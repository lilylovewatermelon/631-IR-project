now there was a sunshower over valletta and even a rainbow howie surd the drunken yeoman lay on his stomach under mount 52 head propped on arms staring at a british landing craft that chugged its way through the rainy harbour fat clyde from chi who was 6 1 142 pounds came from winnetka and had been christened harvey stood by the lifelines spitting dreamily down into the drydock

fat clyde bellowed howie

no said fat clyde whatever it is

he must have been upset nobody ever says things like that to a yeoman im going over tonight howie said gently and i need a raincoat because it is raining out as you may have noticed

fat clyde took a white hat out of his back pocket and tugged it down over his head like a cloche i also got liberty he said

bitch box came on now turn in all paint and paint brushes

to the paint locker it said

about that time said howie he crawled out from under the gun mount and squatted on the 01 deck the rain came down and ran into his ears and down his neck and he watched the sun smearing the sky red over valletta what is wrong hey fat clyde

oh said fat clyde and spat over the side his eyes followed the white drop of spit all the way down howie gave up after about five minutes of silence he went around the starboard side and down the ladder to bother tiger youngblood the spud coxswain who sat at the bottom of the ladder right outside the galley slicing cucumbers

fat clyde yawned it rained in his mouth but he didnt seem to notice he had a problem being an ectomorph he was inclined to brood he was a gunners mate third and normally it would be none of his business except that his rack was directly over pappy hods and since arrival in valletta malta pappy had commenced talking to himself not loud not loud

enough to be heard by anyone but fat clyde

now scuttlebutt being what it is and sailors being under frequently sentimental and swinish exteriors sentimental swine clyde knew well enough what it was about being in malta that upset pappy hod pappy hadnt been eating anything normally a liberty hound he hadnt even been over yet because it was usually fat clyde who pappy went out and got drunk with this was lousing up fat clydes liberty
lazar the deck ape who had been trying the radar gang now for two weeks came out with a broom and started sweeping water into the drain on the port side i dont know why i should be doing this he bitched conversationally i dont have the duty

you should of stayed down in first division fat clyde ventured glum lazar began sweeping water at fat clyde who jumped out of the way and continued on down the starboard ladder to the spud coxswain give me a cucumber hey tiger

you want a cucumber

said tiger who was chopping up onions here i got a cucumber for you his eyes were watering so bad he looked like a sullen boy which is what he was

slice it and put it on a plate said fat clyde and maybe i will 

here from the galley porthole pappy hod was hanging out waving a crescent of watermelon he spat a seed at tiger

thats the old pappy hod thought clyde and he is wearing dress blues and a neckerchief

get your ass in gear clyde said pappy hod liberty call any minute now

so of course clyde was off like a streak for the focsle and back inside of five minutes squared away as he ever got for liberty

832 days tiger youngblood snarled as pappy and clyde headed for the quarterdeck and ill never make it

the scaffold resting on keel blocks was propped up on each side by a dozen wood beams a foot square which extended from the sides of the ship to the sides

of the drydock from above the scaffold must have looked like a great squid with woodcolored tentacles pappy and clyde crossed the long brow and stood in the rain for a moment looking at the ship the sonar dome was shrouded in a secret tarpaulin at the top of the mast flew the biggest american flag captain lych had been able to find it would not be lowered come evening colors and come true nightfall portable spotlights would be turned on and focused on it this was for the benefit of any egyptian bomber pilots who might be coming in scaffold being the only american ship in valletta at the moment

on the starboard side rose a school or seminary with a clock tower growing out of a bastion high as the surfacesearch radar antenna
high and dry said clyde

they say the limeys are going to kidnap us said pappy and leave our ass high and dry till this is over

it may take longer than that anyway give me a cigarette theres the generator and

the screw 

and the barnacles pappy hod was disgusted they will probably want to sandblast long as shes in the yards even though theres a yard period in philly coming up as soon as we get back theyll find something for us to do fat clyde

they made their way through the dockyard around them straggled most of the scaffolds liberty section in files and bunches submarines too were under wraps perhaps for secrecy perhaps for the rain the quitting time whistle blew and pappy and clyde were caught all at once in a torrent of yardbirds disgorged from earth vessels and pissoirs all heading for the gate

yardbirds are the same all over pappy said he and clyde took their time the dock workers fled by jostling them ragged gray by the time pappy and clyde reached the stone gateway theyd all gone waiting for them were only two old nuns who sat to either side of the gate holding little straw collection baskets in their laps and black umbrellas

over their heads bottoms of the baskets were barely covered with sixpences and a shilling or two clyde came up with a crown pappy who hadnt been over to exchange any currency dropped a dollar in the other basket the nuns smiled briefly and resumed their vigil

what was that pappy smiled to nobody admission charge

towered over by ruins they walked up a hill around a great curve in the road and through a tunnel at the other end of the tunnel was a bus stop threepence into valletta as far as the phoenicia hotel when the bus arrived they got on with a few straggling yardbirds and many scaffold sailors who sat in the back and sang pappy fat clyde began i know its no business of mine but 

driver came a yell from in back hey driver stop the bus i got to take a leak

pappy slumped lower in his seat tilted the white hat down over his eyes teledu he muttered that will be teledu

driver
said teledu of the a gang if you dont stop the bus i will have to piss out the window despite himself pappy turned around to watch a number of snipes were endeavoring to pull teledu away from the window the driver drove on grimly the yardbirds werent talking but watched closely scaffold sailors were singing

lets all go down and piss on the forrestal

till the damn thing floats away â€¦

which went to the tune of the old gray mare and had started at gitmo bay in the winter of 55

once he has got an idea in his head said pappy he wont let go so if they dont let him piss out the window he will probably 

look look said fat clyde a yellow river of urine was advancing up the center aisle teledu was just zipping up

a funloving good will ambassador somebody remarked is all teledu is as the river crept forward sailors and yardbirds hurriedly covered it with the leaves of a few morning

newspapers left lying on the seats teledus comrades applauded

pappy fat clyde said you intending to go out and get juiced tonight

i was thinking about it said pappy

thats what i was afraid of look i know im out of line 

ho was interrupted by a burst of merriment from the back of the bus teledus friend lazar whom fat clyde had last seen sweeping water off the 01 deck had succeeded now in setting fire to the newspapers on the floor of the bus smoke billowed up and with a most horrible smell yardbirds began to mutter among themselves i should of saved some crowed teledu to put it out with

oh god said pappy a couplethree of teledus fellow snipes were stomping around trying to put out the fire the bus driver was cursing audibly

they pulled up to the phoenicia hotel at last smoke still leaking from the windows night had fallen raucous with song the men of the scaffold boat

descended on valletta

clyde and pappy were last to get out they apologized to the driver palm leaves in front of the hotel chattered in the wind it seemed pappy was hanging back

why dont we go to a movie clyde said a little desperate pappy wasnt listening they walked under an arch and into kingsway

tomorrow is halloween said pappy and they better put those idiots in a strait jacket

they never made one to hold old lazar hot damn its crowded in here

kingsway seethed there was this sense of containment like a sound stage as an indication of the military buildup in malta since the beginning of the suez crisis there overflowed into the street a choppy sea of green commando berets laced with the white and blue of naval uniforms the ark royal was in and corvettes and troop carriers to take the marines to egypt to occupy and hold

now i was on an aka during the war observed pappy as they elbowed their

way along kingsway and just before dday it was like this

oh they was getting drunk in yoko too back during korea said clyde defensive

not like that was or like this either the limeys have a way of getting drunk just before they have to go off and fight not like we get drunk all we do is puke or break furniture but the limeys show imagination listen

all it was was an english ruddyfaced jarhead and his maltese girl standing in the entrance to a mens clothing store and looking at silk scarves but they were singing people will say were in love from oklahoma

overhead bombers screamed away toward egypt on some street corners trinketstalls were set up and doing a peak trade in goodluck charms and maltese lace

lace said fat clyde what is it about lace

to make you think about a girl even if you dont have a girl its better somehow if you    he trailed off fat clyde didnt

try to keep the subject alive

from a phillips radio store to their left news broadcasts were going full blast little tense knot of civilians stood around just listening nearby at a newspaper kiosk red scare headlines proclaimed british intend to move into suez parliament said the newscaster after an emergency session issued a resolution late this afternoon calling for the engagement of airborne troops in the suez crisis the paratroopers based on cyprus and malta are on onehour alert

oboy oboy said fat clyde wearily

high and dry said pappy hod and the only ship in the sixth fleet getting liberty all the others were off in the eastern mediterranean evacuating american nationals from the egyptian mainland abruptly pappy cut round a corner to the left hed gone about ten steps down the hill when he noticed fat clyde wasnt there

where are you going fat clyde yelled from the corner

the gut

said pappy where else

oh clyde came stumbling downhill i figured maybe we could wander around the main drag a little 

pappy grinned reached out and patted clydes beer belly easy there mother clyde he said old hod is doing all right

im just trying to be helpful clyde thought but yes he agreed i am pregnant with a baby elephant you want to see its trunk

pappy guffawed and they roistered away down the hill there is nothing like old jokes its a kind of stability about them familiar ground

strait street  the gut â€“ was as crowded as kingsway but more poorly lit first familiar face they saw was leman the redheaded waterking who came reeling out the swinging doors of a pub called the four aces minus a white hat leman was a bad drunk so pappy and clyde ducked down behind a patted palm in front to watch sure enough leman started searching in the gutter bent over at a 90 degree

angle rocks whispered clyde he always looks for rocks the waterking found a rock and prepared to heave it through the front window of the four aces the u s cavalry in the form of one tourneur the ships barber arrived also by way of the swinging doors and grabbed lemans arm the two fell to the street and began wrestling around in the dust a passing band of british marines looked at them curiously for a moment then went by laughing a little embarrassed

see said pappy getting philosophical richest country in the world and we never learned how to throw a goodbye drunk like the limeys

but its not goodbye for us said clyde

who knows theres revolutions in hungary and poland fighting in egypt pause and jayne mansfield is getting married

she cant she cant she said shed wait for me

they entered the four aces it was early yet and no one but a few lowtolerance

drunks like leman were causing any commotion they sat at a table guinness stout said pappy and the words fell on clyde like a nostalgic sandbag he wanted to say pappy it is not the old days and why didnt you stay on board the scaffold boat because a boring liberty is better for me than one that hurts and this hurts more all the time

the barmaid who brought their drinks was new at least clyde didnt remember her from last cruise but one across the room jitterbugging with one of pappys strikers shed been around and though paolas bar had been the metro further on down the street this girl  elisa  knew through the barmaids grapevine that pappy had married one of her own if only clyde could keep him away from the metropole if only elisa didnt spot them

but the music stopped she saw them headed over clyde concentrated on his beer pappy smiled at elisa

hows your wife she asked of course

i hope shes well

elisa bless her

heart dropped it you want to dance nobody broke your record yet twentytwo straight

nimble pappy was on his feet lets set a new one

good thought clyde good after a while who should come over but ltjg johnny contango the scaffolds damagecontrol assistant in civvies

when we going to get the screw fixed johnny

johnny because this officer had been a white hat sent to ocs and having been then faced with the usual two alternatives  to persecute those of his former estate or to keep fraternizing and to hell with the wardroom  had chosen the latter he had gone possibly overboard on this at least running afoul of the book at every turn stealing a motorcycle in barcelona inciting an impromptu mass midnight swim at fleet landing in the piraeus somehow  maybe because of captain lychs fondness for incorrigibles  hed escaped courtmartial

i am feeling more and more guilty about the screw said johnny contango i have

just slipped off from a stuffy do over at the british officers club you know what the big joke is lets have another drink old boy before we have to go to war with each other

i dont get it said fat clyde

we voted in the security council with russia and against england and france on this suez business

pappy says the limeys are going to kidnap us

i dont know

what about the screw

drink your beer fat clyde johnny contango felt guilty about the mangled ships propeller not so much in a worldpolitical way it was personal guilt which fat clyde suspected upset him more than he showed hed been ood the midwatch old scaffold boat had hit whatever it was  submerged wreck oil drum  going through the straits of messina radar gang had been too busy keeping tabs on a fleet of night fishing boats whod chosen the same route to notice the object  if it had protruded above the surface at all set

and drift and pure accident had brought them here to get a screw fixed god knew what the med had brought into johnny contangos path the report had called it hostile marine life and thered been much raillery since about the mysterious screwchewing fish but johnny still felt it was his fault the navy would rather blame something alive  preferably human and with a service number  than pure accident fish mermaid scylla charybdis wha who knew how many female monsters this med harbored

bwaagghh

pinguez ill bet johnny said without looking around

yup all over his blues the owner had materialized and stood now truculent over pinguez stewards mate striker hollering sp sp with no results pinguez sat on the floor afflicted with the dry heaves

poor pinguez johnny said hes an early one

out on the floor pappy was up to about a dozen and showed no signs of stopping

we ought

to get him into a cab fat clyde said

where is baby face falange the snipe and pinguezs buddy pinguez now lay sprawled among the legs of a table and had begun talking to himself in filipino a bartender approached with something dark in a glass that fizzed baby face falange wearing as was his wont a babushka joined the group around pinguez a number of british sailors looked on with interest

here you drink it the bartender said pinguez lifted his head and moved it mouth open toward the bartenders hand bartender got the message and jerked his hand away pinguezs shiny teeth closed on the air with a loud snap johnny contango knelt by the steward

andale man he said gently raising pinguezs head pinguez bit him on the arm let go just as quiet its a hathaway shirt i dont want no cabron puking on it

falange pinguez screamed drawing out the as

you hear that said baby face

thats all he has to say on the quarterdeck and my ass has had it

johnny took pinguez under the arms fat clyde more nervous lifted his feet they bore him to the street found a cab and got him off in it

back to the great gray mother said johnny come on you want to try the union jack

i should keep an eye on poppy you know

i know but hell be busy dancing

as long as he doesnt get to the metro said fat clyde they strolled down half a block to the union jack inside antoine zippo captain of the second division head and nasty chobb the baker who periodically used salt in place of sugar in the early mornings pies to discourage thieves had taken over not only the bandstand in back but also a trumpet and guitar respectively and were now making route 66 respectfully

sort of quiet said johnny contango but this was premature because sly young sam mannaro the corpsman striker was

even now sneaking alum into antoines beer which sat uneyed by antoine on the piano

sps will be busy tonight said johnny how come pappy came over at all

i never had that happen to me that way clyde said a little brusque

sorry i was thinking today in the rain how it was i could light a kingsized cigarette without getting it wet

oh i think he should have stayed on board said clyde but all we can do is keep an eye out that window

right ho said johnny contango slurping beer

a scream from the street thats tonights said johnny or one of tonights

bad street

back during the beginning of all this in july the gut ran one killing a night average god knows what it is now

in came two commandos looking around for somewhere to sit they picked clyde and johnnys table

david and maurice their names were and heading off

for egypt tomorrow

we shall be there said maurice to wave hello when you people come steaming in

if ever said johnny

worlds going to hell said david theyd been drinking heavily but held it well

dont expect to hear from us till the election is over said johnny

oh is that it then

why america is sitting on its ass brooded johnny is the same reason our ship is sitting on its ass crosscurrents seismic movements unknown things in the night but you cant help thinking its somebodys fault

the jolly jolly balloon said maurice going up

did you hear a bloke got murdered just as we came in david leaned forward melodramatic

more blokes than that will get murdered in egypt said maurice and dont i wish they would truss up a few mps now in those jumping rigs and chutes send them out the door theyre

the ones who want it not us

but my brother is on cyprus and i shall never live it down if he gets there first

the commandos outdrank them twoforone johnny never having talked to anyone who might be dead inside a week was curious in a macabre way clyde who had only felt unhappy

the group on the stand had moved from route 66 to every day i have the blues antoine zippo who had wrecked one jugular vein last year with a shorebased navy band in norfolk and was now trying for two took a break shook the spit out of his horn and reached for the beer on the piano he looked hot and sweaty as a suicidal workhorse trumpet should alum however being what it is the predictable occurred

ech said antoine zippo slamming the beer down on the piano he looked around belligerent his lip had just been attacked sam the werewolf said antoine is the only sumbitch here who could get alum he couldnt talk too well

there goes pappy

said clyde grabbing for his hat antoine zippo leaped like a puma from the stand landing feet first on sam mannaros table

david turned to maurice i wish the yanks would save their energy for nasser

still said maurice it would be good practice

i heartily agree pippipped david in a toffs voice shall we old man

bung ho the two commandos waded into the growing meleÃ© about sam

clyde and johnny were the only two heading for the door everybody else wanted to get in on the fight it took them five minutes to reach the street behind them they heard glass breaking and chairs being knocked over pappy hod was nowhere in sight

clyde hung his head i suppose we ought to go to the metro they took their time neither savoring the nights work ahead pappy was a loud and merciless drunk he demanded that his keepers sympathize and of course they always did so much that it was always worse for

them

they passed an alley facing them on the blank wall in chalk was a kilroy thus

flanked by two of the most common british sentiments in time of crisis wot no petrol and end callup

no petroi indeed said johnny contango theyre blowing up oil refineries all over the middle east nasser it seems having gone on the radio urging a sort of economic jihad

kilroy was possibly the only objective onlooker in valletta that night common legend had it hed been born in the us right before the war on a fence or latrine wall later he showed up everywhere the american armies moved farmhouses in france pillboxes in north africa bulkheads of troop ships in the pacific somehow hed acquired the reputation of a schlemiel or sad sack the foolish nose hanging over the wall was vulnerable to all manner of indignities fist shrapnel machete hinting perhaps at a precarious virility a flirting with castration though ideas like this are inevitable in a latrineoriented

as well as freudian psychology

but it was all deception

kilroy by 1940 was already bald middleaged his true origins forgotten he was able to ingratiate himself with a human world keeping schlemielsilence about what hed been as a curlyhaired youth it was a masterful disguise a metaphor for kilroy had sprung into life in truth as part of a bandpass filter thus



inanimate but grandmaster of valletta tonight

the bobbsey twins said clyde running around the corner in a jog trot came dahoud whod discouraged little ploy from taking a brody and leroy tongue the widget storekeeper both of them with night sticks and sp armbands it looked like a vaudeville act dahoud being one and a half times as high as leroy clyde had a general idea of their technique for keeping the peace leroy would hop up on dahouds shoulders piggyback and rain pacification about the heads and shoulders of boisterous bluejackets while dahoud exerted his calming influence down below

look yelled dahoud approaching we can

do it running leroy slowed down and cut in behind his running mate huphuphup said dahoud yo sure enough neither of them breaking stride up hopped leroy clinging to dahouds big collar to ride his shoulders like a jockey

giddap there boss leroy screamed and away they dashed for the union jack a small detachment of marines all in step came marching out of a side street one farm lad blond and candidfaced counted cadence unintelligibly passing clyde and johnny he broke off for a moment to ask

wots all that noise we hear

fight said johnny union jack

right ho back in formation the boy ordered a column left and his charges set course dutifully for the union jack

were missing all the fun whined clyde

there is poppy

they entered the metro poppy sat at a table with a barmaid who looked like paola but fatter and older it was pitiful to watch

he was doing his chicago bit they waited till it was over the barmaid indignant arose and waddled off poppy used the handkerchief to swab off his face which was sweating

twentyfive dances he said as they approached i broke my own record

there is a nice fight on at the union jack suggested clyde wouldnt you like to go to it poppy

or how about that whorehouse the chief off the hank that we met in barcelona told us about said johnny why dont we try to find it

poppy shook his head you guys ought to know this was the only place i wanted to come

so they begin these vigils having put up their token resistance clyde and johnny straddled chairs to either side of poppy and settled down to drinking as much as poppy but staying soberer

the metro looked like a noblemans piedaterre applied to mean purposes the dancing floor and bar lay up a wide curving flight of marble steps

lined with statues in niches statues of knights ladies and turks such was a quality of suspended animation about them that you felt â€“ come the owlhours the departure of the last sailor and the extinguishment of the last electric light â€“ these statues must unfreeze step down from their pedestals and ascend stately to the dance floor bringing with them their own light the seas phosphorescence there to form sets and dance till sunup utterly silent no music their stone feet only just kissing the wood planks

along the sides of the room were great stone urns with palms and poincianas on the redcarpeted dais sat a small hotjazz band violin trombone saxophone trumpet guitar piano drums it was a plump middleaged lady playing the violin at the moment they were playing cest magnifique tailgate fashion while a commando six and a half feet tall jitterbugged with two barmaids at once and tree and four friends stood around clapping hands cheering them on it was not so much a matter of dick

powell the american singing marine caroling sally and sue dont be blue more a takingon of traditional attitudes which one suspects must be latent in all english germ plasm mother loony chromosome along with afternoon tea and respect for the crown where the yanks saw novelty and an excuse for musical comedy the english saw history and sally and sue were only incidental

early tomorrow deck hands would come out in the bleaching glare of the piers lights and single up all lines for some of these green berets the night before then was for sentiment larking in shadows with jolly barmaids another pint and another smoke in this manufactured farewellhall this enlisted mens version of that great ball the saturday night before waterloo one way you could tell which ones were going tomorrow they left without looking back

pappy got drunk stinking drunk and drew his two keepers into a personal past neither wanted to investigate they endured a stepbystep account of the brief marriage the

presents hed given her the places theyd gone the cooking the kindnesses toward the end half of it was noise maundering but they didnt ask for clarity didnt ask anything not so much from boozetangled tongues as from a stuffinessbyinduction in the nasal cavities so susceptible were fat clyde and johnny contango

but it was cinderella liberty in malta and though the drunks clock slows down it doesnt stop come on said clyde finally floundering afoot it is about that time pappy smiled sadly and fell out of his chair

well go get a taxi said john carry him home in a taxi

jeez its late they were the last americans in the metro the english were quietly absorbed in saying goodbye to at least this part of valletta with the departure of the scaffold boats men all things had grown more matteroffact

clyde and johnny draped pappy around them and got him down the stairs past the knights reproachful eyes and

into the street taxi hey clyde screamed

no taxis said johnny contango all gone god how big the stars are

clyde wanted to argue you just let me take him he said youre an officer you can stay out all night

who said i was an officer im a white hat your brother pappys brother brothers keeper

taxi taxi taxi

limeys brother everybodys brother who says im an officer congress officer and gentlemen by act of congress congress wont even go into the suez to help the limeys theyre wrong about that theyre wrong about me

paola pappy moaned and pitched forward they grabbed him his white hat was long gone his head hung and hair had fallen over his eyes

pappy is going bald said clyde i never noticed

you never do till youre drunk

they made their way slow and unsteady down the gut yelling occasionally

for a taxi none came the street had a silent look but was not so not so far away on the hill ascending to kingsway they heard sharp little explosions and the voice of a great crowd around the next corner

what is it said johnny revolution

better than that it was a freeforall among 200 royal commandos and maybe 30 scaffold sailors

clyde and johnny dragged pappy round the corner and into the fringes of it

ohoh said johnny the noise woke pappy who called for his wife a few dangling belts were in evidence but no broken beer bottles or boatswains knives or none anybody could see or not yet dahoud stood against a wall facing 20 commandos by his left bicep another kilroy looked on with nothing to say but wot no americans leroy tongue must have been off underfoot somewhere clubbing at shins with his night stick something red and sputtering came arcing through the air landed by johnny contangos foot and blew up firecrackers

said johnny landing three feet away clyde had also fled and pappy unsupported fell to the street lets get him out of here said johnny

but they found their way blocked by marines whod come up from behind

hey billy eckstine yelled the commandos in front of dahoud billy eckstine sing us a song a volley of firecrackers went off somewhere to the right most of the fistfighting was still concentrated in the center of the mob only shoving elbowing and curiosity at the edges dahoud removed his hat drew himself up and began to sang i only have eyes for you commandos were struck dumb somewhere down the street a police whistle blew glass broke in the middle of the crowd it sent human waves back concentric a couplethree marines staggered back and fell over pappy who was still on the ground johnny and clyde moved in to rescue him a few sailors moved in to help the fallen marines unobtrusive as possible clyde and johnny lifted their charge by an arm

each and sneakypeted away behind them the marines and sailors began scuffling with one another

cops somebody yelled half a dozen cherry bombs went off dahoud finished his song a number of commandos applauded now sing i apologize

you mean that dahoud scratched his head that if i told a lie if i made you cry forgive me

hoorah billy eckstine they cried

o no man dahoud said i dont apologize to nobody commandos squared off dahoud surveyed the situation then abruptly lifted a gigantic arm straight up all right there troopers get in ranks now square away

for some reason they shuffled into a kind of formation

yeah dahoud grinned right face so they did

awright men lets goooo down came the arm and away they marched in step kilroy looked on deadpan from nowhere leroy tongue emerged to bring up the rear

clyde johnny

and poppy hod struggled free of the brawl dodged round a corner and began the struggle up the hill to kingsway halfway along dahouds detachment passed them dahoud counting cadence singing it like a blues for all anyone knew he was marching them back to the troop carriers

a taxi pulled up next to the three follow that platoon johnny said and they piled in the cab had a skylight so of course before it reached kingsway three heads had appeared through the roof as they crawled behind the commandos they sang

whos the little rodent

thats getting more than me

fuckey youse

a legacy from pig bodine whod watched this particular kids program religiously on the mess hall tv every night in port had furnished black clipon ears to all the mess cooks at his own expense and composed on the shows theme song an obscene parody of which this variation in spelling was the most palatable part commandos in the rear ranks asked johnny to teach them the

words he did receiving in exchange a fifth of irish whisky when its owner insisted he could not possibly finish it before they got under way next morning to this day the bottle has remained in johnny contangos possession unopened no one knows what hes keeping it for

this weird procession crept along kingsway until intercepted by a british cattle car or lorry the commandos climbed on thanked everyone for a jolly evening and snarled away forever dahoud and leroy climbed wearily into the cab

billy eckstine dahoud grinned jeez

we got to go back leroy said the driver made a uturn and they circled back to the scene of the freeforall no more than fifteen minutes had passed but the street was deserted quiet no more firecrackers shouts nothing

ill be damned said dahoud

youd think it never happened said leroy

dockyard clyde instructed the driver yawning dry dock two american tin

can with the teeth marks of a screwchewing fish

all the way out to the dockyard pappy snored

liberty had been expired an hour when they arrived the two sps bounded past the rows of latrines and across the gangplank clyde and johnny with pappy in the middle lagged

now none of that was worth it johnny said bitterly two figures fat and slim stood by the latrine wall

come on clyde urged pappy few more steps

nasty chobb came running by wearing an english sailor hat with hms ceylon printed on the hand the shadowfigures detached themselves from the latrine wall and approached pappy tripped

robert she said not a question

hello pappy said the other

who zat said clyde

johnny stopped dead and clydes momentum carried pappy round to face her directly ill be dipped in messhall coffee said johnny

poor robert but she said it gently and was

smiling and had either johnny or clyde been less drunk they would have bawled like children

pappy waggled his arms go ahead he told them i can stand ill be along from over on the quarterdeck nasty chobb was heard arguing with the ood what you mean go away yelled nasty

your hat says hms ceylon chobb

so

so what can i say youre on the wrong ship

profane said pappy you came back i thought you would

i didnt profane said but she did he went off to wait leaned against a latrine wall out of earshot looking at the scaffold

hello paola said pappy sahha it means both

you 

you  at the same time he motioned her to talk

tomorrow she said youll he hung over and probably will think this didnt happen that the metros booze sends visions as well as a big

head but im real and here and if they restrict you 

i can put in a chit

or send you off to egypt or anywhere else it should make no difference because i will be back in norfolk before you and be there on the pier like any other wife but wait till then to kiss or even touch you

if i can get off

ill be gone let it be this way robert how tired her face looked in the white scatter from the brow lights it will be better and more the way it should have been you sailed a week after i left you so a week is all weve lost all thats gone on since then is only a seastory i will sit home in norfolk faithful and spin spin a yarn for your cominghome present

i love you was all he could find to say hed been saying it every night to a steel bulkhead and the earthwide sea on the other side

white hands flickered up behind her face here in case you think tomorrow it was a dream

her hair fell loose she handed him an ivory comb five crucified limeys  five kilroys  stared briefly at vallettas sky till he pocketed it dont lose it in a poker game ive had it a long time

he nodded we ought to be back early december

youll get your goodnight kiss then she smiled withdrew turned was gone

pappy ambled on past the latrine without looking back the american flag skewered by spotlights fluttered limp high over them all pappy began his walk to the quarterdeck across the long brow hoping hed be soberer when he reached the other end

of their dash across the continent in a stolen renault profanes onenight sojourn in a jail near genoa when the police mistook him for an american gangster the drunk they all threw which began in liguria and lasted well past naples the dropped transmission at the outskirts of that city and the week they spent waiting its repair in a ruined villa on ischia inhabited

by friends of stencil  a monk long defrocked named fenice who spent his time breeding giant scorpions in marble cages once used by the roman blood to punish their young boy and girl concubines and the poet cinoglossa who had the misfortune to be both homosexual and epileptic  wandering listlessly in an unseasonable heat among vistas of marble fractured by earthquake pines blasted by lightning sea wrinkled by a dying mistral of their arrival in sicily and the difficulty with local bandits on a mountain road from which stencil extricated them by telling foul sicilian jokes and giving them whisky of the daylong trip from syracuse to valletta on the laferla steamer star of malta during which stencil lost 100 and a pair of cufflinks at stud poker to a mildfaced clergyman who called himself robin petitpoint and of paolas steadfast silence through it all there was little for any of them to remember malta alone drew them a clenched fist around a yoyo string

they came in to valletta cold yawning

in the rain they rode to maijstrals room neither anticipating nor remembering â€“ outwardly at least apathetic and lowkeyed as the rain maijstral greeted them calmly paola would stay with him stencil and profane had planned to doss at the phoenicia hotel but at 28 per day the agile robin petitpoint had had his effect they settled for a lodginghouse near the harbour what now said profane tossing his ditty bag in a corner

stencil thought a long time

i like profane continued living off of your money but you and paola conned me into coming here

first things first said stencil the rain had stopped he was nervous see maijstral see maijstral

see maijstral he did but only next day and after a morninglong argument with the whisky bottle which the bottle lost he walked to the room in the ruined building through a brilliant gray afternoon light seemed to cling to his shoulders like fine rain his knees shook

but

it wasnt hard to talk to maijstral

stencil has seen your confession to paola

then you know maijstral said i only made it into this world through the good offices of one stencil

stencil hung his head it may have been his father

making us brothers

there was wine which helped stencil yarned far into the night but with a voice always threatening to break as if now at last he were pleading for his life maijstral kept a decorous silence waiting patiently whenever stencil faltered

stencil sketched the entire history of v that night and strengthened a long suspicion that it did add up only to the recurrence of an initial and a few dead objects at one point in mondaugens story

ah maijstral said the glass eye

and you stencil mopped his forehead you listen like a priest

i have wondered smiling

at the end of it

but paola

showed you my apologia who is the priest we have heard one anothers confessions

not stencils stencil insisted hers

maijstral shrugged why have you come she is dead

he must know

i could never find that cellar again if i could it must be rebuilt now your confirmation would lie deep

too deep already stencil whispered stencils long over his head you know

i was lost

but not apt to have visions

oh real enough you always look inside first dont you to find whats missing what gap a vision could possibly fill i was all gap then and there was too wide a field to choose from

yet youd just come from 

i did think of elena yes latins warp everything to the sexual anyway death becomes an adulterer or rival need arises to see one rival at least done in    but i was bastardized enough you see before

that too much so to feel hatred or triumph watching

only pity is that what you mean at least in what stencil read read into how can he 

more a passiveness the characteristic stillness perhaps of the rock inertia id come back  no in  come in to the rock as far as i would

stencil brightened after a while and changed course a token comb shoe glass eye the children

i wasnt watching the children i was watching your v what i did see of the children  i recognized none of the faces no they may have died before the war ended or emigrated after it try australia try the pawnbrokers and curio shops but as for placing a notice in the agony column anyone participating in the disassembly of a priest 

please

next day and for days after he investigated the inventories of curio merchants pawnbrokers ragmen he returned one morning to find paola brewing tea on the ring for profane who lay bundled

up in bed

fever she said too much booze too much everything back in new york he hasnt been eating much since we arrived god knows where he does eat what the water there is like

ill recover profane croaked tough shit stencil

he says youre down on him 

o god said stencil

the next day brought momentary encouragement to stencil a shopowner named cassar did know of an eye such as stencil described the girl lived in valletta her husband was an auto mechanic at the garage which cared for cassars morris he had tried every device he knew to purchase the eye but the foolish girl would not part with it a keepsake she said

she lived in a tenement stucco walls a row of balconies on the top floor light that afternoon produced a burn between whites and blacks fuzzy edges blurrings white was too white black too black stencils eyes hurt colors were nearly absent leaning either to

white or black

i threw it into the sea hands on hips defiant he smiled uncertainly where had sidneys charm fled under the same sea back to its owner light angling through the window fell across a bowl of fruit  oranges limes  bleaching them and throwing the bowls interior to black shadow something was wrong with the light stencil felt tired unable to pursue it further  not just now  wanting only to leave he left

profane sat in a worn flowered robe of fausto maijstrals looking ghastly chewing on the stump of an old cigar he glared at stencil stencil ignored him threw himself on the bed and slept soundly for twelve hours

he awoke at four in the morning and walked through a seaphosphorescence to maijstrals dawn leaked in turning the illumination conventional along a mudway and up twenty steps a light burned

maijstral was asleep at his table dont haunt me stencil he mumbled still dreamy and belligerent

stencil is passing

on the discomfort of being haunted stencil shivered

they huddled over tea in chipped cups

she cannot be dead stencil said

one feels her in the city he cried

in the city

in the light it has to do with the light

if the soul maijstral ventured is light is it a presence

damn the word stencils father had he possessed imagination might have used it stencils eyebrows puckered as if he would cry he weaved irritably in his seat blinked fumbled for his pipe hed left it at the lodginghouse maijstral tapped across a pack of players

lighting up maijstral stencil expresses himself like an idiot

but your search fascinates me

did you know hes devised a prayer walking about this city to be said in rhythm to his footsteps fortune may stencil be steady enough not to fasten on one of these poor ruins at his own random or at any

least hint from maijstral let him not roam out all gothic some night with lantern and shovel to exhume an hallucination and be found by the authorities mudstreaked and mad and tossing meaningless clay about

come come muttered maijstral i feel uncomfortable enough being in this position

stencil drew in his breath too loudly

no i am not beginning to requestion that is long done

beginning then maijstral took up the study of stencil more closely though suspending judgment hed aged enough to know the written apologia would only be a first step in exorcising the sense of sin that had hung with him since 43 but this v was surely more than a sense of sin

mounting crisis in the suez hungary and poland hardly touched them maijstral leery like any maltese of the balloons least bobbing was grateful for something else  stencil  to take his mind off the headlines but stencil himself who seemed more unaware each day under questioning

of what was happening in the rest of the world reinforced maijstrals growing theory that v was an obsession after all and that such an obsession is a hothouse constant temperature windless too crowded with particolored spots unnatural blooms

stencil returning to the lodginghouse walked into a loud argument between paola and profane

so go he was yelling something crashed against the door

dont try to make up my mind for me she yelled back stencil opened the door warily peered around and was hit in the face with a pillow shades were drawn and stencil saw only blurred figures profane still ducking out of the way paolas arm in followthrough

what the hell

profane crouching like a toad flapped a newspaper at him my old ship is in all stencil could see were the whites of his eyes paola was crying

ah stencil dived for the bed profane had been sleeping on the floor let them use that thought spiteful

stencil snuffled and drifted off to sleep

at length it occurred to him to talk with the old priest father avalanche who according to maijstral had been here since 1919

the moment he entered the church he knew hed lost again the old priest knelt at the communion rail white hair above a black cassock too old

later in the priests house

god lets some of us wait in queer backwaters said father avalanche do you know how long its been since i have shriven a murderer at the time of the ghallis tower murder last year i had hopes    he maundered thus taking stencil by an unwilling hand and began to charge aimless about thickets of memory stencil tried to point them toward the june disturbances

oh i was only a young lad then full of myth the knights you know one cannot come to valletta without knowing about the knights i still believe â€“ chuckling  as i believed then that they roam the streets after sunset somewhere and i

had only served as padre  in the actual fighting  long enough to have illusions left about avalanche as crusading knight but then to compare the malta that was in 1919 to their malta    youd have to talk i suppose to my predecessor here father fairing he went to america though the poor old man wherever he is must be dead by now

politely as he could stencil took leave of the old priest plunged into the sunlight and began to walk there was too much adrenalin contracting the smooth muscle deepening his breathing quickening his pulse stencil must walk he said to the street walk 

foolish stencil he was out of condition he returned to his piedaterre long after midnight hardly able to stand the room was empty

clinches it he muttered if it were the same fairing

even if it were not could it matter a phrase it often happened when he was exhausted kept cycling round and round preconsciously just under the threshold of lip

and tongue movement events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic it repeated itself automatically and stencil improved on it each time placing emphasis on different words  events seem seem to be ordered ominous logic  pronouncing them differently changing the tone of voice from sepulchral to jaunty round and round and round events seem to be ordered into an ominous logic he found paper and pencil and began to write the sentence in varying hands and type faces profane lurched in on him thus

paolas back with her husband said profane and collapsed on the bed shell go back to the states

someone stencil muttered is out of it then profane groaned and pulled blankets around him look here said stencil now youre sick he crossed to profane felt his forehead high fever stencil must get a doctor what the hell were you doing out at this hour anyway

no

profane flopped over fished under the bed in his ditty bag apcs ill sweat it out

neither spoke for a while but stencil was too distraught to hold anything in profane he said

tell paolas father im only along for the ride

stencil began to pace laughed stencil doesnt think he believes him any longer profane rolled over laboriously and blinked at him

vs is a country of coincidence ruled by a ministry of myth whose emissaries haunt this centurys streets porcÃ©pic mondaugen stencil pere this maijstral stencil fils could any of them create a coincidence only providence creates if the coincidences are real then stencil has never encountered history at all but something far more appalling

stencil came on father fairings name once apparently by accident today he came on it again by what only could have been design

i wonder said profane if that was the same father fairing

  

stencil froze the booze jittering in his glass while profane dreamy went on to tell of his nights with the alligator patrol and how hed hunted one pinto beast through fairings parish cornered and killed it in a chamber lit by some frightening radiance

carefully stencil finished the whisky cleaned out the glass with a handkerchief set the glass on the table he put on his overcoat

you going out for a doctor profane said into the pillow

of sorts stencil said

an hour later he was at maijstrals

dont wake her maijstral said poor child id never seen her cry

nor have you seen stencil cry said stencil but you may expriest he has a soul possessed by the devil sleeping in his bed

profane in an attempt at good humor we must get to father a hes a frustrated exorcist always complaining about the lack of excitement

arent you a frustrated

exorcist

maijstral frowned thats another maijstral

she possesses him stencil whispered v

you are as sick

please

maijstral opened the window and stepped out on the balcony valletta by nightlight looked totally uninhabited no maijstral said you wouldnt get what you wanted what  if it were your world  would be necessary one would have to exorcise the city the island every ships crew on that mediterranean the continents the world or the western part as an afterthought we are western men

stencil shrank at the cold air moving in through the window

im not a priest dont try appealing to someone youve only known in a written confession we do not walk ganged stencil all our separate selves like siamese quintuplets or more god knows how many stencils have chased v about the world

fairing stencil croaked in whose

parish stencil was shot preceded your father avalanche

i could have told you told you the name

but

saw no advantage in making things worse

stencils eyes narrowed maijstral turned caught him looking cagy

yes yes thirteen of us rule the world in secret

stencil went out of his way to bring profane here he should have been more careful he wasnt is it really his own extermination hes after

maijstral turned smiling to him gestured behind his back at the ramparts of valletta ask her he whispered ask the rock

iii

two days later maijstral arrived at the lodginghouse to find profane lying dead drunk and slaunchwise on the bed afternoon sun illuminated a swathe of face in which every hair of a weeks growth showed up separate and distinct profanes mouth was open he was snoring and drooling and apparently enjoying himself

maijstral gave profanes

forehead the back of his hand fine the fever had broken but where was stencil no sooner asked than maijstral saw the note a cubist moth alit forever on the gross heap of profanes beer belly

a shipfitter named aquilina has intelligence of one mme viola oneiromancer and hypnotist who passed through valletta in 1944 the glass eye went with her cassars girl lied v used it for an hypnotic aid her destination stockholm as is stencils it will do for the frayed end of another clue dispose as you will of profane stencil has no further need for any of you sahha

maijstral looked around for booze profane had finished everything in the house

swine

profane woke wha

maijstral read him the note profane rolled out of bed and crawled to the window

what day is it after a while paolas gone too

last night

leaving me well how do you dispose of me

lend you a fiver to begin

with

lend roared profane you ought to know better

ill be back said maijstral

that night profane shaved bathed donned suede jacket levis and big cowboy hat and went aroving down kingsway looking for amusement he found it in the form of one brenda wigglesworth an american wasp who attended beaver college and owned she said 72 pairs of bermuda shorts half of which she had brought over to europe back around june at the beginning of a grand tour which bad then held high promise high she had remained all the way across the atlantic high as the boat deck and mostly on sloe gin fizzes the various lifeboats of this most underelict passage east were shared by a purser summer job from the academic flatlands of jersey who gave her an orange and black toy tiger a pregnancy scare hers only and a promise to meet her in amsterdam somewhere behind the five flies hed not come she came to herself  or at least to the inviolable puritan shed show

up as come marriage and the good life someday soon now  in a bars parking lot near a canal filled with a hundred black bicycles her junkyard her own locust season skeletons carapaces no matter her inside too was her outside and on she went streakblond farfromfrail brenda along the rhine up and down the soft slopes of the wine districts into the tyrol and out into tuscany all in a rented morris whose fuel pump clicked random and loud in times of stress as did her camera as did her heart

valletta was the end of another season and all her friends were long sailed back to the states she was nearly out of money profane couldnt help her she found him fascinating

so over sloe gin fizzes for her which took tiny sweet bites out of maijstrals fivepound note and beer for benny they talked of how it was they had come this far and where they would go after valletta and it seemed there were beaver and the street for them separately to return to and both agreed this was nowhere but

some of us do go nowhere and can con ourselves into believing it to be somewhere it is a kind of talent and objections to it are rare but even at that captious

that night between them they established at least that the world was screwed up english marines commandos and sailors who came by  going nowhere also  helped them believe it profane saw no scaffold sailors and decided that since some of them must be cleanliving enough to stay away from the gut the scaffold too had left it made him sadder as if all his homes were temporary and even they inanimate still wandering as he for motion is relative and hadnt he now really stood there still on the sea like a schlemiel redeemer while that enormous malingering city and its one livable inner space and one unconnable therefore hivalue girl had all slid away from him over a great horizons curve comprising from this vantage at once at least one centurys worth of wavelets

dont be sad

brenda were all sad

benny

we are she laughed raucous having a low tolerance for sloe gin

they went back to his place and she must have left him sometime during the night in the dark profane was a heavy sleeper he awoke alone in bed to the sound of forenoon traffic maijstral sat on the table observing a plaid knee sock the kind worn with bermuda shorts which was draped over the electric lamp hanging from the center of the ceiling

i have brought wine said maijstral

good enough

they went out to a cafÃ© for breakfast about two i have no intention of supporting you indefinitely maijstral said

i should get a job any road work in malta

they are building a grade intersection  an underground tunnel  at portedesbombes they also need men to plant trees along the roads

road work and sewer work is all i know

sewers theres a new pumping station going up at marsa

they hire aliens

possibly

possibly

then

that evening brenda wore paisley shorts and black socks i write poetry she announced they were at her place a modest hotel near the great lift

oh said profane

i am the twentieth century she read profane rolled away and stared at the pattern in the rug

i am the ragtime and the tango sansserif clean geometry i am the virginshair whip and the cunningly detailed shackles of decadent passion i am every lonely railway station in every capital of europe i am the street the fanciless buildings of government the cafÃ©dansant the clockwork figure the jazz saxophone the touristladys hairpiece the fairys rubber breasts the traveling clock which always tells the wrong time and chimes in different keys i am the dead palm tree the negros dancing pumps the dried fountain after tourist season i am all the appurtenances of night

that sounds about right said profane

i dont know she

made a paper airplane out of the poem and sailed it across the room on strata of her own exhaled smoke its a phony collegegirl poem things ive read for courses does it sound right

yes

youve done so much more boys do

what

youve had all these fabulous experiences i wish mine would show me something

why

the experience the experience havent you learned

profane didnt have to think long no he said offhand id say i havent learned a goddamn thing

they were quiet for a while she said lets take a walk

later out in the street near the sea steps she inexplicably took his hand and began to run the buildings in this part of valletta eleven years after wars end had not been rebuilt the street however was level and clear hand in hand with brenda whom hed met yesterday profane ran down the street presently sudden and in

silence all illumination in valletta houselight and streetlight was extinguished profane and brenda continued to run through the abruptly absolute night momentum alone carrying them toward the edge of malta and the mediterranean beyondembed"
