im not surprised not everything lasts
ive broken my heart so many times i stopped keeping track
talk myself in i talk myself out
i get all worked up then i let myself down

prechorus
i tried so very hard not to lose it
i came up with a million excuses
i thought id thought of every possibility

chorus
and i know some day that it’ll all turn out
youll make me work so we can work to work it out
and i promise you kid that ill give so much more than i get
i just havent met you yet

verse 2
i might have to wait ill never give up
i guess its half timing and the other halfs luck
wherever you are whenever its right
youll come out of nowhere and into my life

and i know that we can be so amazing
and baby your love is gonna change me
and now i can see every possibility
