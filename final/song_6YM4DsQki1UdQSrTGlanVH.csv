i smell that salty breeze blowing through the fjord
i hear those creaky ships as old board meets old board
i breathe in the place i live and wonder what else can i give this home
my home

verse 2
wandering through the town with everyone doing all of their stuff
somewhere in my heart i feel ive not yet done enough
for these people i know this place that i love so
my home
my home

verse 3
i whistle as i walk a lovely smell of kransekake
wafting out of the baker’s door
the merchants haggling over fish remind me i have what i wish
cause im not alone anymore

bridge
i’m grateful for this castle
and for everything weve got
especially my family
weve all been through a lot
i know how fragile things can be
if i lost them id lose me
theyre my ocean theyre my shore
i wanna give them more
theyre my home
my home
