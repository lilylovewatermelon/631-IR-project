yeah i get it youre an outcast
always under attack
always comin in last
bringin up the past
no one owes you anything
i think you need a shotgun blast
a kick in the ass
so paranoid watch your back
oh my here we go

verse 1
another loose cannon gone bipolar
slipped down couldnt get much lower
quicksands got no sense of humor
im still laughin like hell

prechorus
you think that by cryin to me
lookin so sorry that im gonna believe
youve been infected by a social disease
well then take your medicine

chorus
i created the sound of madness
wrote the book on pain
somehow im still here
to explain
that the darkest hour never comes in the night
you can sleep with a gun
but when you gonna wake up and fight
for yourself

if theres an afterlife then itll set you free
but im not gonna part the seas
youre a selffulfilling prophecy

prechorus
you think that by cryin to me

i created the sound of madness
wrote the book on pain

that the darkest hour never comes in the night
you can sleep with a gun

for yourself
