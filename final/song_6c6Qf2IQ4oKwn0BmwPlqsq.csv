run from all those times
she poured gasoline and by fires light she cried
she cried all night until the salt from her tears
rusted shut her eyes she should have shut her eyes

turn off the lights
blow out the candles tonight
romance this chance to set angels to flight

before they die
ill take this ink from my arms and write your name in the sky
please dont use my letters to start your fires this time
your fire this time

please drive faster faster than the light
erase her embrace erase it from your mind let this die

ill take this ink from my arms and write your name in the sky
please dont use my letters to start your fires this time
your fire this time

remember oceans like times together
across these oceans
i sent my letters i sent these letters to you
remember oceans and time together in my mind
remember starting your fires off my eyes
remember these oceans
like fires off your eyessee hawthorne heights liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeembed"
