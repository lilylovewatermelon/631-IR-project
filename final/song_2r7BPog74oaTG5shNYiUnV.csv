verse 3
two puffs for the lady who be down for that
whatever together
bring your own stash of the greatest trade it
roll a dub burn a dub cough a dub taste it
then watch us chase it
with a handful of pills no chasers
jaw clenching on some supersized papers
and she bad and her head bad
escaping her van is a wonderland
and its halfpast six
read skies cause time dont exist
but when the stars shine back to the crib
superstar lines back at the crib
and we can test out the tables
we got some brand new tables
all glass and its four feet wide
but its a must to get us ten feet high
she give me sex in a handbag
i get her wetter than a wet nap
and no closed doors
so i listen to her moans echo
i heard he do drugs now
you heard wrong i been on it for a minute
we just never act a fool thats just how we fuckin live it
and when we act a fool its probably cause we mixed it
yeah im always on that okey dokey
them white boys know the deal aint no fuckin phony
big o know the deal he the one who showed me
watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin told me
is that your girl whats her fucking story
she kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony
i cut down on her man be her fuckin story
yeah im talking bout you man get to know me
aint no offense though i promise you
if you a real man dude you gon decide the truth
but im a nice dude with some nice dreams
and we could turn this to a nightmare elm street
