im goin outer space
in love with the dead face
im steady gainin weight
im just tryna dodge the hate
my futures bright as day
they throwin all kind of shade
im goin to buy the bank
im tryna pave the way

verse 1
hopped on the interstate
i got me some ms to make
come from where they kill and take
i learned the hard way
shoot out in broad day
we takin all aim
im just tryna dodge the hate
i might camoflauge the wraith
im drippin feng shui
im valentino from my head to my feet
lean is my bombay
i promise im putting chanel on my niece
up in the way you cant reach
your bitch be takin the d
new sixtythree amg
im a little head of my speech
im in the need for speed
i got this beat from wheezy
my bitch is easy breezy
its a new drippin season
i had to be the reason
girl what i said i mean it
im on the syrup im leanin
you still tryna follow the leader
you might also likechorus
im goin outer space
in love with the dead face
im steady gainin weight
im just tryna dodge the hate
my futures bright as day
they throwin all kind of shade
im goin to buy the bank
im tryna pave the way

verse 2
i dont need no leeway
im not being clich√©
i dont want your cheesecake
some shit i dont ppreciate
gettin robbed with the glock ayy
thats my compadre
just bought a new watch
i walk with a walk
they say that im hotter
cause i came with propane
im just tryna maintain
im not eating lo mein
i know its a cold game
im still rockin balmains
im tryna remain sane
buy platinum and gold chains
i smoke out a whole thing
pour out the whole pint
the spot white as colgate
you just missed your ho you too late
i dont really care what you think
im in my own lane
im poppin my own mane
it got me a long way
chorus
im goin outer space
in love with the dead face
im steady gainin weight
im just tryna dodge the hate
my futures bright as day
they throwin all kind of shade
im goin to buy the bank
im tryna pave the wayembed"
