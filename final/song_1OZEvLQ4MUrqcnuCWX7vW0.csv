its a long road and it gets windy
fog is real low and its so blinding
oh im tryna steer tryna take the lead
but i feel like the road is steering me
getting so lost like a castaway
feeling so crossed like a renegade
and im tryna call out in the big city
just a small voice and no ones listening to me

prechorus
ohoh tell me where to go
tell me that you know just how bright i glow

chorus
every time that you think youve lost your shine
just remember nothings brighter
youre the city lights
every time that you fade into the night
just remember youre the fire
youre the city lights
that shine into the night night night night oh
shine into the night night night night oh
shine into the night night night night oh
shine into the night night night oh woah

like a sore thumb that they dont know about
wanna make peace wanna just breathe
wanna be the light that makes them all believe
im the race car not the spectator
im the hero not the narrator
hercules battling conquering everything yeah
