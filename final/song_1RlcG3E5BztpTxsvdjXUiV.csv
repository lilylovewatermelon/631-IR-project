in an accident her foot got caught in a hole
im going to tell you the truth
die for a touch of that cold hand
id be crying every time the southern makes its run

im going to buy them all
cigarettes and chewing tobacco when i can
trials and troubles are heavy for me

shes a ramblin gal
bound to leave her home
i begged my brown skin
please dont leave me alone
im going to make amends
bound to cry to touch her hand
im going to ride that line
â€˜till i see that black train come

im going to buy them all
cigarettes and chewing tobacco when i can
trials and troubles are heavy for me

now people that southern pacific make her run
from chapel hill to the state of washington
round the bend at 40 miles
20 tons of loaded frieght acomin on
florscheims stuck and it wont come out
my good gals dead and gone
see old crow medicine show liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeim going to buy them all
cigarettes and chewing tobacco when i can
trials and troubles are heavy for me

trials and troubles are heavy for meembed"
