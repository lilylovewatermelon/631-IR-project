iâ€™m drawn to the blood
the flight of a onewinged dove
how how did this happen
how how did this happen

the strength of his arm
my lover caught me off guard
how head of a rabbit
how head of a rabbit

chorus
for my prayer has always been love
what did i do to deserve this

verse 2
with blood on my sleeve
delilah avenge my grief
how god of elijah
how god of elijah

as fire to the sun
tell me what i have done
how heart of a dragon
how heart of a dragon

for my prayer has always been love
what did i do to deserve this now
