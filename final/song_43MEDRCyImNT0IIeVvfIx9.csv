the airlines compete with each other but google stands alone economists use two simplified models to explain the difference perfect competition and monopoly “perfect competition” is considered both the ideal and the default state in economics 101 so­called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous products since no firm has any market power they must all sell at whatever price the market determines if there is money to be made new firms will enter the market increase supply drive prices down and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place if too many firms enter the market they’ll suffer losses some will fold and prices will rise back to sustainable levels under perfect competition in the long run no company makes an economic profit

the opposite of perfect competition is monopoly whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price a monopoly owns its market so it can set its own prices since it has no competition it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits to an economist every monopoly looks the same whether it deviously eliminates rivals secures   license from the state or innovates its way to the top in this book we’re not interested in illegal bullies or government favorites by “monopoly” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1 it hasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s when it definitively distanced itself from microsoft and yahoo

americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines actually capitalism and competition are opposites capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital but under perfect competition all profits get competed away the lesson for entrepreneurs is clear if you want to create and capture lasting value don’t build an undifferentiated commodity businesslies people sellhow much of the world is actually monopolistic how much is truly competitive it’s hard to say because our common conversation about these matters is so confused to the outside observer all businesses can seem reasonably alike so it’s
easy to perceive only small differences between themperception firms are similarbut the reality is much more binary than that there’s an enormous difference between perfect competition and monopoly and most businesses are much closer to one extreme than we commonly realizereality differences are deepthe confusion comes from a universal bias for describing market conditions in self­serving ways both monopolists and competitors are incentivized to bend the truthmonopoly liesmonopolists lie to protect themselves they know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited scrutinized and attacked since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their nonexistent competition

think about how google talks about its business it certainly doesn’t claim to be a monopoly but is it one well it depends a monopoly in what let’s say that google is primarily a search engine as of may 2014 it owns about 68 of the search market its closest competitors microsoft and yahoo have about 19 and 10 respectively if that doesn’t seem dominant enough consider the fact that the word “google” is now an official entry in the oxford english dictionary—as a verb don’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen to bing

but suppose we say that google is primarily an advertising company that changes things the us search engine advertising market is 17 billion annually online advertising is 37 billion annually the entire us advertising market is 150 billion and global advertising is a 495 billion market so even if google completely monopolized us search engine advertising it would own just 34 of the global advertising market from this angle google looks like a small player in a competitive world

what if we frame google as a multifaceted technology company instead this seems reasonable enough in addition to its search engine google makes dozens of other software products not to mention robotic cars android phones and wearable computers but 95 of google’s revenue comes from search advertising its other products generated just 235 billion in 2012 and its consumer tech products a mere fraction of that since consumer tech is a 964 billion market globally google owns less than 024 of it—a far cry from relevance let alone monopoly framing itself as just another tech company allows google to escape all sorts of unwanted attentioncompetitive liesnon­monopolists tell the opposite lie “we’re in a league of our own” entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the
scale of competition but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make the fatal temptation is to describe your market
extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition suppose you want to start a restaurant that serves british food in palo alto “no one else is doing it” you might reason “we’ll own the entire market” but that’s only true if the relevant market is the market for british food specifically what if the actual market is the palo alto restaurant market in general and what if all the restaurants in nearby towns are part of the relevant market as well

these are hard questions but the bigger problem is that you have an incentive not to ask them at all when you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different you’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that’s true it would be better to pause and consider whether there are people in palo alto who would rather eat british food above all else it’s very possible they don’t exist

in 2001 my co­workers at paypal and i would often get lunch on castro street in mountain view we had our pick of restaurants starting with obvious categories like indian sushi and burgers there were more options once we settled on a type north indian or south indian cheaper or fancier and so on in contrast to the competitive local restaurant market paypal was at that time the only email­based payments company in the world we employed fewer people than the restaurants on castro street did but our business was much more valuable than all of those restaurants combined starting a new south indian restaurant is a really hard way to make money if you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors—maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great­grandmother’s recipe—your business is unlikely to survive

creative industries work this way too no screenwriter wants to admit that her new movie script simply rehashes what has already been done before rather the pitch is “this film will combine various exciting elements in entirely new ways” it could even be true suppose her idea is to have jayz star in a cross between hackers and jaws rap star joins elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his friend

that has definitely never been done before but like the lack of british restaurants in palo alto maybe that’s a good thing
nonmonopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller marketsbritish food q restaurant q palo alto
rap star q hackers q sharksmonopolists by contrast disguise their monopoly by
framing their market as the union of several large marketssearch engine q mobile phones q wearable
computers q selfdriving carswhat does a monopolist’s union story look like in practice consider a statement from google chairman eric schmidt’s testimony at a 2011 congressional hearingwe face an extremely competitive landscape in which consumers have a multitude of options to access informationor translated from prspeak to plain englishgoogle is a small fish in a big pond we could be swallowed whole at any time we are not the monopoly that the government is looking forruthless peoplethe problem with a competitive business goes beyond lack of profits imagine you’re running one of those restaurants in mountain view you’re not that different from dozens of your competitors so you’ve got to fight hard to survive if you offer affordable food with low margins you can probably pay employees only minimum wage and you’ll need to squeeze out every efficiency that’s why small restaurants put grandma to work at the register and make the kids wash dishes in the back restaurants aren’t much better even at the very highest rungs where reviews and ratings like michelin’s star system enforce a culture of intense competition that can drive chefs crazy french chef and winner of three michelin stars bernard loiseau was quoted as saying “if i lose a star i will commit suicide” michelin maintained his rating but loiseau killed himself anyway in 2003 when a competing french dining guide downgraded his restaurant the competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death
a monopoly like google is different since it doesn’t have to worry about competing with anyone it has wider latitude to care about its workers its products and its impact on the wider world google’s motto—“don’t be evil”—is in part a branding ploy but it’s also characteristic of a kind of business that’s successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence in business money is either an important thing or it is everything monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money non­monopolists can’t in perfect competition a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long­term future only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival monopoly profitsmonopoly capitalismso a monopoly is good for everyone on the inside but what about everyone on the outside do outsized profits come at the expense of the rest of society actually yes profits come out of customers’ wallets and monopolies deserve their bad reputation—but only in a world where nothing changes

in a static world a monopolist is just a rent collector if you corner the market for something you can jack up the price others will have no choice but to buy from you think of the famous board game deeds are shuffled around from player to player but the board never changes there’s no way to win by inventing a better kind of real estate development the relative values of the properties are fixed for all time so all you can do is try to buy them up

but the world we live in is dynamic it’s possible to invent new and better things creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society they’re powerful engines for making it bettereven the government knows this that’s why one of its departments works hard to create monopolies by granting patents to new inventions even though another part hunts them down by prosecuting antitrust cases it’s possible to question whether anyone should really be awarded a legally enforceable monopoly simply for having been the first to think of something like a mobile software design but it’s clear that something like apple’s monopoly profits from designing producing and marketing the iphone were the reward for creating greater abundance not artificial scarcity customers were happy to finally have the choice of paying high prices to get a smartphone that actually works

the dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don’t strangle innovation with apple’s ios at the forefront the rise of mobile computing has dramatically reduced microsoft’s decadeslong operating system dominance before that ibm’s hardware monopoly of the ’60s and ’70s was overtaken by microsoft’s software monopoly att had a monopoly on telephone service for most of the 20th century but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from any number of providers if the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back progress they would be dangerous and wed be right to oppose them but the history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents

monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the longterm plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in to competition cant dream of

so why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state it’s a relic of history economists copied their mathematics from the work of 19thcentury physicists they see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms not as unique creators their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition because that’s what’s easy to model not because it represents the best of business but it’s worth recalling that the longrun equilibrium predicted by 19thcentury physics was a state in which all energy is evenly distributed and everything comes to rest—also known as the heat death of the universe whatever your views on thermodynamics its a powerful metaphor in business equilibrium means stasis and stasis means death if your industry is in a competitive equilibrium the death of your business wont matter to the world some other undifferentiated competitor will always be ready to take your place

perfect equilibrium may describe the void that is most of the universe it may even characterize many businesses but every new creation takes place far from equilibrium in the real world outside economic theory every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception monopoly is the condition of every successful business

tolstop opens anna karenina by observing all happy families are alike each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way business is the opposite all happy companies are different each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem all failed companies are the same they failed to escape competition4 the ideology of competitioncreative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator competition means no profits for anybody no meaningful differentiation and a struggle for survival so why do people believe that competition is healthy the answer is that competition is not just an economic concept or a simple in convenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace more than anything else competition is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking we preach competition internalize its necessity and enact its commandments and as a result we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete the less we gain

this is a simple truth but we’ve all been trained to ignore it our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition grades themselves allow precise measurement of each student’s competitiveness pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials we teach every young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways irrespective of individual talents and preferences students who don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality

and it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking for the privilege of being turned into conformists students or their families pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation why are we doing this to ourselves

i wish i had asked myself when i was younger my path was so tracked that in my 8thgrade yearbook one of my friends predicted—accurately—that four years later i would enter stanford as a sophomore and after a conventionally successful undergraduate career i enrolled at stanford law school where i competed even harder for the standard badges of success

the highest prize in a law student’s world is unambiguous out of tens of thousands of graduates each year only a few dozen get a supreme court clerkship after clerking on a federal appeals court for a year i was invited to interview for clerkships with justices kennedy and scalia my meetings with the justices went well i was so close to winning this last competition if only i got the clerkship i thought i would be set for life but i didn’t at the time i was devastated

in 2004 after i had built and sold paypal i ran into an old friend from law school who had helped me prepare my failed clerkship applications we hadn’t spoken in nearly a decade his first question wasn’t “how are you doing” or “can you believe it’s been so long” instead he grinned and asked “so peter aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerk ship” with the benefit of hindsight we both knew that winning that ultimate competition would have changed my life for the worse had i actually clerked on the supreme court i probably would have spent my entire career taking depositions or drafting other people’s business deals instead of creating anything new it’s hard to say how much would be different but the opportunity costs were enormous all rhodes scholars had a great future in their past war and peaceprofessors downplay the cutthroat culture of academia but managers never tire of comparing business to war mba stu dents carry around copies of clausewitz and sun tzu war metaphors invade our everyday business language we use headhunters to build up a sales force that will enable us to take a captive market and make a killing but really it’s competition not business that is like war allegedly necessary supposedly valiant but ultimately destructive
why do people compete with each other marx and shakespeare provide two models for understanding almost every kind of conflict according to marx people fight because they are different the proletariat fights the bourgeoisie because they have completely different ideas and goals generated for marx by their very different material circumstances the greater the differences the greater the conflict

to shakespeare by contrast all combatants look more or less alike it’s not at all clear why they should be fighting since they have nothing to fight about consider the opening line from romeo and juliet “two households both alike in dignity” the two houses are alike yet they hate each other they grow even more similar as the feud escalates eventually they lose sight of why they started fighting in the first place

in the world of business at least shakespeare proves the superior guide inside a firm people become obsessed with their competitors for career advancement then the firms themselves become obsessed with their competitors in the marketplace amid all the human drama people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead

let’s test the shakespearean model in the real world imagine a production called gates and schmidt based on romeo and juliet montague is microsoft capulet is google two great families run by alpha nerds sure to clash on account of their sameness

as with all good tragedy the conflict seems inevitable only in retrospect in fact it was entirely avoidable these families came from very different places the house of montague built operating systems and office applications the house of capulet wrote a search engine what was there to fight about

lots apparently as a startup each clan had been content to leave the other alone and prosper independently but as they grew they began to focus on each other montagues ob sessed about capulets obsessed about montagues the result windows vs chrome os bing vs google search explorer vs chrome office vs docs and surface vs nexus

just as war cost the montagues and capulets their chil dren it cost microsoft and google their dominance apple came along and overtook them all in january 2013 apple’s market capitalization was 500 billion while google and microsoft combined were worth 467 billion just three years before microsoft and google were each more valuable than apple war is costly business

rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past consider the re cent proliferation of mobile credit card readers in october 2010 a startup called square released a small white square shaped product that let anyone with an iphone swipe and accept credit cards it was the first good payment processing solution for mobile handsets imitators promptly sprang into action

a canadian company called netsecure launched its own card reader in a half‐moon shape intuit brought a cylindrical reader to the geometric battle in march 2012 ebay’s paypal unit launched its own copycat card reader it was shaped like a triangle—a clear jab at square as three sides are simpler than four one gets the sense that this shakespearean saga won’t end until the apes run out of shapes

the hazards of imitative competition may partially ex‐ plain why individuals with an asperger’s‐like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in silicon valley today if you’re less sensitive to social cues you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you if you’re interested in making things or programming computers you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single‐mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them then when you apply your skills you’re a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes

competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist the crazy ’90s version of this was the fierce battle for the online pet store market it was petscom vs petstorecom vs petopiacom vs what seemed like dozens of others each company was obsessed with defeating its rivals precisely because there were no substantive differences to focus on amid all the tactical questions—who could price chewy dog toys most aggressively who could create the best super bowl ads—these companies totally lost sight of the wider question of whether the online pet supply market was the right space to be in winning is better than losing but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting when petscom folded after the dotcom crash 300 million of investment capital disappeared with it

other times rivalry is just weird and distracting con sider the shakespearean conflict between larry ellison co founder and ceo of oracle and tom siebel a top salesman at oracle and ellison’s protégé before he went on to found siebel systems in 1993 ellison was livid at what he thought was siebel’s betrayal siebel hated being in the shadow of his former boss the two men were basically identical—hard charging chicagoans who loved to sell and hated to lose—so their hatred ran deep ellison and siebel spent the second half of the ’90s trying to sabotage each other at one point ellison sent truckloads of ice cream sandwiches to siebel’s headquarters to try to convince siebel employees to jump ship the copy on the wrappers “summer is near oracle is here to brighten your day and your career”

strangely oracle intentionally accumulated enemies ellison’s theory was that it’s always good to have an enemy so long as it was large enough to appear threatening and thus motivational to employees but not so large as to actually threaten the company so ellison was probably thrilled when in 1996 a small database company called informix put up a billboard near oracle’s redwood shores headquarters that read caution dinosaur crossing another informix billboard on northbound highway 101 read you’ve just passed redwood shores so did we
oracle shot back with a billboard that implied that informix’s software was slower than snails then informix ceo phil white decided to make things personal when white learned that larry ellison enjoyed japanese samurai culture he commissioned a new billboard depicting the oracle logo along with a broken samurai sword the ad wasn’t even really aimed at oracle as an entity let alone the consuming public it was a personal attack on ellison but perhaps white spent a little too much time worrying about the competition while he was busy creating billboards informix imploded in a massive accounting scandal and white soon found himself in federal prison for securities fraud

if you can’t beat a rival it may be better to merge i started confinity with my co‐founder max levchin in 1998 when we released the paypal product in late 1999 elon musk’s xcom was right on our heels our companies’ offices were four blocks apart on university avenue in palo alto and x’s product mirrored ours feature‐for‐feature by late 1999 we were in all‐out war many of us at paypal logged 100‐hour workweeks no doubt that was counterproductive but the focus wasn’t on objective productivity the focus was defeat‐ ing xcom one of our engineers actually designed a bomb for this purpose when he presented the schematic at a team meeting calmer heads prevailed and the proposal was attributed to extreme sleep deprivation


but in february 2000 elon and i were more scared about the rapidly inflating tech bubble than we were about each other a financial crash would ruin us both before we could finish our fight so in early march we met on neutral ground—a café almost exactly equidistant to our offices— and negotiated a 50‐50 merger de‐escalating the rivalry post‐merger wasn’t easy but as far as problems go it was a good one to have as a unified team we were able to ride out the dot‐com crash and then build a successful business

sometimes you do have to fight where that’s true you should fight and win there is no middle ground either don’t throw any punches or strike hard and end it quickly

this advice can be hard to follow because pride and honor can get in the way hence hamlet 
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune death and danger dare even for an eggshell rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honor’s at the stakefor hamlet greatness means willingness to fight for reasons as thin as an eggshell anyone would fight for things that matter true heroes take their personal honor so seriously they will fight for things that don’t matter this twisted logic is part of human nature but it’s disastrous in business if you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value you’re already more sane than most the next chapter is about how to use a clear head to build a monopoly business5 last mover advantageescaping competition will give you a monopoly but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can endure in the future compare the value of the new york times company with twitter each employs a few thousand people and each gives millions of people a way to get news but when twitter went public in 2013 it was valued at 24 billion— more than 12 times the times’s market capitalization—even though the times earned 133 million in 2012 while twitter lost money what explains the huge premium for twitter

the answer is cash flow this sounds bizarre at first since the times was profitable while twitter wasn’t but a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future investors expect twitter will be able to capture monopoly profits over the next decade while newspapers’ monopoly days are over

simply stated the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future to properly value a business you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future

comparing discounted cash flows shows the difference between lowgrowth businesses and highgrowth startups at its starkest most of the value of lowgrowth businesses is in the near term an old economy business like a newspaper might hold its value if it can maintain its current cash flows for five or six years however any firm with close substitutes will see its profits competed away nightclubs or restaurants are extreme examples successful ones might collect healthy amounts today but their cash flows will probably dwindle over the next few years when customers move on to newer and trendier alternatives

technology companies follow the opposite trajectory they often lose money for the first few years it takes time to build valuable things and that means delayed revenue most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future

in march 2001 paypal had yet to make a profit but our revenues were growing 100 year‐over‐year when i projected our future cash flows i found that 75 of the company’s present value would come from profits generated in 2011 and beyond—hard to believe for a company that had been in business for only 27 months but even that turned out to be an underestimation today paypal continues to grow at about 15 annually and the discount rate is lower than a decade ago it now appears that most of the company’s value will come from 2020 and beyond

linkedin is another good example of a company whose value exists in the far future as of early 2014 its market capitalization was 245 billion—very high for a company with less than 1 billion in revenue and only 216 million in net income for 2012 you might look at these numbers and conclude that investors have gone insane but this valuation makes sense when you consider linkedin’s projected future cash flows

the overwhelming importance of future profits is counterintuitive even in silicon valley for a company to be valuable it must grow and endure but many entrepreneurs focus only on short‐term growth they have an excuse growth is easy to measure but durability isn’t those who succumb to measurement mania obsess about weekly active user statistics monthly revenue targets and quarterly earnings reports however you can hit those numbers and still overlook deeper harder‐to‐measure problems that threaten the durability of your business

for example rapid short‐term growth at both zynga and groupon distracted managers and investors from long‐term challenges zynga scored early wins with games like farmville and claimed to have a “psychometric engine” to rigorously gauge the appeal of new releases but they ended up with the same problem as every hollywood studio how can you reliably produce a constant stream of popular entertainment for a fickle audience nobody knows groupon  posted fast growth as hundreds of thousands of local businesses tried their product but persuading those businesses to become repeat customers was harder than they thought

if you focus on near‐term growth above all else you miss the most important question you should be asking will this business still be around a decade from now numbers alone won’t tell you the answer instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your businesscharacteristics of monopolywhat does a company with large cash flows far into the future look like every monopoly is unique but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics proprietary technology network effects economies of scale and branding

this isn’t a list of boxes to check as you build your business—there’s no shortcut to monopoly however analyzing your business according to these characteristics can help you think about how to make it durable1 proprietary technologyproprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate google’s search algorithms for ex‐ ample return results better than anyone else’s proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion add to the core search product’s robustness and defensibility it would be very hard for anyone to do to google what google did to all the other search engine companies in the early 2000s

as a good rule of thumb proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell especially in an already crowded market

the clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new if you build something valuable where there was nothing before the increase in value is theoretically infinite a drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep or a cure for baldness for example would certainly support a monopoly business

or you can radically improve an existing solution once you’re 10x better you escape competition paypal for instance made buying and selling on ebay at least 10 times better instead of mailing a check that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive paypal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended sellers received their proceeds right away and unlike with a check they knew the funds were good
amazon made its first 10x improvement in a particularly visible way they offered at least 10 times as many books as any other bookstore when it launched in 1995 amazon could claim to be “earth’s largest bookstore” because unlike a retail bookstore that might stock 100000 books amazon didn’t need to physically store any inventory—it simply requested the title from its supplier whenever a customer made an order this quantum improvement was so effective that a very unhappy barnes  noble filed a lawsuit three days before amazon’s ipo claiming that amazon was unfairly calling itself a “bookstore” when really it was a “book broker”

you can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design before 2010 tablet computing was so poor that for all practical purposes the market didn’t even exist “microsoft windows xp tablet pc edition” products first shipped in 2002 and nokia released its own “internet tablet” in 2005 but they were a pain to use then apple released the ipad design improvements are hard to measure but it seems clear that apple improved on anything that had come before by at least an order of magnitude tablets went from unusable to useful2 network effectsnetwork effects make a product more useful as more peo‐ ple use it for example if all your friends are on facebook it makes sense for you to join facebook too unilaterally choosing a different social network would only make you an eccentric

network effects can be powerful but you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small for example in 1960 a quixotic company called xanadu set out to build a two‐way communication network between all computers—a sort of early synchronous version of the world wide web after more than three decades of futile effort xanadu folded just as the web was becoming commonplace their technology probably would have worked at scale but it could have worked only at scale it required every computer to join the network at the same time and that was never going to happen

paradoxically then network effects businesses must start with especially small markets facebook started with just harvard students—mark zuckerberg’s first product was designed to get all his classmates signed up not to attract all people of earth this is why successful network businesses rarely get started by mba types the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all3 economies of scalea monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger the fixed costs of creating a product engineering management office space can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero

many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies if you own a yoga studio for example you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers you can hire more instructors and expand to more locations but your margins will remain fairly low and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients as software engineers are able to do

a good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design twitter already has more than 250 million users today it doesn’t need to add too many customized features in order to acquire more and there’s no inherent reason why it should ever stop growing4 brandinga company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly today’s strongest tech brand is apple the attractive looks and carefully chosen materials of products like the iphone and macbook the apple stores’ sleek minimalist design and close control over the consumer experience the omnipresent advertising campaigns the price positioning as a maker of premium goods and the lingering nimbus of steve jobs’s personal charisma all contribute to a perception that apple offers products so good as to constitute a category of their own

many have tried to learn from apple’s success paid advertising branded stores luxurious materials playful keynote speeches high prices and even minimalist design are all susceptible to imitation but these techniques for polishing the surface don’t work without a strong underlying substance apple has a complex suite of proprietary technologies both in hardware like superior touchscreen materials and software like touchscreen interfaces purpose‐designed for specific materials it manufactures products at a scale large enough to dominate pricing for the materials it buys and it enjoys strong network effects from its content ecosystem thousands of developers write software for apple devices because that’s where hundreds of millions of users are and those users stay on the platform because it’s where the apps are these other monopolistic advantages are less obvious than apple’s sparkling brand but they are the fundamentals that let the branding effectively reinforce apple’s monopoly

beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous ever since marissa mayer became ceo of yahoo in mid‐2012 she has worked to revive the once‐popular internet giant by making it cool again in a single tweet yahoo summarized mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue” the people are supposed to come for the coolness yahoo demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like tumblr and it has gained media attention for mayer’s own star power but the big question is what products yahoo will actually create when steve jobs returned to apple he didn’t just make apple a cool place to work he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements no technology company can be built on branding alonebuilding a monopolybrand scale network effects and technology in some combination define a monopoly but to get them to work you need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberatelystart small and monopolizeevery startup is small at the start every monopoly dominates a large share of its market therefore every startup should start with a very small market always err on the side of starting too small the reason is simple it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one if you think your initial market might be too big it almost certainly is

small doesn’t mean nonexistent we made this mistake early on at paypal our first product let people beam money to each other via palmpilots it was interesting technology and no one else was doing it however the world’s millions of palmpilot users weren’t concentrated in a particular place they had little in common and they used their devices only episodically nobody needed our product so we had no customers

with that lesson learned we set our sights on ebay auctions where we found our first success in late 1999 ebay had a few thousand highvolume “powersellers” and after only three months of dedicated effort we were serving 25 of them it was much easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals

the perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors any big market is a bad choice and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse this is why it’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1 of a 100 billion market in practice a large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition so it’s hard to ever reach that 1 and even if you do succeed in gaining a small foothold you’ll have to be satisfied with keeping the lights on cut throat competition means your profits will be zeroscaling uponce you create and dominate a niche market then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets amazon shows how it can be done jeff bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail but he very deliberately started with books there were millions of books to catalog but they all had roughly the same shape they were easy to ship and some of the most rarely sold books—those least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock—also drew the most enthusiastic customers amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far from a bookstore or seeking something unusual amazon then had two options expand the number of people who read books or expand to adjacent markets they chose the latter starting with the most similar markets cds videos and software amazon continued to add categories gradually until it had become the world’s general store the name itself brilliantly encapsulated the company’s scaling strategy the biodiversity of the amazon rain forest reflected amazon’s first goal of cataloging every book in the world and now it stands for every kind of thing in the world period

ebay also started by dominating small niche markets when it launched its auction marketplace in 1995 it didn’t need the whole world to adopt it at once the product worked well for intense interest groups like beanie baby obsessives once it monopolized the beanie baby trade ebay didn’t jump straight to listing sports cars or industrial surplus it continued to cater to small‐time hobbyists until it became the most reliable marketplace for people trading online no matter what the item

sometimes there are hidden obstacles to scaling—a lesson that ebay has learned in recent years like all marketplaces the auction marketplace lent itself to natural monopoly be‐ cause buyers go where the sellers are and vice versa but ebay found that the auction model works best for individually distinctive products like coins and stamps it works less well for commodity products people don’t want to bid on pencils or kleenex so it’s more convenient just to buy them from amazon ebay is still a valuable monopoly it’s just smaller than people in 2004 expected it to be

sequencing markets correctly is underrated and it takes discipline to expand gradually the most successful companies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrativedont disruptsilicon valley has become obsessed with “disruption” originally “disruption” was a term of art to describe how a firm can use new technology to introduce a low‐end product at low prices improve the product over time and eventually overtake even the premium products offered by incumbent companies using older technology this is roughly what happened when the advent of pcs disrupted the market for mainframe computers at first pcs seemed irrelevant then they became dominant today mobile devices may be doing the same thing to pcs

however disruption has recently transmogrified into a self‐congratulatory buzzword for anything posing as trendy and new this seemingly trivial fad matters because it dis‐ torts an entrepreneur’s self‐understanding in an inherently competitive way the concept was coined to describe threats to incumbent companies so startups’ obsession with disruption means they see themselves through older firms’ eyes if you think of yourself as an insurgent battling dark forces it’s easy to become unduly fixated on the obstacles in your path but if you truly want to make something new the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create indeed if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms it can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to be‐ come a monopoly

disruption also attracts attention disruptors are people who look for trouble and find it disruptive kids get sent to the principal’s office disruptive companies often pick fights they can’t win think of napster the name itself meant trouble what kinds of things can one “nap” music    kids    and perhaps not much else shawn fanning and sean parker napster’s then‐teenage founders credibly threatened to disrupt the powerful music recording industry in 1999 the next year they made the cover of time magazine a year and a half after that they ended up in bankruptcy court

paypal could be seen as disruptive but we didn’t try to directly challenge any large competitor it’s true that we took some business away from visa when we popularized internet payments you might use paypal to buy something online instead of using your visa card to buy it in a store but since we expanded the market for payments overall we gave visa far more business than we took the overall dynamic was net positive unlike napster’s negative‐sum struggle with the us recording industry as you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets don’t disrupt avoid competition as much as possiblethe last will be firstyou’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage” if you’re the first entrant into a market you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started but moving first is a tactic not a goal what really matters is generating cash flows in the future so being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you it’s much better to be the last mover—that is to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits the way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from there toward your ambitious long‐term vision in this one particular at least business is like chess grandmaster josé raúl capablanca put it well to succeed “you must study the endgame before everything else”1embed"
