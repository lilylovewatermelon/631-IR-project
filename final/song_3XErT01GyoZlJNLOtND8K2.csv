dmac on the fuckin track
tahj money

chorus
im so sick of farewells and rips
in the trenches yellin gang gang mob ties what i bleed
dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
he gon let that 9 blow with ease
can i speak my mind can i breathe
i know she might cry if i leave
i been fooled by liars and thieves
iced out my rollie but i know time cannot freeze

verse 1
once you give my pussy up its over with
miss who you used to be cause thats who i was closer with
im in my bag now i act like i dont know the bitch
before i knew what platinum was was tryna go on hits
well if he act like he bout it then put him on the list
you better pick out a casket cause they goin quick
they gassed him up now tears sheddin when they post his pic
i know bout some flukey shit i heard he died on a lick
my whole squad scorin bitch we dont do no assists
potential wasted couldnt stay in his lane he aint know his niche
might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick
every day a gamble with your life all we know is risk
from the windy city where you bound to see the coldest shit

im so sick of farewells and rips
in the trenches yellin gang gang mob ties what i bleed
dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
he gon let that 9 blow with ease
can i speak my mind can i breathe
i know she might cry if i leave
i been fooled by liars and thieves
iced out my rollie but i know time cannot freeze

verse 2
switches on them glizzys get to blowin like its four of me
promise to my son that the streets wont get no more of me
remember every line from that obituary poetry
see they peep im ballin now just go back to ignorin me
always gotta spazz unleash the beast when they recordin me
lord im tryna take it easy on em but they forcin me
see him in person and that boy wont stand on shit he been sayin
pop shit like taliban loadin up them sticks in a van
you know its fuck the other side cause my niggas gone
always been fuck the other side we dont get along
if we bump heads like marvin gaye lets get it on
aim for the head that chopper spray we get em gone
independent her hair down and she feelin grown
tryna correct her flaw she filled with silicone
and she aint all innocent she did a nigga wrong
i got a playlist for your heart girl pick a song
chorus
im so sick of farewells and rips
in the trenches yellin gang gang mob ties what i bleed
dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
he gon let that 9 blow with ease
can i speak my mind can i breathe
i know she might cry if i leave
i been fooled by liars and thieves
