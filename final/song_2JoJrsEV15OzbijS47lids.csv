today was a fairytale you were the prince
i used to be a damsel in distress
you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale i wore a dress
you wore a dark gray tshirt
you told me i was pretty when i looked like a mess
today was a fairytale

prechorus
time slows down
whenever youre around

chorus
well can you feel this magic in the air
it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale

verse 2
today was a fairytale youve got a smile
that takes me to another planet
every move you make everything you say is right
today was a fairytale
today was a fairytale all that i can say
is now its gettin so much clearer
nothing made sense til the time i saw your face
today was a fairytale
