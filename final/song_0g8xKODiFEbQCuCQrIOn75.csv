wide awake gettin halfpast zero
its gettin heated so i leave the windows open
leave the windows open
preoccupied with a late night broll
right now laying here alone is heaven
here alone is heaven

and ive been a hero helpless
im in hell
and ive cried up and down in these hallways
blamed myself

suns up i dont really wanna fight the daylight
i dont care if you moved on
im not layin in bed with a fuckedup head
im not layin in bed with a fuckedup

verse 2
sundried on the backyard patio
drunk eyes cause i didnt give it a home run
yeah yeah
youre hiding on the fm radio
i sing along just to sing my thoughts at someone
