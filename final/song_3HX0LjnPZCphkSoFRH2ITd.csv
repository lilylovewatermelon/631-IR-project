chrome heart jeans im kinda done with the amiris
some would call it crazy half a ticket on some earrings
at it for a decade had a plug when i was sixteen
ptsd i aint sleep so i dont got dreams
two things i aint running out this money and this lean
two things i care about my family and my team
we was supposed to keep it on the low but why you scream
balling like the playoffs i was tryna get a ring
penthouse in miami
pretty vibes wildin out like they work for nick cannon
tell that bitch to have a seat i know that she cant stand it
tell them boys its fuck em all aint got no understanding
legend in my neighborhood for real free shannon
keeping my composurе im on chill i cant panic
they say i wouldnt make it past two years but i managеd to
you supposed to go with how you feel im not mad at you
gwagen matteblue

chorus
she get my rocks off i buy her goyard
fuck all the time and still act like i dont know her
i heard that pressure bursts pipes i come so hard
why yall on my dick you know thats your ho job
aint worried bout nothing
everybody they own boss we all getting this money
call it what you wanna call it im one of the owners
i couldve exposed you brodie but i aint gon talk about it

i was in the trap too i fucked up my sack too
most of that shit cap cant go for that you say its facts prove it
plug had us on a stash dub but now we back moving
they thought they was winning til i entered now they back losing
brodie in prison on an iphone getting tattoed
i dont know who told you to come for me thats a bad move
i aint in no space for no company im in a bad mood
only thing i gotta abide by is the cash rules
if you think i aint running this money up you a damn fool
tryna count my pockets my net worth aint on no damn google
fifty million dollars in a year if im lying shoot me
five hundred thousand every show im on my grind stupid
i been fucking her and her best friend i put em in a group text
they done made you mad get in your bag thats how you posed to do that
everybody got a hundred guns they know what no to shoot at
ima get this guap until im done bro i can promise you that
i was on the block when shit was lit for real where the fuck was you at
never drop no song then hit a bitch for real bro we dont do that
we the ones thats really out here pushing bro i thought you knew that
come through in that whatshername everybody look like who that

chorus
she get my rocks off i buy her goyard
fuck all the time and still act like i dont know her
i heard that pressure bursts pipes i come so hard
why yall on my dick you know thats your ho job
aint worried bout nothing
everybody they own boss we all getting this money
call it what you wanna call it im one of the owners
i couldve exposed you brodie but i aint gon talk about itembed"
