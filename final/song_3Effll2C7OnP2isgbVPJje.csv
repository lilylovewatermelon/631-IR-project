in fields where nothing grew but weeds
i found a flower at my feet
bending there in my direction
i wrapped a hand around its stem
i pulled until the roots gave in
finding there what id been missing

but i know
so i tell myself i tell myself its wrong
theres a point we pass from which we cant return
i felt the cold rain of the coming storm

hook
all because of you
i havent slept in so long
when i do i dream of drowning in the ocean
longing for the shore where i can lay my head down
ill follow your voice
all you have to do is shout it out

verse 2
inside my hands these petals browned
dried up fallen to the ground
but it was already too late now
i pushed my fingers through the earth
returned this flower to the dirt
so it could live i walked away now
you might also likebut i know
not a day goes by that i dont feel this burn
theres a point we pass from which we cant return
i felt the cold rain of the coming storm

hook
all because of you
i havent slept in so long
when i do i dream of drowning in the ocean
longing for the shore where i can lay my head down
ill follow your voice
all you have to do is shout it out

bridge
all because of you
all because of you

extended hook
all because of you
i havent slept in so long
when i do i dream of drowning in the ocean
longing for the shore where i can lay my head down
inside these arms of yours

all because of you
i believe in angels
not the kind with wings
no not the kind with halos
the kind that bring you home
when home becomes a strange place
ill follow your voice
all you have to do is shout it out
