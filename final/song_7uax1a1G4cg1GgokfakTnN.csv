im dedicated the definition of dedication
wrote this whole record while i was levitating
sittin in my room with the pen and paper im innovative
theyve been afraid of me since i was a second grader
im the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
theres levels of music—and im in the elevator
going up to the top floor look how we elevated
what you dont know the brand by now you better get educated
take both of my arms rip em out the sockets and separate em
forgive me yeah i know i get animated
dont matter i still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
never been more motivated
just look at all the minds i have opened and penetrated
see i am the voice of all these kids that think things but never say em
thats why they come to my shows wearing the nf hoodies and hats low like were carrying weapons ah
put the controllers away its game over
i promise im way colder
the fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
well thats pretty convenient cause i just made a plate for em
and i dont hear what none of yall are saying
i just sit at the keys feeling the music
got me thinking im beethoven
the game needs a makeover
if youve been waiting the waits over
you aint notice yall about to witness a takeover im home
yeah they waiting on me to match the
emotion that i had in the last one
what if i dont they gon tell me that im losing my passion
if i do am i repeating my actions
yeah look how could you leave us is massive
there aint nothing i can write thatll match that
my biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
it was disappointing myself and the fanbase
now i want you to picture me
im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing how could you leave us through the speakers on my iphone
tryna figure out if ima always feel the way that i feel or maybe someday i can learn to be happy
or maybe i cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a hasbeen
pains always been the root of my music
if i cut it off how am i supposed to keep growing
if i let it go wont my whole career be in ruins
thats when i realized this whole conversation is stupid
i never cared to impress people that dont even know me
i just write what i feel somehow it started a movement
trying to enjoy a career but i dont know how to do it
when i spend all of my time being afraid ima lose it
but then i figured out the reason they follow me
the reason why these fans surrounding me
its not cause im a rap god
i dont need you people to bow to me
all they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
this is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than halloween
yeah you aint alone out there look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year
listen to intro iii trying to kill my fear
theyll get that in a minute
we about to shatter the critics
i am a savage admit it
a lot of baggage i live in
thats why the passion is different
really dont care if they get it
were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
im home
