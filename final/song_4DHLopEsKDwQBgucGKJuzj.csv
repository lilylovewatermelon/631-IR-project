do you think i care
about your new job and your new hair
do you think i cry
bout your new friends and your new guy
well i do

verse 2
slide a drink across the table
watch it fall onto the ground
keep your distance shes unstable
watch your tone and watch your mouth

verse 3
left all your records at your mothers place
they only wouldve slapped you in the face
at least your instagram is up to date
better check your facts before you flip the page

verse 4
wait in line
cause youre not alone no
youre mine
i bet you never take your time
all you do is scratch and bite
was i just a waste of time

and throw it all out
take my love
