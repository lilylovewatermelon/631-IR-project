i woke up this mornin in a terrible mood
now you talk about a woman treatin a good man rude
she had me talkin to myself gazin at that mean ol wall
she had another daddy waitin down at the end of the hall

verse 2
she changes with the weather like the leaves i recall
she blossoms in the spring but then shes gone in the fall
a two timin woman with a heart of solid stone
she tells me that she loves me but her hearts a little under grown

verse 3
well she said shed never leave me but she got the urge to roam
she drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
she never changes course she just goes along that same ol way
and i hope she keeps adriftin rolls along back home someday

verse 4
cause if i ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
and tell her now sit there woman you aint leavin no more
im gonna tame your mama til youre eatin from my hand
its not that i dont love you honey its just to make you understand

verse 5
yes i woke up this mornin in a terrible mood
you talk about a woman treatin a good man rude
she had me talkin to myself gazin at that mean ol wall
she had another daddy waitin down at the end of the hallyou might also likeembed"
