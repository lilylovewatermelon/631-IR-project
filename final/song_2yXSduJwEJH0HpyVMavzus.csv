if you could read my mind
youd say baby youre right
but i dont want to fight anymore
youre usually righter than i am
and im not a very good fighter
am i no neither are you
so lets be through with this one
because some things never change

chorus
i know youre still my same girl
who builds her own frames
for the pictures that she paints
the lights of monterey
coming across the bay
right back to my same girl

verse 2
how can you be so calm when the truth is that sometimes
we live in the eye of the storm
with everything going on around us
i feel comfort in the sounds when you say
it will be okay
like a star guiding me to the light of the day
doldrums could follow me
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
but not with my same girl
who builds her own frames
for the pictures that she paints
the lights of monterey
coming across the bay
right back to my same girlembed"
