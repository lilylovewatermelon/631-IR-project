stanley i dont want to stay until seven again this year
pam i dont really have any control over that stanley

pam michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work umm time cards he has to sign these every friday purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month and expense reports all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter but once a year it all falls on the same friday and thats today i call it the perfect storm

michael singing and tapping on his coffee mug i dont want to work i just want to bang on this mug all day
ryan did you ask me here for any specific reason
