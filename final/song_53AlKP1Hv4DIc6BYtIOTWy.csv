they said i had it bad
addicted to what we had
heart rates slow fading fast
vitals low might not last
strapped down while sirens ring
holding on trying to breathe
not like this i cant leave
look what youve done to me

chorus
i overdose overdose overdose on you
they said i overdose overdose overdose on you
cause i want you close need you the most
without you im just through
so i overdose overdose overdose on you

verse 2
rushing me switching lanes
ivs all through my veins
blood tests say no cocaine
they dont know youre the blame
cause youre deep inside of me
so this is goodbye to me
but for you ill die happily
one more hit ill be free
you might also likechorus
cause i overdose overdose overdose on you
they said i overdose overdose overdose on you
cause i want you close need you the most
without you im just through
so i overdose overdose i overdose on you

bridge
cause i knew that you would kill me
cause im sweatin tweakin feenin
never been so high
but damn i love this feeling
cause im achin breakin shakin
will i make it through the night
and now my bodys cold
im losing it cause i was abusing it oh no
cant nobody help i did it to myself
and i swear ill do it again and again

chorus
i overdose overdose overdose on you
they said i overdose overdose overdose on you
cause i want you close need you the most
without you im just through
cause i overdose overdose overdose on youembed"
