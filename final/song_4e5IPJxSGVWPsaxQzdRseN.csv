us living as we do upsidedown
and the new word to have is revolution
people dont even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
because gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
the youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
digging paul revere and nat turner as the good guys
america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
the signs of truth were tattooed across our oftenentered vagina
we learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal
two long centuries buried in the musty vault
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
america was a bastard
the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom freedoom
democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother countrys crotch
what does webster say about soul
all i want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night
after all is said and done build a new route to china if theyll have you
who will survive in america
who will survive in america
who will survive in america
who will survive in america
