verse 1 drake
i got car money fresh start money
i want saudi money i want art money
i want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
and tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
yeah and lately i do bitches the meanest
tell em i love em and dont ever mean it
we go on dates i send the maybach out in neighborhoods
they never seen it
that shit is dangerous but its so convenient i aint lying
yeah and comfortable i sit
that manual ferrari italias some fly shit
its sitting at the house like i bought it in 96
cause honestly im too fucking busy to drive stick i swear
too fucking busy too busy fuckin
this nigga girl but to me she wasnt
been hot before they open doors for me preheated oven
im in this ho
but i aint finished though its been a minute though
my newest girl from back home got issues with parents
and some charges how the fuck can i get her to paris
luckily im the greatest my countrys ever seen
so chances are i get the border to issue me clearance
dreams money can buy
everybody yelled surprise i wasnt surprised
thats only cause i been waiting on it nigga
so fuck whoever hating on a nigga

verse 2 drake
food from india she in charlotte olympias
we talked music for hours she never mentioned ya
cant tell you how much i love when niggas think they got it
and i love the fact that line made em think about it
ymcmb
these niggas make it so hard to be friendly
when i know part of its envy
tryna fill the shoes nigga so far these are empty
i take em off in the house because the throw carpets are fendi
ooh i never seen the car you claim to drive
or shit i seen it you just aint inside
and i feel like lately it went from top five to remaining five
my favorite rappers either lost it or they aint alive
and they tryna bring us down me weezy and stunna
we stayed up christmas lights in the middle of summer
and if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
then ill probably give her my number
yeah i throw my dollars up high
and they land on the stage you dance on
we got company coming over
would it kill you to put some pants on
dreams money can buy
they told me its like a high and it wasnt a lie yeah
just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
and fuck whoever hating on a nigga
aw yeah
