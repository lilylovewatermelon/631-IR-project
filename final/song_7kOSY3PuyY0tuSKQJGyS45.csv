verse 1 danny odonoghue
evil comes from the top and it spreads right round
if you treat a man wrong hes gon pass it on down
to the next in line
whos probably his wife
bringing up his kids
now watch your momma cry
and they pick it up cause they learn everything
life has a funny way of going in a ring
end up growing up in trouble with the law
standing in the cuffs that the father once wore

prehook
now it seems that every brand new generation
have all been growing up with cracks in the foundation
theyre tryna fill the holes of a whole damn nation
thats lost its trust lost its trust
we gotta change it before the train leaves the station
and realize the revolution aint a revelation
it takes blood sweat tears innovation
it starts with us starts with us

verse 2 danny odonoghue
now were all just spokes working in a wheel
spinnin all around lifes cruel battlefield
draw a circle in the sand on a rainy day
wash it wash away
i bet it shows up on a sunny beach a thousand miles away
a flutter from a butterfly
cause a storm over half a million die
but we dont care cause were all desensitized
we dont realize
were putting all this shit before our childrens eyes

prehook

bridge mark sheehan
see the thing about karma is
she loves a bit of drama yeah
loves to hunt you down and pay you back for the things you did
before you turn a positive to a negative
better pray you know exactly who the fk youre dealing with
no this not a dress rehearsal
let me tell you kid
whatever you put out theres coming back again
years may burn
tables gonna turn
and karmas coming back around
either way youre gonna learn
to give love to your neighbor
love to yourself
it dont matter bout your status man
your health is your wealth
we can all point the finger
but theres four pointing back at yourself
ill be the bigger man now
give a little help
