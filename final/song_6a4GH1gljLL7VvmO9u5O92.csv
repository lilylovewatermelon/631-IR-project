ooh im paralyzed

verse 1
i see you drowning in the purple lights
diamonds shinin bright
i see every ice on you
you snatch my soul im crucified
i feel paralyzed
im so mesmerized by you by you

prechorus
but i know youre right for me
ecstasy
i keep coming back for more
i think that you would die for me
destiny
and this time i know for sure

chorus

dont let me down please
dont you break my heart dont break my heart
i dont know if i can take it anymore

i cant take another heartbreak or ill end it all
and the girl i used to love
we broke up in the club
and i almost died in the discotheque

i kept coming back for more
id rather you would die for me
destiny
and this time i know for sure

chorus

dont you break my heart dont break my heart
i dont know if i can take it anymore
dont break my heart dont you dont you
im falling apart already
dont you break my heart dont you dont you
i dont know if i can take it anymore

bridge
i believe the liquors talking
i just need the room to stop and
i could be the one you want
just as long as you dont break my heart
and i realized
when i kissed your neck
that the room is hot
i can taste your sweat
its just you and i
in the discotheque
but dont you worry
chorus
just dont break my heart dont break my heart
dont let me down please
dont you break my heart dont break my heart
i dont know if i can take it anymore
dont break my heart dont you dont you
im falling apart already
dont you break my heart dont you dont you
i dont know if i can take it anymore24embed"
