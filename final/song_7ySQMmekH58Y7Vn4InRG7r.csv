i miss your soft lips i miss your white sheets
i miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
and this is so hard cause i didnt see
that you were the love of my life and it kills me
i see your face in strangers on the street
i still say your name when im talkin in my sleep
and in the limelight i play it off fine
but i cant handle it when i turn off my nightlight

prechorus
ahahah
but i cant handle it when i turn off my nightlight
ahahah

chorus
they say that true love hurts well this could almost kill me
young love murder that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleepin alone lone
the life is fading from me while you watch my heart bleed
young love murder that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleepin alone lone

verse 2
remember the time we jumped the fence when
the stones were playin and we were too broke to get in
you held my hand and they made me cry while
i swore to god it was the best night of my life
or when you took me across the world we
promised that this would last forever but now i see
it was my past life a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing but each other til the sunrise
you might also likeprechorus
ahahah
drunk off of nothing but each other til the sunrise

chorus
they say that true love hurts well this could almost kill me
young love murder that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleepin alone lone
the life is fading from me while you watch my heart bleed
young love murder that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleepin alone lone

a beautiful time ohah
drunk off of nothing but each other til the sunrise

chorus
they say that true love hurts well this could almost kill me
