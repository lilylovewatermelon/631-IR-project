i judge by what shes wearing
just how many heads im tearing
off of assholes coming on to her
each night seems like its getting worse
and i wish shed take the night off
so i dont have to fight off
every asshole coming on to her
it happens every night she works
theyll go and ask the dj
find out just what would she say
if they all tried coming on to her
dont they know its never gonna work
they think theyll get inside her
with every drink they buy her
as they all try coming on to her
this time somebodys getting hurt
here comes the next contestant

chorus
is that your hand on my girlfriend
is that your hand
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
there goes the next contestant
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likeverse 2
i even fear the ladies
theyre cool but twice as crazy
just as bad for coming on to her
dont they know its never gonna work
each time she bats an eyelash
somebodys grabbing her ass
everyone keeps coming onto her
this time somebodys getting hurt
here comes the next contestant

chorus
is that your hand on my girlfriend
is that your hand
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
there goes the next contestant

bridge
im hating what shes wearing
everybody here keeps staring
cant wait till they get what they deserve
this time somebodys getting hurt
here comes the next contestant
chorus
is that your hand on my girlfriend
is that your hand
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
and i wish youd do it again
ill watch you leave here limping
and i wish youd do it again
each night seems like its getting worse
and i wish youd do it again
this time somebodys getting hurt
there goes the next contestant3embed"
