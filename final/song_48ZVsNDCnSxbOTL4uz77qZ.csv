the lake the snow
a winter lying next to you
the town a place that i go
to think about my time with you
so tell me why you left me there
assumed you know i care
tell me why you disappeared
could you could you

chorus
tell me you love me
and tell me its you i crave
say you believe in me
or dont say a word to me
tell me you love me
and tell me its you i crave
say you believe in me
or dont say a word to me
tell me you love me
tell me you love me

verse 2
the cave the stones
a fire by the lake with you
reminds a girl that i know
of all that i could give to you
so find me by the riverbed
behind the trees again
im standing by the waterfall
waiting for you for you
