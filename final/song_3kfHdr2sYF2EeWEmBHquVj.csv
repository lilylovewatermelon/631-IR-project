therell be girls across the nation
thatll eat this up babe
i know that its your soul but could you bottle it up and
get down to the heart of it
no its my heart youre shit out of your luck
dont make me tell you again my love love love love
love love love love
i am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
with her delicate soul
i dont claim to know much except soon as you start
to make room for the parts
that arent you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of
love love love love
love love love love

chorus
only thing i ever could need only one good thing
worth trying to be and its
love love love love
i do it for love
love love love

verse 2
we can understand the sentiment youre saying to us
oh but sensible sells could you kindly shut up
and get started
at keeping your part of the bargain
aw please little darlin
youre killing me sweetly with love love love love
love love love love

bridge
started as a flicker meant to be a flame
skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
still a baby in a cradle gotta take my first fall
babys getting next to nowhere with her back
against the wall
you meant to make me happy make me sad
wanna make it better better so bad
but save your resolutions for your never new year
there is only one solution i can see here

chorus
love youre all i ever could need
only one good thing worth trying to be
and its love love love love
i do it for love love love
only gonna get get what you give away
love love love love2embed"
