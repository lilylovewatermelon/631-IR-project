somewhere underneath the floorboard i will sweep my garden
underneath the cupboard lives a mouse and he discovered
there was nothing there nothing there
to discover

verse 2
falling from the sky there are raindrops in my eyes
and my thoughts are diggin in the backyard
my roots have grown but i dont know where they are
dont know where they are dont know where they are
my roots have grown but i dont know where they are

bridge
cats and dogs and rooster calls
telephones and pay phone stalls

outro
they take away the lonely days
for now
they take away the lonely days
for nowsee the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeembed"
