theres a black hole pulling me in
i slowly bend til i see the back of my own sins
i stole my soul from myself now i wonder
wonder is there somebody with a perfect plan
that goes boom when its stamped and we could understand
how the gods of old used to clap their hands to make thunder
so were clapping and were laughing like it was so absurd
in the future well be laughing at who we were right now
as man plays god with the land that he plunders
to the one unknown no one can know nor see
thats resistant to greed if we listen to
time after time time can never go under

chorus
theres this vine trying to climb
through the window into my life
i dont mind i dont mind
i dont mind
theres this wine trying to find
its way from the bottle into my mind
in my mind in my mind
in my mind

verse 2
and so this vine is trying to climb through the window into my life
to bring me symmetry and memories of a backlit breeze
back into a dream on the ground lookin up at the sun coming down
into a world of boys and girls are holding handheld devices
while theyre eating and theyre sleeping and theyre dreaming of the prices
well be paying down the line when the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine
and all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
they started wearing ones and zeros looking more and more like crooks
they stole the sunlight from the future took a sip drained half the glass and put it back
and a lot of people like to have a feast not so many could stomach the killing
lot of traffic on the streets so whos really doing all the drilling
keep on filling what can never be full
my imagination has got a hold on me

its way from the bottle into my mind
