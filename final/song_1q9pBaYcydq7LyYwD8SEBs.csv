i never thought that itd be easy
cause we both so distant now
and the walls are closing in on us and were wondering how
no one has a solid answer
but just walking in the dark
and you can see the look on my face it just tears me apart

prechorus
so we fight through the hurt
and we cry and cry and cry and cry
then we live and we learn
and we try and try and try and try

chorus
so its up to you and its up to me
that we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
down to earth down to earth
on our way back down to earth
back down to earth back down to earth
back down to earth back down to earth
back down to earth back down to earth
back down to earth back down to earth

so tell me why am i in tears

when theres no road to get to your heart
lets start over again
