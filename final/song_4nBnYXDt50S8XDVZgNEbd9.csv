i dont know why its hurting
hoping for just one sign in your eyes
that tells me you will be still

where can i go to find you
what must i do to feel you
always looking but too blind to see
you were there right by my side

say goodbye ill never forget
say goodbye i believe in the day
say goodbye our hearts could beat both together
cause we well find a way one day

what can i do to hold you
now that i know i love you
never found that our hearts felt the same
til the cold light of day stole our dreams

say goodbye ill never forget
say goodbye cause i believe in the day
say goodbye our hearts could beat both together
cause we well find a way

say goodbye ill never forget
say goodbye i believe in the day
say goodbye our hearts could beat both together
cause we well find a way
we will find a way
we will find a way
we will find a waysee bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
