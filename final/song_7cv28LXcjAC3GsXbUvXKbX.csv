at first i was afraid i was petrified
kept thinkin i could never live without you by my side
but then i spent so many nights thinkin how you did me wrong
and i grew strong and i learned how to get along

verse 1
and so youre back from outer space
i just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
i should have changed that stupid lock
i should have made you leave your key
if id have known for just one second youd be back to bother me

prechorus
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now cause youre not welcome anymore
werent you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
did you think id crumble did you think id lay down and die

chorus
oh no not i i will survive
oh as long as i know how to love i know im still alive
ive got all my life to live and ive got all my love to give
and ill survive i will survive hey hey

it took all the strength i had not to fall apart
just tryin hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
and i spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
i used to cry but now i hold my head up high
and you see me somebody new
im not that chained up little person still in love with you
and so you felt like droppin in and just expect me to be free
well now im saving all my lovin for someone whos lovin me

prechorus
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now cause youre not welcome anymore
werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
did you think id crumble did you think id lay down and die

chorus
oh no not i i will survive
oh as long as i know how to love i know im still alive
ive got all my life to live and ive got all my love to give
and ill survive i will survive oh

prechorus
go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now cause youre not welcome anymore
werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
did you think id crumble did you think id lay down and die
chorus
oh no not i i will survive
oh as long as i know how to love i know im still alive
ive got all my life to live and ive got all my love to give
and ill survive i will survive i will surviveembed"
