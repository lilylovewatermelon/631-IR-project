hey hey miss murder can i hey hey miss murder can i
make hey beauty stay if i take my life hoohoh

verse 1
with just a look they shook and heavens bowed before him
simply a look can break your heart
the stars that pierce the sky he left them all behind
we’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

chorus
hey hey miss murder can i hey hey miss murder can i
make hey beauty stay if i take my life hoohoh

verse 2
dreams of his crash won’t pass oh how they all adored him
beauty will last when spiraled down
the stars that mystify he left them all behind
and how his children cried he left us all behind

chorus
hey hey miss murder can i hey hey miss murder can i
make hey beauty stay if i take my life hoohoh

bridge
whats the hook the twist within this verbose mystery
i would gladly bet my life upon it
that the ghost you love your ray of light will fizzle out
without hope
were the empty set just floating through empty skin
ever searching for what we were promised
reaching for that golden ring wed never let go
but who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it
