watch the sunrise
say your goodbyes
off we go
some conversation
no contemplation
hit the road

verse 2
car overheats
jump out of my seat
on the side of the highway baby
our road is long
your hold is strong
please dont ever let go oh no

chorus
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant

verse 3
im driving fast now
dont think i know how to go slow
oh where you at now
i feel around
there you are
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeverse 4
cool these engines
calm these jets
i ask you how hot can it get
and as you wipe off beads of sweat
slowly you say im not there yet

chorus
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant

instrumental break

chorus
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cantembed"
