three nights at the motel
under streetlights in the city of palms
call me what you want when you want if you want
and you can call me names if you call me up
three nights at the motel
under streetlights in the city of palms
call me what you want when you want if you want
and you can call me names if you call me up

verse 1
feel like the least of all your problems
you can reach me if you wanna stay up tonight stay up at night
green lights in your body language
seems like you could use a little company from me
but if you got everything figured out like you say
dont waste a minute dont wait a minute
its only a matter of time for youoohoohooh tooohoohooh
tell me now cause ive been up for ive been up for

three nights at the motel
under streetlights in the city of palms
call me what you want when you want if you want

i cant fix each and all your problems
im no good with names and faces
she sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
i get my feelings involved she stopped returnin my calls
her flaws turned into walls and barricades
and im too far gone in all the wrong ways
and now every long day is a bad one
i cant make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
so i get lost in modern music watchin movies talkin to the walls in my room
walkin through the halls in my head just tryna make sure it all makes sense
i aint made of money maybe someday you can take it from me
im up too late thinkin bout you in mia for

three nights at the motel
under streetlights in the city of palms
call me what you want when you want if you want
and you can call me names if you call me up ooh59embed"
