verse 1
im with some hoes more realer than these niggas and thats a fact
im with my bros more triller than these bitches understand that
youngin from the slums and he dont wanna tote no pistol we aint heard of that
ima let him play it we coming from a pencil he dont know bout a trap nah
get trapped in fucking with these hoes she just want a baby
more deep into life he worried bout his goals she think its crazy
all through the night back to back hearin them poles this shit amazing
in his hood he dont see no greatness he gon grow or let it faze him
nigga fade him
got some ogs in the hood gon ride bout him
they like that he keep his head in them books so they wont let you slime bout him
police probably slide on him
only for to see if he got that fire on him
but youngin aint gettin that he aint feelin that
so he learned to hide on em
now let me tell you that im a different breed
had my first baby at 16 no plan b i had one dream
and it was something like luther king wanted for to keep the peace but couldnt
turned 17 fore you knew it me and ben was hopping from out of bushes
