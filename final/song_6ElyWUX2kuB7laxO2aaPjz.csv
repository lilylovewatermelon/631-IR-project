and i cant be too careful
theres nothing more gradual
than what i choose to show
and youve been patient with me alright
but does that end tonight

i will brave any trial by fire
but im just not ready
to fall through your thin ice
ill explain myself in time
but im just not ready
to make that sacrifice

but im trying like i said i might

these things are unusual for me
i should explain
no mind should have ever dreamt
of such fictitious pain

theres a story in there somewhere
but im not sure you care

i will brave any trial by fire
but im just not ready
to fall through your thin ice
ill explain myself in time
but im just not ready
to make that sacrifice
you might also likebut im trying like i said i might
but i dont trust this exercise
but im trying like i said i might

i might i might trust it this one time x4

but i dont trust this exercise

theres a story in there somewhere
but im not sure you care

i will brave any trial by fire
but im just not ready
to fall through your thin ice
ill explain myself in time
but im just not ready
to make that sacrifice

but im trying trying like i said i might
just like i said i might trying like i said i might
yeah im trying but i dont trust this exercise
just like i said i might just like i said i mightembed"
