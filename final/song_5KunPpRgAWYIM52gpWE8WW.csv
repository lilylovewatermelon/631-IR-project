my babys sweet talkin the cable man
while im a diggin around up here
sweatin my ass off in the attic
trying to find the rabbit ears
the screen doors off the hinges
and theres a flat tire on the olds
and this ge fridgerator aint keeping nothin froze

chorus
were falling apart together
well its another flashlight dinner in the dark
when times get hard
we just shake us on a little more salt and pepper
yeah the good thing is we might be falling apart
but were falling apart together

verse 2
well i got me some good friends that swing a hammer at a nail
but there aint no houses going up
aint no checks in the mail
well the gas tanks might be empty
but the tailgates still full
we pass a guitar and a bottle around
everybody take a pull
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likerepeat chorus

bridge

these days aint stayin forever
theyre gonna get better
but till they do

repeat chorusembed"
