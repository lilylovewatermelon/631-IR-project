her telephone rang bout a quarter to nine
she heard his voice on the other end of the line
she wondered what was wrong this time
she never knew what his calls might bring
with a cowboy like him it could be anything
and she always expected the worst in the back of her mind

verse 2
he said its cold out here and im all alone
i didnt make the short go again and im coming home
i know ive been away too long
i never got a chance to write or call
and i know this rodeo has been hard on us all
but ill be home soon and honey is there something wrong

chorus
she said dont bother coming home
by the time you get here ill be long gone
theres somebody new and he sure aint no rodeo man
he said im sorry its come down to this
theres so much about you that im gonna miss
but its alright baby if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
gotta go now baby if i hurry i can still make cheyenne

verse 3
he left that phone dangling off the hook
then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
then he just walked away
he aimed his truck toward that wyoming line
with a little luck he could still get there in time
and in that cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
she said dont bother coming home
by the time you get here ill be long gone
theres somebody new and he sure aint no rodeo man
he said im sorry its come down to this
theres so much about you that im gonna miss
but its alright baby if i hurry i can still make cheyenne
gotta go now baby if i hurry i can still make cheyenne2embed"
