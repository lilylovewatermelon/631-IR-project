verse 2 meek mill
okay your baby mama i bought that side chick i bought that
main chick i bought that and your dream girl just called back
i’m still repping that north side with that big p on my ballcap
these broke niggas don’t like me cause they say i think i’m all that
now coon cop that ‘rarri i don’t even feel salty
niggas claimin my flows i should put these niggas on maury
and i ain’t claiming these hoes have these haters looking all sorry
when i pulled up in that rolls swag was surfing on ‘em like gnarley
i’m with three hoes like santa claus and i’m the boss diana ross
hit you girl by mistake nigga wasn’t even in my plan at all
i told homie i hit it there this nigga wanna be playing it off
knowing that girl is main thang that shit don’t like nigga bang bang
