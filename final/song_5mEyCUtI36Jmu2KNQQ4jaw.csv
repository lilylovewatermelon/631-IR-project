run whirlwind run
further and further away into the sun
in twenty minutes
everyone will remember you when youre gone
and your heart is a stone
buried underneath your pretty clothes
dont you know people write songs
about girls like you

verse 2 thom powers
what will you do when something stops you
what will you say to the world
what will you be when it all comes crashing
down on you little girl
what would you do if you lost your beauty
how would you deal with the light
how would you feel if nobody chased you
what if it happened tonight

verse 3 thom powers
how would you cope if the world decided to
make you suffer for all that youre worth
how could you dance if noone was watching
and you couldnt even get off the floor
you might also likewhat would you do if you couldnt even feel
not even pitiful pain
how would you deal with the empty decisions
eating away at your days

chorus thom powers
dont you know people write songs about girls like you
about girls like you
about girls like you

dont you know people write songs about girls like you
about girls like you
about girls like you

bridge alisa xayalith
everything you say is fire
all the claims you lay you liar
everything you say is fire
see it in the grey you crier
