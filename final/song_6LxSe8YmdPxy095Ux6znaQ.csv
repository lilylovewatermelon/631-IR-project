i might be too strung out on compliments
overdosed on confidence
started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin the consequence
drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments
faded way too long im floatin in and out of consciousness
and they sayin im back id agree with that
i just take my time with all this shit i still believe in that
i had someone tell me i fell off ooh i needed that
and they want to see me pick back up well whered i leave it at
i know i exaggerated things now i got it like that
tuck my napkin in my shirt cause im just mobbin like that
you know good and well that you dont want a problem like that
you gon make someone around me catch a body like that
no dont do it ayy please dont do it ayy
cause one of us goes in and we all go through it ayy
and drizzy got the money so drizzy gon pay it
those my brothers i aint even gotta say it
thats just something they know

chorus
they know they know they know
they know they know they know
they know they know they know
yeah they know yeah
that the real is on the rise
fuck them other guys
i even gave em a chance to decide
now its something they know
they know they know they know yeah
see drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likeverse 2
i be yellin out money over everything money on my mind
then she wanna ask when it got so empty
tell her i apologize happened over time
she says they miss the old drake girl dont tempt me
if they dont get it theyll be over you
that new shit that you got is overdue
you better do what you supposed to do
im like why i gotta be all that
but still i cant deny the fact that its true
listening to you expressin all them feelings
soapopera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
and thats who you thinkin is bout to come and make a killin
i guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
you know that they aint even got it like that
you gon hype me up and make me catch a body like that
cause i live for this it isnt just a hobby like that
when they get my shit and play it i aint even gotta say it they know

chorus
they know they know they know
they know they know they know
they know they know they know
yeah they know yeah
that the real is on the rise
fuck them other guys
i even gave em a chance to decide
now its something they know
they know they know they know
outro
i be yellin out money over everything money on my mind

they know they know they know
they know they know they know
