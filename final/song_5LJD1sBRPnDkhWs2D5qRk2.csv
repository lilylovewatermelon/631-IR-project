you wouldnt do that tyler kill yourself or anyone you dont you dont even have the balls to begin with what you need is me someone to talk to uh its been a while since our last session so tell me whats been going on

verse 1
im not a fucking role model i know this
im a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
since kanye tweeted tellin people hes bumpin all of my shit
these motherfuckers think im sposed to live up to something shit
im still jackin off and proceedin my life careless
but getting more pussy cause i tell bitches im wood harris as you should
philly to paris im getting these weird stares
at skateparks and airports all in a year its weird
yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
he still hasnt called me yet thats not your fault
but thats a whole fucking different argument shit i got over it
and a couple bucks in my pocket so now i could go buy
a couple hot pockets and grandma could stop cooking
them nasty ass collard greens pressures on me like this top hat
bastard intro how the fuck im gonna top that

interlude tyler the creator tyler the creator as dr tc
tyler youll top it youll top that youre a very capable individual
okay you guys caught me im not a fucking rapist or serial killer i lied
you know you just want attention youll be fine
i try too hard huh
no you dont

made a couple thou and i just dont know what to buy yet
the preme shit is free and i dont drink so fuck a wine set
nigga fuck a mindset my brain is an obscenity
im fucked in the head i lost my mind with my virginity
oh thats a triple three six isnt he a devil worshiper
cause im too fucking ignorant to do some research
im the star of the group yeah
so no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
bastard was good though what you think i record it for
to have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore
like i didnt make parade or inglorious
cause im too scared to tell my friends the way i really fucking feel
of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin off
in the tombs of lara croft im getting pissed off i bet
message boards are on my dick i need a pissing waiver here
let me bust one in they mouth i know they full of flavor

interlude tyler the creator tyler the creator as dr tc
cant they just be happy for me like a kid with nothing living out his dreams why they got to fucking hate
i think everyones happy everyones immature everyone loves you tyler you have to believe that
i dont even skate anymore im too fucking busy i can barely kickflip now
why why is that do you not have any free time when youre at  home
what the fuck you mean im not talented you see the shit that ive been doing
i have i mean youre a great person
i mean im not that great of a rapper but as a whole im pretty cool right
verse 3
people excited thinking shit is so tight for what
getting cosigns from rappers that i dont even like
what the fuck you want me to do start to gobble his mic
and start jackson him off until his cack blasting off no
fuck that yeah these niggas aint fucking with me
cause i dont listen to the immortal of techofthenique
and all this underground bullshit thats never gon peak
on the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
id rather listen to badu and pusha the t
and some waka flocka flame instead i love that shit of that real hip hop
thats bullofthesheet but they want to critique
everything that we wolf gang has ever released
but they dont get it they dont its not made for them cause its not made for them
the nigga thats in the mirror rapping its made for him
but they do not have the mindset thats same as him
im not weird youre just a faggot shame on him

interlude tyler the creator tyler the creator as dr tc
it is but tyler youre going to have to cut down on that faggot word thats very thats a bad
im not homophobic
i mean i dont think you are but
faggot
alright well since the last time we
the fuck is a good performance i get on stage and i have as much fun as i can
i mean you you it seems like you have fun but your twitter posts just i mean theyre really random and its add
who doesnt have add well i dont
i mean sometimes you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know whats the problem for this
i wish thebe was here
verse 4
therapys been sinning and niggas getting offended
they dont want to fuck with me cause i do not fuck with religion
you see thats my decision you fuckers dont have to listen
here put this middle finger in your ear id rather not
when someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed what his ak47
at 47 kids i dont wanna see my name mentioned
i dont think anyones going to menâ€”i dont think anyone takes you serious enough to believe you
college wasnt working and i wasnt working
so i was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
but i was determined to be great so those classes can wait
cause the four days that i went i wasnt learning shit i mean you
now im living dreams that i wanted since eight
and can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
i mean youve explained to me that you were in school but i mean i
they claim the shit i say is just wrong
like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
im just a teenager who admits hes suicide prone
my life is doing pretty good so that date is postponed for now
wow lifes a cute bitch full of estrogen
and when she gives you lemons nigga throw em at pedestrians
so what are you saying take advantage
i mean youve been doing pretty good ive seen that
i still live in my grandmas house
sell out a fucking show in london just to end up on couches
i hate my fucking life but when i make that announcement
my hero calls my phone just to put that in doubt then
and then i am confused if i want in or just out
my friends really think im playing when i say i need counseling
i sit in grandmothers living room and just pout
and shout loud inside sometimes i just want to die no you dont
odd future came from the bottom
and its gon take a couple armed armies tryna stop em
i believe you all you fucking lames dont have to like me yeah
the devil doesnt wear prada im clearly in a fucking white tee

outro tyler the creator as dr tc
whoa umm alright uh so you was telling me you went to new york50embed"
