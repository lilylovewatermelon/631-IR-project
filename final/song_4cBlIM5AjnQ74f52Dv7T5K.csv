yeah look
i dont do drugs im addicted to the pain though
yeah i been on it for a while dunno how to put it down
gotta have it its a habit ima break though
i just wanna take a hit keep sayin ima quit
keep sayin ima leave but i stay though
i just want a little fix i dont wanna take a risk
i dont like it when i drift from the safe zone
but lately i been thinkin ima have to
lettin go of things that im attached to
world dont stop just because im in a bad mood
you dont know what love is til you holdin onto somethin that you cant lose
that’s why im tryna get it together
sleeves up puttin work in tryna be better
i like to rap but i aint gon do it forever
forget the charts ive been focusin on holdin my head up
moment i get up i just wanna know im doin my best
and if im not lord forgive me you can have the regrets
cause i can feel the water tryna go up over my head
most of my life i always felt like i was holdin my breath
holdin my chest to be honest so im tired of it
lookin for somethin in my life to be inspired again
i like to walk around and act like i dont know what it is
but i know what it is i just never wanna commit

runnin from change
im lookin for change
im searchin for change
im lookin for change
i just want i just want change

verse 2
yeah i dont like new things
got a lot of mood swings
oh you wanna tell me somethin negative
i dont wanna hear what you think
yeah tossin in my sleep
every night for like two weeks
thinkin bout how i could have done this or done that better
cant help it thats just me
lies thats me avoidin the change
yeah thats probably why the issues aint goin away
yeah thats probably why i always sit around and complain
tellin myself that i aint never gettin out of this place
out of my face if you tellin me i need to be different
thats the issue though im always insecuritydriven
takin the wrong turns actin like i know where im headed
waitin for somethin bad to happen i can snap any minute
i need change
yeah thats kinda easy to say right
but difficult to do when i feel like i hate life
and everyone around me kinda thinks im a great guy
but i dont ever think it so i think im a fake liar
change
its somethin that i know i should do
im a little uncomfortable to tell you the truth
but to be honest with you lately i got nothin to lose
see ive always been full of pain but now im makin some room
chorus
lookin for change
im lookin for change
im searchin for change
im lookin for change
i just want i just want—

verse 3
i need a moment of silence
i dont like change but ill try it
i dont wanna hear what i should or i shouldnt do
why are they always defiant
see all my emotions are liars
all my emotions are violent
they dont want freedom to find me
mention the name and everybody riots change
yeah thats why im checkin my vitals
they keep on workin but i know
breathin dont mean youre alive so
i bag up all of my trash and walk out on my tightrope
positive thoughts are my rivals change
im tryna be on their side though
should i feel comfortable i dont
last year i felt suicidal
this year i might do somethin different like talkin to god more
chorus
