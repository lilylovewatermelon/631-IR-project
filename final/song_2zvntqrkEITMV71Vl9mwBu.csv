ive heard all the stories of you back in your prime
how you held all your pride in hands stained
and youd go to work for breadcrumbs and dirt
so your kids could stand tall in their name
and youd told me son there are things to be done when youre older and stronger like me
you give all you have just to be a good dad
and youll die a thousand times just to please

chorus
n old man the blood that youve bled
and the mouths that you fed at your door
n old man the sweat that youve poured
proves that they dont make em you no more
n old man the dinners youve missed
so your daughters could eat at this table
n old man i would give back all the things that youve lacked if is able

verse 2
ive never seen you smile like you did out in pineville
when the crowd screamed the words of your kid
and you told me boy its been a long hard road in this life that ive chose for my kin
and i wish and i pray i could go back in time so i could raise up this family again

chorus
n old man the blood that youve bled
and the mouths that you fed at your door
n old man the sweat that youve poured
proves that they dont make em you no more
n old man the dinners youve missed
so your daughters could eat at this table
n old man i would give back all the things that youve lacked if is able
