got an attitude
thinking that hes always right
blowing smoke rings
making me want to fight
and then i look back
at all things ive ever done
and then i look up
seeing that hes on the run x2

verse 2
its a big thing
everything your heart desires
and now i have to
try and outdo the fight
i caught a big break
when playing in the role
i saw you laughing
even though you know its so x2
even when youre on the run
even though you know its so

outrorepeat until fade
seeing that hes on the run
even though you know its sosee kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also like2embed"
