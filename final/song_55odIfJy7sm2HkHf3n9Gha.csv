lost in the flames of love
unrequited love
time wont always heal
and it eats at my mind
because youre the one that got away

chorus
ive been searching high and low wondering where my feelings go
nothing feels the same cause theres no one like you
no one like you
and even though youre far away even if my time decays
nothing feels quite the same youre the one that got away
unrequited love

verse 2
sometimes i feel alone
tried to hold my breath
somewhere deep in space
and i felt like you understood
what it truly means to be in love

chorus
baby youre the one the one that got away
this is what it feels like to have regrets
it is what it is
now im wide open its so hard to focus
now that its the end i guess youll always be
the one that got awaysee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like8embed"
