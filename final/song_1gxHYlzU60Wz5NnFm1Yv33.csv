here we go
ooh
here we go

danny odonoghue
up in the bar all smoking cigars
while we were drinking irish whiskey straight from the jar
talking bout them better days theyre not that far
whoevers coming back to mine you better bring the guitar
you play a sad song
yeah sing it from the heart
tell a sad story
yeah tell it from the start
pass me on the pain that you made into art
yeah pierce it through my skin like a heroin dart when
someones strumming on the strings
and theyre spitting things
everybodys moving grooving vibes while the other sings
they gon kill you with their passion and the soul
when the first verse drops youll be fighting back the tears and all
while another mans crying in his beers and all
while his womans saying cheers to it all
aint no shame in the game
just the way you were raised
to always sing about better days better days

and watch us march along
