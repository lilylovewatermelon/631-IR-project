maybe my mind is playing tricks on me but i couldve sworn
that the kiss that was meant truly for me is leaving me torn
how can love be so kind and so gentle then turn and be so cold
and why must my arms feel so empty for what my heart still holds

chorus
mary how could you go
around and hurt me so
ive tried so hard to please you baby
but i just cant seem to baby
mary how could you go
around and hurt me so
ive tried so hard to please you baby
but i just cant seem to baby

verse 2
now was there something i couldve done to change this outcome here
as if i blinked my eyes and suddenly she up and disappeared
how can love escape your grasp without you ever letting go
and until she returns to my offer i may never know

chorus
mary how could you go
around and hurt me so
ive tried so hard to please you baby
but i just cant seem to baby
mary how could you go
around and hurt me so
ive tried so hard to please you baby
but i just cant seem to baby
