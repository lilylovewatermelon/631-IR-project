verse 1 pitbull
im like a quarterback i got options
but i play the point in school
broke ankles more than a few
broke hearts yeah that too
twenty years later same movie same script
same player more chips
more women more haters
different toilet same shh
why get caught up in emotions
why go through the same motions
in a sick way she loves to see me mad
it gets her wetter than the ocean
shes a good girl gone bad
but bad girls dont like good guys
now tell me if you think im a good guy
thats what i though ha lets ride

chorus inna
all the things you do all the things you say
playin with my heart so i can run away
all the things you did all the things you said to me
said to me said
now im lonely in my bed
all the things you do all the things you say
playin with my heart so i can run away
all the things you did all the things you said to me
said to me said
now im lonely in my bed

they act hard but they got soft hearts
and i know their soft spots
i meet em i greet em i train em
and show em all about hard knox
listen next thing you know next thing you know
they holding the fort down like fort knox
then they fall in love and make everything seem what its not
damn
these are called rules of engagement
welcome to the world of entertainment
they dont want a man like rayman
they want a man thats duck in the raymonds
i know its ironic
but the good girls love bad guys
now tell me do you think im a good guy
thats what i though now lets ride

chorus inna
all the things you do all the things you say
playin with my heart so i can run away
all the things you did all the things you said to me
said to me said
now im lonely in my bed
all the things you do all the things you say
playin with my heart so i can run away
all the things you did all the things you said to me
said to me said
now im lonely in my bed
