baby if your dream is forty acres and a house
porch going all the way around
ima buy it
or if youd rather see
city lights and a crowd

prechorus
ima move you uptown
it dont matter to me
nah it dont girl
baby i can see me livin anywhere with you so

chorus
til the sky falls and the good lord calls us up
youre the only girl i wanna love
til im pushing up daisies
wanna stare into your green eyes baby
til were handinhand walking down them streets of gold
six feet below you know
im gonna make your world a better place
til were both in a better place

verse 2
if all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
well baby thats fine with me
you look good in anything
aw but girl i swear
if you wanna hit the town in a dress turn a few heads
i aint gonna stop you
baby i got you oh
