i wrote this letter to remind myself the reasons im alive
i got to reason number five
with my pen i wrote on and i tried
to find words that described all the times
i caught myself and realised there are good things just ahead of me
but right now it gets hard to believe
but i know that im safe when i leave

chorus
and you cant speak to me
and when i cant receive
the words i know you mean
nothing can sеt me free

verse 2
and i was broken but a little part of mе thinks that im glad
i can go through things that make me sad
its the only time off that ive had
any more then i start to go mad
reason that i had at number one was i liked to
know the feeling well of being loved then number two
i like the feeling of becoming numb i cant choose
which one i prefer because you cant

chorus
speak to me
and when i cannot receive
the words i know you mean
nothing can set me free its better you leave me be
