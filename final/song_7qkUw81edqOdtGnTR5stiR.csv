well the weatherman said it might storm today
i gotta hit the field gotta bail some hay
and i cant let it rain on my daddys farm
til i get it all stacked up high in the barn
and im gonna call my baby shes been waiting on me yeah
she lives down town on sycamore street
and the wheels on the blacktop are startin to whine
as i pass that oklahoma city limit sign

chorus
im a hayseed and a plow boy
im a farm kid and a cowboy
im a roughneck daddy was a roughneck too woah
i run around with hillbilly girls
when the weekend sets on our hillbilly world
you better be ready when the sun goes down
thats when country comes to town

verse 2
well her daddy said child better let him be
well i dont like him and he sure dont like me
her mama just says yall have a little fun
said aint doing nothing me and papa aint done
and i open up the door to my pickup truck
and my baby jumps in and she fires it up
and she gives me a kiss as i crawl in
weve been waiting all week for a weekend
