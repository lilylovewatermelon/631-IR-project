i wonder how you sleep
i wonder what you think of me
if i could go back
would you have ever been with me
i want you to be uneased
i want you to remember
i want you to believe in me
i want you on my side

chorus
come on and lay it down
ive always been with you
here and now
give all thats within you
be my savior
and ill be your downfall

verse 2
here we go again
ashamed of being broken in

i wanna get you back again
i want you to trouble me
i wanted you to linger
i want you to agree with me
i want so much so bad
