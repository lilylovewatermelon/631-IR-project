verse 1 mf doom
villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
wont stop rockin til he clocked in a gazillion grand
tillin the wasteland sands
raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin fan
he rest when hes ashes
ask em after ten miles in his galoshes smashes stashes
chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
a clip a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
they supposed to know it show when his aura glow
get from out the row when he get dough its horrible
time is money spend waste save invest the fess
for ten ks hell cave a chicken chest s
yes yall the dub will get you trickles
the best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
but tuttut he bout to change the price again
it go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
villain here have em shrillin in fear
and wont stop top illin til he a gazillionaire
grillin stare yeah your boy had drama
got em on a mental plane avoided bad karma
once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
plus a brandnew chrome smoker with the triggers broke
i thought i told em firing pins was separate
he find out later when he tries to go and rep it
took a jehovah money for a arabic torah
charged in advance to translate it and ignored her sorta
one monkey dont stop no slaughter
a junkie wanna cop a quarterton run for the border
know the drill it aint worth the overkill
flow skill still theres no thrill
fill a billion 10k bills in his pillow
villain when it gets realer split the skrilla with—

verse 2 mf doom
dilla dilla mix mix mix
do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
sketch lyric bet your bottom nick on some vic
ick from the drumstick come with the dumb schtick
sick slick hidden in a book
the only way they find it if its spittin in a hook
listen dont look now keep walkin
traded three beans for this cow cheap talkin
hawk men stalkin hear that we hawkin often
coughin to a coffin might as well scoff the pork then
hes like worf some say stronger though
off the top jay strongbow play along bro
wear a mask like yo off the gong show
flow slow as mongo don juan thong pro
for ya info when hes not practicin jim crow
or actressing some nympho bimbo
hes playin ray j the old tape
doom—well what can i say like jj in a gold cape
fill it to the rim like brim
villain and ya wont find him in no gym
probably a foggy bog with the frogs
with a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
half cocked and half baked
used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shake
my mistake sign a track agreement
for more gs than lines and cracks in the cement
in any event its fake like wrestlin
get em like jake the snake on mescalines
ahem—elixir for the dry throat
tried to hit the high note villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
by remote send in the meat wagon
braggin mcs packed in with they feets draggin
these stats are staggerin
had his phd in indiscreet street hagglin
part 3

verse 3
villain his agenda is clear
endin this year with dividends to spare here
its not meant for the seein
went through the ceilin after enterin his center bein
a new meanin to sales through the roof
guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth proof
its the return of the tramp
who do a duet jam when ernest goes to camp
for the right earn namean like vern
we need some more oil for the machines to burn learn
jiminy crickets
he gets lucky like winnin free tickets off sickly lyrics
one mans waste is another mans soap
sons fanbase know the brothermans dope
a real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
and the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
he wears a mask so the charge wont grab
on a rooftop with a large stone slab
heads up talk white and thought niggerish
refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
black licorice and equally as yucky
how he handled the money was strictly dan stuckie
monkey hustle man on fire
later for the date than the hadron collider
and cost more it be seemin like a style
doom leave the competition steamin like a pile
smile ding sparklin jewels
in effect like alternate side of the street parkin rules
fools the roach was never dead
live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
instead it was depicted as flicked in
split the wigs lit can you dig it
outro
we have got to try and find doom
good luck26embed"
