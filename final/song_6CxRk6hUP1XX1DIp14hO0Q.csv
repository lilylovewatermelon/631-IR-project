im on my own and the road is long
ill do what it takes
just finding a place
where i belong

verse 1
being down not out
being lost not found
no words no sound
on this lonely track
the wind can roll
the storm can rage
its all the same
im not turning back

verse 2
overnight things can change always
im on my own and the road is long
ill do what it takes
just finding a place
where i belong
dusty tracks kicking on and on
not a coin to my name
just finding a place
where i belong

no chains to break
no walls to climb
just space and time waiting for me
no cares no fares
no shame no pride
just stars to guide where i need to be

over night things can change always

chorus
im on my own and the road is long
ill do what it takes
just finding a place
where i belong
dusty tracks kicking off and on
not a coin to my name
just finding a place
where i belong
where i belong
where i belong

chorus
im on my own and the road is long
ill do what it takes
just finding a place
dusty tracks kicking on and on
not a coin to my name
just finding a place
where i belong
outro
im on my own where i belong
and the road is long where i belong
ill do what it takes where i belong
just finding a place where i belong
dusty tracks where i belong kicking on and on where i belong
not a coin to my name where i belong
just finding a place
where i belong1embed"
