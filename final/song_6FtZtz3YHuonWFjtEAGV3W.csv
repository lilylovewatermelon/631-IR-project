im goin out on an afternoon vacation
they all know where im gonna go

the sun is shinin down and
theres no one else around now
i wish you were here to hear me say
this is gonna be my greatest day

how far would i go
how long would i stay
to see it all
to carry it all back with me again
how hard would i try
just to hear everybody say
this is gonna be my greatest day

standin here lookin out on the world
for a second nobodys lookin back at me
i never even notice where they go

the sun is shinin down and
theres no one else around now
i wish you were here to hear me say
this is gonna be my greatest day

just to carry it back with me again
