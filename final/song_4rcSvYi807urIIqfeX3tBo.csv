its not the waking its the rising
it is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
its not forgoing of the lie
its not the opening of eyes
its not the waking its the rising
its not the shade we should be past it
its the light and its the obstacle that casts it
its the heat that drives the light
its the fire it ignites
its not the waking its the rising
its not the song it is the singing
its the hearing of a human spirit ringing
it is the bringing of the line
it is the bearing of the rhyme
its not the waking its the rising

its not the wall but whats behind it
oh the fear of fellow man his mere assignment
and everything that were denied
by keeping the divide
its not the waking its the rising

and i could cry power
power has been cried by those stronger than me
straight into the face that tells you to
rattle your chains if you love being free
