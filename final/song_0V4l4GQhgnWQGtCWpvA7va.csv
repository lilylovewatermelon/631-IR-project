verse 1 the weeknd
take your nose off my keyboard

theres a room full of niggas
what you following me for
this aint no fuckin singalong

got my whole crew blowin like a c4
twenty keep the bar rollin
fake ids in the trash we goin
straight to the top rooftop glows
with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
brain so poisoned rainbows flowin
lightskinned chick first flight from poland
a whole lotta friends first flight from poland
a whole lotta cash comin straight from poland

smokin weed under star projectors
i guess well never know where harvard gets us
but seein my family have it all
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
and really i think i like who im becoming
theres times where i might do it just to do it like its nothing
theres times where i might blow like 50k on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
all it took was patience
i got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
the same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
the realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
i told my story and made history
tell them ima need reservations for twenty
ive never really been one for the preservation of money nah
id much rather spend it all while im breathin
that ovo and that xo is everything you believe in i know

chorus the weeknd
they loving the crew
