i want to hypnotize you baby on the telephone
so many times i called your house just to hear the tone
and though i knew that you werent home
i didnt mind so much cause im so alone
i want to hypnotize you baby on the telephone

verse 2
i want to spin my little watch right before your eyes
youre the kind of girl a guy like me could hypnotize
and if this comes as a surprise
just think of all those guys that would tell you lies
i want to spin my little watch right before your eyes

instrumental

verse 3
i want to hold your little hand if i can be so bold
and be your right hand man til your hands get old
then when all the feelings gone
just decide if you want to keep holding on
i want to hold your little hand if i can be so bold
