uh uh uh uhuh uh yeah like

verse 1 the weeknd
i ran out of tears when i was eighteen
so nobody made me but the main streets
cause too many people think they made me
well if they really made me then replace me
homeless to forbes list these niggas bring no stress
i feel like moses i feel like im chosen
and if you aint my nigga then your girl single to me
i dont give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
grew up with no father so nobody ever son me
my flow too sick kevin costner couldnt touch me
i know you wish that nobody ever love me
i feel useless when im never makin money ah
well this the life we always fantasized
rich folk problem through a queen street niggas eyes
every time you see me pullin up in aventadors
just know we been grindin on them sidewalks

chorus the weeknd
sidewalks saved my life
they dont ever lie
sidewalks saved my life
they show me all the signs

verse 2 kendrick lamar
say say say
i come from murder one brung late night melee
say say say
we hung all summer sprung mattress with bae bae
say say say
trippin off dyke and my name strike with pay day
say say say
flippin blue lightnin tightenin strapped with ak
say say say
og one told me one show me one eight ways
how to segue
pussy power profit and headache
i reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
or life intimate with fame
light limo tint with light women dark women in it
aw kenny good game
she wanna hang with a starboy
the sun and the moon and star boy
astronomer anonymous
i line em up we grind em up theres nine of us
and five of us have probably fucked
she mollied up i tallied up all the parts boy
twenty legs arms head head
head head more head head
oh god bless the dead yup
im livin life high off life
i wear my chokes off to bed
im the greatest nigga why you scared to say it
i wanna rock i wanna rock
i wanna cop more land i never stop
i wanna quick advance on a bill if it aint one
break everything im a hustler came from
chorus the weeknd
sidewalks saved my life sidewalks saved my life
they dont ever lie
sidewalks saved my life sidewalks saved my life
they show me all the signs

they dont let me down
but they lead me on
and they dont let me down
but they lead me on
