mans becoming more corrupt now
godless wicked and cruel
the soulless man stood silenced
marys words rang so true
chastisement worse than the flood
spread the word its all through
dont kill the messenger cause
as if we havent swam enough in this life of misery

chorus 1
voice your prophecy shed us some light
feel sorrow for mankinds chance to survive
swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
a stab in the dark but it wounded our will

we wont be here tomorrow
hold on to me for one last time

verse 2
weve grown into the numbers
six hundred sixty six
war breaks a sign of the end
eternally expelled
look to the sky for knowledge
the stars align tonight
eclipse and heaven shall fall
now i know ive seen it all in my life of misery
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus 2
voice your prophecy shed us some light
feel sorrow for mankinds chance to survive
swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
a stab in the dark but it wounded our will
dust the apple off savor each bite
and deep inside you know adam was right
lust and power indulgence no fear
left with his sins how does this end

we wont be here tomorrow
hold on to me for one last time

bridge
as the prophets shed the light
on whats to come the crowds did gather
your time is precious they explained
no time to worry messiahs coming
dont go to sleep tonight darling
hold me in your arms
these will be our final days
and i cant let go

walls are falling
churches burning
women ravaged
children crying
flesh is tearing
some still fighting in this world of misery
chorus 2
voice your prophecy shed us some light
feel sorrow for mankinds chance to survive
swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
a stab in the dark but it wounded our will
dust the apple off savor each bite
and deep inside you know adam was right
lust and power indulgence no fear
left with his sins how does this end

we wont be here tomorrow
hold on to me for one last time1embed"
