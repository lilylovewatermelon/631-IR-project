we drove all night until you started to cry
because you saw a world without you and i
told me where your problems lie
but i cant solve em
yeah we gotta give it time
guess thats my problem

chorus
i see you loving on the sidelines
i think about it at the wrong times
i see you loving on the sidelines
i dont wanna know
who youll be taking with you tonight

verse 2
i know i drew the line
can we erase it
were living in denial
but we can change this
and i drove all night until i started to cry
all because i saw a world without you and i
dont let this conversation die

chorus
i see you loving on the sidelines
i think about it at the wrong times
i see you loving on the sidelines
i dont wanna know
who youll be taking with you tonight

youve turned into
someone that i never knew
