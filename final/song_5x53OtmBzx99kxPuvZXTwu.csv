people say love comes and goes but
they dont understand what they dont know
cause what i feel starts deep inside
its planted like a seed that springs into life

prechorus 1
they say its not right and we move too fast
but they dont know the meaning of what we have

chorus
wherever it is ill fly
whatever it takes ill try
so dont pay no mind to what other people say
whenever it is in my life know that i will be on time
cause you know why theres no standing in our way

verse 2
when youre far and were apart
im really missing you i wanna be where you are

prechorus 2
they say its not right and it wont last
they never would believe in what we have

chorus
wherever it is ill fly
whatever it takes ill try
so dont pay no mind to what other people say
whenever it is in my life know that i will be on time
cause you know why theres no standing in our way
you might also likebridge
and if youre lost ill come and find you
cause without you ill break down and cry
and you know i i wanna surround you
with all my love

interlude
is ill fly  takes ill try
baby dont pay no mind
pay no mind to what other people say
it is in my life be on time
you know ill be on time
you know why theres no standing in our way

chorus
wherever it is ill fly
whatever it takes ill try
so dont pay no mind to what other people say
whenever it is in my life know that i will be on time
cause you know why theres no standing in our way1embed"
