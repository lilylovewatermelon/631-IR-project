okay so you just
go around breaking hearts just to see what is inside
go around stealing them feeding them to your pride
did you ever stop and think that i might really need that
to stay alive
im starting to believe that you dont really see that
i had given you my life oh yeah

prechorus
but its okay im gonna find my way
but as for you i dont know what to say
if you dont learn youll never know a good thing
youll never know a good thing

chorus
you will never know you will never know no good
never know a good thing
you will never know no
you will never know you will never know no good
never know never know
you will never know no
you will never know you will never know no good
you will never know no
you will never know you will never know no good
you will never know

cause it will all come back around one day
