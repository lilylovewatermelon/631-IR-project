scratchin for my meat
i have been kicked in my teeth
till the blood run hot and sweet

i seen a lot of living my friend
and this i will repeat
just because you knock a man down
dont mean that you got hime beat

its a shameshameshame
baby its a cryin shame

henry nearly killed me
fore they hauled his ass in jail
slapped me right across my face
with a flour sack full o nails

nearly broke my head in two
with his steeltoed boots
shovin all that money
down the laundry chute

its a shameshameshame
baby its a cryin shame

with her makeup all a mess
picks herself up off the floor
coughs and straightens her dress

somehow this town dont feel like home anymore

its a shameshameshame
baby its a cryin shame

ive seen a lot of living my friend
and this i will repeat
just because you knock a man down
dont mean you got him beatembed"
