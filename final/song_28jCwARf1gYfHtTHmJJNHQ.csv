i have never known peace
like the damp grass that yields to me
i have never known hunger
like these insects that feast on me
a thousand teeth
and yours among them i know
our hungers appeased
our heartbeats becoming slow

prechorus both karen cowley hozier
we lay here for years or for hours
thrown here or found to freeze or to thaw
so long wed become the flowers
two corpses we were two corpses i saw

chorus karen cowley  hozier
and theyd find us in a week
when the weather gets hot
after the insects have made their claim
id be home with you id be home with you

verse 2 karen cowley
i have never known sleep
like this slumber that creeps to me
i have never known colour
like this morning reveals to me
and you havent moved an inch
such that i would not know
if you sleep always like this
the flesh calmly going cold

we lay here for years or for hours
your hand in my hand so still and discreet
so long wed become the flowers
wed feed well the land and worry the sheep

chorus karen cowley  hozier
theyd find us in a week
when the cattle show fear
after the insects have made their claim
after the foxes have known our taste
id be home with you id be home with you

bridge  karen cowley hozier
theyd find us in a week we lay here for years or for hours
when the weather gets hot so long wed become the flowers
theyd find us in a week we lay here for years or for hours
when the cattle show fear so long wed become the flowers

chorus karen cowley  hozier
and theyd find us in a week
when the buzzards get loud
after the insects have made their claim
after the foxes have known our taste

outro karen cowley  hozier
after the raven has had his say
id be home with you id be home with you
id be home with you id be home with you
id be home with you id be home with you32embed"
