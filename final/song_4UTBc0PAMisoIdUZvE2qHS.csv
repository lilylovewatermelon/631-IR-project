any chance you get to play the wornout pity card
any opportunity to push my buttons hard
its gettin old your poor me thoughts
believe me boy when i say so what
this broken record thing has got to stop
im losing interest in your pillow talk

prechorus
and ooh its not looking good
and ooh im not in the mood
and ooh i cant get through
to you you

chorus
dont be a girl about it cause i didnt say yes
dont be a girl about it cause i wouldnt pretend
dont be a girl about it and now youre whining again
dont be a girl about it youre such a girl about it

verse 2
now youre up in arms because i say were not working out
you wonder if i loved you from the start well ill tell you what
i knew a guy who changed my world
and then he grew into a little girl
this metamorphosis is just too much
youre crossing lines that i just cant let go of

i guess its true that love can grow in different directions
i chose the high road and you chose to be a girl
well i know youre mad at me now
and its all my fault somehow
here comes my favorite part
youre so misunderstood
