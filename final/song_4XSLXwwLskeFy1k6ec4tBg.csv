i need an altitude adjustment
get higher and higher til i feel nothing
blue mountain air and good clean loving
and i need an altitude adjustment

verse 1
jammed up again in the music city
damn im gonna sit here and write your diddies
im backing up my six string dreams and heading out west
this big city pills a little hard to swallow
turning this steering wheel to colorado
then this rocky mountain highs put this tennessee blues to rest

chorus
i need an altitude adjustment
get higher and higher til i feel nothing
cold mountain air and good clean loving
i need an altitude adjustment
and i wanna feel just like john denver
all of my worries i cant remember
out here in boulder i cant get busted
i need an altitude adjustment

verse 2
ill be down in durango just doing my thing
go hitch a ride to tell you right where i know the lingo
found a dreamboat in steamboat and black diamond fresh powder queen
i asked for a dime and she gave me a dozen
im in grand junction and i can barely function
the sky is baby blue and the grass is green if you know what i mean

i need an altitude adjustment
get higher and higher til i feel nothing
cold mountain air and good clean loving
i need an altitude adjustment
i wanna feel just like john denver
all of my worries i cant remember
out here in boulder i wont get busted
i need an altitude adjustment

lets go boys

i need an altitude adjustment
get higher and higher til i feel nothing
cold mountain air and good clean loving
i need an altitude adjustment
i wanna feel just like john denver
all of my worries i cant remember
mountain border i wont get busted
i need an altitude adjustment
down in bolder i cant get busted
i need an altitude adjustmentembed"
