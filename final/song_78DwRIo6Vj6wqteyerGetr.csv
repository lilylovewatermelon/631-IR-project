i hate to see you cry
lying there in that position
theres things you need to hear
so turn off your tears
and listen

chorus
pain throws your heart to the ground
love turns the whole thing around
no it wont all go the way it should
but i know the heart of life is good

verse 2
you know its nothing new
bad news never had good timing
then the circle of your friends
will defend the silver lining

chorus
pain throws your heart to the ground
love turns the whole thing around
no it wont all go the way it should
but i know the heart of life is good

outro
pain throws your heart to the ground
love turns the whole thing around
fear is a friend whos misunderstood
but i know the heart of life is good
i know its goodsee john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also like22embed"
