some things in life are meant to fly
and others they were born to run
you cant tie them up and leave em
like the changing of the seasons
good things they come and then they go

chorus
like a runaway southbound train
like an arizona desert rain
like lightning in the sky
like fireworks in july
like a left field home run ball
like a whiskey shot at last call
its like she was made for moving on
that girl is going going gone

verse 2
i can say it wasnt meant to be
but maybe meant to be is misunderstood
i cant hold on to letting go
change the way the river flows
lovin hers like roping in the wind

chorus
like a runaway southbound train
like an arizona desert rain
like lightning in the sky
like fireworks in july
like a left field homerun ball
like a whiskey shot at last call
its like she was made for moving on
that girl is going going gone

bridge
she aint got one bit of stick around
theres no sense in tryin to slow her down

chorus
like a runaway southbound train
like an arizona desert rain
like lightning in the sky
like fireworks in july
like a left field homerun ball
like a whiskey shot at last call
its like she was made for moving on
that girl is going going gone

outro
going going gone
