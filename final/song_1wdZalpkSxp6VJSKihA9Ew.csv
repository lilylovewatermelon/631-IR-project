verse 1
i woke up this morning with a smile on my face
and nobodys gonna bring me down today
been feeling like nothings been going my way lately
but i decided right here right now
that my outlooks gonna change

prechorus
thats why im gonna say goodbye
to all the tears ive cried
for every time somebody hurt my pride
feelin like they wont let me live life
and take the time to look at what is mine
i see every blessing so clearly
and i thank god for what i got from above

chorus
i believe they can take anything from me
but they cant succeed in taking my inner peace from me
they can say all they wanna say about me
but i im gonna carry on imma keep on singin my song

i never wanna dwell on the pain again ooh no no
theres no use in relivin how i hurt back then oh no
rememberin too well the hell i felt when i was running out of faith
every step im bout to take was towards a better day

prechorus
cause im about to say farewell to every single lie
all the fears ive held too long inside
every time i felt i couldnt try
all the negativity and strife
for too long ive been strugglin couldnt go on
but now ive found im feelin strong and im moving on

chorus
i believe i believe they can take anything from me
but they cant succeed in taking my inner peace from me
they can say all they wanna say about me
but i im gonna carry on
ill keep on singin my song

bridge
whoa
whoa every time i tried to be what they wanted from me
it never came naturally so i ended up in misery
was unable to see all the good around me
wasting much energy on what they thought of me
than simply just rememberin to breathe
im humanly unable to please
everyone at the same time
so now i find my peace of mind living one day at a time
in the end i answer to one god
comes down to one love til i get to heaven above
i have made the decision never to give in
til the day i die no matter what
im gonna carry on imma keep on mmm singin my song
lalala la la la la
lalala la la la la
chorus
i believe they can take anything from me i believe
but they cant succeed in taking my inner peace from me
they can do what they wanna say what they wanna say
they can say what they wanna
but im gonna keep on
keep on singin my song
i believe it
that they can take from me
but they cant take my inner peace
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
say what they wanna say wanna say
but im gonna sing my song
oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
