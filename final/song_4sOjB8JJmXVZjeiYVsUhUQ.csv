go ahead and burn it down
i’m drunk and so is everyone else
in this devil town
they won’t let me turn around
to get one last look at my baby

chorus sean foreman
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around

verse 2 sean foreman
go ahead and build it up again
this city’s just cemeteries and
forgotten men
my only hope’s to see you
and even if i never do

chorus sean foreman
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
you might also likebridge sean foreman
and i know what you’re thinking
that won’t stop this drinking
it’s the least i can do
‘cause this life is anything but certain
when they close the final curtain
you’ll get a glimpse of the truth

chorus sean foreman
‘cause you’re still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around
well she’s still around

outro sean foreman
go ahead and burn it down
i’m drunk and so is everyone else
in this devil townembed"
