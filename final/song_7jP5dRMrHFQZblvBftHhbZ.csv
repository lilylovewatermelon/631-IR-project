bridge rihanna
you know they talk about you when they tell the lies
so dont be fooled you better recognize
theyre not there for you they dont care for you
trust me cause i know its true
you know they smile in your face and make you think theyre down
but then they turn against you when youre not around
its just jealousy and dishonesty
so hold on to your sanity
