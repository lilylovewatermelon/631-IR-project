well i was working on the kcs rail line
katie was the girl down the street
well i took her to a dance
on the fourth of july
hoping she might fall in love with me

verse 2
well the band started playin right at nine
firecrackers popped in the sky
we danced and we danced
lord i never had a chance
well i got canned on the fifth of july

chorus
and we laughed at the moonlight
i said goodbye in the gray light of dawn
yes the girl of my dreams
each and every night it seems
is the one that i hold in my arms

verse 3
i was playin in this tommyknocker tavern
jenny was the girl at the bar
well i sang every song
for her and her alone
and kissed her neath the colorado stars
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus
and we laughed at the moonlight
i said goodbye in the gray light of dawn
yes the girl of my dreams
each and every night it seems
is the one that i hold in my arms

verse 5
seasons come and change just like the leaves
red oaks in the kai nation wind
well they scatter and they fall
where they land i cant recall
will i ever find my darlin again

chorus
and we laughed at the moonlight
said goodbye in the gray light of dawn
yes the girl of my dreams
each and every night it seems
is the one that i hold in my arms
oh yes the girl of my dreams
each and every night it seems
is the one that i hold in my armsembed"
