i dont wanna waste my time if i cant be by your side
you really shouldnt think about god if she cant see where you hide
we dont gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
but she dont gotta know bout nothing
but she dont gotta know

chorus
and if the stars collide will she relieve my soul
and when we feel alive i know shell let me go
when you read my lips i know you feel all cold
but i promise you my heart is made of gold

verse 2
i dont wanna waste my time if i cant make you decide
youre only on my mind when i need you
i dont need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
cause i dont gotta know about nothing
cause i dont gotta know

chorus
and if the stars collide will she relieve my soul
when we feel alive i know shell let me go
when you read my lips i know you feel my cold
but i promise you my heart is made of goldyou might also like130embed"
