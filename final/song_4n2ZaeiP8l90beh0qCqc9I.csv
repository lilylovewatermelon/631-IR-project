a holly jolly kid at christmas time
everyone from maine to baton rouge
got the news  even scrooge
everyones a kid at christmas time
a holly jolly kid at christmas time
mistletoe is now the latest rage
and no one wants to act their age
the older folks are playing with their trains
eating candy canes and trimming trees
some nice old guy is riding through the sky
would you believe hes jumping into chimneys
whoa everyones a kid at christmas time
a holly jolly kid at christmas time
nows the time to throw your cares away
the world is on a holiday
theres even people singing in the street
life is such a treat and goodness knows
that same old guy still riding through the sky
and talking to a reindeer with a big red nose
whoa everyones a kid at christmas time
a holly jolly kid at christmas time
everyone from one to ninetythree
feeling free look at me
oh everyones a kid at christmas time
a holly jolly kid at christmas time
nows the time to throw your cares away
and do the things you did when you were just a kid
the world is on a holiday
everyones a kid at christmas time
a holly jolly kid at christmas time
everyone from maine to baton rouge
got the news  even scrooge
