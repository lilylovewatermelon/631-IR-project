shes dressed up looking good
i love her style
we share all our clothes
i really like your nose

you dont have to change
youre perfect the way you are
you dont have to change
youre perfect the way you are
youre perfect the way you are
perfect the way you are
perfect the way you are
perfеct the way you are
perfеct the way you are

we used to sleep on a twin bed
in my lonely apartment
you always held me down
when i didnt have shit
you used to take the bus
just so you could be with me
just so you could be with me

you dont have to change
youre perfect the way you are
shes a pretty girl without the filter
she looks beautiful with no make up on
no make up on
no make up on
no make up onsee eyedress liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeembed"
