cook that shit up quay

chorus lil baby
i’m getting paid
cartier glasses they sit on my face
i ain’t throwin shade
i’m getting money i ain’t in the way
i stay out the way
free all my dogs til they get out the cage
i’m having my way
running through hundreds and millions a day
they know not to play
yeah i’m the one you can see on my face
a mil in my safe
everywhere i go i’m keepin a k
i’m getting paid
cartier glasses they sit on my face
i ain’t throwin shade
i’m getting money i ain’t in the way

verse 1 lil baby
we just been balling like odell
i got your hoe on my coattail
she in her feeling but oh well
we got em packs from wholesale
running through thots in the hotel
give em couple of hundreds for toe nails
only time im in crowed they both tell
they can say it was vacuum sealed with no smell
i was sitting in jail with no bail
i was sitting in prison getting no mail
my nigga switching up on me but i don’t care
they got jack shit on him he wont tell
zo6 vette ridin the fast lane hope i dont wreck
im on that red
pourin it up with most disrespect
forgiato on my cars now
i been fuckin round with the stars now
5 stars for my lineup
give these niggas a chance but they time up
switch the hustle i did get the grind up
in the spot hundred dollars the lineup
im the big homie niggas can line us
stickin dick in this bitch cause she fine as fuck

verse 2 gunna
i cant stop the money keep calling
vvs on my collar
caught a body trying to dead dock ya
the way she suck she a head doctor
diggin in i got her legs lockin
super trendy got chanel stockings
i aint never had to fantasize it
ysl we come and change the climate
run with twenty thousand one out of onyx
swear the ring the chain watch avianne
i got shooters in the trunk right behind me
i got spots like a cheetah wont find me
gunna gunna fell in love with these diamonds
pressure god only rocking the finest
i done told you the crew is almighty
several time i just gotta remind you
if you my dog i gotta ride with you
i got you dog on whatever the issue
free my dogs out of prison i miss you
fuck the laws and whoever against you
know the plug i dont go through the middle
showing love it could all be so simple
im a giant remember i used to be little
getting paid i dont need no credentials
chorus lil baby

cartier glasses they sit on my face
i ain’t throwin shade
i’m getting money i ain’t in the way

free all my dogs til they get out the cage
