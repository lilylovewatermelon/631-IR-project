johnny wanna be a big star
get on stage and play the guitar
make a little money buy a fancy car
big old house and an alligator
just to match with them alligator shoes
hes a rich man so hes no longer singing the blues
hes singing songs about material things
and platinum rings and watches that go bling
but diamonds dont bling in the dark
he a star now but he aint singing it from the heart
sooner or later its just gonna fall apart
cause his fans cant relate to his new found art
he aint doin what he did from the start
and thats putting in some feeling and thought
he decided to live his life shallow
cash in his love for material
and its gone

chorus jack johnson
gone going
gone everything gone give a damn
gone be the birds when they dont wanna sing
gone people
awawkward with their things gone

you see yourself in the mirror and ya
feel safe cause its looks familiar but cha
afraid to open up your soul cause ya
dont really know dont really know who is who is
the person thats deep within
cause you content with just being the name brand man
and you fail to see that its trivial
insignificant you addicted to material
i seen your kind before
you the type that think souls is sold in the store
packaged up with incense sticks
with the vegetarian meals to you thats righteous
youre fiction like books
need to go out to life and look
cause uh what happens when they take your material
and you already sold your soul
and its

chorus jack johnson
gone going
gone everything gone give a damn
gone be the birds when they dont wanna sing

awawkward with their things gone
verse 3 william
they say that time is money and money is time
so you gotcha mind in your money and your money on your mind
but what about
that crime you did to get paid
and what about
that bid you cant take it to your grave
tell me about it

bridge jack johnson
what about those shoes you in today
theyll do no good
on the bridges you walk along the way

verse 4 william
all that money chu got
gon be gone
that ear that chu rock
gon be gone
that house upon that hill
gon be gone
the gold burns on your grill
gon be gone
the ice on your wrist
gon be gone
that nice little miss
gon be gone
that whip that chu roll
gon be gone
whats worse is your soul already gone
yeah its gone
chorus jack johnson
