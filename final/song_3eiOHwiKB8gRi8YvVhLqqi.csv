i wanna be right where you are
no more subliminal
my desires gone
i no longer feel apart
i remember a time
i wanted to be just like you
ive seen you touch the soul of the world
then corrupt the ideals we held so true
now i see right through the sick one sided
truth of people like you
you made me play the fool
for thinking our friendship would ever stay the same
im still mourning your goodbye
im falling asleep to your sad lullaby
well never get back to the feeling we once had
the feeling of our youth
now i realize well never recap our youth
and although weve spent some time
i wont hold on i wont forget
now i realize ill never find the truth by looking in your eyes the answer lies within
so i sit here with a depreciated grinyou might also likeembed"
