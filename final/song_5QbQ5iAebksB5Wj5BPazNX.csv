i got enough on my mind
that when she pulls me by the hair
she hasnt much to hold onto
she keeping count on her hand one two three days
that i been sleeping on my side

verse 2
i finished kissing my death
so now i head back up the steps
thinking about where ive been 
i mean the sun was never like this
i wanna feel with the season
i guess it makes sense
cause my lifes become as vapid as
a night out in los angeles
and i just want to stay in bed

prechorus
and hold you like i used to
you know that i am home
so darling if you love me
would you let me know

chorus
or go on go on go on
if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
why am i the one always packing up my stuff
for once for once for once
i get the feeling that im right where i belong
why am i the one always packing up my stuff

she got enough on her mind
that she feel no sorrow
i let my fate fill the air
so now she rollin down the window
never been one to hold on
but i need a last breath
so i ask if she remembers when
she used to come and visit man
we were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

chorus
go on go on go on
if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
why am i the one always packing up my stuff
for once for once for once
i get the feeling that im right where i belong
why am i the one always packing up my stuff
i think i kinda like it
but i might have had too much

bridge
ill move back down to this western town
when they find me out make no mistake about it
ill move back down to this western town
when they find me out make no mistake about it
ill move back down to this western town
chorus
or go on go on go on
if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
why am i the one always packing up my stuff

go on go on go on
if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
why am i the one always packing up my stuff

for once for once for once
i get the feeling that im right where i belong
why am i the one always packing up my stuff

outro
i think i kinda like it but i might have had too much
ill move back down

when i see stars thats all they are
when i hear a song
when i see stars thats all they are
when i hear a song
when i see stars thats all they are
when i see stars thats all they are
when i hear a song19embed"
