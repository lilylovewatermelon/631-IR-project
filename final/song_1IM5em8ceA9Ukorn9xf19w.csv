intro sample

great stuff
ahh oh yeah
applause
verse 1 mf doom
hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
or a foe for ransom flows is handsome
os in tandem anthem random tantrum
phantom of the grand ole opry ask the dumb hottie
masked pumpshotty—somebody stop me
hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
after rockin parties he departed in a jalopy
watch the droptop papi
known as the grimy limey slimy— try me blimey
simply smashing in a fashion thats timely
madvillain dashing in a beatrhyme crime spree
we rock the house like rock n roll
got more soul than a sock with a hole
set the stage with a goal
to have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
overthrow em like throwing rover a biscuit
a lot of bitches think hes overly chauvinistic
let go his dick if thats the case
rats what a waste theres more cats to chase—
dogs he got it like new powers
woke up wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
sheesh been unleashed since the glee club
had your fam saying please make me a dub
well since you ask kindly
where he been behind the mask who cant find me
youre blind in the wine zone leave your mind blown
when he shine with the 9 hes a rhinestone
cowboy

applause
no no no no enough
verse 2 mf doom
goony googoo loony cuckoo
like gary gnu off new zoo revue but who knew
the mask had a loose screw hell could hardly tell
had to tighten it up like the drells and archie bell
it speaks well of the hyper base
wasnt even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
couldnt wait for the snipes to place
at least a tracklist in bold print typeface
stopped for a year
come back with thumbtacks pop full of beer
were hip hop sharecroppers
used to wear flip flops now rare gear coppers
hes in it for the quiche
you might as well not ask him for no free shit capiche
oh my aching hands
from raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
villain—his smile stuns ya chick
while he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
you heard it on the radio tape it
play it in your stereo your crewll go apeshit
raw lyrics—he smells em like a hunch
the same intuition that tells him spike the punch
curses hes truly the worsest
with enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
let the beat blast she told him wear the mask
he said you bet your sweet ass
its made of fine chrome alloy
find him on the grind hes the rhinestone cowboy
interlude
applause

outro
sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying
they were the foes of society whether fighting the local sheriff or a secret agent
frequently they mirrored our times the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
collectively they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come
