mine immaculate dream
made of breath and skin ive been waitin for you
signed with a home tattoo
happy birthday to you was created for you

jessie
i cant ever keep from fallin apart at the seams
i cannot believe youre takin my heart into pieces

matt
oh it might take a little time
might take a little crime to come undone now
well try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

who do you need who do you love
when you come undone
who do you need who do you love
when you come undone

words playing me déjà vu
like a radio tune i swear ive heard before
chill is this something real
or the magic im feeding off your fingers
you might also likejessie
i cant ever keep from fallin apart at the seams
i cannot believe youre takin my heart into pieces

matt
lost in a selffilled sky
might make it alright to come undone now
well try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
hey child stay wilder than the wind can blow me into cry

who do you need who do you love
when you come undone
who do you need who do you love
when you come undone

jessie  matt
i cant ever keep from fallin apart at the seams
who do you need
i cannot believe youre taking my heart into pieces
who do you love
i cant ever keep from fallin apart at the seams
who do you love
i cannot believe youre takin my heart
when you come undoneembed"
