it might be your smile
cause it can change my day
blue eyes that chase my blues away
it might be your touch
that keeps me coming back for more
her loving words that keep me going strong
that heart of hers i hang my future on
what it is well i cant say for sure

chorus
its just shes got this thing about her
shes got this thing about her
like the magic in your favorite song
you just cant put your finger on
in her arms when were all alone
i get the feeling that ive come back home
shes got this thing about her

verse 2
she stops time when she moves through a room
when she leaves shes always gone too soon
and im counting down the minutes til shes back
shes the love ive known eternally
it always feels brand new to me
i cant separate the fiction from the fact
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
its just shes got this thing about her
shes got this thing about her
like a hymn in a cathedral hall
watching april snowflakes fall
in her arms when were all alone
i get the feeling that i come back home
shes got this thing about her

outro
like the magic in your favorite song
you just cant put your finger on
shes got this thing about herembed"
