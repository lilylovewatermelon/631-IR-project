this is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
same grade as me
tried to kiss her once in the aisle of the bus
and she walked right over me
facedown in the gum on the floor
i was hopin that shed change her mind
but i swear as she walked down the stairs
she didnt even wave goodbye
didnt even wave goodbye

verse 2
ray dixon didnt take no lip
hed kick you right off the bus
stop by your house on the way out of the holler
and tell your momma where you was
he didnt need no drivers aid
to keep a bunch of kids in line
all he needed was a glare in the mirror
and a paddle that he carved from pine
blisterin punk kids alive oh blister em

verse 3
this is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
same grade as me
i held onto hope for eight long years
and by the time that i turned sixteen
i wasnt awkward is a real smooth talker
with my very own pickup truck
id take her home and if her parents werent around
shed bring me in and give me some
bring me in and give me some
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 4
safe to say nowadays ol ray
cant keep a route very long
and im glad the little girls dad
never found out what was goin on
i know hed kill me in a minute
and he wouldnt have left no trace
hogsll eat bout anything you give em
and they dont let nothin go to waste
dont let nothin go to waste

outro
this is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
same grade as meembed"
