oh bbaby dont you be so mad because i barely remember
and she tries to recognize me with the eyes
she saw me with in december
and shes starting to realize that its actually not a good thing
and its so tough because youre down to go out again and have another adventure
all her friends in the alleyway shout back but she cant hear them

chorus 1
but youre never gonna get my love
we can only play in the sun
get up in the morning and run
youll be frustrated til the day that youre done

verse 2
he got punched in the mouth for sticking
his nose in other peoples business
no good solution always on the verge of some revolution
well tough luck it may take a thousand years
but i think we can do it
best friends fight but they never enjoy life
as good as when they abuse it
he said the soldier is a necessity in light of all the failures of man

chorus 2
but youre never gonna get their love
we can only fight in the sand
you get tired when the days are too long
you get lonely when the days are gone
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likehe could never mention it out here and now
without quick tears in his eyes

chorus 3
but youre never gonna get my love
we can only play in the sun
you get tired when the days are too long
you get lonely when the days are gone

chorus 4
oh youre never gonna get this love
we can roll around in the dark
thats about as far as we go
get up in the morning and run10embed"
