woke up this mornin with my cellphone ringin
she said i know that when you called me you were drinking
but i loved every single word you left on my phone
and i know youre hungover but im comin on over
did i say wed go shoppin that id louis vuitton her
that id rodeo drive her slide a tiffany diamond on her

chorus
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
unblackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say

verse 2
last thing i remember i was thinking id call her up and
put her on speaker while the whole bar sang free bird
had that phone in my hand when i ran into trouble
my friend comin over with a couple of doubles

chorus
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
unblackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say

that id rodeo drive her slide a tiffany diamond on her
did i tell her she could move in and wed fly out to vegas
champagne all the way and wed get married by elvis

chorus
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
unblackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say
what the hell did i hell did i hell did i say
