i made another mistake thought i could change
thought i could make it out
promises break need to hear you say
youre gonna keep it now

prechorus
i miss the way you say my name
the way you bend the way you break
your makeup running down your face
the way you touch the way you taste

chorus
when the curtains call the time
will we both go home alive
it wasnt hard to realize
loves the death of peace of mind

verse 2
youre in the walls that i made with crosses and frames
hanging upside down
for granted in vain i took everything
i ever cared about

prechorus
i miss the way you say my name
the way you bend the way you break
your makeup running down your face
the way you fuck the way you taste
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
when the curtains call the time
will we both go home alive
it wasnt hard to realize
loves the death of peace of mind
when the curtains call the time
will we both be satisfied
it wasnt hard to realize
loves the death of peace of mind

postchorus
loves the death of peace of mind

bridge
you come and go in waves
leavin me in your wake
you come and go in waves
swallowing everything

breakdown
oh
are you satisfied
loves the death of peace of mind
mine mine

chorus
when the curtains call the time
will we both go home alive
it wasnt hard to realize
loves the death of peace of mind
when the curtains call the time
will we both be satisfied
it wasnt hard to realize
loves the death of peace of mind
loves the death of peace of mind
outro
loves the death of peace of mind7embed"
