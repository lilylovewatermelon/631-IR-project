its a bad idea me and you
lets just keep kissing til we come to

heart stop racing
lets face it making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
mind stop running
its time we just let this thing go
it was a pretty good bad idea wasnt it though

its a bad idea me and you
its a bad idea me and you
hold me close while i think this through
yeah its a very poor idea me and you

heart stop racing
lets face it making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
mind stop running
its time we just let this thing go
it was a pretty good bad idea wasnt it though

i know its right for me
its the only thing ive ever done
what if i never see myself ever be anything more
than what ive already become
jenna
i need a bad idea

both
i need a bad idea
i need a bad idea
just one

heart keep racing
lets make mistakes
let us say so what and make worse what was already pretty bad
this secret is safe
no reason to throw it away when theres love to be had
hold me tight as i tell myself that you might make sense
and make good what has been just so bad
lets see this through
its a pretty good bad idea
me and youembed"
