even if we both break down tonight
and you say you hate me and we go to bed angry
i know everything will be alright
ill be here waiting i promise i’m changing
i just need

verse 1
a little time to show you im worth it
i know that i can be a difficult person
im a stress case drive you up the wall when i’m workin
actually im probably worse when im not you dont deserve it
make you nervous cause you know ima break soon
every time i do i say somethin that hurts you
actin’ like i’m gone but we both in the same room
i dont like to be wrong which i know you relate to
and i know i make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
thats when i look at you and tell you id be better alone
just the pride talkin isn’t it cause both of us know
im the definition of wreck if you look into my soul
comes out the most when i feel im in a vulnerable place
made a lot of mistakes i wish i knew how to erase
when im afraid might get distant and i push you away
but no matter the case ima do whatever it takes even if—

chorus

verse 2
yeah way before i bought you the ring
we were fighting back and forth like you were wearin the thing
two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
lead to passionate conversation when its hard to agree
you know me well sittin on the edge of my seat
lookin at life overanalyzin everything
always depressed tryna find a better version of me
searching for somethin i knows prolly right in front of my feet
stubborn as me maybe not but youre close to it
got a lot of issues im tryin to work through em
going to therapy for yous somethin thats worth doin
when i know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
and i know it hurts knowing that i carry this weight on my chest
making it difficult for me to open up and connect
lot of regrets i apologize for all of the stress
thats not what i meant to do you know i love you to death even if—

even if we both break down tonight
and you say you hate me and we go to bed angry
