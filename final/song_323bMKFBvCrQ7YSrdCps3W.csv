verse 1
slowly the pen touches paper
in the guidance of the words that you write
memories roll in of the things you once did
and who you had shared them with
is somebody thinking of you

verse 2
did i bother telling you this
with the words that cross teeth and jump lips
a poor choice of words in wanting to tell you anything
but words dont come with ease
theyre forever my hurt

verse 3
would it really matter
if you were to count the days left with your hands
your focus secure on the loves you left well
smiles staged in photographs
here until
you you left the light on
theres a chance i might have tripped girl
but you were there to hold on
you might also likeprechorus
ignoring the words of your obnoxious little brother
kill or be killed spilled the words from your mother
ill lay awake for a while
ill leave the light on a while

chorus
but you couldnt last a lifetime
caught between here and the days of it
carving her name across your arm
with every wish its hit or miss her
i told you so
i measure distance in lines
departing the rest of my life

postchorus
but you you you
you had better things to do
but you you you
you had better things to do

interlude
liar liar liar liar
liar liar liar liar
liar liar liar lie away
liar liar liar liar
liar liar liar liar
liar liar liar lie away
prechorus
ignoring the words of your obnoxious little brother
kill or be killed spilled the words from your mother
ill lay awake for a while
ill leave the light on a while

chorus
but you couldnt last a lifetime
caught between here and the days of it
carving her name across your arm
with every wish its hit or miss her
i told you so
i measure distance in lines
departing the rest of my life

bridge
if youd get put to sleep
like an old dog youre better off
if youd get put to sleep
ive been cautious with the words i extend
allow this year before the world starts to end

chorus
your fathers dead he passed in his sleep
and i woke to the sounds of her crying
your fathers dead he passed in his sleep
and i woke to the sounds of her crying
your fathers dead he passed in his sleep
and i woke to the sounds of her crying
your fathers dead he passed in his sleep
