i have to sing i have to play
the music its its not just in me it is me
when life gets me down i play my guitar
the rest of the world may follow the rules but i must follow my heart
you know that feeling like theres a song in the air and its playing just for you

ernesto de la cruz

i never knew i could want something so much but its true
