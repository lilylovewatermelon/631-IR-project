verse 1 chance the rapper
they aint teaching taxes in school
it dont even matter i was acting a fool
but who would think the raps would turn into racks
dont matter matter fact it could happen to you
scars on my head im the boy who lived
the boy love playing when the boy too sick
reclining on a prayer im declining to help
ive been lying to my body cant rely on myself oh no
last year i got addicted to xans
started forgetting my name and start to missin my chance
la for four months end up leaving right back
im in love with my city bitch i sleep in my hat uh
i felt hogtied ever since my dog died
he lived to 84 damn thats a long ride
i know he up there he just sit and he wait
ill be racing up the stairs ima get to the gate singing

gimme the water gimme the water i need the kind from space jam

hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
we in a marathon we could build a marriage on
arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
ive been getting blocked just tryna make songs with friends
labels told me to my face that they own my friends
i got to pray i got to pray like hammer after 2 legit
i got the power i could poke lucifer with crucifix
i cannot scrape off stupid shit i stand up like im ludacris
i know some folks that talk so much youd think they drive an uber whip damn

part ii drown

intro eryn allen kane
the water may be deeper than its ever been
verse 1 noname
lord rain down on me so i can move on water
like children at the altar like god inside my house
i love you i love you you looking holy like mama
you made a church out of feathers so when she fly to the father
she know the choir gon follow and all the offering paid
she gave my name away to your holy house
she like my blessings in disguise
she like her jesus mountain high
so he can watch her lonely child i know my god
i know my god seen his breaks and his edges
are jagged for giving that pain to his city in gold
like everything is everything
like all them days he prayed with me
like emptiness was tamed in me
and all that was left was his love
and all that was left was his love
and all that was left was his love
and all that was left was his love

chorus choir
never never drown
the water may be deeper than its ever been
never drown
the water may be deeper than its ever been
never drown
verse 2 choir  kirk franklin
never never never chance let me in come on
this thirst in my soul theres a thirst in my soul it tell me
where else can i go where but you come on
i may cry a river i may cry a thousand tears but
but you take each drop and you wash you wash me new
me new people sing
this water is deep yes yes and i need you to
jesus rescue me come on save me i need you to
take me to your mountain hallelujah
so someday chicago will be free someday well all be free
be free say
