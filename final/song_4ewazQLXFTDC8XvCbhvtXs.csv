shed take the world off my shoulders
if it was ever hard to move
shed turn the rain to a rainbow
when i was living in the blue
why then if shes so perfect
do i still wish that it was you
perfect dont mean that its workin
so what can i do ooh

prechorus
when youre out of sight
in my mind

cause sometimes i look in her eyes
and thats where i find a glimpse of us
and i try to fall for her touch
but im thinkin of the way it was
said im fine and said i moved on
im only here passing time in her arms
hopin ill find a glimpse of us

verse 2
tell me he savors your glory
does he laugh the way i did
is this a part of your story
one that i had never lived
maybe one day youll feel lonely
and in his eyes youll get a glimpse
maybe youll start slippin slowly and find me again
