i aint never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
and the special way i feel when you hold me
we gon always be together baby
thats what you told me and i believe it
cause i aint neva had nobody do me like you

verse 1 bow wow ciara
now i done been with different kind of girls
like i done seen them all but aint none of them at all like you
and i done seen the best of the best
baby still i aint impressed cause aint none of them at all like you
if you know how i feel when i chill
if im seen with a girl then she gotta be just like you
and baby thats the way i feel
and i got no choice but for me to keep it real
cause when we first got together started hanging out you was
skeptical at first had to figure out if
i was the kinda guy to try to dog you out but
i aint that kinda guy you tried to make me out
you found out when you turned to my baby
i showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
i let you drive when i ride that mercedes
and i aint trippin or actin shady cause baby you know

chorus ciara  bow wow
i aint never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
and the special way i feel when you hold me
we gon always be together baby
thats what you told me and i believe it
cause i aint neva had nobody do me like you
