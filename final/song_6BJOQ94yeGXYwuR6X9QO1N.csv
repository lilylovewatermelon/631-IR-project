she was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
she was convinced if she got up there that shed be discovered someday

prechorus
so she belted it
she hit the high notes fearlessly
oh she melted them
as she brought them to their feet

chorus
she was a big star at banana joes bar where she sang karaoke every night
she said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
she was a big star

verse 2
she made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
after a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place

prechorus
and she signed autographs
like she was garth brooks in a skirt
and in the aftermath
that smalltime town was hers

chorus
she was a big star at banana joes bar where she sang karaoke every night
she said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
she was a big star
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
she doesnt care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
the only thought she entertains is where they are
and where she is now

verse 3
her old neighbors swear theyre certain she slept her way to the top
she knows you dont get where youre going less you got something they aint got

prechorus
so she sings tonight
to twentythousand plus
and the young girls scream out loud
man that could be us

chorus
shes a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
she says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
shes a big star
shes a big starembed"
