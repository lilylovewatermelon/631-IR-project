taking all my full circles and making straight lines
been getting to the bottom of the bottom getting to me
holding up the mirror to everything i dont want to see
but it aint all flowers
sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
and when you play with the devil you know you gonna get the horns
been dancing with demons all my life
every time i find my groove they cut in like a knife
been a sin eater since the day i was born
tired of feeling weighed down from carrying round all the pain that keeps me torn
so i pray when i lay me down to die
grab a glass of wine and a seat to dine and go ahead and eat the whole damn pie

but it aint all flowers
sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
and when you play with the devil you know you gonna get
the horns
oh lay me down
oh lay me down
oh lay me downyou might also like5embed"
