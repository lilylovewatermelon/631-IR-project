youre not the same anymore
don’t wanna play that game anymore
youd make a better window than a door
oh the strangers they implore
it gets so easy to ignore
just like the girl next door

chorus 1
uncles house it was noon
sorry boy i can’t employ ya
you are strange but i like you
sorry this is overdue
i promised i would do it right
her and a boy on a saturday night

verse 2
and now the door slams shut
a child prisoner grows up
to seek his enemys throat cut
im on and on it on and on and on it
were on the way fuel the jet
can see that what he wants he gets
what does your sworn enemy regret

chorus 2
i didnt know i didnt care
i dont even understand
did somethin wrong i wasn’t sure
stay on top of this or else
i was afraid i fucked up
yeah yeah yeah
i couldn’t change its too late
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 3
and now it’s time to show up
late again i cant grow up
and now its on me theyve given up

chorus 3
uncle’s house i forget
violent tendencies i get
your timing sucks she went overboard
dont forget you are insured
i didnt know i wasnt sure
cant remember all that well
i couldnt change was too late
yeah yeah yeah18embed"
