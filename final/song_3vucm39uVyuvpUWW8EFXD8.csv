if it makes you less sad i will die by your hand
i hope you find out what you want i already know what i am
and if it makes you less sad well start talking again
you can tell me how vile i already know that i am

ill grow old start acting my age
be a brand new day in a life that you hate
a crown of gold a heart thats harder than stone
and it hurts a whole lot but its missed when its gone

chorus
call me a safe bet im betting im not
im glad that you can forgive
only hoping as time goes you can forget

verse 2
and if it makes you less sad ill move out of the state
you can keep to yourself ill keep out of your way
and if it makes you less sad ill take your pictures all down
every picture you paint i will paint myself out
its cold as a tomb and its dark in your room
when i sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wounds
so call it quits or get a grip
say you wanted a solution you just wanted to be missed

call me a safe bet im betting im not
im glad that you can forgive
only hoping as time goes you can forget
so you can forget you can forget

bridge
you are calm and reposed let your beauty unfold
pale white like the skin stretched over your bones
spring keeps you ever close you are secondhand smoke
you are so fragile and thin standing trial for your sins
holding onto yourself the best you can
you are the smell before rain you are the blood in my veins

chorus
call me a safe bet im betting im not
im glad that you can forgive
only hoping as time goes you can forget25embed"
