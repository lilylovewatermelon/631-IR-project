he calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
hes always chokin from the stench and the fume
the weddin party all collapsed in the room
so send my resignation to the bride and the groom
lets go down

verse 1
this elevator only goes up to ten
hes not around hes always looking at men ohohoh
down by the pool he doesnt have many friends
as ohoh they are facedown and bloated
snap a shot with the lens

prechorus
if you marry me would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

chorus
say goodbye to the vows you take
say goodbye to the life you make
and say goodbye to the hearts you break
and all the cyanide you drank

postchorus
ohwoahoh

she keeps a picture of the body she lends
got nasty blisters from the money she spends
shes got a life of her own and it shows by the benz
she drives at ninety by the barbies and kens
if you ever say never too late
ill forget all the diamonds you ate ohohoh
lost in coma and covered in cake ohoh
increase the medication share the vows at the wake
kiss the bride

prechorus
if you marry me would you bury me
would you carry me to the end

chorus
say goodbye to the vows you take
say goodbye to the life you make
and say goodbye to the hearts you break
and all the cyanide you drank
and say goodbye to the last parade
and walk away from the choice you made
and say goodnight to the hearts you break
and all the cyanide you drank

chorus
say goodbye to the vows you take
say goodbye to the life you make

say goodnight to the hearts you break
and all the cyanide you drank
