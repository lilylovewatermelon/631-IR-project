ive come here from nowhere across the unforgiving sea
drifting further and further its all becoming clear to me
the violent winds are upon us and i cant sleep
internal temperatures rising and all the voices wont recede

chorus
ive finally found what i was looking for
a place where i can be without remorse
because i am a stranger who has found an even stranger war
ive finally found what i was looking for
here i come come come come come
here i come

bridge
la chaleur me dérange
mais cest le grincement du bateau qui ma réveillée

outro
i sharpen the knife and look down upon the bay
for all of my life a stranger i remain
a stranger i remain
a stranger i remainyou might also like1embed"
