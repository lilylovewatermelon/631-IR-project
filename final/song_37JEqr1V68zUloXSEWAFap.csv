been disconnected for so long
and left my mark here along the way
so many years have come and gone
so many fears have remained the same

verse 2
a sea of faith i swim and play
yet drowning all possibilities
beyond what i believe and know
i cut the cord free of home again

prechorus 1
it turns to silence
a silence sometimes i can hear
internal violence
a struggle deep within what if

chorus
what if i leave could i still breathe
what if i breathe could i still be
and if i leave would i be me

hook
i lost my hope along the way
