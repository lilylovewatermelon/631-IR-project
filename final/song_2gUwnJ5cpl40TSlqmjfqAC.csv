i ran down the road pants down to my knees
screaming please come help me
that canadian shaman gave a little too much to me
and im writing a novel
because its never been done before
first house that i saw i wrote house up on the door
and told the people who lived there they had to get out
cause my reality is realer than yours
and theres no time in the present
and theres a black dog on the bed
i went to the backyard to burn my only clothes
and the dog ran out and said you cant turn nothing
into nothingness with me no more
well im no doctor but that monkey might be right
and if he is ill be walking him my whole life

verse 2
i rode to malibu on a dune buggy with neil
he said youre gonna have to drown me down on the beach
if you ever want to write the real
and i said im sorry
young man what was your name again
now everywhere i go in west hollywood
is filled with people pretending they dont see the actress
and the actress wishing that they could
we could do ayahuasca
baby if i wasnt holding all these drinks
something bout the way violet whips her hair
that makes me empty my pockets
holding court on the corner
burning twenties as if i was the mayor
well i dont need any new friends mama
but i could really use something to do
so if youre up for it sometime
i swear you wouldnt have to be my muse
you might also likeoutro
heidegger and sartre drinking poppy tea
i couldve sworn last night i passed out in my van
and now these guys are pouring one for me
i never leave the canyon cause im surrounded on all sides
by people writing novels and living on amusement rides4embed"
