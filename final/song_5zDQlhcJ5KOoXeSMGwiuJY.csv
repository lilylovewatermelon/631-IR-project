i’m looking for you with a flashlight
i want to feel what a real fat ass like
no injection i learned my lesson
i walk it like i talk it baby this pedestrian
runnin’ through your mind like jackie joyner
pussy pop like boom go get me a burner
got shot like boom
this can be detrimental
tshirt and panties thats your credential
you’re cotton candy i need a fistful
i’m awful antsy hope that convince you
