12 hunna on the beat
dy krazy

verse 1
when you wake up off them pills that feeling terrible
the worst thing to be known is when they scared of you
and they gon laugh right in your face when they ahead of you
and to be technical that shit we do is federal
holding tear backs from this life its so unbearable
you a copycat thats not lean thats theraflu
ima jump from the top of my money with a parachute
and who you look up to a ho i wouldnt dare salute
i keep taking care of my killers they wouldnt care to shoot
i got your address from a bitch thats for a pair of shoes
you got a text like he got hit that shit be scary news
they told me get up out the streets you can go back to school

bridge
my life hurts so bad
thinking bout if you was here what kinda life you would have
nowadays the way we live we live our life on the edge
nowadays the way we live you would die if you scared uh

chorus
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life

nobody put fear in us
i put real life inside this music they not hearing us
i know whats real i had some real killers tearing up
i did all i can for em they not sincere enough
they stopped believing me way back then they cant cheer with us mmmmmm
it get treacherous thats why they dont mention us
why you holding onto a snitch just give that victim up
they cant take care us alone thats why they cliquing up
they told me to go pop and give the trenches up
i said fuck that shit four killers inside a bentley truck
it wouldve been five but one of them died his soul was given up
wish i talked to him on the last call told him live it up

bridge
where the love mmm where the love
you know its tiring tryna clean blood from a rug
you know its tiring watchin my back and duckin slugs
i know two robbers said they tired of sticking up

chorus
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life
this life is for the ghetto
this life this life this life2embed"
