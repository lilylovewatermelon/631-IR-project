when i met you i was chillin to some old willie
bet you were thinkin howd i get up with this hillbilly
saw yourself sittin pretty in the big city
and now youre bigtime diggin on some little bitty
backroads real slow
got your hand out the window

chorus
now you took a little ride around the farm
got to do a little fishin in the dark
wrapped up in some country boy arms
now you know what its about
whatcha think of country now
halfway down your first country mile
you called your mama said its gonna be a while ha
i didnt think way out was your style
but now you know what its about
whatcha think of country now
yeah whatcha think of country now

verse 2
aw baby now youve seen the way my sun sets
from a blanket on a bank of a creek bed
and i can tell you were hooked soon as you said
dont take me home boy i aint had enough yet

now you took a little ride around the farm
got to do a little fishin in the dark
wrapped up in some country boy arms
now you know what its about
whatcha think of country now
halfway down your first country mile
you called your mama said its gonna be a while ha
i didnt think way out was your style
but now you know what its about
whatcha think of country now
yeah whatcha think of country now

bridge
yeah whatcha think about the pine trees
hey whatcha think about the cool breeze
and whatcha think about the midnight moon
aw damn this country looks good on you

instrumental break

chorus
now you took a little ride around the farm
got to do a little fishin in the dark
wrapped up in some country boy arms
now you know what its about

i didnt think way out was your style
but now you know what its about
