let me wrap myself around you
let you show me how i see
and when you come back in from nowhere
do you ever think of me

your heart is not able
let me show you how much i care

i need those eyes to tide me over
ill take your picture when i go
it gives me strength and gives me patience
but ill never let you know

i got nothing on you baby
but i always said i try
let me show you how much i care
cause sometimes it gets hard
and dont she know

verse 2
dont give the ghost up just clench your fist
you shouldve known by now you were on my list
dont give the ghost up just clench your fist
you shouldve known by now you were on my list
dont give the ghost up just clench your fist
you shouldve known by now you were wrong on my list
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likewhen your heart is not able
and your prayers theyâ€™re not fables
let me show you let me show you
let me show you let me show you
let me show you how much i care oh7embed"
