aint ashamed of where im from or where ive been
well im still my daddys angel but my halos kinda bent
been washed in the mud of the mississippi
southernfried droppedinthegrease kinda hippie
lipstick on a cigarette throwin back whiskey
what you see is what you get

chorus
if i i look a little drunk its cause i drank some
if my necks a little red its cause i am one
heavens where im gonna go the bible says so on my shelf
but if i smell like smoke its only cause ivе been through hell

verse 2
i let a blueеyed twotimin devil kiss me on the mouth
had me up on a homegrown high fore it all went south
it burned me like a mess of cornbread in a skillet
left me with a heartbreak i dont wanna feel it
can i bum another one of them cowboy killers
hit me with the good stuff now

chorus
if i i look a little drunk its cause i drank some
if my necks a little red its cause i am one
heavens where im gonna go the bible says so on my shelf
but if i smell like smoke its only cause ive been
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likebridge
through hell and back again
tryin like hell to get over him
i can tell its gonna take some time
but you can bet your ass im gonna be just fine

chorus
if i i look a little drunk its cause i drank some all night
if my necks a little red its cause i am one damn right
heavens where im gonna go the bible says so on my shelf
and if i smell like smoke
ima light it up
aw yeah and ima let it go
its only cause ive been through hellembed"
