al geno on the track
niggas having undercover pressure bout bitches
let a nigga know if it’s smoke

verse 1
i was sittin in jail i was in penitentiary
i done seen the gangsta niggas turn bitches
ima answer calls i don’t like bitches
shell still pull up on a nigga and kick it
i aint gon lie we talked about this
i always knew that i would be rich
shawty she cry like im buyin tears
she done kept it gangsta all these years
used to write the bitch she aint write back
now im on top she don’t like that
i don’t think about it had to let em know that
she can die tomorrow i prolly wouldn’t notice
try to hold me down i gotta stay focused
go and get the money bust the safe open
stay away from broads i gotta stay low
rest in peace my dawg he got a halo yeah

chorus

play with me you gon get chastised
free the bros down the road doin real time
all the homies they call it the red line
he gon only pull up when they say its time
