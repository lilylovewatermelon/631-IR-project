wish i was too dead to cry
my selfaffliction fades
stones to throw at my creator
masochists to which i cater

chorus
you dont need to bother
i dont need to be
ill keep slipping farther
but once i hold on i wont let go till it bleeds

verse 2
wish i was too dead to care
if indeed i cared at all
never had a voice to protest
so you fed me shit to digest

prechorus
i wish i had a reason
my flaws are open season
for this i gave up trying
one good turn deserves my dying

chorus
you dont need to bother
i dont need to be
ill keep slipping farther
but once i hold on i wont let go till it bleeds
you might also likesolo jim root

verse 3
wish id died instead of lived
a zombie hides my face
shell forgotten with its memories
diaries left with cryptic entries

chorus
you dont need to bother
i dont need to be
ill keep slipping farther
but once i hold on i wont let go till it bleeds

outro
you dont need to bother
i dont need to be
ill keep slipping farther
but once i hold on ill never live down my deceit19embed"
