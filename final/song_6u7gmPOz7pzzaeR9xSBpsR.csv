said ima give you some instructions
that you cant be scared to try
i want you to touch it softly
like the way you do my mind
it got body and its smooth to touch
the same way as my skin
but dont you be scared

to run your hands through my hair
baby cause thats why its there
come run your hands through my hair
ooh baby so dont you be scared
so come run your hands through my hair

verse 2
its been way long overdue
just like these inches down my back
usually dont let people touch it
but tonight you get a pass
spend my dimes and spend my time
to keep it real sometimes its tracks
but i dont care mmm

chorus
so run your hands through my hair
baby cause thats why its there
come run your hands through my hair
ooh baby so dont you be scared
so come run your hands through my hair
