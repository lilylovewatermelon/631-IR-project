yo mmm

chorus
you cant stand to see me shine better buy a visor
you dont ever cross my mind whats a sheep to a tiger
on your horse so high swear to god im higher
know youre beggin for a dime ima throw you a fiver
beggin for it beggin for it beggin for some relevance
as soon as i pull up on you scare you like a skeleton
you cant stand to see me shine better buy a visor
you dont ever cross my mind whats a sheep to a tiger

verse 1
leeches leechin wanna juice me peaches
all eyes on me peepers you all jeepers creepеrs

that you said you made me who i am
you think youre the man
youre so toxic like britney bitch
i drop you just because i can
you think youre the man bitch please
