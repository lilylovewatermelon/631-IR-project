i paid my last respects this mornin on an early grave
already said goodbye nothin left to say
a tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent
not how i wanted it im hating all of this

prechorus
well im hating all of this
im hating all of this
all of this all of this

chorus
now i know why i hide my love from you somedays
no i dont mind keeping this bottled inside me
you came along and tore this wall down around me
looks like you found me
now i know why
i felt like shit when i woke up this morning

verse 2
ive been a loser all my life im not about to change
if you dont like it theres the door nobody made you stay
there aint a woman on the planet who can deal with it
just how i wanted it im hating all of this

prechorus
well im hating all of this
im hating all of this
all of this all of this

now i know why i hide my love from you somedays
no i dont mind keeping this bottled inside me
you came along and tore this wall down around me
looks like you found me
now i know why
i felt like shit when i woke up this morning
