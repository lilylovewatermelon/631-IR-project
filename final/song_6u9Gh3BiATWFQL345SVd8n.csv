she remained with her comrades till dusk and participated with a certain zest in the dancing though being heartwhole as yet she enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake little divining when she saw the soft torments the bitter sweets the pleasing pains and the agreeable distresses of those girls who had been wooed and won what she herself was capable of in that kind the struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to her—no more and when they became fierce she rebuked them

she might have stayed even later but the incident of her fathers odd appearance and manner returned upon the girls mind to make her anxious and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the parental cottage lay

while yet many score yards off other rhythmic sounds than those she had quitted became audible to her sounds that she knew well—so well they were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing in a vigorous gallopade the favourite ditty of the spotted cow—


i saw her lie do′own in yon′der green gro′ove
come love′ and ill tell′ you where′

the cradlerocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a moment and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place of the melody

god bless thy diment eyes and thy waxen cheeks and thy cherry mouth and thy cubits thighs and every bit o thy blessed body

after this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence and the spotted cow proceed as before so matters stood when tess opened the door and paused upon the mat within it surveying the scene

the interior in spite of the melody struck upon the girls senses with an unspeakable dreariness from the holiday gaieties of the field—the white gowns the nosegays the willowwands the whirling movements on the green the flash of gentle sentiment towards the stranger—to the yellow melancholy of this onecandled spectacle what a step besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill selfreproach that she had not returned sooner to help her mother in these domesticities instead of indulging herself outofdoors

there stood her mother amid the group of children as tess had left her hanging over the monday washingtub which had now as always lingered on to the end of the week out of that tub had come the day before—tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse—the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass—which had been wrung up and ironed by her mothers own hands

as usual mrs durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child the cradlerockers had done hard duty for so many years under the weight of so many children on that flagstone floor that they were worn nearly flat in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot flinging the baby from side to side like a weavers shuttle as mrs durbeyfield excited by her song trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long days seething in the suds

nickknock nickknock went the cradle the candleflame stretched itself tall and began jigging up and down the water dribbled from the matrons elbows and the song galloped on to the end of the verse mrs durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while even now when burdened with a young family joan durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune no ditty floated into blackmoor vale from the outer world but tesss mother caught up its notation in a week
there still faintly beamed from the womans features something of the freshness and even the prettiness of her youth rendering it probable that the personal charms which tess could boast of were in main part her mothers gift and therefore unknightly unhistorical

ill rock the cradle for ee mother said the daughter gently or ill take off my best frock and help you wring up i thought you had finished long ago

her mother bore tess no illwill for leaving the housework to her singlehanded efforts for so long indeed joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time feeling but slightly the lack of tesss assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them tonight however she was even in a blither mood than usual there was a dreaminess a preoccupation an exaltation in the maternal look which the girl could not understand

well im glad youve come her mother said as soon as the last note had passed out of her i want to go and fetch your father but whats moren that i want to tell ee what have happened yll be fess enough my poppet when thst know mrs durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect her daughter who had passed the sixth standard in the national school under a londontrained mistress spoke two languages the dialect at home more or less ordinary english abroad and to persons of quality

since ive been away tess asked

ay

had it anything to do with fathers making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon why did er i felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame

that wer all a part of the larry weve been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county—reaching all back long before oliver grumbles time—to the days of the pagan turks—with monuments and vaults and crests and scutcheons and the lord knows what all in saint charless days we was made knights o the royal oak our real name being durberville … dont that make your bosom plim twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee not because hed been drinking as people supposed

im glad of that will it do us any good mother

o yes tis thoughted that great things may come ot no doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as tis known your father learnt it on his way hwome from shaston and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter

where is father now asked tess suddenly

her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer he called to see the doctor today in shaston it is not consumption at all it seems it is fat round his heart a says there it is like this joan durbeyfield as she spoke curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter c and used the other forefinger as a pointer at the present moment he says to your father your heart is enclosed all round there and all round there this space is still open a says as soon as it do meet so—mrs durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete—off you will go like a shadder mr durbeyfield a says you mid last ten years you mid go off in ten months or ten days

tess looked alarmed her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon notwithstanding this sudden greatness
but where is father she asked again

her mother put on a deprecating look now dont you be bursting out angry the poor man—he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pasons news—that he went up to rollivers half an hour ago he do want to get up his strength for his journey tomorrow with that load of beehives which must be delivered family or no hell have to start shortly after twelve tonight as the distance is so long

get up his strength said tess impetuously the tears welling to her eyes o my god go to a publichouse to get up his strength and you as well agreed as he mother

her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room and to impart a cowed look to the furniture and candle and children playing about and to her mothers face

no said the latter touchily i be not agreed i have been waiting for ee to bide and keep house while i go fetch him

ill go

o no tess you see it would be no use

tess did not expostulate she knew what her mothers objection meant mrs durbeyfields jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side in readiness for this contemplated jaunt the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity

and take the compleat fortuneteller to the outhouse joan continued rapidly wiping her hands and donning the garments

the compleat fortuneteller was an old thick volume which lay on a table at her elbow so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type tess took it up and her mother started

this going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of mrs durbeyfields still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children to discover him at rollivers to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval made her happy a sort of halo an occidental glow came over life then troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul the youngsters not immediately within sight seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there she felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing shutting her eyes to his defects of character and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover

tess being left alone with the younger children went first to the outhouse with the fortunetelling book and stuffed it into the thatch a curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted between the mother with her fastperishing lumber of superstitions folklore dialect and orally transmitted ballads and the daughter with her trained national teachings and standard knowledge under an infinitely revised code there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood when they were together the jacobean and the victorian ages were juxtaposed

returning along the garden path tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day she guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it but did not divine that it solely concerned herself dismissing this however she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime in company with her nineyearold brother abraham and her sister elizalouisa of twelve and a half called lizalu the youngest ones being put to bed there was an interval of four years and more between tess and the next of the family the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy and this lent her a deputymaternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors next in juvenility to abraham came two more girls hope and modesty then a boy of three and then the baby who had just completed his first year
all these young souls were passengers in the durbeyfield ship—entirely dependent on the judgement of the two durbeyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence if the heads of the durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither were these halfdozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them—six helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of durbeyfield some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure gets his authority for speaking of natures holy plan

it grew later and neither father nor mother reappeared tess looked out of the door and took a mental journey through marlott the village was shutting its eyes candles and lamps were being put out everywhere she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand

her mothers fetching simply meant one more to fetch tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood

abraham she said to her little brother do you put on your hat—you baint afraid—and go up to rollivers and see what has gone wi father and mother

the boy jumped promptly from his seat and opened the door and the night swallowed him up half an hour passed yet again neither man woman nor child returned abraham like his parents seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn

i must go myself she said

lizalu then went to bed and tess locking them all in started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress a street laid out before inches of land had value and when onehanded clocks sufficiently subdivided the dayembed"
