i still avoid medication
id rather take a vacation
drive around all of the outlets
buy things and later regret it
spend the whole week in hawaii
fall asleep under the palm trees
down a whole bottle of whiskey
counting the people who hate me

chorus
i dont know if ill be alright
what will it take to make this good
oh someone tell me it gets better better better better
because for tonight im just not alright

verse 2
what if i drove to you backwards
jump in the shallow end headfirst
burn my emergency contact
run for the hills when it gets bad
what if i never move out
id live in the basement my whole life
i got the chills when i said that
i never thought of a fallback

i dont know if ill be alright alright
what will it take to make this good
oh someone tell me it gets better better better better
because for tonight im just not alright2embed"
