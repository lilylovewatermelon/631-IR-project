i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

get your fucking hands in the fucking air

goodbye

verse 1
i wipe it off on tile the light is brighter this time
everything is 3d blasphemy
my eyes are red and gold the hair is standing straight up
this is not the way i pictured me
i cant control my shakes how the hell did i get here
something about this so very wrong
i have to laugh out loud i wish i didnt like this
is it a dream or a memory
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likechorus
ive felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

verse 2
get outta my head cuz i dont need this why didnt i see this
but im a victim manchurian candidate
i have sinned by just
making my mind up and taking your breath away

chorus
i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

hold on
hold on
goodbye
bridge
you havent learned a thing
i havent changed a thing
the flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free
you havent learned a thing
i havent changed a thing
the flesh was in my bones
the pain was always free

chorus
i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

i felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

outro
oh london yeah
and it waits for you
thank you so much we fucking love you allembed"
