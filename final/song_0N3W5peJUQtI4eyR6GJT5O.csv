and i put that on my momma and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin out the court buildin woowoo
aw yeah fuck the judge
i made it past twentyfive and there i was
a little nappyheaded nigga with the world behind him
life aint shit but a fat vagina

straight from the bottom this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin king oh yeah
