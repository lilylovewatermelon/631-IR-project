yeah
oh no no no
oh no no no no oh

verse
long as you had a dime
4pf aint shit else that be on your mind
long as you got your cars and toys to drive
i shouldve known i couldnt get your time
long as you got your ice and got your drip
be on them private jets takin trips
come back at six
wake me and your child
and then wont lay the dick
make me wonder who you mightve been layin with
makes me wonder who you think you playin with
im beside myself to keep playin this
record back over and over again
swear that youve changed but i know this the end
long as you on the scene
think you know your girl thats so funny to me
thats why you done got left bout one or two times
got tired of your shit you almost lost your mind mind
long as they call your name
youll continue to try to play these games
leave your family in the cold and rain
and i dont think youll ever change your ways
cause a house is not a home when no ones there
so alone no ones there
should i move on since no ones here
here
you know what you got is good thats why
you refuse to let me walk out your life
but you refuse to match up with my vibe
you keep wastin my time but you keep wastin my timesee summer walker liveget tickets as low as 238you might also like9embed"
