i almost liked the way you fooled me
to make me feel like this would last forever
but twice a night id wake up sweating
to sleep without you here would do me better

chorus
ii ii
called you out and labeled you a problem
ii ii
i should know that it takes one to know one

verse 2
you represent the codependence
i was down you wore the shining armor
the side effect is cold resentment
tricked mе into thinking you were stronger

chorus
ii ii
callеd you out and knew you were my problem
ii ii
i should know that it takes one to know one

outro
hold me slowly
you dont even know me
home now lights out
pictures just destroy me
come through late and
tell me that you want it bad
hold me slowly
you dont even know me
home now lights out
pictures just destroy me
come through late and
tell me that you want it badyou might also like1embed"
