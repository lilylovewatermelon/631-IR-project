free lil stank high speed on the cops he gon control the wheel
lil foenem gon hop out on your block they tryna overkill
might relapse linkin with my gangers make me want a pill
my niggas gone and i got so much anger i dont wanna feel
told her baby tat my name on it so i know its real
but i cant be your knight in shinin armor i dont own a shield
trenches playin foul but we wont drop no flags on the field
foreigns back to back i make em sick so im corona ill
had a bond we grew apart just tryna trust my foolish heart
front line my shooters spark might go and shut down seward park
bullseye like he threw a dart pray my young niggas out movin smart
pray they movin smart

chorus
uh when the lights dim and the crowd lеave
can i count on you to stick around me
show in miami im takin my talents to south bеach
bought a house for my granny i told her rich is what ill be
when youre all on your own without me
hope what i said is what you can now see
i had to shut up all the ones who tried to doubt me
who wouldve thought that silence could sound sweet

verse 2
im tryna evaporate his soul with them bullets
hurt his auntie when she seen him lose his soul on that footage
im from chiraq where theyll roll em doughs when you aint looking uh
they gon fry his top just like a stove leave him cookin
pop out gang i been on the road takin bookings
im the nigga went and did everything they said i couldnt
racin to the top bitch stay in your lane and keep it pushin
playin with my guap thats gon have lil gang nem in your bushes uh
deep up in that water with the sharks and the great whites
i remember days it was dark made me hate life
catch a nigga kill him let it spark broad daylight
told him im the greatest that aint somethin i gotta say twice not somethin

uh when the lights dim and the crowd leave
can i count on you to stick around me
show in miami im takin my talents to south beach
bought a house for my granny i told her rich is what ill be
when youre all on your own without me
hope what i said is what you can now see
i had to shut up all the ones who tried to doubt me
who wouldve thought that silence could sound sweet2embed"
