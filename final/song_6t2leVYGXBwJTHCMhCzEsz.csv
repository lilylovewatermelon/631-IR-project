the first time that i saw you lookin like you did
we were young we were restless just two clueless kids
but if i knew then what i know now
id fall in love

verse 2
on a bus in chicago three rows to the left
you know my heart was racin for you but we never even met
if i knew then what i know now
id fall in love

cause love only comes once in a while
and knocks on your door and throws you a smile
it takes every breath leaves every scar
speaks to your soul and sings to your heart
but if i knew then what i know now
id fall in love

verse 2
on a summer night in august back seat of my car
stead of tryin to get to know you i took it way too far
but if i knew then what i know now
id fall in love
