in the car in the car in the backseat im your baby
we go fast we go so fast we don’t move
i believe in a place you take me
make you real proud of your baby
in your car im a star and im burnin’ through you
in your car im a star and im burnin through you

chorus
oh be my once in a lifetime
lyin on your chest in my party dress
im a fuckin mess but i
oh thanks for the high life
baby its the best passed the test and yes
now i’m here with you and i
would like to think that you would stick around
you know that i’d just die to make you proud
the taste the touch the way we love
it all comes down to make the sound of our love song

verse 2
dream a dream heres a scene
touch me anywhere ’cause im your baby
grab my waist dont waste any part
i believe that you see me for who i am
so spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
is it safe is it safe to just be who we are
is it safe is it safe to just be who we are
