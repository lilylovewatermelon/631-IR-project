i wanna make new plans for a big vacation
i wanna fly out west to a new location
i wanna move off the grid where i hunt and make my clothes oh no
hoping you’ve been all good heard you found a brand new home

chorus
well tell me do you know
youre all i dream about
take it from me
im too dumb to recognise your doubt
well i dont wanna go
im in too far to leave
tell me how you live so easily young and naïve

bridge
i cant feel
i cant feel
talk bad whos that walk back to your place
i think you fake the smile thats on your face

chorus
well tell me do you know
youre all i dream about
take it from me
im too dumb to recognise your doubt
well i dont wanna go
im in too far to leave
tell me how you live so easily young and naïveyou might also like2embed"
