welcome to marvins marvelous mechanical museum
known from coast to coast like butter and toast
from headlines to bread lines
from schoolrooms to pool rooms
no other place in the contiguous united states
or other environs of the world welcome

verse 1 rob cantor
can i get a t t
and if you hit me with the ally then youd see
why the hall is here for yall
the minimall is calling us all in
so kids pack up your moms car back up the windstar
kick it in drive and arrive at the mega mart
slide the side hatch with pride cause your ties match
on booty duty like your name was eddie thatch yarrgh
wwthd
we like to kick it at the university
but all work and no play makes us crazy
so we jump in the bumping suv
hit the street get the sweet tunes on
do a donut on your mamas front lawn
and sooner than you know youve found the rock n roll show
at the tizzy hizzy well be gone

verse 2 zubin sedghi joe hawley marvin yagoda
whos to blame
the automated players i proclaim
yellow tie this suave fellow writes
heterophonic tunes of how love bites
red the proud loud guy we adore
is my amp too high no turn it up more
so grey in the back sippin gnac can hear
hes knockin down the shots like bill laimbeer
send home the locksmith greens got keys
to unlock the rock in the act if you please
now open the case give blue the bass
and jiggle your badiggle all over the place

working the carnival
we like to play it all
welcome to tally hall

verse 3 joe hawley with zubin sedghi
can i get a click
flick off the switch and well ignite the night in pitch
singin songs you like to hear and the world will disappear
then well be glowing in the dark lighting up the park
revealing that the hall is the place that aims to please
with unpredictable games and antiquities
the collectibles so delectable
the unreliable styles undetectable
like i might rap like an english chap
take you by the knickers and a bum youll slap
you didnt think we had the gall
well bloody welcome to tally hall

bridge joe hawley
were stereosonic were animatronic
were rappin with the roboelectronic ebonics
a quick distraction a mechanic attraction
got a penny in your pocket for the slot
rock

prechorus joe hawley rob cantor
hey ho dontcha know
its a good oldfashioned puppet show
thats right quite the set
were the marionette quintet
chorus 2 joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi
we think were playing in a band
but wed love to give you all a hand

chorus 2 joe hawley rob cantor zubin sedghi
we think were playing in a band
but wed love to give you all a hand
