uh cant wait to get home
baby dial your number
can you pick up the phone
cause i wanna holla
daydreaming bout you all day in school cant concentrate
wanna have your voice in my ear
til mama come and says its too late

prechorus
cause the lights are on outside
wish there was somewhere to hide
cause i just dont want to say goodbye
cause you are my baby baby

chorus
nothing really matters
i dont really care
what nobody tell me
im gonna be here
its a matter of extreme importance
my first teenage love affair
