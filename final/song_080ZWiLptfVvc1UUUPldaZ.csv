the end is near my summer days
all great things go away
feel the cold comin round the bend
everythings gonna change again

prechorus
down another day
down another day

verse 2
oh the winter i adore
summers gone forevermore
someday shell come back to me
seasons change to set me free

prechorus
down another day
down another day

chorus
dont have to bore you with details ill never let you down
and in the morning the sunrise will never let you down
if i could hold you tomorrow ill never let you down
and when shes golden the ocean will never let you down

the end is near my winter fling
change is melting everything
now its time to sink below
season come season go

prechorus
down another day
down another day

chorus
dont have to bore you with details ill never let you down
and in the morning the sunrise will never let you down
if i could hold you tomorrow ill never let you down
and when shes golden the ocean will never let you down

i keep saying goodbye
saying goodbye keep saying goodbye
shes always coming back
she keeps coming back she keeps coming back
i keep saying goodbye
saying goodbye keep saying goodbye
shes always coming back
she keeps coming back you keep coming back
chorus
dont have to bore you with details ill never let you down
and in the morning the sunrise will never let you down
if i could hold you tomorrow ill never let you down
and when shes golden the ocean will never let you down
