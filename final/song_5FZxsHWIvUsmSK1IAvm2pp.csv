ive got another confession to make
im your fool
everyones got their chains to break
holdin you
were you born to resist
or be abused

chorus
is someone getting the best
the best the best the best of you

the best the best the best of you
are you gone and on to someone new

verse 2
i needed somewhere to hang my head
without your noose
you gave me something that i didnt have
but had no use
i was too weak to give in
too strong to lose
my heart is under arrest again
but i break loose
my head is giving me life or death
but i cant choose
i swear ill never give in
i refuse
