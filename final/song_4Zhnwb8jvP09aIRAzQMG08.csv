theres nothing to do here
some just whine and complain
in bed at the hospital
coming and going
asleep and awake
in bed at the hospital

verse 2
tell me the story of how you ended up here
ive heard it all in the hospital
nurses are fussin
doctors on tour
somewhere in india

prechorus
i got one friend laying across from me
i did not choose him he did not choose me
weve got no chance of recovery
sharing hospital joy and misery
the joy and misery
the joy and misery

chorus
put out the fire boys dont stop dont stop
put out the fire on us
put out the fire boys dont stop dont stop
put out the fire on us
bring your buckets by the dozens
bring your nieces and your cousins
come put out the fire on us
