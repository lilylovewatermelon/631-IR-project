yeah

verse mac miller
i know its been a minute since ive been away
didnt mean to cause you pain i just needed to escape
aint sayin that im sober im just in a better place
im on my way over im just runnin kinda late
and you know ive been through all the highs
ive seen all the lows lost track of time
im coming home you know my mind
places it goes and it goes and it goes

chorus mac miller
its only a game
dont be afraid
these doors will close
and people change
one day youre gone
right now youre here
dont leave just yet
dont disappear

outro elle varner
