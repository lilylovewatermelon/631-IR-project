ah ah
ah ah

verse 1
i get your messages
i read them all aloud
my friends they roll their eyes
shake their heads
make a frown
but it seems so wellintentioned
and at once im beginning to fall
theres no point to even mention you at all

hook
ah ah

verse 2
i am recording all the doubletalk and lies
my rage a tickin bomb
while im shocked
and i cry
but i know you still remember
that im not very hard to disarm
and you know im no contender to your charms
see lake street dive liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
so stop your crying
you know ill be the one to let you back in let you back in
im so sick of lying
telling myself its the end
i know better
but here i go again

verse 3
i am a photograph
a moment stuck in time ooh
the margins crease the color is beat
and resigned
but the girl i still see clearly
with her heart good and ready to love
its her head that isnt nearly good enough

chorus
so stop your crying
you know ill be the one to let you back in let you back in
im so sick of lying
telling myself its the end
i know better but here i go–

so stop your crying
you know ill be the one to let you back in let you back in
im so sick of lying
telling myself its the end
well stop your crying
you know ill be the one to let you back in
im so sick of lying
telling myself its the end

well now here i go again
well i didnt mean to let you back in
well here i go again
you know i didnt wanna let you back in
oh now here i go again
you know i didnt wanna let you back in
here i go again
you know i didnt wanna–
