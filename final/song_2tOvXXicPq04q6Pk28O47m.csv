if i don’t pick up the phone like i used to for you
don’t you take it personal
if i don’t do all the things that i used to do to you
i ain’t mad at you
if you get to feeling stressed up in your chest thinking that you about to lose baby it’s true
and if you’re losing out on sleep
home worrying about me
that’s how it be

chorus all
if you don’t know now you know
you’re gonna miss my love
and i aint stressing bout a dog gone thing
cause i was true when i gave you my love
if you search you will never find another love like my love
you’re gonna miss me
i aint got time while you sit around and play with my my love
my love

verse 2  michelle kelly  beyoncé
if you think i caught a feeling when i heard about that other chick no
i already knew about it
i just needed time just to clear my mind and ask myself
why i didnt handle him
if you woulda taken care of home instead of leaving me alone i
still would be right there with you
taking care of you
steady loving you like i used to do
you might also likechorus all
if you don’t know now you know
you’re gonna miss my love
and i aint stressing bout a dog gone thing
cause i was true when i gave you my love
if you search you will never find another love like my love
you’re gonna miss me
i aint got time while you sit around and play with my my love
my love

bridge all michelle  beyoncé
there once was a time i blamed myself for what was wrong
i can see so clearly now because you are gone
that’s how i spent all my time when you werent home
playing around with them raggedy heifers
there’ll be no more stressing no more crying no more trying
i would rather be alone i’d rather be all by myself yeah
because this valuable heart of mine was yours until i realized
finally opened my eyes

spoken kelly
you see ladies
i know i knew better
what was i thinking
he gon miss me when im gone
chorus all
if you don’t know now you know
you’re gonna miss my love
and i aint stressing bout a dog gone thing
cause i was true when i gave you my love
if you search you will never find another love like my love
you’re gonna miss me
i aint got time while you sit around and play with my my love
