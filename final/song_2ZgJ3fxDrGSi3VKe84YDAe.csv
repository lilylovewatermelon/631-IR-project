keys are rare and theres a thousand locks
stand in your way
so goes the gold age
your tired life

digging for a way you cast a spell
carve a path from all the things they sell
but they dont let go
just thought you should know either way

chorus
i know what i know
would not fill a thimble
so let my mind go
straight down the runway
does one want to
get more used to
the mall and misery
the debt mounts the cost to be alive

your eyes are burning from the biting cold
if only to learn what youve never been told
that theres a real world
and somewhere a good girl
lives and breathes
you might also likepowdered hope in my callow mind
an idea stolen by the morning tide
now theres a dark time
and this is your dark rhyme
to fill your heart

chorus
i know what i know
would not fill a thimble
so let my mind go
straight down the runway
does one want to
get more used to
the mall and misery
the debt mounts the cost to be alive3embed"
