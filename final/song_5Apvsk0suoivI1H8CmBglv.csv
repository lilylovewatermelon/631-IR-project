i came in from the outside burned out from a joy ride
she likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
played from the bedside is stella by starlight
that was my heart the drums that start off night and day

prechorus
the same kind of music haunts her bedroom
im almost me again shes almost you

chorus
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me

verse 2
tell me who and ill be thanking them
the numbered lovers of duke ellington
do i owe each kiss to lip and cheek
as soft as chet can sing lets get lost
and let the good times roll
let smoke rings from this paper doll
blow sweet and thick till every thought of it dont mean a thing
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeprechorus
i got some colour back she thinks so too
i laugh like me again she laughs like you

chorus
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me

bridge
i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt know where i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt mmm
i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt know where i wouldnt know where
i wouldnt know

verse 3
the very thought of you and am i blue
a love supreme seems far removed
i get along without you very well some other nights
oh the radio news reader chimes
reporting russian lullabies
shell turn to me awake and ask is everything alright
and lord
chorus
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark i wouldnt know where
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me
i wouldnt know where to start
sweet music playing in the dark i wouldnt know where
be still my foolish heart
dont ruin this on me27embed"
