verse 1 big boi
now peter piper picked a pepper that was his downfall
im down with dre 3000 cause he got my back yall
ball if you want to but do it with some class g
ask me do outkast got some flows so you can blast me
nasty niggas on the point they see you shining
engineers in the studio see me rhyming
dont get me wrong got four albums stay consisent
you got a bodyguard i let my nigga tote the biscuit
twist ya cap back you got blood off on ya fur hat
cap cap ya link snapped you slumped off in ya cadillac
for what though some diamonds and a bentley
what you dying for
alright hoe imma bank my cheese and let my mic glow
prioritize to live to tell these other niggas how you
bought yo kid some tennis shoes
let these brothers know that your mama she got her house too
let these niggas know that your sister wouldnt have finished
college without you i doubt you do that though
so do this here and keep that bullshit out of our ear
you too near me to not hear me to open to conceal me
the love for the music keeping big boi spittin real g
