a babys born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
they grab his feet smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
before you know it hes off to school and then he graduates in may
goes out and gets a phd and then cures all sorts of things
wins a nobel prize and saves a million different lives
the worlds a better place for all hes done
its funny when you think about the reason hes alive
its all because two people fell in love

right now at a picnic shelter down by caney creek
youll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
the whole wilson familys lined up filling their paper plates
theyve driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
well stanley wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
that miss emma tucker was the one
now five generations get together every june
all because two people fell in love

chorus
there is nothing not affected
when two hearts get connected
all that is will be or ever was
every single choice we make
every breath we get to take
is all because two people fell in love
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 2
well i recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
and a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
but in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
with a whole lot to help from up above
we met and things sure turned around for me and you
and all because two people fell in love

chorus

tag
you know to me its all so clear
every one of us is here
all because two people fell in love

outro
a babys born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
they grab his feet smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoonembed"
