it was all about a dream
turned into reality doublecup of lean
ugh

verse 1
let me get a oneway ticket havent picked a destination
im just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
packin no bags nothin but the clothes on my back
with a cognac let me sip it tryin to relax
red wine up in my glass plus filet mignon
i got a army right up under me im genghis khan
yeah its me against the world i guess ill take them on
i might stop and see my girl but i aint stayin long
what if im gone what the fuck you gon think then
i told my story put my life inside this ink pen
said ill make it big when everybody know me
well i made it big and everybody phony ha
so could you pour me i need a cup
no none of that liquor mix in purple stuff
i could talk my pain but would it hurt too much
go head judge me hate cost money but this love free

chorus
they just dreams
turn em to reality
doublecup of lean
standin on my balcony
lookin at the sky
thinkin it could all be mine
all we got is memories
so what the fuck is time
they just dreams
turn em to reality
doublecup of lean
standin on my balcony
lookin at the street
thinkin it could all be mine
all we got is memories
so what the fuck is time
what the—
what the fuck is time heh
ask em what the fuck is time i dont know
what the fuck is time
i ask em what the fuck is time

what do you do when you think you could be a icon
cause all these people get to screamin when the lights on
like they just seen a ghost earn my stripes zebra coat
racin to the gate but my flight gone
and now these writers takin shots without a nikon
but i dont fight though figure its a typo
seems we in some shit now gonna be alright though
potion in my sprite then my night slows down down aha
see thats exactly what i need
my khakis filled with cheese my homie sap is on the beat
like it was donald trump a fuckin hit but i just call it luck
they throw it on when im walkin in the club
hey this the burgh shit i dont deserve this
well i dont think you lookin far beyond the surface
learn quick now im big time
fill your cup up and ima sip mine

chorus
fill it up with dreams
turn em to reality
doublecup of lean
standin on my balcony
lookin at the sky
thinkin it could all be mine
all we got is memories
so what the fuck is time
they just dreams
turn em to reality
doublecup of lean
standin on my balcony
lookin at the street
thinkin it could all be mine
all we got is memories
so what the fuck is time
what the—
what the fuck is time heh
ask em what the fuck is time i dont know
what the fuck is time
i ask em what the fuck is time
