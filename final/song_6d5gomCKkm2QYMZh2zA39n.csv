for the worlds events have rumbled on since those gagged days
like traffic checked while at the crossing of cityways
and the haunted gap in your mind has filled with thoughts that flow
like clouds in the lit heaven of life and youre a man reprieved to go
taking your peaceful share of time with joy to spare
but the past is just the sameand wars a bloody game
have you forgotten yet
look down and swear by the slain of the war that youll never forget

do you remember the dark months you held the sector at mametz
the nights you watched and wired and dug and piled sandbags on parapets
do you remember the rats and the stench
of corpses rotting in front of the frontline trench
and dawn coming dirtywhite and chill with a hopeless rain
do you ever stop and ask is it all going to happen again

do you remember that hour of din before the attack
and the anger the blind compassion that seized and shook you then
as you peered at the doomed and haggard faces of your men
do you remember the stretchercases lurching back
with dying eyes and lolling headsthose ashengrey
masks of the lads who once were keen and kind and gay
have you forgotten yet
look up and swear by the green of the spring that youll never forget4embed"
