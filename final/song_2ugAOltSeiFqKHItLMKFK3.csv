verse 1
fire and caffeine a lot of nicotine
im gonna burn so i better tell you everything
the competition the superstition
nevermind cause youre never going to give in
its a crisis just how you like it
the same drama in a different disguise
im bound to walk with a target on my back
at least im ready for another attack

chorus
the lord of lies the morning star
you had to be set free
opposing sides your choices are
the negative one and me yeah

verse 2
svengali why are we the enemies
i never follow and i never make apologies
your dementias are gonna get you
because your walls cant support each other
settle for the cynical youre so political
youre getting ready cause the first move is critical
reciprocity somebodys listening
what did we learn from our time in captivity

contaminate
succumb to the selfish creation
your failure yeah

verse 3
no accountability divisibility
i point a finger but its always looking back at me
the centipedes pulling on the mechanism
unearthing scars of the cataclysm
when the innocent begin to circumvent
the color fades but the picture is vibrant
what do you believe does it matter now
turn away the killer is disavowed
chorus
the lord of lies the morning star

when your world goes up in flames
and as you die you see my face
youre the only one to blame
