she asked me son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me

lived ever after happily

chorus
she asked me son when i grow old
will you buy me a house of gold
and when your father turns to stone
will you take care of me
i will make you queen of everything you see
ill put you on the map ill cure you of disease

and life turns plans up on their head
