there are times i think about that fateful day
i threw your love away
every time i see that look upon your face
the same one that you made
when your fragile world was crashing down around you
you realized your place
and the darkness that you try so hard to subdue
it causes you to change
but baby baby please dont leave me please dont leave me
i know i made a big mistake dont turn my sunshine to shade
baby please dont leave me please dont leave me
i know this is a game we play
youre always taking my breath away

verse 2 daniel caesar
shoulda left you a long time ago
all my niggas done told me so
all my niggas all my niggas all my niggas
but my niggas dont hold me tight
when im sleepin in my bed at night only you
shoulda left a long time ago shoulda left a long time ago
all my niggas done told me so all my niggas done told me so
but my niggas dont hold me tight but my niggas dont hold me tight
when im sleepin in my bed at night only you
babe i know i fucked up
fucked with some empty cups
but you got your friends too
but you got your friends too
better believe it
in truth im up on my luck cant stop runnin amok
but you got your friends too
but you got your friends too
better believe it iyou might also like6embed"
