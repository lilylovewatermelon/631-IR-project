two broken hearts lonely lookin like houses
where nobody lives
two people each havin so much pride inside
neither side forgives

chorus
the angry words spoken in haste
such a waste of two lives
its my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
in the number of husbands and wives

bridge
a woman and a man a man and a woman
some can some cant some cant

verse 2
oh two broken hearts lonely lookin like houses
where nobody lives
two people each havin so much pride inside
neither side forgives

chorus
the angry words spoken in haste
such a waste of two lives
oh its my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
in the number of husbands and wives
