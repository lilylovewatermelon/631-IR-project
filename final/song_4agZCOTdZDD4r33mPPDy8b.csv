and i am thankful for her kind of lovin
cause its simple

no longer do we wonder if were together
were way past that
and ive already asked her
so in january were gettin married

shes talkin to me with her voice
down so low i barely hear her
but i know what shes sayin
i understand because my heart and hers are the same
and in january were gettin married

and i was sick with heartache
and she was sick like audrey hepburn when i met her
but we would both surrender
true love is not the kind of thing you should turn down
dont ever turn it down

i hope that i dont sound too insane when i say
there is darkness all around us
i dont feel weak but i do need sometimes for her to protect me
and reconnect me to the beauty that im missin
and in january were gettin married
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeno longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in
she knows which birds are singin
and the names of the trees where theyre performin in the mornin
and in january were gettin married
come january lets get married1embed"
