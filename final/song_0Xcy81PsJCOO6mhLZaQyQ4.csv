holdin my breath this aint what i expected

outro
yeah tell me you love me spin me around
pretty please pick me up in the air and dont put me down
seen it all unfold sat back and watched
knowin time dont give a fuck about clocks until they stop
bare feet runnin late her car started
even though the only thing that she drivin a hard bargain
more important is im kinda sorta out the door but
she put me back together when im out of order
