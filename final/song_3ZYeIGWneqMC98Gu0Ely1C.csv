i close my eyes and i smile
knowing that everything is alright
to the core so close that door
is this happening
my breath is on your hair im unaware
that you opened the blinds and let the city in
god you held my hand and we stared
just taking in everything

chorus
and i knew it from the start
so my arms are open wide
your head is on my stomach and were
were trying so hard not to fall asleep
here we are
on this 18th floor balcony were both flying away

verse 2
so we talked about moms and dads about family pasts
just getting to know where we came from
our hearts were on display for all to see
i cant believe this is happening to me and
i raised my hand as if to show you that i was yours
that i was so yours for the taking im so yours for the taking
thats when i felt the wind pick up
i grabbed the rail while choking up
these words to say and then you kissed me yeah
