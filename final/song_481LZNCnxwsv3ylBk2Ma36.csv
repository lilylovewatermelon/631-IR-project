well i guess old men on the street prove that time really does fly
and i guess pawn shop diamond rings proves that girls love goodbyes
and i guess a black dress at a funeral means that life has one sting
and i guess a girl like you lovin me must mean angels love anything

chorus
’cause im a messed up kid nothin to spare
i’ll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin through your hair
im a messed up kid with nothin to show
except a girl sayin shell be here everywhere i go
im a messed up kid

verse 2
well my old man says im wild and my mama says i’m reckless
and that color in your eyes reminds me of east texas

chorus
i’m a messed up kid nothin to spare
i’ll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin through your hair
im a messed up kid

postchorus
messed up kid nothin to show
except a girl sayin she’ll be here everywhere i go

chorus
cause im a messed up kid nothin to spare
ill turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin through your hair

except a girl sayin shell be here everywhere i go
im a messed up kid nothin to spare
ill turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin through your hair
