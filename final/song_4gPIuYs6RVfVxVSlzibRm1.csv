love love love love
hate oh hate
hell oh hell
fire oh fire

verse 1
well love
you make it in your bed
you relive it in your head
but we all know how this is gonna end
and hate
it tries to be your friend
tries to tell you how to feel
but we all know how this is gonna end

verse 2
and hell
is where youre gonna go
just to stand amongst the fire
and burn all the bridges that you know
just to stand amongst the fire
and burn all the bridges that you know

verse 3
well rage
it pushes you around
tries to get under your skin
but we all know youve already hit the ground
and lust
it played you like a fool
you bang your head against the wall
cause we all know youve got to keep it cool
