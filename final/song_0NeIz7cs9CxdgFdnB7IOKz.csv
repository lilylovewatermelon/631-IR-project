of late its harder just to go outside
to leave this dead space with hatred so alive

prechorus
writhing with sickness thrown into banality i decay
killed by the weakness but forced to return turn it off

chorus
i watch the stars as they fall from the sky
i held a fallen star and it wept for me dying
i feel the fallen stars encircle me now as they cry

verse 2
out there so quickly grows malignant tribes
posthuman extinction excels unrecognized

prechorus 2
feeling surrounded so bored with mortality i decay
all of this hatred is fucking real turn it on yeah

chorus
i watch the stars as they fall from the sky
i held a fallen star and it wept for me dying
i feel the fallen stars encircle me now as they cry

and i disintegrate cause this hate is fucking real
and i hope to shade the world as stars go out and i disintegrate1embed"
