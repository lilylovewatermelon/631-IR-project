now as the summer fades i let you slip away
you say im not your type but i can make you sway
it makes you burn to learn youre not the only one
id let you be if you put down your blazing gun

prechorus
now youve gone somewhere else far away
i dont know if i will find you find you find you
but you feel my breath on your neck
cant believe im right behind you right behind you

chorus
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight

verse 2
sometimes you move so well its hard not to give in
im lost i cant tell where you end and i begin
it makes me burn to learn youre with another man
i wonder if hes half the lover that i am

prechorus
now youve gone somewhere else far away
i dont know if i will find you find you find you
but you feel my breath on your neck
cant believe im right behind you right behind you

cause you keep me coming back for more

baby baby please believe me
find it in your heart to reach me
promise not to leave me behind promise not to leave me behind
take me down but take it easy
make me think but dont deceive me
torture me by taking your time talk to me talk to me

chorus
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
and if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonight
torture me yeah torture me
keep me coming back for more coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we got much further than i thought wed get tonightembed"
