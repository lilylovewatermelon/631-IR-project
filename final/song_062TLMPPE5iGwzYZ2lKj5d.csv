ayy pull up lam

verse 1
they aint doing they job they aint serve and protectin
even street niggas need that love and affection
big homies not big homies they aint tryna give direction
the advice they gave to me i told them niggas they couldve kept it
couldve stayed on the porch but jumped inside the streets i had a selection
aint no back and forth talkin on the net we send a message
we want the king we want that tiger head like the nigga off of tekken
put blood sweat and tears inside this shit you gotta respect it
you aint did shit for the streets so how you gon put a word in
ima do what all i can do but i aint never say i was perfect
man that gun heavy palms sweaty you acting nervous
put a hundred thousand on his head thats two verses
the county days i used to wake up wash up with the jergens
she told me three niggas she fucked when i went in she was a virgin
and i cant hang around no bitch niggas im too allergic
an iphone plus an iphone two jail calls i merge it

chorus
the one i called my brother not my brother cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
i cant tell a nigga that i met that i love him i be lying i dont love him
get in my feelings when i pop all prescriptions i take all these pills and i crush em
if you aint known for having cash or that bag they gon treat you like you nothing
you might also likeverse 2
dont be telling me bout your block nigga fuck them
you cant bring your ass around if you say fuck twin
into it with us kiss your kids make sure they tucked in
two fifties in a millennium clip thats a buckten
the one you look up to a pussy his nuts tucked in
aint hide the guns fast enough the police rushed in
and since you died for your gang you got slumped in
you pull up bleeding out that pussy you gotta suck it in
you signed your name up on that statement you got the best font
you asked me do i love you mhm im nonchalant
went on the gram seen an opp died thats when i sparked a blunt
maybe sipped a lil lean too but thats not the point
a lot of money through western union get you a blocked account
im on camera i got a case so foenem knock em out
we move the same we all as one thats what im talking bout
im the same you touch my chain foenem chalk em out yeah yeah

chorus
the one i called my brother not my brother cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
i cant tell a nigga that i met that i love him i be lying i dont love him
get in my feelings when i pop all prescriptions i take all these pills and i crush em
if you aint known for having cash or that bag they gon treat you like you nothing1embed"
