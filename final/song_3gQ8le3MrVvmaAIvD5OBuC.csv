it was a friday night win and followed by a saturday bruise
it was a first blue ribbon my dad and i drank baptized on glenville lake
a tear in our eyes the night we lost all we had to lose

that tobacco town where i grew up
the tailgate down on a jacked up truck
a ring we earned cause we owned that state
a tombstone with my daddys name
now the six string dream on a crazy course
has got my compass losing north
and i need someone to remind me who i am
oh carolina can

it was faded blue denim on franklin street
a hes not buzz a house band beat
it was a summer heat dragging me to a fifth year fall
it was classes skipped cause the room couldnt teach
what we learned three days on wrightsville beach
with my high school love short hair
and that sweet hometown southern drawl

that tobacco town where i grew up
the tailgate down on a jacked up truck
a ring we earned cause we owned that state
a tombstone with my daddys name
now the six string dream on a crazy course
has got my compass losing north
and i need someone to remind me who i am
yeah carolina can
carolina can

another night another show to play
oh hey mr taylor she aint only on your mind

that tobacco town where i grew up
the tailgate down on a jacked up truck
a ring we earned cause we owned that state
a tombstone with my daddys name
the six string dream on a crazy course
has got my compass losing north
and i need someone to remind me who i am
yeah when i need someone to remind me who i am
yeah carolina can
