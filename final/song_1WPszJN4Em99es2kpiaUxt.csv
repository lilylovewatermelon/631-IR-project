drum dummie
drum dummie made the beat and im gon kill it

chorus
in this life ive been scarred
so i walk around with my guard guard
and they quick to say lil nuni trippin
i think about my past and get in my feelings okay
i think about the people who desert me okay
i think about the ones who didnt deserve me okay yeah
think about the ones who did me dirty okay
i wont let you close enough to hurt me okay yeah

verse
and ive been stayin to myself ive been movin lowkey
cause i dont know you and nigga you dont know me
i dont need no new homeboys nigga im straight
you can keep your handshakes these niggas snakes i play it safe
and sometimes i wish bae could understand okay
that i am not your average man okay
aint insecure im just hurtin
tryna find out is you worth it
openin up make me worried
and new faces make me nervous
like where these niggas was when we was slidin in my acura
now they wanna pop up cause them rs is in the back of us
and we be state to state promoters always got them racks for us
new niggas come round i disappear like perry the platypus
