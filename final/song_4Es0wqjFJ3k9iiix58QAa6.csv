i am an actor or an actress or whatever
got a fancy college theatre degree
i told myself id be on broadway by thirty
but then i blinked and poof i turned thirtythree

its a game of survival
but hey thats the biz
and new york is mad expensive but the good news is
ive got temping skills to pay my bills
thats my scheme till my dream comes true
so i do what i dont really do

so i can do what i do do

jane
its not so bad i answer calls i print reports
when no ones looking use an office supply

i type and file while i hum stephen schwartz
crammed in my corner of the corporate sky

every jobs got something that makes it easy to bear
like this swanky midtown office overlooking times square
out my window i see a broadway marquee
and to me thats a hell of a view
reminding me i do what i dont really do

boxman
ticking noise

jane
so i can do what i do do

ensemble
do do do
doobie doobie
doobie doobie

jane
a survival job is a stepping stone
before you become who you are
i mean madonna was a coat check girl
before she became a global star
meryl streep waited tables
marlon brando he dug ditches
liza and barbara and patti lupone 
never had a day job

all
bitches

jane
but harrison ford and jesus christ
both survived on carpentry
they paid their dues on the road to greatness
just like me
