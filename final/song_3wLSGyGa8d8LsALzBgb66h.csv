woke up and i feel like shit
i dont remember last night im getting sick of this
i hit the bottle when i got off stage
and got piss drunk stupid and i went in a rage
i think i mighta got in a fight
because my knuckles were bloody and i dont feel alright
i hit the bottom and i dont even care
you say im going to hell but i am already there

prechorus
sick and tired of being sick and tired

chorus
i wanna be free from this ball and chain and
be free from this life of pain and
be free from this ball and chain
i wanna be free from you

verse 2
now im full of guilt and shame
i cant point a finger cause theres no one to blame
so i say ill never do it again
but when the sun goes down you are my only friend
im thinking i am starting to see
i have become everything i never wanted to be
im really getting sick of myself
cause when i look into the mirror i see somebody else
