yeah

verse
never thought id be talkin from this perspective
but im not really sure what else you expected
when the higherups have all come together as a collective
with conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40 did you get the message
cause i just checked my phone and i didnt get it
i mean ill say hats off for a solid effort
but we didnt flinch for a second we got our shit together 6
yeah not here to fight wars
but niggas wanna talk high scores
party just dipped off in a white porsche
and i just came from dinner where i ate some welldone seared scallops that were to die for
but i got bigger fish to fry
im talkin bigger shit than you and i
kids are losin lives got me scared of losin mine
and if i hold my tongue about it i get crucified
wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
flyin over chattanooga out here tryna spread the movement
i just got me the mercedes pullman
you niggas never heard of it you gotta hit up google yeah
back in the city shit is gettin brutal
these kidsll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
they been droppin out on both sides
we aint in it we just ghostride
the pen is workin if you niggas need some ghost lines
i thought you wanted yours like i want mine
i guess you just makin moves on your own time
but just know itll be january in no time
and your absence is very concernin
its like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin
shit is purely for sport i need a 30 for 30
banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey yeah
i got a club in the raptors arena
championship celebrations durin regular season
paternity testin for women that i never slept with
im legally obligated if they request it
so much legal action like im michael jackson
luckily im great at avoidin distraction
used to give no reaction now im overreacting
aw nigga that shit gotta go platinum
i just listened to closer to my dreams
wideeyed and uneducated at nineteen
i cant rap like that all young and naïve
not after all the shit i seen and the things i believe
drastically changin thank you for all your patience
im just in a different space and i choose to embrace it
four thousand square feet just isnt as spacious
you loved me back in the basement guess it is what we make it
im tired of awkward exchanges and niggas crooked ways
tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
peyton and eli when niggas called me they brother
the season start and i dont wanna see you end up with nothin
yall throw the word family around too much in discussion
rookie season i wouldve never thought this was comin
they knees give out and they passin to you all of the sudden
now you the one gettin buckets
they put they arm around you now you becomin the crutches
kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
and women that you seen on tv look better in person
and either they wanna fuck you
or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there but
these aint the girls from brampton this aint that local action
the hate is just bringin me and my people closer actually
what happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen
are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened
we just supposed to get the pie then split it in two
supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you
my plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
and treat the money like secrets keep the shit to ourself
papi champú young pablito de seis dios
6 god i think i
was destined for this shit when i was round keyshia cole and ti
and young dro was poppin off with aint i
way before niggas had they hands out like they doin macarena
but who am i to complain now im still around they know
