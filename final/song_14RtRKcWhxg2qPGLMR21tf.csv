ten ms up nigga lets go
he a dreadhead mhm my bro leave him dead in front that store
on three different drugs tryna take away my pain but its still gon flow
try my hardest to put a smile on top my mans but he still cant cope

verse 1
on the highway out the window do somethin
need it my way bam bam shoot somethin
he a head hunter rude boy trust nothin
she got a nice round bum but cant pay her nothin
do a hit real sick it be cold the wholе summer
i cant figure how she comin ima givе her to my mama
any minute ima cut a nigga knowin ima slime him
everything goin bad you can trust him still time him
niggas steady reppin we be shootin at the bitch
sound of the stick goin boom when it hit
sound of the smoke real loud when its lit
still let it off with a crowd in the midst
black card matte stick im it
dont pick die if you try one trick
right gang but she say wrong bitch
young rich nigga he done took the wrong fix
overdose cant shake back no
harbor freight get the jack from the store
white trace thats a whole lotta snow
ridin bumpin kirk with a 30 and a pole
with a young bitch she dont want me its vivid
but i dont need her hand when im runnin up benjis
real deal business this real blood business
really spill those dead bodies in the trenches
real slime that was my partner for a minute
contract from my brother when them hollows got up in it
dodgin bullets in the car when them shottas sent them in it
all praise to allah one was dead in less than sixty
we gon burn them forensics leave em dead if he miss it
should have aimed when you shot it dont fuck with my bodies
ima foreign my engine take luxury narcotics
why they cookin im watchin die protectin that body
through the house the aroma it cover the closet
i dont say that aint it but i still wan cop it
ima flood out this bitch to whoever come cop it
police ran in this bitch no one say nothin about it
i aint got nothin i wanna do better with my life but take narcotics with my life
collect these bodies with your life send it to the most highest
nigga showin off got it took when he got it
nigga ran off tell me what you doin bout it
you dont know off the dome shit cant write
with the glock when you see the kid on sight
bullets started playin round with tension got focused
got another pack rolled up he gon smoke it
ten grand twenty grand all night scope
were up all day high were up all day slow

verse 2
herm steady talkin bout top just let me shoot him no
i cant teach a nigga shit i can make it out him
i aint need no tutor been advanced for the road
doped up two or three tools doin shows
forty on my teeth and two hundred for my pole
three hundred for my car extra sneeze for the nose
i be runnin to the money soon as it reach my phone
i aint got nothin i wanna do better with my life but take narcotics with my life
collect these bodies with your life send it to the most highest
