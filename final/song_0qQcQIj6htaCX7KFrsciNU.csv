im crying everyones tears
and there inside our private war i died the night before
and all of these remnants of joy and disaster
what am i supposed to do
i want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
but nothin would change nothin would change at all
its just a day that brings it all about
just another day and nothings any good

chorus
the djs playing the same song
i have so much to do i have to carry on
i wonder if this grief will ever let me go
i feel like i am the king of sorrow
the king of sorrow

verse 2
i suppose i could just walk away
will i disappoint my future if i stay
its just a day that brings it all about
just another day and nothings any good

chorus
the djs playing the same song
i have so much to do i have to carry on
i wonder will this grief ever be gone
will it ever go
im the king of sorrow
the king of sorrow

im crying everyones tears
i have already paid for all my future sins
theres nothing anyone can say to take this away
its just another day and nothings any good

outro
im the king of sorrow
king of sorrow
king of sorrow
king of sorrow
sorrow
king of sorrow
king of sorrow
