verse 1
i get mad zooted i got this bad thing i recruited
my passion is a movie i say fuck her cause i screwed her
i stay on miley cyrus everywhere i go im screwed up
i know my texas niggas got my back and thats for sure though
sippin on easter pink like its tanqueray
we aint never gon give this perfect life up
i know the boys saying they gettin to the money over there
baby trust me these niggas nothin like us
i put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
i gave her realness and that’s all she gonna get from me
bona fide superstar im straight up out the hooduh
i just did a dose of percocets with some strippers

chorus
i just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
i just poured this lean in my cup like its liquor
i just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
i just tried acid for the first time i feel good

treasure bring misery codeine in my delivery
i pulled up in a big b swervin like a hippie
movin with the dopers and pushers
in the rover duckin undercover huggin the interstate
coppin a couple cakes and the drum hangin under me
got a chain hangin over me
god watching over me all my angels watch over me
i bag it like groceries keep some cash flowing over me
got some money all in my hand and i stack it all under me
the young niggas under me they gon stand up in any war
we built this shit ground up like the head of a seminar
i talk for the real ones
i talk for them niggas that feel this shit out in belgium
freeband gang

chorus
i just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
i just poured this lean in my cup like its liquor
i just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
i just tried acid for the first time i feel good35embed"
