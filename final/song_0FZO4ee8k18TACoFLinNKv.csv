verse 1
ayy bitch i showed you how i operate now come get with the gang blrrrd
we aint just doing no recruitin you gotta go work on your aim blrrrd
i kept it true i was just chasin money it came with the fame
and im a drug addict like fredo ruthless tote my fredo bang blrrrd
yeah i got rich but stayed the same just fell asleep in the mulsanne the new mulsanne
two new shooters got no names no names
they asked to whack something for they chain
i told em i got them a extra bonus if they hit his brain
id just rather chew a percocet than talk about my pain blrrrd

chorus
boogers fallin out my cartier new diamonds in the face they in the face

choppers in a bigass thirty ridin round bumpin murder day its murder day

verse 2
cg live like afghanistan hit your block with a thousand dracs a thousand shots
big shiesty move like talibans always messed up wont see my face wont never cut my face
chop shoot like a cameraman hollow tip fill up all your space
almost blew my engine doing a race srt how we got away
always slammin shit thats what we on they say its gon come back one day
its disrespectful tellin me be careful know i play the dangerous way
exotic gen 5 tan and gray throwed off i get the stang valeted
supportin the opps get dropped the same way
if i tell them car wash they hop out then spray
prechorus
everybody claim they demons til the time to go down to they place
investigators know whats up leave out no i aint got shit to say get that phone out my face
its cge forever one time for my members in the cage
all them snitches gon get put away know we whack shit the choppa way

chorus
ayy boogers fallin out my cartier new diamonds in the face they in the face
turnin up on stage cause i could be gone for a murder case
choppers in a bigass thirty ridin round bumpin murder day its murder day
we been slidin for ten days straight i couldnt get no sleep til the eighth until the eighth
we been slidin for ten days straight i couldnt get no sleep til the eighth until the eighth
opps aint never sendin shots let me find out they choppa fate
im cheatin on my glizzy i fell in love how that choppa quake
ima show you how i operate now come live life the choppa way
