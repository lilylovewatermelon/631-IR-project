have you ever had a thing for a woman
a thing that make you lose your mind
every time you start to think about her
sends shivers up and down your spine

my daddy was a bit of a rounder
said women gonna make you go blind
i told my old man im right over here
and i like the way i see just fine

chorus
im a son of a ramblin man
son of the runnin kind
im a son of a ramblin man
i come from a long long line

verse 2
now im just a hillbilly gypsy
and i aint one for settling down
if i thought somebody might miss me
hell maybe id hang around

but i got to keep on movin
cause every towns just a little too small
aint a thing in the world i dont love about a woman
imma gonna try to love em all
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus x3
cause im a son of a ramblin man
son of the runnin kind
im a son of a ramblin man
i come from a long long line

outro
i come from a long long linеembed"
