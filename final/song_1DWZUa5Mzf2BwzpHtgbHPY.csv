i spent the whole day in my head
do a little spring cleanin
im always too busy dreamin
well maybe i should wake up instead
a lot of things i regret but i just say i forget
why cant it just be easy
why does everybody need me to stay
oh i hate the feelin
when youre high but youre underneath the ceilin
got the cards in my hand i hate dealin yeah
get everything i need then im gone but it aint stealin
can i get a break
i wish that i could just get out my goddamn way
what is there to say
there aint a better time than today
well maybe ill lay down for a little yeah
instead of always tryin to figure everything out
and all i do is say sorry
half the time i dont even know what im sayin it about

chorus
good news good news good news
thats all they wanna hear
no they dont like it when im down
but when im flyin oh
it make em so uncomfortable
so different whats the difference

when it aint that bad
it could always be worse
im runnin out of gas hardly anything left
hope i make it home from work
well so tired of bein so tired
why i gotta build somethin beautiful just to go set it on fire
im no liar but
sometimes the truth dont sound like the truth
maybe cause it aint
i just love the way it sound when i say it yeah
its what i do
if you know me it aint anything new
wake up to the moon havent seen the sun in a while
but i heard that the skys still blue yeah
i heard they dont talk about me too much no more
and thats the problem with a closed door

chorus
good news good news good news
thats all they wanna hear
no they dont like it when im down
but when im flyin oh
it make em so uncomfortable
so different whats the difference
verse 3
theres a whole lot more for me waitin on the other side
im always wonderin if it feel like summer
i know maybe im too late i could make it there some other time
ill finally discover
that theres a whole lot more for me waitin
that theres a whole lot more for me waitin
i know maybe im too late i could make it there some other time
then ill finally discover
that it aint that bad aint so bad
well it aint that bad mm
at least it dont gotta be no more

outro
