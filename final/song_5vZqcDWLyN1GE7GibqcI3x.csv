free my nigga julio
i dropped a purple tesla you who i do it for
gave my dawg a life sentence robbin jewelry stores
he just want a tesla truck so i did it for em
if you fuck with murda its a homicide
make sure i send pictures to him behind the mall

chorus
i still got them purple stamps i run with the murder camp
aint through with the perkys yet im still poppin perkys i keep poppin perkys
might fuck round and overdose

verse
they gave up on fourth and goal
i was stressin for twenty months
i came home and killed the ho twentyone
twеntyone bitch im a savage baby
gucci on me likе im radric davis
i put a stash in the frigerator
hope they dont think they intimidatin
yeah i might pull up with becky g
i was rich i was seventeen
they was callin my destiny you can go and ask stephanie
she was callin me pressure back when i was little
even though they be hatin they see the potential
my family big and i grew up round killers
even though ima kid ima go get my man
i hit the strip ima fuck off some bands
i got me a lil bitch i dont fuck all my fans

she comin like ándale
i want all my money no under pay know im sayin
i still got a purple stamp i aint goin commercial yet
i still got a purple stamp i aint goin commercial yet
bought my brother a purple lex but he still got a white one too
aint no pump fakin ima shoot know im sayin
gettin back when i was in school
they say them lil niggas be on the news
we gon send a bitch on the news
got a purple stamp on the door purple stamp on the envelope
ima send him to state prison encouragin niggas behind the fences
might put the penny on twentysixes
my baby girl panties be steady drippin
they sleepin on me martin luther king
i only drink belaire cause i get paid
my mama got amethyst on her chain
smokin the cannabis keep me sane
me and my dawg fucked the same thing
we lost our virginity seventh grade
so over you now cant hear your name
i think blue nile is the best fragrance
i went gold on a purple tesla
she inhaling my rich leather
every time you see me she be droolin
i keep these lil bitches drooling
aint passing im getting greedy with this blunt
im living off fifty gs for this month yeah yeah
im living off fifty gs for this month
im smoking on caviar eating on caviar
whole pint of purple screens in the trunk
