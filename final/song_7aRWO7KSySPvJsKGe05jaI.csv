ive been missing all the vital signs
that i needed for love to work
engine of a heart that would not start
had to jump it so much it hurt
everytime i looked under the hood
it was always a mystery
you pulled up in a rescue truck and
showed up with a master key
and revved it up for me

chorus
my pulse was nearly gone
i was almost in need of a defibrillator
i didnt know what went wrong
i had to shake it off but i got stuck
oh my god you turned all my loose strings
youre the love innovator that brings
all the right tools you know what to do
fine tune
fine tune

verse 2
you started tweaking on a little knob
that i didnt even know was there
kissing on my wrist all the way to my neck
running your fingers through my hair
i felt like i was dizzy and i didnt think i could drive
you flipped a switch hotwired my gears
yeah you put me in line
and now im running right
