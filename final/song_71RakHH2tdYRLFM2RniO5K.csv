in 1992 the chicago city council enacted the gang congregation ordinance which prohibits criminal street gang members from loitering with one another or with other persons in any public place the question presented is whether the supreme court of illinois correctly held that the ordinance violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitutionibefore the ordinance was adopted the city councils committee on police and fire conducted hearings to explore the problems created by the citys street gangs and more particularly the consequences of public loitering by gang members witnesses included residents of the neighborhoods where gang members are most active as well as some of the aldermen who represent those areas based on that evidence the council made a series of findings that are included in the text of the ordinance and explain the reasons for its enactment1

the council found that a continuing increase in criminal street gang activity was largely responsible for the citys rising murder rate as well as an escalation of violent and drug related crimes it noted that in many neighborhoods throughout the city the burgeoning presence of street gang members in public places has intimidated many law abiding citizens  177 ill 2d 440 445 687 n e 2d 53 58 1997 furthermore the council stated that gang members establish control over identifiable areas    by loitering in those areas and intimidating others from entering those areas and    members of criminal street gangs avoid arrest by committing no offense punishable under existing laws when they know the police are present      ibid it further found that loitering in public places by criminal street gang members creates a justifiable fear for the safety of persons and property in the area  and that aggressive action is necessary to preserve the citys streets and other public places so that the public may use such places without fear  moreover the council concluded that the city has an interest in discouraging all persons from loitering in public places with criminal gang members  ibid

the ordinance creates a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to 500 imprisonment for not more than six months and a requirement to perform up to 120 hours of community service commission of the offense involves four predicates first the police officer must reasonably believe that at least one of the two or more persons present in a public place  is a criminal street gang member  second the persons must be loitering  which the ordinance defines as remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose  third the officer must then order all  of the persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area  fourth a person must disobey the officers order if any person whether a gang member or not disobeys the officers order that person is guilty of violating the ordinance ibid2

two months after the ordinance was adopted the chicago police department promulgated general order 924 to provide guidelines to govern its enforcement3 that order purported to establish limitations on the enforcement discretion of police officers to ensure that the antigang loitering ordinance is not enforced in an arbitrary or discriminatory way chicago police department general order 924 reprinted in app to pet for cert 65a the limitations confine the authority to arrest gang members who violate the ordinance to sworn members of the gang crime section and certain other designated officers4 and establish detailed criteria for defining street gangs and membership in such gangs id at 66a—67a in addition the order directs district commanders to designate areas in which the presence of gang members has a demonstrable effect on the activities of law abiding persons in the surrounding community and provides that the ordinance will be enforced only within the designated areas id at 68a—69a the city however does not release the locations of these designated areas to the public5iiduring the three years of its enforcement6 the police issued over 89000 dispersal orders and arrested over 42000 people for violating the ordinance7 in the ensuing enforcement proceedings 2 trial judges upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance but 11 others ruled that it was invalid8 in respondent youkhanas case the trial judge held that the ordinance fails to notify individuals what conduct is prohibited and it encourages arbitrary and capricious enforcement by police9

the illinois appellate court affirmed the trial courts ruling in the youkhana case10 consolidated and affirmed other pending appeals in accordance with youkhana11 and reversed the convictions of respondents gutierrez morales and others12 the appellate court was persuaded that the ordinance impaired the freedom of assembly of nongang members in violation of the first amendment to the federal constitution and article i of the illinois constitution that it was unconstitutionally vague that it improperly criminalized status rather than conduct and that it jeopardized rights guaranteed under the fourth amendment13

the illinois supreme court affirmed it held that the gang loitering ordinance violates due process of law in that it is impermissibly vague on its face and an arbitrary restriction on personal liberties 177 ill 2d at 447 687 n e 2d at 59 the court did not reach the contentions that the ordinance creates a status offense permits arrests without probable cause or is overbroad ibid

in support of its vagueness holding the court pointed out that the definition of loitering in the ordinance drew no distinction between innocent conduct and conduct calculated to cause harm14 moreover the definition of loiter provided by the ordinance does not assist in clearly articulating the proscriptions of the ordinance id at 451452 687 n e 2d at 6061 furthermore it concluded that the ordinance was not reasonably susceptible to a limiting construction which would affirm its validity15

we granted certiorari 523 u s 1071 1998 and now affirm like the illinois supreme court we conclude that the ordinance enacted by the city of chicago is unconstitutionally vagueiiithe basic factual predicate for the citys ordinance is not in dispute as the city argues in its brief the very presence of a large collection of obviously brazen insistent and lawless gang members and hangerson on the public ways intimidates residents who become afraid even to leave their homes and go about their business that in turn imperils community residents sense of safety and security detracts from property values and can ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods16 the findings in the ordinance explain that it was motivated by these concerns we have no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating conduct would be constitutional17 but this ordinance broadly covers a significant amount of additional activity uncertainty about the scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for respondents claim that the ordinance is too vague

we are confronted at the outset with the citys claim that it was improper for the state courts to conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face the city correctly points out that imprecise laws can be attacked on their face under two different doctrines18 first the overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of first amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep broadrick v oklahoma 413 u s 601 612615 1973 second even if an enactment does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct it may be impermissibly vague because it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests kolender v lawson 461 u s 352 358 1983

while we like the illinois courts conclude that the ordinance is invalid on its face we do not rely on the overbreadth doctrine we agree with the citys submission that the law does not have a sufficiently substantial impact on conduct protected by the first amendment to render it unconstitutional the ordinance does not prohibit speech because the term loiter is defined as remaining in one place with no apparent purpose it is also clear that it does not prohibit any form of conduct that is apparently intended to convey a message by its terms the ordinance is inapplicable to assemblies that are designed to demonstrate a groups support of or opposition to a particular point of view cf clark v community for creative nonviolence 468 u s 288 1984 gregory v chicago 394 u s 111 1969 its impact on the social contact between gang members and others does not impair the first amendment right of association that our cases have recognized see dallas v stanglin 490 u s 19 2325 1989

on the other hand as the united states recognizes the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the liberty protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment19 we have expressly identified this right to remove from one place to another according to inclination as an attribute of personal liberty protected by the constitution williams v fears 179 u s 270 274 1900 see also papachristou v jacksonville 405 u s 156 164 197220 indeed it is apparent that an individuals decision to remain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is a part of our heritage kent v dulles 357 u s 116 126 1958 or the right to move to whatsoever place ones own inclination may direct identified in blackstones commentaries 1 w blackstone commentaries on the laws of england 130 176521

there is no need however to decide whether the impact of the chicago ordinance on constitutionally protected liberty alone would suffice to support a facial challenge under the overbreadth doctrine cf aptheker v secretary of state 378 u s 500 515517 1964 right to travel planned parenthood of central mo v danforth 428 u s 52 8283 1976 abortion kolender v lawson 461 u s at 355 n 3 358360 and n 9 for it is clear that the vagueness of this enactment makes a facial challenge appropriate this is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement see hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc 455 u s 489 499 1982 it is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement see colautti v franklin 439 u s 379 395 1979 and infringes on constitutionally protected rights see id at 391 when vagueness permeates the text of such a law it is subject to facial attack22
vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two independent reasons first it may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits second it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement see kolender v lawson 461 u s at 357 accordingly we first consider whether the ordinance provides fair notice to the citizen and then discuss its potential for arbitrary enforcementivit is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the due process clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits     giaccio v pennsylvania 382 u s 399 402403 1966 the illinois supreme court recognized that the term loiter may have a common and accepted meaning 177 ill 2d at 451 687 n e 2d at 61 but the definition of that term in this ordinance—to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose—does not it is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an apparent purpose if she were talking to another person would she have an apparent purpose if she were frequently checking her watch and looking expectantly down the street would she have an apparent purpose23

since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member the vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of uncertainty about the normal meaning of loitering but rather about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not the illinois supreme court emphasized the laws failure to distinguish between innocent conduct and conduct threatening harm24 its decision followed the precedent set by a number of state courts that have upheld ordinances that criminalize loitering combined with some other overt act or evidence of criminal intent25 however state courts have uniformly invalidated laws that do not join the term loitering with a second specific element of the crime26

the citys principal response to this concern about adequate notice is that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after they have failed to comply with an officers order to disperse whatever problem is created by a law that criminalizes conduct people normally believe to be innocent is solved when persons receive actual notice from a police order of what they are expected to do27 we find this response unpersuasive for at least two reasons

first the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law no one may be required at peril of life liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes lanzetta v new jersey 306 u s 451 453 1939 although it is true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctions unless he or she disobeys a dispersal order the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit28 if the loitering is in fact harmless and innocent the dispersal order itself is an unjustified impairment of liberty if the police are able to decide arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to disperse then the chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from the law we held invalid in shuttlesworth v birmingham 382 u s 87 90 196529 because an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred it cannot provide the kind of advance notice that will protect the putative loiterer from being ordered to disperse such an order cannot retroactively give adequate warning of the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible applications of the law30

second the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice afforded by the ordinance it provides that the officer shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area app to pet for cert 61a this vague phrasing raises a host of questions after such an order issues how long must the loiterers remain apart how far must they move if each loiterer walks around the block and they meet again at the same location are they subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again as we do here we have found vagueness in a criminal statute exacerbated by the use of the standards of neighborhood and locality connally v general constr co 269 u s 385 1926 we remarked in connally that both terms are elastic and dependent upon circumstances may be equally satisfied by areas measured by rods or by miles id at 395

lack of clarity in the description of the loiterers duty to obey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear but it does buttress our conclusion that the entire ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted the constitution does not permit a legislature to set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained and who should be set at large united states v reese 92 u s 214 221 1876 this ordinance is therefore vague not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all coates v cincinnati 402 u s 611 614 1971vthe broad sweep of the ordinance also violates the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement  kolender v lawson 461 u s at 358 there are no such guidelines in the ordinance in any public place in the city of chicago persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent the mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes it matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father for example might loiter near wrigley field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of sammy sosa leaving the ballpark in either event if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer she may— indeed she shall—order them to disperse

recognizing that the ordinance does reach a substantial amount of innocent conduct we turn then to its language to determine if it necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the momenttomoment judgment of the policeman on his beat kolender v lawson 461 u s at 360 internal quotation marks omitted as we discussed in the context of fair notice see supra at 5660 the principal source of the vast discretion conferred on the police in this case is the definition of loitering as to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose

as the illinois supreme court interprets that definition it provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering 177 ill 2d at 457 687 n e 2d at 63 we have no authority to construe the language of a state statute more narrowly than the construction given by that states highest court31 the power to determine the meaning of a statute carries with it the power to prescribe its extent and limitations as well as the method by which they shall be determined smiley v kansas 196 u s 447 455 1905

nevertheless the city disputes the illinois supreme courts interpretation arguing that the text of the ordinance limits the officers discretion in three ways first it does not permit the officer to issue a dispersal order to anyone who is moving along or who has an apparent purpose second it does not permit an arrest if individuals obey a dispersal order third no order can issue unless the officer reasonably believes that one of the loiterers is a member of a criminal street gang

even putting to one side our duty to defer to a state courts construction of the scope of a local enactment we find each of these limitations insufficient that the ordinance does not apply to people who are moving—that is to activity that would not constitute loitering under any possible definition of the term—does not even address the question of how much discretion the police enjoy in deciding which stationary persons to disperse under the ordinance32 similarly that the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue the no apparent purpose standard for making that decision is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene

presumably an officer would have discretion to treat some purposes—perhaps a purpose to engage in idle conversation or simply to enjoy a cool breeze on a warm evening—as too frivolous to be apparent if he suspected a different ulterior motive moreover an officer conscious of the city councils reasons for enacting the ordinance might well ignore its text and issue a dispersal order even though an illicit purpose is actually apparent

it is true as the city argues that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal that limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect33 or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members but this ordinance for reasons that are not explained in the findings of the city council requires no harmful purpose and applies to nongang members as well as suspected gang members34 it applies to everyone in the city who may remain in one place with one suspected gang member as long as their purpose is not apparent to an officer observing them friends relatives teachers counselors or even total strangers might unwittingly engage in forbidden loitering if they happen to engage in idle conversation with a gang member

ironically the definition of loitering in the chicago ordinance not only extends its scope to encompass harmless conduct but also has the perverse consequence of excluding from its coverage much of the intimidating conduct that motivated its enactment as the city councils findings demonstrate the most harmful gang loitering is motivated either by an apparent purpose to publicize the gangs dominance of certain territory thereby intimidating nonmembers or by an equally apparent purpose to conceal ongoing commerce in illegal drugs as the illinois supreme court has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance we must assume that the ordinance means what it says and that it has no application to loiterers whose purpose is apparent the relative importance of its application to harmless loitering is magnified by its inapplicability to loitering that has an obviously threatening or illicit purpose
finally in its opinion striking down the ordinance the illinois supreme court refused to accept the general order issued by the police department as a sufficient limitation on the vast amount of discretion granted to the police in its enforcement we agree see smith v goguen 415 u s 566 575 1974 that the police have adopted internal rules limiting their enforcement to certain designated areas in the city would not provide a defense to a loiterer who might be arrested elsewhere nor could a person who knowingly loitered with a wellknown gang member anywhere in the city safely assume that they would not be ordered to disperse no matter how innocent and harmless their loitering might beviin our judgment the illinois supreme court correctly concluded that the ordinance does not provide sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity35 177 ill 2d at 459 687 n e 2d at 64 we recognize the serious and difficult problems testified to by the citizens of chicago that led to the enactment of this ordinance we are mindful that the preservation of liberty depends in part on the maintenance of social order houston v hill 482 u s 451 471472 1987 however in this instance the city has enacted an ordinance that affords too much discretion to the police and too little notice to citizens who wish to use the public streets

accordingly the judgment of the supreme court of illinois is

affirmed

justice oconnor with whom justice breyer joins concurring in part and concurring in the judgment

i agree with the court that chicagos gang congregation ordinance chicago municipal code § 84—015 1992 gang loitering ordinance or ordinance is unconstitutionally vague a penal law is void for vagueness if it fails to define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited or fails to establish guidelines to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law kolender v lawson 461 u s 352 357 1983 of these the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine is    the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement  id at 358 quoting smith v goguen 415 u s 566 574575 1974 i share justice thomas concern about the consequences of gang violence and i agree that some degree of police discretion is necessary to allow the police to perform their peace keeping responsibilities satisfactorily post at 109 dissenting opinion a criminal law however must not permit policemen prosecutors and juries to conduct a standardless sweep    to pursue their personal predilections  kolender v lawson supra at 358 quoting smith v goguen supra at 575

the ordinance at issue provideswhenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area any person who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section app to pet for cert 61ato loiter in turn is defined in the ordinance as to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose ibid the illinois supreme court declined to adopt a limiting construction of the ordinance and concluded that the ordinance vested absolute discretion to police officers 177 ill 2d 440 457 687 n e 2d 53 63 1997 emphasis added this court is bound by the illinois supreme courts construction of the ordinance see terminiello v chicago 337 u s 1 4 1949

as it has been construed by the illinois court chicagos gang loitering ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers in particular it fails to provide police with any standard by which they can judge whether an individual has an apparent purpose indeed because any person standing on the street has a general purpose—even if it is simply to stand—the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible under this construction the police do not have to decide that an individual is threatening the public peace to issue a dispersal order see post at 107 thomas j dissenting any police officer in chicago is free under the illinois supreme courts construction of the ordinance to order at his whim any person standing in a public place with a suspected gang member to disperse further as construed by the illinois court the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are not gang members standing on any sidewalk or in any park coffee shop bar or other location open to the public whether publicly or privately owned chicago municipal code § 84—015c5 1992

to be sure there is no violation of the ordinance unless a person fails to obey promptly the order to disperse but a police officer cannot issue a dispersal order until he decides that a person is remaining in one place with no apparent purpose and the ordinance provides no guidance to the officer on how to make this antecedent decision moreover the requirement that police issue dispersal orders only when they reasonably believe that a group of loiterers includes a gang member fails to cure the ordinances vague aspects if the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued cf ante at 62 but the illinois supreme court did not construe the ordinance to be so limited see 177 ill 2d at 453454 687 n e 2d at 62

this vagueness consideration alone provides a sufficient ground for affirming the illinois courts decision and i agree with part v of the courts opinion which discusses this consideration see ante at 62 that the ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer deciding whether such an order should issue ibid it is true   that the requirement that the officer reasonably believe that a group of loiterers contains a gang member does place a limit on the authority to order dispersal that limitation would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members accordingly there is no need to consider the other issues briefed by the parties and addressed by the plurality i express no opinion about them

it is important to courts and legislatures alike that we characterize more clearly the narrow scope of todays holding as the ordinance comes to this court it is unconstitutionally vague nevertheless there remain open to chicago reasonable alternatives to combat the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence for example the court properly and expressly distinguishes the ordinance from laws that require loiterers to have a harmful purpose see ibid from laws that target only gang members see ibid and from laws that incorporate limits on the area and manner in which the laws may be enforced see ante at 6263 in addition the ordinance here is unlike a law that directly prohibits the presence of a large collection of obviously brazen insistent and lawless gang members and hangerson on the public ways  that intimidates residents  ante at 51 52 quoting brief for petitioner 14 indeed as the plurality notes the city of chicago has several laws that do exactly this see ante at 52 n 17 chicago has even enacted a provision that enables police officers to fulfill    their traditional functions including preserving the public peace see post at 106 thomas j dissenting specifically chicagos general disorderly conduct provision allows the police to arrest those who knowingly provoke make or aid in making a breach of peace see chicago municipal code § 84—010 1992

in my view the gang loitering ordinance could have been construed more narrowly the term loiter might possibly be construed in a more limited fashion to mean to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas to intimidate others from entering those areas or to conceal illegal activities such a definition would be consistent with the chicago city councils findings and would avoid the vagueness problems of the ordinance as construed by the illinois supreme court see app to pet for cert 60a—61a as noted above so would limitations that restricted the ordinances criminal penalties to gang members or that more carefully delineated the circumstances in which those penalties would apply to nongang members

the illinois supreme court did not choose to give a limiting construction to chicagos ordinance to the extent it relied on our precedents particularly papachristou v jacksonville 405 u s 156 1972 as requiring it to hold the ordinance vague in all of its applications because it was intentionally drafted in a vague manner the illinois court misapplied our precedents see 177 ill 2d at 458459 687 n e 2d at 64 this court has never held that the intent of the drafters determines whether a law is vague nevertheless we cannot impose a limiting construction that a state supreme court has declined to adopt see kolender v lawson 461 u s at 355356 n 4 noting that the court has held that for the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the state has interpreted it  citations and internal quotation marks omitted new york v ferber 458 u s 747 769 n 24 1982 noting that where the court is dealing with a state statute on direct review of a statecourt decision that has construed the statute such a construction is binding on us accordingly i join parts i ii and v of the courts opinion and concur in the judgmentjustice kennedy concurring in part and concurring in the judgmenti join parts i ii and v of the courts opinion and concur in the judgment

i also share many of the concerns justice stevens expresses in part iv with respect to the sufficiency of notice under the ordinance as interpreted by the illinois supreme court the chicago ordinance would reach a broad range of innocent conduct for this reason it is not necessarily saved by the requirement that the citizen must disobey a police order to disperse before there is a violation
we have not often examined these types of orders cf shuttlesworth v birmingham 382 u s 87 1965 it can be assumed however that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given illustrative examples include when the police tell a pedestrian not to enter a building and the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team or to protect a crime scene or to secure an area for the protection of a public official it does not follow however that any unexplained police order must be obeyed without notice of the lawfulness of the order the predicate of an order to disperse is not in my view sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance a citizen while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersal order based on the officers own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregating nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizens lack of an apparent purposejustice breyer concurring in part and concurring in the judgmentthe ordinance before us creates more than a minor limitation upon the free state of nature post at 74 scalia j dissenting emphasis added the law authorizes a police officer to order any person to remove himself from any location open to the public whether publicly or privately owned chicago municipal code § 84—015c5 1992 i e any sidewalk front stoop public park public square lakeside promenade hotel restaurant bowling alley bar barbershop sports arena shopping mall etc but with two and only two limitations first that person must be accompanied by or must himself be someone police reasonably believe is a gang member second that person must have remained in that public place with no apparent purpose § 84—015c1

the first limitation cannot save the ordinance though it limits the number of persons subject to the law it leaves many individuals gang members and nongang members alike subject to its strictures nor does it limit in any way the range of conduct that police may prohibit the second limitation is as the court ante at 62 and justice oconnor ante at 6566 opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment point out not a limitation at all since one always has some apparent purpose the socalled limitation invites in fact requires the policeman to interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for     and it is in the ordinances delegation to the policeman of openended discretion to fill in that blank that the problem lies to grant to a policeman virtually standardless discretion to close off major portions of the city to an innocent person is in my view to create a major not a minor limitation upon the free state of nature

nor does it violate our rules governing facial challenges post at 74 scalia j dissenting to forbid the city to apply the unconstitutional ordinance in this case the reason why the ordinance is invalid explains how that is so as i have said i believe the ordinance violates the constitution because it delegates too much discretion to a police officer to decide whom to order to move on and in what circumstances and i see no way to distinguish in the ordinances terms between one application of that discretion and another the ordinance is unconstitutional not because a policeman applied this discretion wisely or poorly in a particular case but rather because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in every case and if every application of the ordinance represents an exercise of unlimited discretion then the ordinance is invalid in all its applications the city of chicago may be able validly to apply some other law to the defendants in light of their conduct but the city of chicago may no more apply this law to the defendants no matter how they behaved than it could apply an imaginary statute that said it is a crime to do wrong even to the worst of murderers see lanzetta v new jersey 306 u s 451 453 1939 if on its face the challenged provision is repugnant to the due process clause specification of details of the offense intended to be charged would not serve to validate it

justice scalias examples post at 8183 reach a different conclusion because they assume a different basis for the laws constitutional invalidity a statute for example might not provide fair warning to many but an individual defendant might still have been aware that it prohibited the conduct in which he engaged cf e g parker v levy 417 u s 733 756 1974 one who has received fair warning of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in question is not entitled to attack it because the language would not give similar fair warning with respect to other conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit

one to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness but i believe this ordinance is unconstitutional not because it provides insufficient notice but because it does not provide sufficient minimal standards to guide law enforcement officers see ante at 6566 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment

i concede that this case is unlike those first amendment overbreadth cases in which this court has permitted a facial challenge in an overbreadth case a defendant whose conduct clearly falls within the law and may be constitutionally prohibited can nonetheless have the law declared facially invalid to protect the rights of others whose protected speech might otherwise be chilled in the present case the right that the defendants assert the right to be free from the officers exercise of unchecked discretion is more clearly their own

this case resembles coates v cincinnati 402 u s 611 1971 where this court declared facially unconstitutional on among other grounds the due process standard of vagueness an ordinance that prohibited persons assembled on a sidewalk from conducting themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by the court explainedit is said that the ordinance is broad enough to encompass many types of conduct clearly within the citys constitutional power to prohibit and so indeed it is the city is free to prevent people from blocking sidewalks obstructing traffic littering streets committing assaults or engaging in countless other forms of antisocial conduct it can do so through the enactment and enforcement of ordinances directed with reasonable specificity toward the conduct to be prohibited    it cannot constitutionally do so through the enactment and enforcement of an ordinance whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed id at 614 citation omitted the ordinance in coates could not constitutionally be applied whether or not the conduct of the particular defendants was indisputably annoying or of a sort that a different more specific ordinance could constitutionally prohibit similarly here the city might have enacted a different ordinance or the illinois supreme court might have interpreted this ordinance differently and the constitution might well have permitted the city to apply that different ordinance or this ordinance as interpreted differently to circumstances like those present here see ante at 6768 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment but this ordinance as i have said cannot be constitutionally applied to anyonejustice scalia dissentingthe citizens of chicago were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished at some point chicagoans or perhaps illinoisans decided this would not do and imposed prophylactic speed limits designed to assure safe operation by the average or perhaps even subaverage driver with the average or perhaps even subaverage vehicle this infringed upon the freedom of all citizens but was not unconstitutional

similarly the citizens of chicago were once free to stand around and gawk at the scene of an accident at some point chicagoans discovered that this obstructed traffic and caused more accidents they did not make the practice unlawful but they did authorize police officers to order the crowd to disperse and imposed penalties for refusal to obey such an order again this prophylactic measure infringed upon the freedom of all citizens but was not unconstitutional

until the ordinance that is before us today was adopted the citizens of chicago were free to stand about in public places with no apparent purpose—to engage that is in conduct that appeared to be loitering in recent years however the city has been afflicted with criminal street gangs as reflected in the record before us these gangs congregated in public places to deal in drugs and to terrorize the neighborhoods by demonstrating control over their turf many residents of the inner city felt that they were prisoners in their own homes once again chicagoans decided that to eliminate the problem it was worth restricting some of the freedom that they once enjoyed the means they took was similar to the second and more mild example given above rather than the first loitering was not made unlawful but when a group of people occupied a public place without an apparent purpose and in the company of a known gang member police officers were authorized to order them to disperse and the failure to obey such an order was made unlawful see chicago municipal code § 84—015 1992 the minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all chicagoans seemed to them and it seems to me a small price to pay for liberation of their streets

the majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges by elevating loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right and by discerning vagueness where according to our usual standards none existsirespondents consolidated appeal presents a facial challenge to the chicago ordinance on vagueness grounds when a facial challenge is successful the law in question is declared to be unenforceable in all its applications and not just in its particular application to the party in suit to tell the truth it is highly questionable whether federal courts have any business making such a declaration the rationale for our power to review federal legislation for constitutionality expressed in marbury v madison 1 cranch 137 1803 was that we had to do so in order to decide the case before us but that rationale only extends so far as to require us to determine that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to this party in the circumstances of this case

that limitation was fully grasped by tocqueville in his famous chapter on the power of the judiciary in american societythe second characteristic of judicial power is that it pronounces on special cases and not upon general principles if a judge in deciding a particular point destroys a general principle by passing a judgment which tends to reject all the inferences from that principle and consequently to annul it he remains within the ordinary limits of his functions but if he directly attacks a general principle without having a particular case in view he leaves the circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority he assumes a more important and perhaps a more useful influence than that of the magistrate but he ceases to represent the judicial power
    

whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is invoked in a tribunal of the united states he may refuse to admit it as a rule     but as soon as a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case that law immediately loses a portion of its moral force those to whom it is prejudicial learn that means exist of overcoming its authority and similar suits are multiplied until it becomes powerless    the political power which the americans have intrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense but the evils of this power are considerably diminished by the impossibility of attacking the laws except through the courts of justice    when a judge contests a law in an obscure debate on some particular case the importance of his attack is concealed from public notice his decision bears upon the interest of an individual and the law is slighted only incidentally moreover although it is censured it is not abolished its moral force may be diminished but its authority is not taken away and its final destruction can be accomplished only by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries democracy in america 73 7576 r heffner ed 1956as justice sutherland described our system in his opinion for a unanimous court in massachusetts v mellon 262 u s 447 488 1923we have no power per se to review and annul acts of congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional that question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened presenting a justiciable issue is made to rest upon such an act then the power exercised is that of ascertaining and declaring the law applicable to the controversy it amounts to little more than the negative power to disregard an unconstitutional enactment which otherwise would stand in the way of the enforcement of a legal right    if a case for preventive relief be presented the court enjoins in effect not the execution of the statute but the acts of the official the statute notwithstandingand as justice brennan described our system in his opinion for a unanimous court in united states v raines 362 u s 17 2022 1960the very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare acts of congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies before them    this court as is the case with all federal courts has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute either of a state or of the united states void because irreconcilable with the constitution except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies in the exercise of that jurisdiction it is bound by two rules to which it has rigidly adhered one never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied   kindred to these rules is the rule that one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional    the delicate power of pronouncing an act of congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imaginedit seems to me fundamentally incompatible with this system for the court not to be content to find that a statute is unconstitutional as applied to the person before it but to go further and pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in all applications its reasoning may well suggest as much but to pronounce a holding on that point seems to me no more than an advisory opinion—which a federal court should never issue at all see hayburns case 2 dall 409 1792 and especially should not issue with regard to a constitutional question as to which we seek to avoid even non advisory opinions see e g ashwander v tva 297 u s 288 347 1936 brandeis j concurring i think it quite improper in short to ask the constitutional claimant before us do you just want us to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to you in this case or do you want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications

i must acknowledge however that for some of the present century we have done just this but until recently at least we have—except in freespeech cases subject to the doctrine of overbreadth see e g new york v ferber 458 u s 747 769773 1982—required the facial challenge to be a goforbroke proposition that is to say before declaring a statute to be void in all its applications something we should not be doing in the first place we have at least imposed upon the litigant the eminently reasonable requirement that he establish that the statute was unconstitutional in all its applications i say that is an eminently reasonable requirement not only because we should not be holding a statute void in all its applications unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications but also because unless it is unconstitutional in all its applications we do not even know without conducting an asapplied analysis whether it is void with regard to the very litigant before us—whose case after all was the occasion for undertaking this inquiry in the first place1

as we said in united states v salerno 481 u s 739 745 1987a facial challenge to a legislative act is of course the most difficult challenge to mount successfully since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid the fact that a legislative act might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid since we have not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment emphasis added2this proposition did not originate with salerno but had been expressed in a line of prior opinions see e g members of city council of los angeles v taxpayers for vincent 466 u s 789 796 1984 opinion for the court by stevens j statute not implicating first amendment rights is invalid on its face if it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application schall v martin 467 u s 253 269 n 18 1984 hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc 455 u s 489 494495 497 1982 united states v national dairy products corp 372 u s 29 3132 1963 raines 362 u s at 21 and the proposition has been reaffirmed in many cases and opinions since see e g anderson v edwards 514 u s 143 155156 n 6 1995 unanimous court babbitt v sweet home chapter communities for great ore 515 u s 687 699 1995 opinion for the court by stevens j facial challenge asserts that a challenged statute or regulation is invalid in every circumstance reno v flores 507 u s 292 301 1993 rust v sullivan 500 u s 173 183 1991 ohio v akron center for reproductive health 497 u s 502 514 1990 opinion of kennedy j webster v reproductive health servs 492 u s 490 523524 1989 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment new york state club assn inc v city of new york 487 u s 1 1112 19883 unsurprisingly given the clarity of our general jurisprudence on this point the federal courts of appeals all apply the salerno standard in adjudicating facial challenges4

i am aware of course that in some recent facialchallenge cases the court has without any attempt at explanation created entirely irrational exceptions to the unconstitutional in every conceivable application rule when the statutes at issue concerned hotbutton social issues on which informed opinion was zealously united see romer v evans 517 u s 620 643 1996 scalia j dissenting homosexual rights planned parenthood of southeastern pa v casey 505 u s 833 895 1992 abortion rights but the present case does not even lend itself to such a political correctness exception—which though illogical is at least predictable it is not à la mode to favor gang members and associated loiterers over the beleaguered lawabiding residents of the inner city

when our normal criteria for facial challenges are applied it is clear that the justices in the majority have transposed the burden of proof instead of requiring respondents who are challenging the ordinance to show that it is invalid in all its applications they have required petitioner to show that it is valid in all its applications both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively imagination creating hypothetical situations in which the laws application would in their view be ambiguous but that creative role has been usurped from petitioner who can defeat respondents facial challenge by conjuring up a single valid application of the law my contribution would go something like this5 tony a member of the jets criminal street gang is standing alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out their turf at promontory point on the south side of chicago the group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive tattoos to passersby officer krupke applying the ordinance at issue here orders the group to disperse after some speculative discussion probably irrelevant here over whether the jets are depraved because they are deprived tony and the other gang members break off further conversation with the statement—not entirely coherent but evidently intended to be rude—gee officer krupke krup you a tense standoff ensues until officer krupke arrests the group for failing to obey his dispersal order even assuming as the justices in the majority do but i do not that a law requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague unless it is clear to the objects of the order before its issuance that their conduct justifies iti find it hard to believe that the jets would not have known they had it coming that should settle the matter of respondents facial challenge to the ordinances vagueness

of course respondents would still be able to claim that the ordinance was vague as applied to them but the ultimate demonstration of the inappropriateness of the courts holding of facial invalidity is the fact that it is doubtful whether some of these respondents could even sustain an asapplied challenge on the basis of the majoritys own criteria for instance respondent jose renteria—who admitted that he was a member of the satan disciples gang—was observed by the arresting officer loitering on a street corner with other gang members the officer issued a dispersal order but when she returned to the same corner 15 to 20 minutes later renteria was still there with his friends whereupon he was arrested in another example respondent daniel washington and several others—who admitted they were members of the vice lords gang—were observed by the arresting officer loitering in the street yelling at passing vehicles stopping traffic and preventing pedestrians from using the sidewalks the arresting officer issued a dispersal order issued another dispersal order later when the group did not move and finally arrested the group when they were found loitering in the same place still later finally respondent gregorio gutierrez—who had previously admitted to the arresting officer his membership in the latin kings gang—was observed loitering with two other men the officer issued a dispersal order drove around the block and arrested the men after finding them in the same place upon his return see brief for petitioner 7 n 5 brief for united states as amicus curiae 16 n 11 even on the majoritys assumption that to avoid vagueness it must be clear to the object of the dispersal order ex ante that his conduct is covered by the ordinance it seems most improbable that any of these asapplied challenges would be sustained much less is it possible to say that the ordinance is invalid in all its applicationsiithe pluralitys explanation for its departure from the usual rule governing facial challenges is seemingly contained in the following statement this is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement    and infringes on constitutionally protected rights     when vagueness permeates the text of such a law it is subject to facial attack ante at 55 emphasis added the proposition is set forth with such assurance that one might suppose that it repeats some wellaccepted formula in our jurisprudence criminal law without mens rea requirement h11501 infringement of constitutionally protected right h11501 vagueness h11505 entitlement to facial invalidation there is no such formula the plurality has made it up for this case as the absence of any citation demonstrates

but no matter none of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists anyway i turn first to the support for the proposition that there is a constitutionally protected right to loiter—or as the plurality more favorably describes 8484 it for a person to remain in a public place of his choice ante at 54 the plurality thinks much of this fundamental freedom to loiter which it contrasts with such lesser constitutionally un protected activities as doing ugh business this is not an ordinance that simply regulates business behavior and contains a scienter requirement    it is a criminal law that contains no mens rea requirement    and infringes on constitutionally protected rights ante at 55 internal quotation marks omitted poor alexander hamilton who has seen his commercial republic devolve in the eyes of the plurality at least into an indolent republic see the federalist no 6 p 56 no 11 pp 8491 c rossiter ed 1961

of course every activity even scratching ones head can be called a constitutional right if one means by that term nothing more than the fact that the activity is covered as all are by the equal protection clause so that those who engage in it cannot be singled out without rational basis see fcc v beach communications inc 508 u s 307 313 1993 but using the term in that sense utterly impoverishes our constitutional discourse we would then need a new term for those activities—such as political speech or religious worship—that cannot be forbidden even with rational basis

the plurality tosses around the term constitutional right in this renegade sense because there is not the slightest evidence for the existence of a genuine constitutional right to loiter justice thomas recounts the vast historical tradition of criminalizing the activity post at 102106 dissenting opinion it is simply not maintainable that the right to loiter would have been regarded as an essential attribute of liberty at the time of the framing or at the time of adoption of the fourteenth amendment for the plurality however the historical practices of our people are nothing more than a speed bump on the road to the right result its opinion blithely proclaims neither this history nor the scholarly 8585 compendia in justice thomas dissent ibid persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause ante at 54 n 20 the entire practice of using the due process clause to add judicially favored rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the bill of rights usually under the rubric of socalled substantive due process is in my view judicial usurpation but we have recently at least sought to limit the damage by tethering the courts rightmaking power to an objective criterion in washington v glucksberg 521 u s 702 720721 1997 we explained our established method of substantive due process analysis carefully and narrowly describing the asserted right and then examining whether that right is manifested in our nations history legal traditions and practices see also collins v harker heights 503 u s 115 125126 1992 michael h v gerald d 491 u s 110 122123 1989 moore v east cleveland 431 u s 494 502503 1977 the plurality opinion not only ignores this necessary limitation but it leaps far beyond any substantivedueprocess atrocity we have ever committed by actually placing the burden of proof upon the defendant to establish that loitering is not a fundamental liberty it never does marshal any support for the proposition that loitering is a constitutional right contenting itself with a transparently inadequate explanation of why the historical record of laws banning loitering does not positively contradict that proposition6 and the transparently erroneous assertion that the city of chicago appears to have conceded the 8686 point7 it is enough for the members of the plurality that history    fails to persuade us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause ante at 54 n 20 emphasis added they apparently think it quite unnecessary for anything to persuade them that it is8

it would be unfair however to criticize the pluralitys failed attempt to establish that loitering is a constitutionally protected right while saying nothing of the concurrences the plurality at least makes an attempt the concurrences on the other hand make no pretense at attaching their broad vagueness invalidates rule to a liberty interest as far as appears from justice oconnors and justice breyers opinions no police officer may issue any order affecting any insignificant sort of citizen conduct except perhaps an order addressed to the unprotected class of gang members unless the standards for the issuance of that order are precise no modern urban society—and probably none since london got big enough to have sewers—could function under such a rule there are innumerable reasons why it may be important for a constable to tell a pedestrian to move on—and even if it were possible to list in an ordinance all of the reasons that are known many are simply unpredictable hence the entirely reasonable rule of the city of new york which reads no person shall fail neglect or refuse to comply with the lawful direction or command of any police officer urban park ranger parks enforcement patrol officer or other parks and recreation department employee indicated verbally by gesture or otherwise 56 rcny § 103c1 1996 it is one thing to uphold an asapplied challenge when a pedestrian disobeys such an order that is unreasonable—or even when a pedestrian asserting some true liberty interest holding a political rally for instance disobeys such an order that is reasonable but unexplained but to say that such a general ordinance permitting lawful orders is void in all its applications demands more than a safe and orderly society can reasonably deliver

justice kennedy apparently recognizes this since he acknowledges that some police commands will subject a citizen to prosecution for disobeying whether or not the citizen knows why the order is given including for example an order telling a pedestrian not to enter a building when the reason is to avoid impeding a rescue team ante at 69 opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment but his only explanation of why the present interference with the right to loiter does not fall within that permitted scope of action is as follows the predicate of an order to disperse is not in my view sufficient to eliminate doubts regarding the adequacy of notice under this ordinance ibid i have not the slightest idea what this means but i do understand that the followup explanatory sentence showing how this principle invalidates the present ordinance applies equally to the rescueteam example that justice kennedy thinks is constitutional—as is demonstrated by substituting for references to the facts of the present case shown in italics references to his rescueteam hypothetical shown in brackets a citizen while engaging in a wide array of innocent conduct is not likely to know when he may be subject to a dispersal order order not to enter a building based on the officers own knowledge of the identity or affiliations of other persons with whom the citizen is congregating what is going on in the building nor may the citizen be able to assess what an officer might conceive to be the citizens lack of an apparent purpose the impeding of a rescue team ante at 6970iiii turn next to that element of the pluralitys facialchallenge formula which consists of the proposition that this criminal ordinance contains no mens rea requirement the first step in analyzing this proposition is to determine what the actus reus to which that mens rea is supposed to be attached consists of the majority believes that loitering forms part of indeed the essence of the offense and must be proved if conviction is to be obtained see ante at 47 5051 5355 5759 6061 6263 plurality and majority opinions ante at 65 66 68 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment ante at 6970 kennedy j concurring in part and concurring in judgment ante at 7273 breyer j concurring in part and concurring in judgment that is not what the ordinance provides the only part of the ordinance that refers to loitering is the portion that addresses not the punishable conduct of the defendant but what the police officer must observe before he can issue an order to disperse and what he must observe is carefully defined in terms of what the defendant appears to be doing not in terms of what the defendant is actually doing the ordinance does not require that the defendant have been loitering i e have been remaining in one place with no purpose but rather that the police officer have observed him remaining in one place without any apparent purpose someone who in fact has a genuine purpose for remaining where he is waiting for a friend for example or waiting to hold up a bank can be ordered to move on assuming the other conditions of the ordinance are met so long as his remaining has no apparent purpose it is likely to be sure that the ordinance will come down most heavily upon those who are actually loitering those who really have no purpose in remaining where they are but that activity is not a condition for issuance of the dispersal order

the only act of a defendant that is made punishable by the ordinance—or indeed that is even mentioned by the ordinance—is his failure to promptly obey an order to disperse the question then is whether that actus reus must be accompanied by any wrongful intent—and of course it must as the court itself describes the requirement a person must disobey the officers order ante at 47 emphasis added no one thinks a defendant could be successfully prosecuted under the ordinance if he did not hear the order to disperse or if he suffered a paralysis that rendered his compliance impossible the willful failure to obey a police order is wrongful intent enough

iv

finally i address the last of the three factors in the pluralitys facialchallenge formula the proposition that the ordinance is vague it is not even under the ersatz overbreadth standard applied in kolender v lawson 461 u s 352 358 n 8 1983 which allows facial challenges if a law reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct respondents claim fails because the ordinance would not be vague in most or even a substantial number of applications a law is unconstitutionally vague if its lack of definitive standards either 1 fails to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct or 2 encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement see e g grayned v city of rockford 408 u s 104 108 1972

the plurality relies primarily upon the first of these aspects since it reasons the loitering is the conduct that the ordinance is designed to prohibit and an officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has already occurred ante at 58 59 the order to disperse cannot itself serve to apprise persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct what counts for purposes of vagueness analysis however is not what the ordinance is designed to prohibit but what it actually subjects to criminal penalty as discussed earlier that consists of nothing but the refusal to obey a dispersal order as to which there is no doubt of adequate notice of the prohibited conduct the pluralitys suggestion that even the dispersal order itself is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify how far to disperse see ante at 59 scarcely requires a response9 if it were true it would render unconstitutional for vagueness many of the presidential proclamations issued under that provision of the united states code which requires the president 9191 before using the militia or the armed forces for law enforcement to issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse see 10 u s c § 334 president eisenhowers proclamation relating to the obstruction of courtordered enrollment of black students in public schools at little rock arkansas read as follows i   command all persons engaged in such obstruction of justice to cease and desist therefrom and to disperse forthwith presidential proclamation no 3204 3 cfr 132 19541958 comp see also presidential proclamation no 3645 3 cfr 103 19641965 comp ordering those obstructing the civil rights march from selma to montgomery alabama to disperse    forthwith see also boos v barry 485 u s 312 331 1988 rejecting overbreadthvagueness challenge to a law allowing police officers to order congregations near foreign embassies to disperse cox v louisiana 379 u s 536 551 1965 rejecting vagueness challenge to the dispersalorder prong of a breachofthepeace statute and describing that prong as narrow and specific

for its determination of unconstitutional vagueness the court relies secondarily—and justice oconnors and justice breyers concurrences exclusively—upon the second aspect of that doctrine which requires sufficient specificity to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement see ante at 60 majority opinion ante at 6566 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment ante at 72 breyer j concurring in part and concurring in judgment in discussing whether chicagos ordinance meets that requirement the justices in the majority hide behind an artificial construct of judicial restraint they point to the supreme court of illinois statement that the apparent purpose standard provides absolute discretion to police officers to decide what activities constitute loitering 177 ill 2d 440 457 687 n e 2d 53 63 1997 and protest that it would be wrong to construe the language of the ordinance more narrowly than did the states highest court ante at 61 63 majority opinion ante at 68 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment the absolute discretion statement however is nothing more than the illinois supreme courts characterization of what the language achieved—after that court refused as i do to read in any limitations that the words do not fairly contain it is not a construction of the language to which we are bound but a legal conclusion to which we most assuredly are not bound

the criteria for issuance of a dispersal order under the chicago ordinance could hardly be clearer first the law requires police officers to reasonably believe that one of the group to which the order is issued is a criminal street gang member this resembles a probablecause standard and the chicago police departments general order 924 1992—promulgated to govern enforcement of the ordinance—makes the probablecause requirement explicit10 under the order officers must have probable cause to believe that an individual is a member of a criminal street gang to be substantiated by the officers experience and knowledge of the alleged offenders and by specific documented and reliable information such as reliable witness testimony or an individuals admission of gang membership or display of distinctive colors tattoos signs or other markings worn by members of particular criminal street gangs app to pet for cert 67a—69a 71a—72a

second the ordinance requires that the group be remaining in any one place with no apparent purpose justice oconnors assertion that this applies to any person standing in a public place ante at 66 is a distortion the ordinance does not apply to standing but to remaining— a term which in this context obviously means to endure or persist see american heritage dictionary 1525 1992 there may be some ambiguity at the margin but remaining in one place requires more than a temporary stop and is clear in most of its applications including all of those represented by the facts surrounding respondents arrests described supra at 8283

as for the phrase with no apparent purpose justice oconnor again distorts this adjectival phrase by separating it from the word that it modifies any person standing on the street her concurrence says has a general purpose—even if it is simply to stand and thus the ordinance permits police officers to choose which purposes are permissible  ante at 66 but chicago police officers enforcing the ordinance are not looking for people with no apparent purpose who are regrettably in oversupply they are looking for people who remain in any one place with no apparent purpose—that is who remain there without any apparent reason for remaining there that is not difficult to perceive11

the courts attempt to demonstrate the vagueness of the ordinance produces the following peculiar statement the no apparent purpose standard for making the decision to issue an order to disperse is inherently subjective because its application depends on whether some purpose is apparent to the officer on the scene ante at 62 in the courts view a persons lack of any purpose in staying in one location is presumably an objective factor and what the ordinance requires as a condition of an order to disperse— the absence of any apparent purpose—is a subjective factor this side of the looking glass just the opposite is true

elsewhere of course the court acknowledges the clear objective commands of the ordinance and indeed relies upon them to paint it as unfairin any public place in the city of chicago persons who stand or sit in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless their purpose is apparent the mandatory language in the enactment directs the police to issue an order without first making any inquiry about their possible purposes it matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his father for example might loiter near wrigley field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of sammy sosa leaving the ballpark in either event if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer she may—indeed she shall—order them to disperse ante at 60quite so and the fact that this clear instruction to the officers reaches a substantial amount of innocent conduct ibid would be invalidating if that conduct were constitutionally protected against abridgment such as speech or the practice of religion remaining in one place is not so protected and so as already discussed it is up to the citizens of chicago—not us—to decide whether the tradeoff is worth it12

justice breyers concurrence tries to perform the impossible feat of affirming our unquestioned rule that a criminal statute that is so vague as to give constitutionally inadequate notice to some violators may nonetheless be enforced against those whose conduct is clearly covered see ante at 7172 citing parker v levy 417 u s 733 1974 while at the same time asserting that a statute which delegates too much discretion to a police officer is invalid in all its applications even where the officer uses his discretion wisely ante at 71 but the vagueness that causes notice to be inadequate is the very same vagueness that causes too much discretion to be lodged in the enforcing officer put another way a law that gives the policeman clear guidance in all cases gives the public clear guidance in all cases as well thus what justice breyer gives with one hand he takes away with the other in his view vague statutes that nonetheless give adequate notice to some violators are not unenforceable against those violators because of inadequate notice but are unenforceable against them because the policeman enjoys too much discretion in every case ibid this is simply contrary to our case law including parker v levy supra13vthe plurality points out that chicago already has several laws that reach the intimidating and unlawful gangrelated conduct the ordinance was directed at see ante at 52 n 17 the problem of course well recognized by chicagos city council is that the gang members cease their intimidating and unlawful behavior under the watchful eye of police officers but return to it as soon as the police drive away the only solution the council concluded was to clear the streets of congregations of gangs their drug customers and their associates

justice oconnors concurrence proffers the same empty solace of existing laws useless for the purpose at hand see ante at 67 6768 but seeks to be helpful by suggesting some measures similar to this ordinance that would be constitutional it says that chicago could for example enact a law that directly prohibits the presence of a large collection of obviously brazen insistent and lawless gang members and hangerson on the public ways that intimidates residents ante at 67 internal quotation marks omitted if the majority considers the present ordinance too vague it would be fun to see what it makes of a large collection of obviously brazen insistent and lawless gang members this prescription of the concurrence is largely a quotation from the plurality—which itself answers the concurrences suggestion that such a law would be helpful by pointing out that the city already has several laws that serve this purpose ante at 52 n 17 plurality opinion citing extant laws against intimidation street gang criminal drug conspiracy and mob action the problem again is that the intimidation and lawlessness do not occur when the police are in sight

justice oconnors concurrence also proffers another cure if the ordinance applied only to persons reasonably believed to be gang members this requirement might have cured the ordinances vagueness because it would have directed the manner in which the order was issued by specifying to whom the order could be issued ante at 66 the court agrees that this might be a cure see ante at 62 but the ordinance already specifies to whom the order can be issued persons remaining in one place with no apparent purpose in the company of a gang member and if remaining in one place with no apparent purpose is so vague as to give the police unbridled discretion in controlling the conduct of nongang members it surpasses understanding how it ceases to be so vague when applied to gang members alone surely gang members cannot be decreed to be outlaws subject to the merest whim of the police as the rest of us are not

  

the fact is that the present ordinance is entirely clear in its application cannot be violated except with full knowledge and intent and vests no more discretion in the police than innumerable other measures authorizing police orders to preserve the public peace and safety as suggested by their tortured analyses and by their suggested solutions that bear no relation to the identified constitutional problem the majoritys real quarrel with the chicago ordinance is simply that it permits or indeed requires too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens to be proscribed as justice oconnors concurrence says with disapprobation the ordinance applies to hundreds of thousands of persons who are not gang members standing on any sidewalk or in any park coffee shop bar or other location open to the public ante at 66 internal quotation marks omitted

but in our democratic system how much harmless conduct to proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts so long as constitutionally guaranteed rights are not affected and so long as the proscription has a rational basis all sorts of perfectly harmless activity by millions of perfectly innocent people can be forbidden—riding a motorcycle without a safety helmet for example starting a campfire in a national forest or selling a safe and effective drug not yet approved by the food and drug administration all of these acts are entirely innocent and harmless in themselves but because of the risk of harm that they entail the freedom to engage in them has been abridged the citizens of chicago have decided that depriving themselves of the freedom to hang out with a gang member is necessary to eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidation—and that the elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other this court has no business secondguessing either the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade

the plurality asserts that the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the liberty protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment ante at 53 yet it acknowledges—as it must—that antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country ante at 53 n 20 see also 177 ill 2d 440 450 687 n e 2d 53 60 1997 case below loitering and vagrancy statutes have been utilized throughout american history in an attempt to prevent crime by removing undesirable persons from public before they have the opportunity to engage in criminal activity in derogation of the framework we articulated only two terms ago in glucksberg the plurality asserts that this history fails to persuade us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless    is not a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause ante at 54 n 20 apparently the plurality believes it sufficient to rest on the proposition that antiloitering laws represent an anachronistic throwback to an earlier less sophisticated era for example it expresses concern that some antivagrancy laws carried the penalty of slavery ibid but this fact is irrelevant to our analysis of whether there is a constitutional right to loiter for innocent purposes this case does not involve an antiloitering law carrying the penalty of slavery the law at issue in this case criminalizes the failure to obey a police officers order to disperse and imposes modest penalties such as a fine of up to 500 and a prison sentence of up to six months

the pluralitys sweeping conclusion that this ordinance infringes upon a liberty interest protected by the fourteenth amendments due process clause withers when exposed to the relevant history laws prohibiting loitering and vagrancy have been a fixture of angloamerican law at least since the time of the norman conquest see generally c ribtonturner a history of vagrants and vagrancy and beggars and begging reprint 1972 discussing history of english vagrancy laws see also papachristou v jacksonville 405 u s 156 161162 1972 recounting history of vagrancy laws the american colonists enacted laws modeled upon the english vagrancy laws and at the time of the founding state and local governments customarily criminalized loitering and other forms of vagrancy2 vagrancy laws were common in the decades preceding the ratification of the fourteenth amendment3 and remained on the books long after4

tellingly the plurality cites only three cases in support of the asserted right to loiter for innocent purposes see ante at 5354 of those only one—decided more than 100 years after the ratification of the fourteenth amendment— actually addressed the validity of a vagrancy ordinance that case papachristou supra contains some dicta that can be read to support the fundamental right that the plurality asserts5 however the court in papachristou did not undertake the nowaccepted analysis applied in substantive due process cases—it did not look to tradition to define the rights protected by the due process clause in any event a careful reading of the opinion reveals that the court never said anything about a constitutional right the courts holding was that the antiquarian language employed in the vagrancy ordinance at issue was unconstitutionally vague see id at 162163 even assuming then that papachristou was correctly decided as an original matter—a doubtful proposition—it does not compel the conclusion that the constitution protects the right to loiter for innocent purposes the pluralitys contrary assertion calls to mind the warning that the judiciary including this court is the most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judgemade constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the design of the constitution    we should be extremely reluctant to breathe still further substantive content into the due process clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a state or city to promote its welfare moore 431 u s at 544 white j dissenting when the judiciary does so it unavoidably preempts for itself another part of the governance of the country without express constitutional authority ibidbh3

the court concludes that the ordinance is also unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide adequate standards to guide police discretion and because in the pluralitys view it does not give residents adequate notice of how to conform their conduct to the confines of the law i disagree on both counts1h4

at the outset it is important to note that the ordinance does not criminalize loitering per se rather it penalizes loiterers failure to obey a police officers order to move along a majority of the court believes that this scheme vests too much discretion in police officers nothing could be further from the truth far from according officers too much discretion the ordinance merely enables police officers to fulfill one of their traditional functions police officers are not and have never been simply enforcers of the criminal law they wear other hats—importantly they have long been vested with the responsibility for preserving the public peace see e g o allen duties and liabilities of sheriffs 59 1845 as the principal conservator of the peace in his county and as the calm but irresistible minister of the law the duty of the sheriff is no less important than his authority is great e freund police power § 86 p 87 1904 the criminal law deals with offenses after they have been committed the police power aims to prevent them the activity of the police for the prevention of crime is partly such as needs no special legal authority nor is the idea that the police are also peace officers simply a quaint anachronism in most american jurisdictions police officers continue to be obligated by law to maintain the public peace6

in their role as peace officers the police long have had the authority and the duty to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse for example the 1887 police manual for the city of new york providedit is hereby made the duty of the police force at all times of day and night and the members of such force are hereby there unto empowered to especially preserve the public peace prevent crime detect and arrest offenders suppress riots mobs and insurrections disperse unlawful or dangerous assemblages and assemblages which obstruct the free passage of public streets side walks parks and places  manual containing the rules and regulations of the police department of the city of new york rule 414 emphasis added

see also j crocker duties of sheriffs coroners and constables § 48 p 33 2d ed rev 1871 sheriffs are ex officio conservators of the peace within their respective counties and it is their duty as well as that of all constables coroners marshals and other peace officers to prevent every breach of the peace and to suppress every unlawful assembly affray or riot which may happen in their presence emphasis added the authority to issue dispersal orders continues to play a commonplace and crucial role in police operations particularly in urban areas7 even the aba standards for criminal justice recognize that in daytoday police experience there are innumerable situations in which police are called upon to order people not to block the sidewalk not to congregate in a given place and not to loiter     the police may suspect the loiterer of considering engaging in some form of undesirable conduct that can be at least temporarily frustrated by ordering him or her to move on  standard 134d p 188 and comments 2d ed 1980 supp 19868

in order to perform their peacekeeping responsibilities satisfactorily the police inevitably must exercise discretion indeed by empowering them to act as peace officers the law assumes that the police will exercise that discretion responsibly and with sound judgment that is not to say that the law should not provide objective guidelines for the police but simply that it cannot rigidly constrain their every action by directing a police officer not to issue a dispersal order unless he observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place app to pet for cert 61a chicagos ordinance strikes an appropriate balance between those two extremes just as we trust officers to rely on their experience and expertise in order to make spurofthemoment determinations about amorphous legal standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion so we must trust them to determine whether a group of loiterers contains individuals in this case members of criminal street gangs whom the city has determined threaten the public peace see ornelas v united states 517 u s 690 695 700 1996 articulating precisely what reasonable suspicion and probable cause mean is not possible they are commonsense nontechnical conceptions that deal with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men not legal technicians act    our cases have recognized that a police officer may draw inferences based on his own experience in deciding whether probable cause exists citations and internal quotation marks omitted in sum the courts conclusion that the ordinance is impermissibly vague because it necessarily entrusts lawmaking to the momenttomoment judgment of the policeman on his beat  ante at 60 cannot be reconciled with common sense longstanding police practice or this courts fourth amendment jurisprudence

the illogic of the courts position becomes apparent when it opines that the ordinances dispersal provision would no doubt be sufficient if the ordinance only applied to loitering that had an apparently harmful purpose or effect or possibly if it only applied to loitering by persons reasonably believed to be criminal gang members ante at 62 footnote omitted see also ante at 67 oconnor j concurring in part and concurring in judgment endorsing courts proposal with respect if the court believes that the ordinance is vague as written this suggestion would not cure the vagueness problem first although the court has suggested that a scienter requirement may mitigate a vagueness problem with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc 455 u s 489 499 1982 footnote omitted the alternative proposal does not incorporate a scienter requirement if the ordinances prohibition were limited to loitering with an apparently harmful purpose the criminality of the conduct would continue to depend on its external appearance rather than the loiterers state of mind see blacks law dictionary 1345 6th ed 1990 scienter is frequently used to signify the defendants guilty knowledge for this reason the proposed alternative would neither satisfy the standard suggested in hoffman estates nor serve to channel police discretion indeed an ordinance that required officers to ascertain whether a group of loiterers have an apparently harmful purpose would require them to exercise more discretion not less furthermore the ordinance in its current form—requiring the dispersal of groups that contain at least one gang member—actually vests less discretion in the police than would a law requiring that the police disperse groups that contain only gang members currently an officer must reasonably suspect that one individual is a member of a gang under the pluralitys proposed law an officer would be required to make such a determination multiple times

in concluding that the ordinance adequately channels police discretion i do not suggest that a police officer enforcing the gang congregation ordinance will never make a mistake nor do i overlook the possibility that a police officer acting in bad faith might enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary or discriminatory way but our decisions should not turn on the proposition that such an event will be anything but rare instances of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance like any other law are best addressed when and if they arise rather than prophylactically through the disfavored mechanism of a facial challenge on vagueness grounds see united states v salerno 481 u s 739 745 1987 a facial challenge to a legislative act is of course the most difficult challenge to mount successfully since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid2the pluralitys conclusion that the ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted ante at 60 is similarly untenable there is nothing vague about an order to disperse9 while we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language grayned v city of rockford 408 u s 104 110 1972 itis safe to assume that the vast majority of people who are ordered by the police to disperse and remove themselves from the area will have little difficulty understanding how to comply app to pet for cert 61a

assuming that we are also obligated to consider whether the ordinance places individuals on notice of what conduct might subject them to such an order respondents in this facial challenge bear the weighty burden of establishing that the statute is vague in all its applications in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all coates v cincinnati 402 u s 611 614 1971 i subscribe to the view of retired justice white—if any fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within the reach of the statute if there is an unmistakable core that a reasonable person would know is forbidden by the law the enactment is not unconstitutional on its face kolender 461 u s at 370371 dissenting opinion this is certainly such a case as the illinois supreme court recognized persons of ordinary intelligence may maintain a common and accepted meaning of the word loiter  177 ill 2d at 451 687 n e 2d at 61

justice stevens contrary conclusion is predicated primarily on the erroneous assumption that the ordinance proscribes large amounts of constitutionally protected andor innocent conduct see ante at 55 5657 60 as already explained supra at 102106 the ordinance does not proscribe constitutionally protected conduct—there is no fundamental right to loiter it is also anomalous to characterize loitering as innocent conduct when it has been disfavored throughout american history when a category of conduct has been consistently criminalized it can hardly be considered innocent similarly when a term has long been used to describe criminal conduct the need to subject it to the more stringent vagueness test suggested in hoffman estates 455 u s at 499 dissipates for there is no risk of a trap for the unwary the term loiter is no different from terms such as fraud bribery and perjury we expect people of ordinary intelligence to grasp the meaning of such legal terms despite the fact that they are arguably imprecise10

the plurality also concludes that the definition of the term loiter—to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose see 177 ill2d at 445 687 n e 2d at 58—fails to provide adequate notice11 it is difficult to imagine the plurality posits how any citizen of the city of chicago standing in a public place   would know if he or she had an apparent purpose  ante at 5657 the plurality underestimates the intellectual capacity of the citizens of chicago persons of ordinary intelligence are perfectly capable of evaluating how outsiders perceive their conduct and here it is selfevident that there is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at least a semblance of common sense would know is loitering and that would be covered by the statute see smith v goguen 415 u s 566 584 1974 white j concurring in judgment members of a group standing on the corner staring blankly into space for example are likely well aware that passersby would conclude that they have no apparent purpose in any event because this is a facial challenge the pluralitys ability to hypothesize that some individuals in some circumstances may be unable to ascertain how their actions appear to outsiders is irrelevant to our analysis here we are asked to determine whether the ordinance is vague in all of its applications hoffman estates supra at 497 the answer is unquestionably no

  

today the court focuses extensively on the rights of gang members and their companions it can safely do so— the people who will have to live with the consequences of todays opinion do not live in our neighborhoods rather the people who will suffer from our lofty pronouncements are people like ms susan mary jackson people who have seen their neighborhoods literally destroyed by gangs and violence and drugs they are good decent people who must struggle to overcome their desperate situation against all odds in order to raise their families earn a living and remain good citizens as one resident described there is only about maybe one or two percent of the people in the city causing these problems maybe but its keeping 98 percent of us in our houses and off the streets and afraid to shop transcript 126 by focusing exclusively on the imagined rights of the two percent the court today has denied our most vulnerable citizens the very thing that justice stevens ante at 54 elevates above all else—the freedom of movement  and that is a shame i respectfully dissentfootnotes briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the united states by solicitor general waxman deputy solicitor general underwood and james a feldman for the state of ohio et al by betty d montgomery attorney general of ohio jeffrey s sutton state solicitor robert c maier and david m gormley and by the attorneys general for their respective jurisdictions as follows william h pryor jr of alabama bruce m botelho of alaska grant woods of arizona daniel e lungren of california gale a norton of colorado john m bailey of connecticut m jane brady of delaware robert a butterworth of florida thurbert e baker of georgia james e ryan of illinois jeffrey a modisett of indiana carla j stovall of kansas a b chandler iii of kentucky richard p ieyoub of louisiana j joseph curran jr of maryland frank j kelley of michigan hubert h humphrey iii of minnesota michael c moore of mississippi jeremiah w jay nixon of missouri joseph p mazurek of montana don stenberg of nebraska frankie sue del papa of nevada dennis c vacco of new york michael f easley of north carolina d michael fisher of pennsylvania carlos lugofiol of puerto rico jeffrey b pine of rhode island charles m condon of south carolina mark barnett of south dakota jan graham of utah julio a brady of the virgin islands and mark o earley of virginia for the center for the community interest by richard k willard and roger l conner for the chicago neighborhood organizations by michele l odorizzi and jeffrey w sarles for the los angeles county district attorney by gil garcetti pro se and brent dail riggs for the national district attorneys association et al by kristin linsley myles daniel p collins william l murphy and wayne w schmidt for the washington legal foundation et al by daniel j popeo and richard a samp and for the u s conference of mayors et al by richard ruda miguel a estrada and mark a perry

2 the ordinance states in pertinent part

a whenever a police officer observes a person whom he reasonably believes to be a criminal street gang member loitering in any public place with one or more other persons he shall order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from the area any person who does not promptly obey such an order is in violation of this section

b it shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of this section that no person who was observed loitering was in fact a member of a criminal street gang

c as used in this section

1 loiter means to remain in any one place with no apparent purpose

2 criminal street gang means any ongoing organization association in fact or group of three or more persons whether formal or informal having as one of its substantial activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in paragraph 3 and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity

    

5 public place means the public way and any other location open to the public whether publicly or privately owned

e any person who violates this section is subject to a fine of not less than 100 and not more than 500 for each offense or imprisonment for not more than six months or both

in addition to or instead of the above penalties any person who violates this section may be required to perform up to 120 hours of community service pursuant to section 14—120 of this code chicago municipal code § 84—015 added june 17 1992 reprinted in app to pet for cert 61a—63a

3 as the illinois supreme court noted during the hearings preceding the adoption of the ordinance representatives of the chicago law and police departments informed the city counsel that any limitations on the discretion police have in enforcing the ordinance would be best developed through police policy rather than placing such limitations into the ordinance itself 177 ill 2d at 446 687 n e 2d at 5859

4 presumably these officers would also be able to arrest all nongang members who violate the ordinance

19 see brief for united states as amicus curiae 23 we do not doubt that under the due process clause individuals in this country have significant liberty interests in standing on sidewalks and in other public places and in traveling moving and associating with others the city appears to agree at least to the extent that such activities include social gatherings brief for petitioner 21 n 13 both justice scalia post at 8386 dissenting opinion and justice thomas post at 102106 dissenting opinion not only disagree with this proposition but also incorrectly assume as the city does not see brief for petitioner 44 that identification of an obvious liberty interest that is impacted by a statute is equivalent to finding a violation of substantive due process see n 35 infra

20 petitioner cites historical precedent against recognizing what it describes as the fundamental right to loiter brief for petitioner 12 while antiloitering ordinances have long existed in this country their pedigree does not ensure their constitutionality in 16thcentury england for example the slavery acts  provided for a 2year enslavement period for anyone who liveth idly and loiteringly by the space of three days  note homelessness in a modern urban setting 10 ford urb l j 749 754 n 17 1982 in papachristou we noted that many american vagrancy laws were patterned on these elizabethan poor laws 405 u s at 161162 these laws went virtually unchallenged in this country until attorneys became widely available to the indigent following our decision in gideon v wainwright 372 u s 335 1963 see recent developments constitutional attacks on vagrancy laws 20 stan l rev 782 783 1968 in addition vagrancy laws were used after the civil war to keep former slaves in a state of quasi slavery in 1865 for example alabama broadened its vagrancy statute to include any runaway stubborn servant or child  and a laborer or servant who loiters away his time or refuses to comply with any contract for a term of service without just cause  t wilson black codes of the south 76 1965 the reconstructionera vagrancy laws had especially harsh consequences on africanamerican women and children l kerber no constitutional right to be ladies women and the obligations of citizenship 5069 1998 neither this history nor the scholarly compendia in justice thomas dissent post at 102106 persuades us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause

21 the freewheeling and hypothetical character of justice scalias discussion of liberty is epitomized by his assumption that citizens of chicago who were once free to drive about the city at whatever speed they wished were the ones who decided to limit that freedom by adopting a speed limit post at 73 history tells quite a different story

in 1903 the illinois legislature passed an act to regulate the speed of automobiles and other horseless conveyances upon the public streets roads and highways of the state of illinois that statute with some exceptions set a speed limit of 15 miles per hour see christy v elliott 216 ill 31 74 n e 1035 1905 in 1900 there were 1698575 citizens of chicago 1 twelfth census of the united states 430 1900 table 6 but only 8000 cars both private and commercial registered in the entire united states see wards automotive yearbook 230 1990 even though the number of cars in the country had increased to 77400 by 1905 ibid it seems quite clear that it was pedestrians rather than drivers who were primarily responsible for illinois decision to impose a speed limit

22 the burden of the first portion of justice scalias dissent is virtually a facial challenge to the facial challenge doctrine see post at 7483 he first lauds the clarity of our general jurisprudence in the method for assessing facial challenges and then states that the clear import of our cases is that in order to mount a successful facial challenge a plaintiff must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid see post at 7879 emphasis deleted united states v salerno 481 u s 739 745 1987 to the extent we have consistently articulated a clear standard for facial challenges it is not the salerno formulation which has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this court including salerno itself even though the defendants in that case did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them see id at 745 n 3 the court nevertheless entertained their facial challenge since we like the illinois supreme court conclude that vagueness permeates the ordinance a facial challenge is appropriate

we need not however resolve the viability of salerno s dictum because this case comes to us from a state—not a federal—court when asserting a facial challenge a party seeks to vindicate not only his own rights but those of others who may also be adversely impacted by the statute in question in this sense the threshold for facial challenges is a species of third party jus tertii standing which we have recognized as a prudential doctrine and not one mandated by article iii of the constitution see secretary of state of md v joseph h munson co 467 u s 947 955 1984 when a state court has reached the merits of a constitutional claim invoking prudential limitations on the respondents assertion of jus tertii would serve no functional purpose city of revere v massachusetts gen hospital 463 u s 239 243 1983 internal quotation marks omitted

whether or not it would be appropriate for federal courts to apply the salerno standard in some cases—a proposition which is doubtful—state courts need not apply prudential notions of standing created by this court see asarco inc v kadish 490 u s 605 618 1989 justice scalias assumption that state courts must apply the restrictive salerno test is incorrect as a matter of law moreover it contradicts essential principles of federalism see dorf facial challenges to state and federal statutes 46 stan l rev 235 284 1994

23 the solicitor general while supporting the citys argument that the ordinance is constitutional appears to recognize that the ordinance cannot be read literally without invoking intractable vagueness concerns the purpose simply to stand on a corner cannot be an apparent purpose under the ordinance if it were the ordinance would prohibit nothing at all brief for united states as amicus curiae 1213

24 177 ill 2d at 452 687 n e 2d at 61 one of the trial courts that invalidated the ordinance gave the following illustration suppose a group of gang members were playing basketball in the park while waiting for a drug delivery their apparent purpose is that they are in the park to play ball the actual purpose is that they are waiting for drugs under this definition of loitering a group of people innocently sitting in a park discussing their futures would be arrested while the basketball players awaiting a drug delivery would be left alone chicago v youkhana nos 93 mci 293363 et al ill cir ct cook cty sept 29 1993 app to pet for cert 48a—49a

27 brief for petitioner 31

28 in this way the ordinance differs from the statute upheld in colten v kentucky 407 u s 104 110 1972 there we found that the illegality of the underlying conduct was clear any person who stands in a group of persons along a highway where the police are investigating a traffic violation and seeks to engage the attention of an officer issuing a summons should understand that he could be convicted under    kentuckys statute if he fails to obey an order to move on ibid

29 literally read    this ordinance says that a person may stand on a public sidewalk in birmingham only at the whim of any police officer of that city the constitutional vice of so broad a provision needs no demonstration 382 u sat 90

30 as we have noted in a similar context if petitioners were held guilty of violating the georgia statute because they disobeyed the officers this case falls within the rule that a generally worded statute which is construed to punish conduct which cannot constitutionally be punished is unconstitutionally vague to the extent that it fails to give adequate warning of the boundary between the constitutionally permissible and constitutionally impermissible applications of the statute wright v georgia 373 u s 284 292 1963

31 this critical fact distinguishes this case from boos v barry 485 u s 312 329330 1988 there we noted that the text of the relevant statute read literallymay have been void for vagueness both on notice and on discretionary enforcement grounds we then found however that the court of appeals had provided a narrowing construction that alleviates both of these difficulties ibid

32 it is possible to read the mandatory language of the ordinance and conclude that it affords the police no discretion since it speaks with the mandatory shall however not even the city makes this argument which flies in the face of common sense that all police officers must use some discretion in deciding when and where to enforce city ordinances

33 justice thomas dissent overlooks the important distinction between this ordinance and those that authorize the police to order groups of individuals who threaten the public peace to disperse see post at 107

34 not all of the respondents in this case for example are gang members the city admits that it was unable to prove that morales is a gang member but justifies his arrest and conviction by the fact that morales admitted that he knew he was with criminal street gang members reply brief for petitioner 23 n 14 in fact 34 of the 66 respondents in this case were charged in a document that only accused them of being in the presence of a gang member tr of oral arg 34 58

35 this conclusion makes it unnecessary to reach the question whether the illinois supreme court correctly decided that the ordinance is invalid as a deprivation of substantive due process for this reason justice thomas see post at 102106 and justice scalia see post at 8586 are mistaken when they assert that our decision must be analyzed under the framework for substantive due process set out in washington v glucksberg 521 u s 702 1997

1 in other words a facial attack since it requires unconstitutionality in all circumstances necessarily presumes that the litigant presently before the court would be able to sustain an asapplied challenge see hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc 455 u s 489 495 1982 a plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others a court should therefore examine the complainants conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law parker v levy 417 u s 733 756 1974 one to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness

the plurality asserts that in united states v salerno 481 u s 739 1987 which i discuss in text immediately following this footnote the court entertained a facial challenge even though the defendants    did not claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them ante at 55 n 22 that is not so the court made it absolutely clear in salerno that a facial challenge requires the assertion that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid 481 u s at 745 emphasis added the footnoted statement upon which the plurality relies nor have respondents claimed that the act is unconstitutional because of the way it was applied to the particular facts of their case id at 745 n 3 was obviously meant to convey the fact that the defendants were not making in addition to their facial challenge an alternative asapplied challenge—i e asserting that even if the statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications it was at least unconstitutional in its particular application to them

2 salerno a criminal case repudiated the courts statement in kolender v lawson 461 u s 352 359 n 8 1983 to the effect that a facial challenge to a criminal statute could succeed even when the statute could conceivably have had some valid application kolender seems to have confused the standard for first amendment overbreadth challenges with the standard governing facial challenges on all other grounds see ibid citing the courts articulation of the standard for first amendment overbreadth challenges from hoffman estates supra at 494 as salerno noted supra at 745 the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression see e g broadrick v oklahoma 413 u s 601 612 1973

3 the plurality asserts that the salerno standard for facial challenge has never been the decisive factor in any decision of this court ante at 55 n 22 it means by that only this in rejecting a facial challenge the court has never contented itself with identifying only one situation in which the challenged statute would be constitutional but has mentioned several but that is not at all remarkable and casts no doubt upon the validity of the principle that salerno and these many other cases enunciated it is difficult to conceive of a statute that would be constitutional in only a single application—and hard to resist mentioning more than one

the plurality contends that it does not matter whether the salerno standard is federal law since facial challenge is a species of thirdparty standing and federal limitations upon thirdparty standing do not apply in an appeal from a state decision which takes a broader view as the illinois supreme courts opinion did here ante at 5556 n 22 this is quite wrong disagreement over the salerno rule is not a disagreement over the standing question whether the person challenging the statute can raise the rights of third parties under both salerno and the pluralitys rule he can the disagreement relates to how many thirdparty rights he must prove to be infringed by the statute before he can win salerno says all in addition to his own rights the plurality says many that is not a question of standing but of substantive law the notion that if salerno is the federal rule a federal statute is not totally invalid unless it is invalid in all its applications it can be altered by a state court a federal statute is totally invalid if it is invalid in many of its applications and that that alteration must be accepted by the supreme court of the united states is to put it as gently as possible remarkable

6 the pluralitys explanation for ignoring these laws is that many of them carried severe penalties and during the reconstruction era they had harsh consequences on africanamerican women and children ante at 54 n 20 those severe penalties and those harsh consequences are certainly regrettable but they in no way lessen indeed the harshness of penalty tends to increase the capacity of these laws to prove that loitering was never regarded as a fundamental liberty

7 ante at 53 n 19 the plurality bases its assertion of apparent concession upon a footnote in part i of petitioners brief which reads of course laws regulating social gatherings affect a liberty interest and thus are subject to review under the rubric of substantive due process     we address that doctrine in part ii below brief for petitioner 2122 n 13 if a careless reader were inclined to confuse the term social gatherings in this passage with loitering his confusion would be eliminated by pursuing the reference to part ii of the brief which says in its introductory paragraph as we explain below substantive due process does not support the courts novel holding that the constitution secures the right to stand still on the public way even when one is not engaged in speech assembly or other conduct that enjoys affirmative constitutional protection id at 39

8 the plurality says ante at 64 n 35 that since it decides the case on the basis of procedural due process rather than substantive due process i am mistaken in analyzing its opinion under the framework for substantive due process set out in washington v glucksberg  ibid but i am not analyzing it under that framework i am simply assuming that when the plurality says as an essential part of its reasoning that the right to loiter for innocent purposes is    a part of the liberty protected by the due process clause it does not believe that the same word liberty means one thing for purposes of substantive due process and something else for purposes of procedural due process there is no authority for that startling proposition see board of regents of state colleges v roth 408 u s 564 572575 1972 rejecting proceduraldueprocess claim for lack of liberty interest and citing substantivedueprocess cases

the pluralitys opinion seeks to have it both ways invoking the fourteenth amendments august protection of liberty in defining the standard of certainty that it sets but then in identifying the conduct protected by that high standard ignoring our extensive case law defining liberty and substituting instead all harmless and innocent conduct ante at 58

9 i call it a suggestion because the plurality says only that the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy of the notice and acknowledges that they might not render the ordinance unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct were clear ante at 59 5960 this notion that a prescription disperse which is itself not unconstitutionally vague can somehow contribute to the unconstitutional vagueness of the entire scheme is full of mystery—suspending as it does the metaphysical principle that nothing can confer what it does not possess nemo dat qui non habet 

10 administrative interpretation and implementation of a regulation are   highly relevant to our vagueness analysis for in evaluating a facial challenge to a state law a federal court must    consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered  ward vrock against racism 491 u s781 795796 1989 emphasis added quoting hoffman estates 455 u s at 494 n 5 see also id at 504 administrative regulations will often suffice to clarify a standard with an otherwise uncertain scope

11 justice breyer asserts that one always has some apparent purpose so that the policeman must interpret the words no apparent purpose as meaning no apparent purpose except for      ante at 70 it is simply not true that one always has some apparent purpose—and especially not true that one always has some apparent purpose in remaining at rest for the simple reason that one often indeed perhaps usually has no actual purpose in remaining at rest remaining at rest will be a persons normal state unless he has a purpose which causes him to move that is why one frequently reads of a persons wandering aimlessly which is worthy of note but not of a persons sitting aimlessly which is not remarkable at all and that is why a synonym for purpose is motive that which causes one to move

12 the court speculates that a police officer may exercise his discretion to enforce the ordinance and direct dispersal when in the courts view the ordinance is inapplicable—viz where there is an apparent purpose but it is an unlawful one see ante at 62 no one in his right mind would read the phrase without any apparent purpose to mean anything other than without any apparent lawful purpose the implication that acts referred to approvingly in statutory language are lawful acts is routine the court asserts that the illinois supreme court has forced it into this interpretive inanity because since it has not placed any limiting construction on the language in the ordinance we must assume that the ordinance means what it says     ante at 63 but the illinois supreme court did not mention this particular interpretive issue which has nothing to do with giving the ordinance a limiting interpretation and everything to do with giving it its ordinary legal meaning

13 the opinion that justice breyer relies on coates v cincinnati 402 u s 611 1971 discussed ante at 7273 did not say that the ordinance there at issue gave adequate notice but did not provide adequate standards for the police it invalidated that ordinance on both inadequatenotice and inadequateenforcementstandard grounds because first amendment rights were implicated it is common ground however that the present case does not implicate the first amendment see ante at 5253 plurality opinion ante at 72 breyer j concurring in part and concurring in judgment
