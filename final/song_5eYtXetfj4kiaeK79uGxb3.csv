this isnt over baby dont believe a word they said
but then she takes a moment to ponder
to wonder what couldve been given another chance
to find a light in the darkness and a way out of this
if only she could see what i could see

verse
she takes a moment to stumble to her feet
if only i was there to hold her hand
if only she saw what i saw
shed get out of this one shed get out of here

prechorus
what burns the most is that you lied right to my face
and still i hold your hand to set you free
what burns the most is that you lied right to my face
and still i hold your hand to set you free to set you free

chorus
with eyes closed her heart breaks
and through it all she brought this on herself on herself
with eyes closed her heart breaks
and through it all she brought this on herself on herself

she brought this on herself
she falls she falls she falls beside me
she falls beside me she falls she falls
she falls she falls beside me she falls she falls
she falls she falls beside me she falls

and through it all she brought this on herself on herself

and through it all she brought this on herself on herself12embed"
