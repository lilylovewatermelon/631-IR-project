verse mf doom
living off borrowed time the clock tick faster
thatd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
dick dastardly and muttley with sick laughter
a gunfight and they come to cut the mixmaster
ice cold nice to be old
y2g stee twice to threefold
he sold scrolls lo and behold
know whos the illest ever like the greatest story told
keep your glory gold and glitter
for half half of his niggasll take him out the picture
the other half is rich and it dont mean shitta
villain a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
chase it with more beer taste it like truth or dare
when he have the mic its like the place get like aw yeah
its like they know whats bout to happen
just keep ya eye out like aye aye captain
is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody aint hear it
and can they testify from in the spirit nah
in living the true gods
giving yall nothing but the lick like two broads
got more lyrics than the church got ooh lords
and he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
either that or either one with two blades on it
hey you dont touch the mic like its aids on it yuck
its like the end to the means
fuck type of message that sends to the fiends
thats why he bring his own needles
and get more cheese than doritos cheetos or fritos
slip like freudian
your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion
you might also likeoutro mf doom
when he at the mic you dont go next
leaving pussy cats like why hoes need kotex
exercise index wont need bowflex
and wont take the one with no skinny legs like joe tex149embed"
