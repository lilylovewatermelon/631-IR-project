oh

verse 1
well judge looked down gave me forty days
instead of the fine that i could not pay
said walk right youll soon be home
cross the line youll be on your own

chorus
forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
forty nights to sit and listen
to the midnight train to memphis

verse 2
well now whistle blows when the sun comes up
head to floor keep your big mouth shut
eat your breakfast on the ground
work like hell till the sun goes down

chorus
forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
forty nights to sit and listen
to the midnight train to memphis

verse 3
well now ten for the jury ten for the judge
twenty more to forget my grudge
when i get to thirtynine
thats the longest day in a prisoners mind
see chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likechorus
forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
forty nights to sit and listen
to the midnight train to memphis

outro
midnight train to memphis
midnight train to memphis
oh midnight train to memphis1embed"
