if youre tired of the glass being half full
burnin at both ends and youre burnt out
sometimes you got to go a little coastal
take the truck and point it south

chorus
work in a little sunshine overtime
checking on out of that nine to five
sandy streets and the windows down
hair free in the breeze getting all unwound
jump in the water go weekend wild
get wrapped up in an old beach towel
break out tequila salt and the lime
workin sunshine overtime

verse 2
man theres just something about the ocean
flip flops and tank tops and tan lines
makes you wanna grab the sun tan lotion
and let your worries roll out with the tide

chorus
work in a little sunshine overtime
checking on out of that nine to five
sandy streets and the windows down
hair free in the breeze getting all unwound
jump in the water go weekend wild
get wrapped up in an old beach towel
break out tequila salt and the lime
workin sunshine overtime
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
its the kind of fun
thats hard to stop
when its started
so raise a cup and punch the clock on a party
work in a little sunshine overtime

chorus
work in a little sunshine overtime
checking on out of that nine to five
sandy streets and the windows down
hair free in the breeze getting all unwound
jump in the water go weekend wild
get wrapped up in an old beach towel
break out tequila salt and the lime
workin sunshine overtime
work in a little sunshine overtimeembed"
