i know i dont want to
be the one that you run to
when you got nowhere else to go
when you need some love
i know im the last one
you try to call but
i always give in
to give you it all

chorus
ohoh
i cant be your midnight love
ohohoh
when your silver is my gold
ohohoh
in this light i swear im blind
ohohoh
in this light i swear youre mine

verse 2
i hope that the right time one day arrives
so ill be willing to let this die
able to look you right in the eyes
say im not your consolation prize

i cant be your second best
close but not your favorite
i keep going back for more
where theres nothing from before

i cant be your midnight love
ohohoh
when your silver is my gold
i cant be your second best
close but not your favorite
i keep going back for more
where theres nothing from before16embed"
