the world is mine nigga get back
dont fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
about to drop the bomb im the motherfuckin don
big fish in a small pond
now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
but i shook they worm and they hook
guppies hold they breath they want to miss me when im tipsy
running everything west of the mississippi
its the unseen pulling strings with my pinky ring
we got your woman pucker up fore we fuck her up
bow down before i make a phone call
got 25 niggas running up on yall
for the cheese we want them keys
everybody freeze on your knees butt naked please
before any of you guppies get hard
nigga rewind my part fool andbow down

bow down when im westward bound

verse 2 mack 10
i take ten steps and i draw blaow
now whos dissin the madass inglewood addition
i bust like a pimple my mind is ill mental
the westside connects with me and south central
and a drag from the zig zag cant fuck with the phillys
holdin down the wild west like a kid they call billy
once again its mack 10 the gold crown holda
strong as a cocacola with a chrome pistola brr
now who wanna fuss so i can buss when i cuss
my look bring you fear with gear from the surplus
since a teen i chased the green the crackscene king
lolos corniches and baguettes on my pieces ugh

threewheeling and dealing its like the california style
but in the meanwhile in my town you got to bow

bow down when you come to my town
bow down when im westward bound
bow down because i aint a hater like you
bow down to a nigga thats greater than you
