you say its coming but i cant see it at all
you know me well but i dont know you at all
no i dont know you at all
its always just on the horizon so my hopes rise and fall
you know me well but i dont know you at all
no i dont know you at all

we wanted to play but we had nothing left to play for
colourless colour
once in fashion soon to be seen

we wanted to play but we had nothing left to play for
colourless colour
once in fashion soon to be seen

verse 2
been dreaming of blue skies new horizons
and sights from my eyes
the discovery of the unknown
is something to tell the folks back home
i want to get away to feel the sun on my skin
to feel it really sinking in
