verse 1 jayz
yeah i get it down anxiously the public cant wait
niggas had to have it way before its release date
jigga get irate press get it fucked up
took me one point eight but i had to get it straight
get the cd twelve inch vinyl get the tape
jigga give out food for thought dog get a plate
i get it down get it crunk when i get in the state of mind
that whats mine is mine nobody get to take
i dont bend break fold scratch go down
my mental rolodex see these words i just dont know
i know stress drama niggas upsetting my mama
arrested put in the lineup trying to put dents in my armor
but im a survivor plus im liver than most
out on bail fifty thou still riding with toast
i aint trying to collide with folk
but i dont want folk taking jigga for joke
i guess you niggas just woke  good morning
you might also likechorus r kelly
yall cats cant touch me
you cant touch me no you cant touch me
jigga kelly not guilty
try to charge me but im not guilty

ive got all of my mamis
tell me what you want from me
tell me what yall want from me
im not guilty

verse 2 jayz
i see how you coming at me now im cool
im not the snitch i dont go to the cops to get rich
i go to the block and pitch
i go with the glock and click i go with the pop im sick
i go with you hard i aint gon stop for shit
look in my eyes dog right in my pupils
if im your rival why would i have to do you
press try to throw dirt on my name disturbing my game
seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned glad hes indicted
i got big money big lawyers to fight it
just like cochran cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
yall all know it jiggas a fighter
plus im claustrophobic back on the streets before you know it
and my word niggas i heard you niggas
ima address each and every one of you cocksuckers
fuck the white press the block love us hiphop forever
big is here the soul of 2pac hovers  above us
chorus r kelly jayz
yall cats cant touch me
you cant touch me no you cant touch me
jigga kelly not guilty
try to charge me but im not guilty
i got all my mamis
ive got all of my mamis
tell me what you want from me
tell me uhh i am the one
what you want from me not guilty

verse 3 jayz
uhh okay you on my radar i got you too bitch
got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
same lame bitch i bust in her face
honey just mad i got her fucking replaced
plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
but i aint gon lie the head was sick
but what we need to do is put that mouth on a better bitch
you heard the rhetoric jigga hit me over the head
with a champagne bottle at the bar can he buy me a car
naw how do yall equate your pain
would it all go away if i bought you a range
i got one or two of those nothin gon change
for nothing else you gotta live with yourself
try and lie on hov cause i ride on the road
in what most would describe as a rolls
no thats that continental t
the only car that fit intercontinental me not guilty
chorus  outro r kelly  jayz
yall cats cant touch me
