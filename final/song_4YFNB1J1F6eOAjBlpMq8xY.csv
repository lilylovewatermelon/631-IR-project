i can never think correctly
you can never show your heart
i was set in my ways and you
wanted to change and we both fell apart
you wanted a man to marry
and i could never get past my sin
it was all just so strange
i was halfway deranged
pretty much the same shape im in now

refrain
and i need you if im gonna make it through this hell
annabel

verse 2
your benevolent way and manner
my sickly gunshot heart
you wanted for me to heal
but i just tried to conceal it all right from the start
keep it honest and open
thats what you always said
but whats a man to do when
he dont know the truth
and he lives inside his own head now
you might also likerefrain
but i need you if im gonna make it through this hell
ahhhh

interlude
and i guess ill just give it a shot now
try to make it on my own
but god it just feel like a let down
that this house just aint our home
aint our home

refrain
i need you if im gonna make it through this hell
i need you if im gonna make it through this hell
i need you if im gonna make it through this hell
