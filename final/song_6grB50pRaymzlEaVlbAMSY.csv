oh me oh my oh would you look at miss ohio

verse 2
had your arm around her shoulder a regimental soldier
and mamma starts pushing’ that wedding gown
yeah i wanna do right but not right now

oh me oh my oh would you look at miss ohio
she’s a running’ around with her ragtop down
she says i wanna do right but not right now
