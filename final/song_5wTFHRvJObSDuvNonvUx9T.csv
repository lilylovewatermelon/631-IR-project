what you gonna do with the thirtysix cents
sticky with coke on your floorboard
when a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
on a sidewalk vent trying to keep warm
do you call her over hand her the change
ask her story ask her her name
or do you tell yourself

interlude
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world

verse 2
oh what you gonna do when youre watching tv
and an ad comes on yeah you know the kind
flashing up pictures of a child in need
for a dime a day you could save a life
do you call the number reach out a hand
or do you change the channel call it a scam
do you tell yourself

chorus
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
dont listen to em when they say
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
oh the smallest thing can make all the difference
love is alive dont listen to em when they say
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likebridge
the worlds so big it can break your heart
and you just wanna help not sure where to start
so you close your eyes
and send up a prayer into the dark

chorus
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
dont listen to em when they say
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world
oh the smallest thing can make all the difference
love is alive dont you listen to em when they say
youre just a fool just a fool to believe you can change the world3embed"
