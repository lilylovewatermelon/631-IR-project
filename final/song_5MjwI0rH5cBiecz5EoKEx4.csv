cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug em in and then turn em on
process the data make yourself the bomb
what is your target what is your reason
do you have emotions is your heart freezing
seizin this opportunity to speak
you didnt say nuthin but turn your fuckin cheek

dead cell dead cell

sick in the head living but dead
hear what i said
learn a lesson from the almighty dread
jah nutty warrior nothins scarier
kids are gettin sick like malaria
situation gets hairier
im throwing up all types of barriers
im tellin you
the kids are getting singled out
let me hear the dead cell shout

dead cell dead cell

born with no soul lack of control
cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug em in and then turn them on
process the data make yourself the bomb
no soul no control
cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug em in and then turn them on
process the data make yourself the bomb
you might also likestop pointing fingers cause we all are guilty
of clean cut lies and the truth thats filthy
believe what is the root of the word
out comes lie when its cut into thirds
i dont believe what my eyes behold no
i dont believe what my ears are told no
seizin this opportunity to speak
im saying something dont turn your fuckin cheek

dead cell dead cell

born with no soul lack of control
cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug them in and then turn em on
process the data make yourself the bomb
no soul no control
cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug them in and then turn em on
process the data make yourself the bomb

dead cell
