i hope you never lose your sense of wonder
you get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
may you never take one single breath for granted
god forbid love ever leave you emptyhanded

verse 2
i hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
whenever one door closes i hope one more opens
promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

chorus
i hope you dance
i hope you dance

verse 3
i hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
never settle for the path of least resistance
livin might mean takin chances but theyre worth takin
lovin might be a mistake but its worth makin

verse 4
dont let some hellbent heart leave you bitter
when you come close to sellin out reconsider
give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
