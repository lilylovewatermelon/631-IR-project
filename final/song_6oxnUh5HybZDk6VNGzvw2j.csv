can you lie next to her
and give her your heart your heart
as well as your body
and can you lie next to her
and confess your love your love
as well as your folly
and can you kneel before the king
and say im clean im clean
chorus
but tell me now where was my fault
in loving you with my whole heart
oh tell me now where was my fault
in loving you with my whole heart

verse 2
a white blank page and a swelling rage rage
you did not think when you sent me to the brink to the brink
you desired my attention
but denied my affections my affections
chorus
so tell me now where was my fault
in loving you with my whole heart
oh tell me now where was my fault
in loving you with my whole heart

lead me to the truth and i
will follow you with my whole life
oh lead me to the truth and i
will follow you with my whole life
