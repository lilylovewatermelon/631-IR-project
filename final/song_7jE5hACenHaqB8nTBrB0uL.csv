and i would turn on the tv but its so embarrassing
to see all the other people i dont know what they mean
and it was magic at first when they spoke without sound
but now this world is gonna hurt you better turn that thing down
turn it around

verse 1
well it wasnt me says the boy with the gun
sure i pulled the trigger but it needed to be done
because lifes been killin me ever since it begun
you cant blame me cause im too young

verse 2
you cant blame me sure the killer was my son
but i didnt teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
its the killin on this tv screen
you cant blame me its those images he sees
verse 3
well you cant blame me says the media man
well i wasnt the one who came up with the plan
and i just point my camera at what the people want to see
man its a two way mirror and you cant blame me

verse 4
you cant blame me says the singer of the song
or the maker of the movie which he based his life on
its only entertainment and as anyone can see
its smoke machines and makeup man you cant fool me
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeverse 5
it was you it was me it was every man
weve all got the blood on our hands
we only receive what we demand
and if we want hell then hells what well have

chorus
and i would turn on the tv but its so embarrassing
to see all the other people dont even know what they mean
and it was magic at first but lets everyone down
but now this world is gonna hurt you better turn it around
turn it around1embed"
