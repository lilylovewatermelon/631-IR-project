i remember

verse 1
good girl sad boy
big city wrong choices
we had one thing goin on
i swear that it was somethin
cause i dont remember who i was
before you painted all my nights
a color ive searched for since
but one thing after another
fuckin situations circumstances
miscommunications and i
have to say by the way
i just may like some explanations

chorus
can i ask you a question
did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
and every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
but fifteen seconds later thеy were clappin too
then what did you do
did you lеave her house in the middle of the night oh
did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
when she said it was too much
do you wish you could still touch her
its just a question

halfmoon eyes bad surprise
did you realize out of time
she was on your mind with some dickhead guy
that you saw that night
but you were on somethin
it was one drink after another
fuckin politics and gender roles
and youre not sure and i dont know
got swept away in the gray
i just may like to have a conversation

chorus
can i ask you a question
did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
and every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
but fifteen seconds later they were clappin too
then what did you do
did you leave her house in the middle of the night oh
did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
when she said it was too much
do you wish you could still touch her
its just a question
