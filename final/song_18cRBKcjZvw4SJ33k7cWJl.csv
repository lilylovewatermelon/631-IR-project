twelve gauge old ford buckshot floorboard dont ask

chorus
if my truck could talk id have to yank out all the wires

its been good to me but it knows too much hed sing it all
id have to find a riverbank and roll it off
if my truck could talk

verse 2
those two headlights looked in her eyes how she danced
moonlit truck bed two kids enough said yeah man
all that went on goes on my own
it can go on and on and on
