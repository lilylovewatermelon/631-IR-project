we were sleeping til you came along
with your tiny heart
you led us in the wooden house
to share in all the wealth

chorus

verse 2
seven figures leap the hungry mouths
the beast he comes to you
hes a hunter for a lonely heart
in the season of the sun

chorus
dont you know its true

bridge
where you thinking that youre gonna run to now
with the beating of a tiny heart
you hang onto the things that youre supposed to say
millions of stars they hold onto your breath
