babe youre getting closer
the lights are going dim
the sound of your breathing
has made the mood im in
all of my resistance
is lying on the floor
taking me to places
ive never been before

prechorus
ooh and i can feel it
feel it feel it feel it

chorus
way down where the music plays
way down like a tidal wave
way down where the fires blaze
way down down way way on down

verse 2
ooh my head is spinning
you got me in your spell
a hundred magic fingers
on a whirling carousel
the medicine within me
no doctor could prescribe
your love is doing something
that i just cant describe
you might also likeprechorus
ooh and i can feel it
feel it feel it feel it

chorus
way down where the music plays
way down like a tidal wave
way down where the fires blaze
way down down way way on down

break
hold me again
tight as you can
i need you so
baby lets go

chorus
way down where the music plays
way down like a tidal wave
way down where the fires blaze
way down down way way on downembed"
