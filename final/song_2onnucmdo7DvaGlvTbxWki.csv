verse 1
feels like im waking from the dead
and everyones been waiting on me
least now ill never have to wonder
what its like to sleep a year away
but werent we indestructible
i thought that we could brave it all
i never thought that what would take me out
was hiding down below

prechorus
lost the battle win the war
im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
starting over or head back in
theres a time and a place to die but this aint it

chorus
if theres a future we want it
nowowowowowowowow
if theres a future we want it
nowowowowowowowow
if theres a future we want it
nowowowowowowowow
if theres a future we want it
nowowowowowowowow

verse 2
wish i could find a crystal ball
for the days i feel completely worthless
you know id use it all for good
i would not take it for granted
instead i have some memories
for the days i dont feel anything
at the least they will remind me
not to make the same mistakes again

prechorus
lost the battle win the war
im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore

theres a time and a place to die but this aint it
