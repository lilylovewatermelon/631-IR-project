we drive through the woods rich neighborhoods to watch
we joked as we looked that they were too good for us
cause socially speaking we were the same
with runaway fathers and mothers who drank
a tale old as time young love dont last for life
and now i know now i know
its time to go its time to go

chorus
weve traveled the seas weve ridden the stars
weve seen everything from saturn to mars
as much as it seems like you own my heart
its astronomy were two worlds apart

postchorus
its astronomy were two worlds apart
its astronomy were two worlds apart

verse 2
from far away i wish id stayed with you
but here face to face a stranger that i once knew
i thought if i wandered id fall back in love
you said distance brings fondness but guess not with us
the only mistake that we didnt make was run
now look what weve done
you might also likechorus
weve traveled the seas weve ridden the stars
weve seen everything from saturn to mars
as much as it seems like you own my heart
its astronomy were two worlds apart

postchorus
its astronomy were two worlds apart

bridge
stop tryna keep us alive
youre pointing at stars in the sky
that already died
stop tryna keep us alive
you cant force the stars to align
when theyve already died
oh weve died ooh

chorus
oh weve traveled the seas weve ridden the stars
weve seen everything from saturn to mars
as much as it seems like you own my heart
its astronomy were two worlds apart43embed"
