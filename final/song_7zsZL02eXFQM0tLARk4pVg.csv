i dont like the look of it

verse 1 gudda gudda
okay im sippin on the syrup got a nigga movin slow
im all about the money what the fuck you think i do it for
bitch dont act like you dont know im killin all these rap niggas
custom made caskets for yo motherfuckin funeral
keep the women with me shit i gotta keep like two or more
party everyday like we won the fuckin super bowl
chillin wit my nigga mack he keep bitches handy
white girl on the table let em sniff the nose candy
when im walkin by the women sayin who is that nigga
i replied hi i am gudda gudda that nigga
i was raised in the home of the cap splitters
whip on 24s watch it crawl like a caterpillar
i come with a toy boy like a happy meal
and yous a motherfuckin duck daffydil
im from the school of hard knocks where we scrap and kill
pick the knife or gun or you can get the package deal
im hot nigga burnin everything around me
i was lost for a minute took a while but i found me gudda
the streets say im king but the gamell never crown me gudda
realest nigga doin it just ask them niggas round me gudda
so you caint size me up or try to clown a—
shark in the water jump in and ima drown you
new orleans nigga gun out ima down you
put niggas to sleep like a muhfuckin downer gudda

ugh goons on deck marley dont shoot em
silence on the gun watch a nigga mute em
the coach in the booth call me jon gruden
school these niggas they all my students
all jokes aside i aint playin with ya
the weed broke down like a transmission
tha chopper spin him round like a ballerina
bitch im still spittin like i ate a jalapena
im from uptown my bitch from argentina
my pockets on fat like joey cartagena
stunt so hard its all yall fault
and when it come to beef give me a1 sauce
i aint worryin bout shit everything paid out
you could catch me courtside in dwayne wade house
with a high yellow thick bitch wit her legs out
cash money president but we in a red house
who the fuck want it make my fuckin day
i blow your candles out now nigga cut the cake
i gotta eat bitch like a runaway
yall niggas aint eatin stomach ache
okay all these bitches and niggas still hatin
i used to be ballin but now im bill gatein
fuckin with my iphone bumpin illmatic
