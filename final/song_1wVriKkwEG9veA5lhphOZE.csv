im throwing away pictures
that i never should have taken in the first place
and its cold in my apartment
as im changing all the colors
from the brightest reds to grays

prechorus
well its 3 oclock on monday morning
im just hoping youre not seeing his face
ive been getting calls in these hotel rooms
long enough to know that it was him
that took my place

chorus
and i hope this makes you happy now
that the flame we had is burning out
and i hope you like your pictures facing down
as even broken hearts may have their doubts

verse 2
and im burning all the letters
hoping that i might forget her and the bad taste
that she left when she was leaving me
a life of barely breathing as she walked
out of this place
and you dropped the note and we changed key
you changed yourself and i changed me
i really didnt see us singing through this
then you screamed the bridge
and i cried the verse
and our chorus came out unrehearsed
and you smiled the whole way through it
i guess maybe thats whats worse
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likechorus
and i hope this makes you happy now
that the flame we had is burning out
and i hope you like your pictures facing down
as even broken hearts may have their doubts

postchorus
and im taking all your memories off the shelf
and i dont need you or anybody else
so take a look at me
see what you want to see
when you get home

bridge
take me home
id rather die than be with you
take me home
you have a problem with the truth
take me home
because this happens every time
i knew it would
i knew it would
take me home
id rather die than be with you
take me home
you have a problem with the truth
take me home
because this happens every time
and i knew it would
i knew it would
chorus
and i hope this makes you happy now
that the flame we had is burning out
and i hope you like your pictures facing down
as even broken hearts may have their doubts

and im taking all your memories off the shelf
and i dont need you or anybody else
