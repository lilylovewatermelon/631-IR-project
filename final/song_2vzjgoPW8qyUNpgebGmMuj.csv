verse 3 estelle
put me in the middle let me start the drama
said im trying to do this cause it affects my karma
listen no one expected us to do this
well so i know were making best without any time to dwell
said im trying to make a stand for my family name
i got my piece of gold and i had it engraved
its more than a chain more than hearing what they say
im trying to go be global be out in space
try to do it at a pace but i got a little sick of it
robbin me hot and lukewarm a little bit
in my two feet twostepping in my timbos
anyone in my ways getting moved out the window
i have to represent my mama my nanny like laila ali
i need your daddy every time she fight
im trying to live my dreams stead of watching them flow
youll be just another memory

chorus natasha bedingfield
drop me in the middle so i can make a ripple effect
upon the ocean ill be the moon that turns the tide
drop me in the middle so i can make a ripple
a domino effect falling through the sands of time
drop me in the middle so i can make a ripple effect
upon the ocean ill be the moon that turns the tide
drop me in the middle so i can make a ripple effect
a domino effect falling through the sands of time
outro natasha bedingfield
drop me in the middle
drop me in the middle
drop me in the middleembed"
