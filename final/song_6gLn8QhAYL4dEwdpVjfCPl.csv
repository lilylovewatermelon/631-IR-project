stay out of the light or the photograph that i gave you
you can say a prayer if you need to
or just get in line and ill grieve you
can i meet you alone
another night and ill see you
another night and ill be you
some other way to continue
to hide my face

prechorus
another knife in my hands a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me off im so dirty babe
the kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
i keep a book of the names and those

chorus
only go so far til you bury them
so deep and down we go

verse 2
touched by angels though
i fall out of grace
i did it all so maybe
id live this every day
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likeprechorus
another knife in my hands a stain that never comes off the sheets
clean me off im so dirty babe
it aint the money and it sure as hell aint just for the fame
its for the bodies i claim and those

chorus
only go so far til you bury them
so deep and down we go

breakdown
down and down we go and down we go and down we go
and we all fall down i tried i tried

chorus
and well all dance along to the tune of your death
well love again well laugh again and its better off this way

postchorus
and never again and never again they gave us two shots
to the back of the head and were all dead now
and never again and never again they gave us two shots
to the back of the head and were all dead now

adlibs
i tried one more night one more night
well im laughing out crying out laugh out loud
i tried well i tried well i tried cause i tried but i lied i lied
i tried i tried i tried well
bridge
and well love again well laugh again
well cry again and well dance again
and its better off this way so much better off this way
i cant clean the blood off the sheets in my bed

postchorus
and never again and never again they gave us two shots
to the back of the head and were all dead now36embed"
