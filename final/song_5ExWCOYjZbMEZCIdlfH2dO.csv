verse 1 brad petering roxanne shanté
i heard that you heard
that i was writing songs about you
that i was bad mouthing your name
in some shitty bar somewhere
you know how i love these biased onesided conversations
so lets discuss the whos the whys the whens the hows the wheres
but who really cares
if it was all in my mind  and you dont know why
if it was all in my mind  and you dont know why
to begin with  and you dont know why
keep the chaos cause you dont know why
if it was all in my mind  and you dont know why
if it was all in my mind and you dont know why
to begin with  and you dont know why
keep the chaos cause you dont know why

verse 2 brad petering roxanne shanté
and i remember her bent over
and knowing that it was the last time
you know the end is near
if she only lets you fuck at night
and when she finally came even though she faked it
it was much appreciated
at least she had the decency
to try to make a sound that she thought id like
but its alright
cause it was all in my mind and you dont know why
cause it was all in my mind and you dont know why
to begin with and you dont know why
and you dont know why
cause it was all in my mind and you dont know why
cause it was all in my mind and you dont know why
to begin with and you dont know why
keep the chaos cause you dont know why

verse 3 maddie acid  roxanne shanté
yeah i heard your song but i wasnt impressed
so you got your feels hurt and now youre feeling depressed
just because we had sex and it didnt last
now you want revenge you wanna put me on blast
dont make me laugh remember all those girls you played
with all the lies you told back in the day to get laid
an excuse for suzie you got a story for lori
and all those other girls you only called when you were horny  have to make a–whyd you have to make a–
so yeah its nothing that you didnt do first
the only difference is that you probably did it worse
so look at the big bad soldier
declaring holy war on every girl who didnt mean to fuck him over
but karmas a bitch for hypocrites who kiss and tell
and talk shit about girls who only wished him well
so if you wanna chat just stick to the facts and get at me
from russia with love maddie
