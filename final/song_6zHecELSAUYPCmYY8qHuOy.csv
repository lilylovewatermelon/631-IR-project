i had a dream i was mugged outside your house
i had a dream in a panic you came running out
for a moment you were sure id die on you
for a moment i believed you loved me too
but life is never like this and you were never strong

chorus
too much of a good thing wont be good for long
although you made my heart sing to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing wont be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

verse 2
we talk maybe twenty times a day
and still i never say what i want to say
i thought i wouldnt need to
i guess i read you wrong

chorus
too much of a good thing wont be good for long
although you made my heart sing to stay with you would be wrong
too much of a good thing wont be good anymore
watch where i tread before i fall

bridge
you refuse to see this don’t see it anymore
i have made a decision not to answer your calls
cause i put everything out there and i got nothing at all
see sam smith liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeoutro
too much of a good thing isnt good and you know
i watch where i walk before i fall
before i fall29embed"
