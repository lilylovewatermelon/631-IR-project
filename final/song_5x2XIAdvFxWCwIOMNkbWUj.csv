verse 1
he says ooh baby girl you know were gonna be legends
im the king and youre the queen and we will stumble through heaven
if theres a light at the end its just the sun in your eyes
i know you wanna go to heaven but youre human tonight

prechorus
and ive been sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool
for a while now drowning my thoughts out with the sounds

chorus
but do you feel like a young god
you know the two of us are just young gods
and well be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and theyre running running running
but do you feel like a young god
you know the two of us are just young gods
and well be flying through the streets with the people underneath
and theyre running running running
again
