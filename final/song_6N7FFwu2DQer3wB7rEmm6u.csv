you dont have to drink tonight
why don’t we just get some sleep
cause im tired of cryin’ in driveways
as you slur the words you speak
i know growin up
has been an evil thing to you
makes you awfully hard to love
from a lovers point of view

verse 2
and ill never understand
how you wound up in the shape youre in
but ill always be the fool
who fell for you in your burnin skin
ill be prayin’ for you and pinin’ for you
and hopin you get some rest
but from a lover’s point of view
its all been hard to watch at best

chorus
cause from where im standin’
you got a long climb ahead
ill be there to wipe the vomit
when you cannot lift your head
cause a lover doesnt leave
when times like these get dark
ill be there to watch the sunrise
when we reclaim your heart

and ill pick you up downtown
when youre grinnin with a busted lip
cause youre not known for backin down
and those boys are known for talkin shit
but nows about the time love
you really got to decide
are you gonna be a good man to me
or die the way your mother died

chorus
cause from where im standin
you got a long climb ahead
ill be there to wipe the vomit
when you cannot lift your head
cause a lover doesnt leave
when times like these get dark
ill be there to watch the sunrise
when we reclaim your heart

outro
and you dont have to drink tonight
why dont we just get some sleep
cause im tired of cryin in driveways
as you slur the words you speak1embed"
