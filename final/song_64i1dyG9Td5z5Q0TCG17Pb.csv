watch the sunrise
say your goodbyes off you go
some conversation
no contemplation hit the road

prechorus
car overheats jump out of my seat
on the side of the highway baby
our road is long your hold is strong
please dont ever let go oh no

chorus
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
oh can they keep it
oh no they cant

verse 2
im driving fast now
dont think i know how to go slow
oh where you at now
i feel around there you are

prechorus
cool these engines calm these jets
i ask you how hot can it get
and as you wipe off beads of sweat
slowly you say im not there yet

i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad

chorus
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
oh can they keep it
