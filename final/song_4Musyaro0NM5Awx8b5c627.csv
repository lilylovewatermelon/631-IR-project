going back to the corner where i first saw you
gonna camp in my sleeping bag im not gonna move
got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand
saying if you see this girl can you tell her where i am
some try to hand me money they dont understand
im not broke im just a brokenhearted man
i know it makes no sense what else can i do
and how can i move on when im still in love with you

chorus
cause if one day you wake up and find that youre missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i could be
thinking maybe youll come back here to the place that wed meet
and youll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
so im not moving
im not moving

verse 2
policeman says son you cant stay here
i say theres someone im waiting for
if its a day a month a year
gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
if she changes her mind this is the first place she will go

chorus
cause if one day you wake up and find that youre missing me
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i could be
thinking maybe youll come back here to the place that wed meet
and youll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
so im not moving
im not moving
im not moving
im not moving
