i cant explain but i wanna try
theres this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by
in the morning and in the night time
theres all these secrets that i cant keep
like in my heart theres that hotel suite
and you lived there so long
its kind of strange now youre gone

chorus
im not sure if i should show you what ive found
has it gone for good or is it coming back around
isnt it hard to make up your mind
when youre losing and your fuse is fireside

verse 2
theres all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
but something about its changed

chorus
im not sure if i should show you what ive found
has it gone for good or is it coming back around
isnt it hard to make up your mind
when youre losing and your fuse is fireside
you might also likebridge
and i thought i was yours forever
or maybe i was mistaken
but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately

instrumental break

chorus
im not sure if i should show you what ive found
has it gone for good or is it coming back around
isnt it hard to make up your mind
when youre losing and your fuse is fireside53embed"
