so now i know
people want a story
one ending with glory
and the wave of their flag

well as far as i can tell
the homecoming heroes
get put in the headlines
and back off they go

prechorus
and i wont stand for anything more
tried our hand even though we were poor
weve put in the time
casting our lines off shore

verse 2
yes some things i dread
i duck in the allies
i avoid the rallies
its a choice of my own

prechorus

chorus
well im sorry but i find no glory in that
i just want you off my back
and theres not a word in my head floating around
you wont pick a part and put down
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likeprechorus

chorus

so get out of my head
get out of my head
get out of my head3embed"
