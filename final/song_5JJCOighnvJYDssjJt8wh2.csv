no i cant stop now
cant stop now if i wanted to
we have come to far
cant stop now if i wanted to
i may never touch the clouds
cant stop now if i wanted to
i command from the stars
cant stop now cant stop now

verse 1
fuck a nigga playing hell wanna hustle make them
ill show you how far good work ethic could take him
i binded with the jews hindus and the jamacians
when i have hustles i hit the streets of coradam
no excuses
no room for losers
youre useless if your revenue aint making manuevers
chill with pretty bitches whos attitude is manure they say dumb shit but ass fat enough to listen to them
pocket life pistol make for great suprises
blow so good it will make a fine eye twitch
money on my mind and i cant even close my eyelids
bet up on my grind ten days and thats where ive been
the chances of enterprise for heavy weighters
marble tables and city views thats breath taking
name your work and i could get it to your cheif of love
golddiggers they dont fuck but broke niggas need them

and i cant stop now if i wanted to
even if i end up on the news
im a hustler as long as the sky is blue
niggas cant stop what im about to do
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard

verse 2
stone cold hustler money makes champs
fuck free lunch wear fare and food stamps
i remember when my jorge used to give me love
reminiscing when i didnt know what bentleys was
i was bp before the blood
school of hard knocks there was knowledge in them drugs
on the corner is a college for a city thug
brainwashed by money nigga i cant get enough
sike on the rifle bitch ass nigga
eyes closed rifle fully loaded with us
in the nightclub i pro rose on them bitches
get them pussies drunk then pass them to my niggas
drug trade played out got to be a better way
from a nigga up like ligen for a better day
traveled 20 cities just to get a better place
i cant get it to you something i would never say
chorus
and i cant stop now if i wanted to
even if i end up on the news
im a hustler as long as the sky is blue
niggas cant stop what im about to do
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard

bridge
red lights cant stop me to ghetto cocky
sitting on a hundred mil
im finished you can have the block im something like a astronaut
i got stacks in outer space
lets go lets go
and catch me if you can
im not your average man
my my my nigga

chorus
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
and i cant stop now if i wanted to
even if i end up on the news
im a hustler as long as the sky is blue
niggas cant stop what im about to do
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
if you can go hard you can go hard
if you can go hard my nigga go hard
outro
no i cant stop now
cant stop now if i wanted to
we have come to far
cant stop now if i wanted to
i may never touch the clouds
cant stop now if i wanted to
i command from the stars
cant stop now cant stop nowembed"
