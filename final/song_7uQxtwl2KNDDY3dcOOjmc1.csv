if ever you had said to me before that i would lead this life
that i am living now i guess its all so strange to feel the way i do inside
and have so much that i could feel some pride for in my life
so why is it that i feel like this

chorus
how do i feel ive been here before ive felt this
retreat to a place a place within me i need this
keep it all down bottled inside it breaks me
to torment again and torture me like it used to

verse 2
i try and try to break away from all the hate im feeling
for everyone of you thats ever done me wrong
i need to justify the reasons for the way im living
i guess i cant cause i dont feel like i deserve

chorus
how do i feel ive been here before ive felt this
retreat to a place a place within me i need this
keep it all down bottled inside it breaks me
to torment again and torture me like it used to

my life is the 23rd hour of day
once said that everything goes by yesterday
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
so now the waves they have subsided and my soul is bleeding
i cant take away all the shame i feel forgive me

chorus
how do i feel ive been here before ive felt this
retreat to a place a place within me i need this
keep it all down bottled inside it breaks me
to torment again and torture me like it used to

outro
again
again
