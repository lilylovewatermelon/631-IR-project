tempted and tried were oft made to wonder
why it should be thus all the day long
while there are others living about us
never molested though in the wrong

chorus
well farther along well know all about it
farther along well understand why
cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
well understand it all by and by

verse 2
when death has come and taken our loved ones
it leaves our home so lonely and drear
and then do we wonder why others prosper
living so wicked year after year

chorus
well farther along well know all about it
farther along well understand why
cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
well understand it all by and by

verse 3
when we see jesus coming in glory
when he comes down from his home in the sky
then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
well understand it all by and by
