although my lover lives in a place that i cant live
i kind of find i like a life this lonely
it rips and pierces me in places i cant see
i love the rip of nerves the rip that wakes me
so im dissatisfied i love dissatisfied
i love to feel as though its more than i need

chorus
so come on home
so come on home
so come on home
home

verse 2
youre where you want to be im where i want to be
come on were chasing everything weve ever wanted
replace you easily replace pathetically
i flirt with every flighty thing that falls my way
but how i needed you when i needed you
lets not forget we are so strong so bloody strong

chorus
come on home
so come on home
so come on home
home

bridge
blue light falls upon your perfect skin
falls and you draw back again
falls and this is how i felt
and i cannot forget and i cannot forget

chorus
come on home
so come on home
but dont forget to leave1embed"
