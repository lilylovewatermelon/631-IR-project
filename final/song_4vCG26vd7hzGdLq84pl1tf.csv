lets skip all the histrionics
not again not another excuse
the epidemic is codependent
biting off more than your mouth can chew
dont forget to convalesce your secrets
i dont wanna be a man today
for all you know im the silver in the bullet
i am the trigger that will make you all obey

prechorus
im going to make you cry tonight
im going to make you hate me

chorus
inside all my flaws again i cant let go
in spite of you im lost again i still dont know
disguises show me
what am i if i am only
the status quo is not a punishment
but now it feels like home

verse 2
your association finds you guilty
starting with the end of the day
black and white is such a fascist feeling
right or wrong and nothing to say
the last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
unappreciated medical fiends
confiscate another classic inbred
fuck it all light the acetylene
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeprechorus
no other choice i cant explain
life keeps taking things away

chorus
inside all my flaws again i cant let go
in spite of you im lost again i still dont know
disguises show me
what am i if i am only
the status quo is not a punishment
but now it feels like home

bridge
the tough guys who came to kill
but stayed to rape and ravage

guitar solo

verse 3
the futures here im past my prime
when the evidence came i committed the crime
can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible
who could ask for a better disciple
whats the point im not sure i can
ill never dig another grave
im afraid of what ill find
if it hurts then youre too old
ill take your shit and give you fucking gold
prechorus
im gonna make you cry tonight
i need you to hate me

chorus
inside all my flaws again i cant let go
in spite of you im lost again i still dont know
disguises show me
what am i if i am only
the status quo is not a punishment
but now it feels like home
but now it feels like home12embed"
