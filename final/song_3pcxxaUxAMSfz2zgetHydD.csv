now what you in a rush for
what you tryna meet your maker darling
or are you runnin out of time huh
but time aint even real you really need to chill
its all an illusion

whatever it is you tryna see

but i wouldnt never be the same old thing
how
but i can tell you straight that i aint no game baby oh
