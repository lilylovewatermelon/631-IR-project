i want to see in your soul
i want to tame this animal
give me shame you shown me lies
i want to change my alibis

prechorus
cheated all thats loved you
broken hearts youre rumbled
feasted on foundations
bathed in blood of angels
found you out your weakness
drown you out im sleepless
leave my mind youre feeding
on my heart

chorus
so break the silence
give me a reason
we had credence
but now were poisoned

so break the silence
just give me a reason
we had credence
now were poisoned

i want to feel how its true
these chemicals in me and you
i want to fight with desire
i want to burn in your fire

prechorus
cheated all thats loved you
broken hearts youre rumbled
feasted on foundations
bathed in blood

chorus
so break the silence
give me a reason
we had credence
now were poisoned

so break the silence
just give me a reason
we had credence
but now were poisoned1embed"
