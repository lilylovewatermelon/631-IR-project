im so happy you smile
im so happy you flirt
and for this id crawl one mile

grant me this final wish
i wanna put you in a trance
i wanna be your poisoned dish
all sick senses enhanced

give me your attention
ill show you all the pleasures of soho
give me your worst intentions
and ill show you all the pleasures of soho
ill show you all the pleasures of soho

i know a private club
and theyll delight with your type
we are all titled mud
and you can fright who you like

youre a strange one crazed one fazed one little boy
with nothing at all to do at night
well as for me im the outsider
lets paint the walls black tonight
you might also likegive me your attention
ill show you all the pleasures of soho
give me your worst intentions
and ill show you all the pleasures of soho
ill show you all the pleasures of soho

give me your attention
ill show you all the pleasures of soho
give me your worst intentions
and ill show you all the pleasures of soho
ill show you all the pleasures of sohoembed"
