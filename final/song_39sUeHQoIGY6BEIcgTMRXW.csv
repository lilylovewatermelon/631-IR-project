verse 1 jayz
h to the izzo v to the izza
fo shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in va
was herbing em in the home of the terrapins

plus if they was short with cheese i would work with them
brought in weed got rid of that dirt for them
wasntbornhustlers i was birthing em
h to the izzo v to the izza
for sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
cant leave rap alone the game needs me
haters want me clapped in chrome it aint easy
cops want to knock me da wanna box me in
but somehow i beat them charges like rocky
h to the izzo v to the izza
not guilty he who does not feel me

verse 2 mike shinoda with chester bennington
check it out yo
it starts with one
one thing i dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind
i designed this rhyme to explain in due time
all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away and its so unreal
i didnt look out below
i watched the time go right out the window
trying to hold on and didnt even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go
i kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
of a time when i tried soâ€“
