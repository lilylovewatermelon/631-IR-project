dont be cautious dont be kind
you committed im your crime
push my button anytime
you got your finger on the trigger but your trigger fingers mine

silver dollar golden flame
dirty water poison rain
perfect murder take your aim
i dont belong to anyone but everybody knows my name

by the way youve been uninvited
cause all you say are all the same things i did

watch your back when you cant watch mine
copycat tryna cop my glamour
why so sad bunny cant have mine
