think about the love inside the strength of heart
think about the heroes saving life in the dark
climbing higher through the fire time was running out
never knowing you werent going to be coming down alive
but you still came back for me
you were strong and you believed

chorus
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
be strong believe
be strong believe

verse 2
think about the chance i never had to say
thank you for giving up your life that day
never fearing only hearing voices calling out
let it all go the life that you know just to bring it down alive
and you still came back for me
you were strong and you believed

chorus
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
be strong believe
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
be strong believe

again today we take into our hearts and minds those who perished on this site one year ago
and also those who came to toil in the rubble to bring order out of chaos to help us make sense of our despair
wanna hold my wife when i get home
wanna tell the kids theyll never know how much i love to see them smile
wanna make a change or two right now
wanna live a life like you somehow
wanna make your sacrifice worthwhile

chorus
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
be strong believe
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
everything is gonna be alright
be strong believe

outro
think about the love inside the strength of heart
think about the heroes saving life in the dark
think about the chance i never had to say
thank you for giving up your life that day

the world will little note nor longer remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here2embed"
