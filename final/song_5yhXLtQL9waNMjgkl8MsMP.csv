im not a turtle im a turbo
haters pray to god that i turn slow
like im sipping on purple
but i aint on your glow
im in a whole nother circle
trying to keep it clean like church clothes
said that respect was something had to work for
but that aint gonna work though
get your respect but lose all my worth no
you can dead that get a hearse go
dont need 48 youll find a killer in the first floor
it was me boy to commercials
feeling out of place like peta at a fur store
so i left with a couple dozen fur coats
said i could never break away from your hold
watch me turn though
said that i blew it like turquoise
just mad hear it all in your word choice
know it hurts but i really dont care though
let me rub it in get it all up in that ho

hook poo bear  lupe fiasco

its like the worlds in my hands now
im feeling so rebellious from all of the envy crowding around me
i dont wanna care right now
i dont wanna dont wanna right now i dont wanna care right now
i dont wanna care right now
i dont wanna dont wanna right now no i really dont no i really dont no i really dont no i really dont no i really dont care now

im an ambulance and a fire truck and some strobe lights tied up
shining all in your eyes all out of yours and all into mine
lights and stars is all intertwined
and im feeling like malcolm looking all out the blinds
any means any means and you can do anything anything
and the flow tight skinny jeans skinny jeans
hit you like pacquiao philippines philippines
