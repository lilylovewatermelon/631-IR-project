what are you scared of me its embarrassing
if it wasnt for me you woulda never wrote therapy
ive been here for you but how come youre never there for me
its a little bit twisted but i miss when you and i had scary dreams
i dont really wanna talk about it
well thats too bad now nate
shut up
now where were we
well back in the day when
you and i had it all mapped out in the basement
crying in your room like a baby
i wish mom was here
we all do so we wouldnt have to hear about it every single record
you dont really wanna change me
yeah im the one that made this happen
do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction
lets pack our bags and go back to gladwin now
yeah its time for the third record
and you know i got the content
i dont wanna make you nervous
but it aint like it used to be we got a lotta people watchin watchin
you told me that you dont want me in your life thats pretty hard to digest digest
and i told you id leave when we die die and we aint died yet
therapy session was beautiful nate but im wonderin whats comin next
yeah get that stupid hat off of your head when im talkin to you you hear what i said
you dont like the prison i built you built you
yeah you wanna know what the funny thing is
you keep on talkin to me like a stranger
but weve been together since you were a kid kid yeah
took us from a noname
told you everything was okay
now you tryna cut me out of it like i aint never been a part of it
i am the heart of it i made this whole thing
yeah i put us on the dope stage you must have no brain
whats the point of havin guns if you cant aim cant aim
whats the point of havin blood with no veins with no veins
whats the point of havin love with no pain with no pain
what im sayin is me without you doesnt make any sense
i know im intense and controlling but you need to learn how to cope with it
thats just the way that it is
if you didnt want me to live in your house you shouldnt have let me move in
its comfortable here and i like it i got my own room and everything
it dont get better than this
you say you wanna own your life then wake up and take your own advice
youre just mad cause you know im right
yeah im flattered you put me in mansion but you shoulda told em right
held your hands on the coldest nights
you didnt tell em bout the times you and i used to hold the mic
i mean what are you outta your mind
cause both of us will be come on lets go outside
is this what you wanted
both of us out in the open lets do it then
i mean why are you doin this
i know that youre mad that youre mad but im not in the mood for this
we got a record to drop drop
so why you actin like im not a part of it
aye where is my shovel at
prolly out back where it always is
you cant get rid of all of me
im the reason why—
nah shut up i dont wanna hear another sentence
hey im nf
is it me or the fear talkin ha what a dumb question
yeah its real music til the day we die right
yeah aint that the slogan nathan
thought i told you to keep your mouth shut
i mean so what you know i never listen
let me guess we gon dig a hole kill the track and prolly put a beat in it
rap about it for like three minutes
hey thats pretty deep isnt it
wait a minute you dont really think for a second that youre puttin me in this
no of course not just a little deeper then well go inside and we can stop diggin
whew you had me scared for a second i thought we were diggin my grave
thunk
we did what you dont like bein afraid
heres a dose of your own medicine
what you dont like how it tastes
my therapist told me dont bury my issues but ima be honest man im feelin great great
i think its only right we go back to where you were created
i wrote a song for johnny without you but he aint gon like it lets see how he takes it takes it
he prolly dont even remember us does he
i wish i was burying anger
but both of us know ima need him for that song that song he still lives in the basement
almost done shoulda done this a year ago i dont know why i waited
you know how i get i put everything off in my personal life you hear what im sayin sayin
ha that was a joke joke yeah its hilarious aint it
youll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind—depends how you see it
put the shovel away time to go back in the house now youll be out in a week
tellin me you want your room back thats funny what you aint got nowhere to sleep
ima just look out the window and laugh at you this is crazy to me
cause i thought you had me in prison this whole time but im the one holdin the keys
