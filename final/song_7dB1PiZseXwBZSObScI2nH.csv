verse 1
i touched the guilt in your eyes
as your lips begin to lie
and it kills me every time
but i always learn the hard way with you
just be cool
be kind
dont be dumb
dont be blind
its the sweetness in your smile
its nothing new
nothing new

chorus
but i always learn the hard way
and it always ends in heartbreak
you put me in a hard place
i always learn the hard way
my heartbreaks with you
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh

i dont complain
theres a pattern
to this pain
just keep hopin

and its all my fault
cuz i know what to expect so its cool
nothing new

our empty words

but now your gone

and it always ends in heartbreak ooo
