the word hurricane is the name given to natures strongest storm
a hurricane occurs when high pressure and low pressure masses of air
come in contact with one another

there is often a significant difference in temperature
between the two masses
one mass is warm while the other is cold
the warmer air rises and the cooler air falls
likewise the low pressure area slides down the sides
of the high pressure area

they swirl in and around one another creating the beginnings of the stormsee air liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeembed"
