lately im feeling stupid and crazy
cause i saw him with his new baby
and he treats her like shes the one
its not that i want him back aint trying to be mean
but i bought him brand new clothes and burned his skinny jeans
but shell never know that i made him better for her

chorus
so give some credit where its due
give props to you know who
i gave him swag i made him cool
he used to be a fool
so give some credit where its due
give props to you know who
you know who you know who
give credit where its due

verse 2
ooh wee he holds her hand at the movies
never stares at other boobies
i bet she thinks hes the one
she should be thanking me and sending me some flowers
i taught him everything now he can last for hours
shell never know that i made him better for her

yo he used to be whack but i made him all that

but i wasnt in love so i tossed him
