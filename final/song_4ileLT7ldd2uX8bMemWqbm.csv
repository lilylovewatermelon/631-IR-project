animals on tv singing about some pain that they once felt
theres no one i disapprove of more or root for more than myself
i wanted to pretend that it was better better better on the phone
i didnt wanna tell you i was jealous jealous jealous and alone

chorus
so we talk about ourselves in hell
to forget the love we never felt
all the old jokes that work so well
universal truth was a moments lie
dont try to stop us
dont try to stop us
dont try to stop us
get out of the way

verse 2
got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost i see
she sees her father in that old mans eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
animals on tv singing about some pain they felt at some point
i didnt wanna tell you i was jealous jealous jealous whats the point

prechorus
as i watch the velvet drapes appear
and the door was closed for forty years
as we hide what we dont wanna hear
as we hide whats really in our ears
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
he is coming from a part of hell
where lightning blue eyes dont go down well
he can tell that were oblivious
its addiction of routine as well
making fools out of the best of us
making robots of the rest of us
innocence itself in america today
is a crime just like cornel west might say
dont try to stop us
dont try to stop us
dont try to stop us
get out of the way15embed"
