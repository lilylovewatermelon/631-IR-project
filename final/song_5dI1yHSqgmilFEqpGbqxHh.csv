ohohohoh

verse 1
she said love me so i love her ohohohoh
she said leave me so i left ohohohoh
then i went to california ohohohoh
and i aint never comin back
i got a high five from a brother ohohohoh
i got bloodstains on the bed ohohohoh
and i aint sayin that i love her ohohohoh
but this bitch is gonna drive me mad
i said this bitch is gonna drive me mad ahahahahahah ohohohoh

chorus
you got just what i been looking for
but you cant bring yourself to say no
and i aint never gonna let you go
i kept wishing i would die oh
the whole plane ride home
and i wish i could
i know i should leave you alone
ohohohoh
ohohohoh

verse 2
i worship since i met you ohohohoh
i fell down to my knees ohohohoh
and when no one would accept ya ohohohoh
throw myself up on a cross and bleed
i seen a dark cloud coming over ohohohoh
i seen some evil shit in her head ohohohoh
but she rode me like no other ohohohoh
but this bitch is gonna drive me mad
i said this bitch is gonna drive me mad ahahahahahah ohohohoh
