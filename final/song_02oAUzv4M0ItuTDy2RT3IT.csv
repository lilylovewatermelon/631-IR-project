a couple rebel top gun pilots
flying with nowhere to be
dont know you super well
but i think that you might be the same as me
behave abnormally

prechorus
lets let things come out of the woodwork
ill give you my best side tell you all my best lies
yeah awesome right
so lets let things come out of the woodwork
ill give you my best side tell you all my best lies
seeing me rolling showing someone else love
dancing with our shoes off
know i think youre awesome right

chorus
our rules our dreams were blind
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite
our friends our drinks we get inspired
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite

verse 2
might get your friend to drive
but he can hardly see oohooh
well end up painted on the road red and chrome
all the broken glass sparkling
i guess were partying

so lets let things come out of the woodwork
ill give you my best side tell you all my best lies
see me rolling showing someone else love
hands under your tshirt
know i think youre awesome right

chorus
our rules our dreams were blind
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite
our friends our drinks we get inspired
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite

chorus
our rules our dreams were blind
blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite

blowing shit up with homemade ddddynamite
