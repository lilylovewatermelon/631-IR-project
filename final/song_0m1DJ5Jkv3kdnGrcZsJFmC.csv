im becoming less defined as days go by
fading away and well you might say im losing focus
kinda drifting into the abstract
in terms of how i see myself
sometimes i think i can see right through myself
sometimes i think i can see right through myself
i think sometimes i can see right through myself

verse 2
less concerned about fitting into the world
your world that is
cause it doesnt really matter anymore
no it doesnt really matter anymore
no it doesnt really matter anymore
none of this really matters anymore

verse 3
yes i am alone but then again i always was
as far back as i can tell i think maybe its because
because you were never really real to begin with
i just made you up to hurt myself
i just made you up to hurt myself yeah
and i just made you up to hurt myself
i just made you up to hurt myself yeah
and i just made you up to hurt myself
and it worked yes it did

well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a scab
and i had this funny feeling like i just knew its something bad
i just couldnt leave it alone i kept pickin at the scab
it was a doorway tryin to seal itself shut
but i climbed through

and i can see things i know i really shouldnt see
and now i know why now nnow i know why
things arent as pretty on the inside
