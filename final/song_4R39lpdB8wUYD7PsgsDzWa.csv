well i go where they go
and i know who i wanna know
we are the in set
and they dont trip if youre hip
at the velvet rope off the strip
we are the in set
call me cruel and unkind but im cool and refined
like a robot

chorus
if youre not down with us youre down below
where have you been who do you know
its no secret this is our big show
and we will never let you down
never ever ever

verse 2
well the pond may be big
but it aint deep if you dig
on the in set
little fish swim away
i suggest you go and play
on the swing set
and i was a junkie way before it was cool
with that ill leave you
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
if youre not down with us youre down below
where have you been who do you know
its no secret this is our big show
and we will never let you down
never ever ever

bridge
were just driving this jalopy till it grinds to a halt
and thats our mission
a hollywood tradition

chorus
if youre not down with us youre down below
where have you been who do you know
its no secret this is our big show

chorus
if youre not down with us youre down below
where have you been who do you know
its no secret this is our big show
and we will never let you down
never ever everembed"
