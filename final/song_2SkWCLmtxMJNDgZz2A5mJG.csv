just clap your hands to the beat to the beat
come on clap your hands to the beat to the beat
i said clap your hands to the beat to the beat
uh huh and you dont stop
uh huh and you dont stop
uh huh and you dont stop
we in this great lakes state
eatin steaks n shrimp
its kinda hard to miss the crew
because we all got limps
we come equipped with new kicks and stetsons
the super saggy rags and the white trash connection
no flexin huh know what i mean
you can feel us fool we dont need to be seen
its all about the green not the drugs we be takin
that shits free with an lp in circulation
and we be wastin time
got them all state all county all hood rhymes
its all good times thank the lord
for dumb fkin people and credit card fraud
were tearin up your lawn we got herds of lincolns
step into your crib and have your whole house stinkin
dont blink and dont think were soft
hide your money and your gold and dont express your thoughts
we get mad props wreck all shops
puttin stops on crews
they get confused and lose thats what we do
styles stem from pioneers
leavin suckers in awe
and you get jawed for lookin queer
can you hear me or am i talkin to the wall
thats top dog callin out each and every one of yall
you get balls you come and talk that shit
but top dogs camp aint nothin to fk with
and dont say we didnt warn ya
i got this detroit thang with more love that california
drunk dj smokin coiniac dips
call me the sidekick thug boy kid with the limp
i rip through rhymes like a bullet in the breeze
and i float through tracks like a shark in the sea
a wee bit shy but i comply by me
and im a mean mother fker when i have to be
got young gs with sleeves and thieves on hold
strategically placed in case somebody feels bold
i toldyou hos you cant fk with these cause
i make more papers then trees
see we believe in brotherhood forever is criteria
you fkin with top dog
your fkin with family
no i aint feelin ya got all that i can do to hear
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeany time you see me you should stand clear
you see me in my lincoln
im in the clubs drinkin
who you gonna check bitch what the fk you thinkin
you can check me but that shit dont slide
you can get your life took tryin to take my pride
you ride with who man that shit aint big
i roll with dogs thatll rock your wig
and got gigs all money
detroit to portland
cellular receivers and beepers is what were sportin
your nothin of importance i dont sweat you
yeah the drinks on me but the jokes on you
im all about the everyday nothin at all
see im not doin very much im just havin a ball
im in bed by four im up by noon
i might sit around i might write me a tune
i might go fishi and again i might not
i might get me a fourty or pour me some scotch
the watch on my wrist that dont even exist
a lot of pissed people from appointments that ive missed
i dissed everybody and their mom for spite
cause everybodys barkin but nobody ever bites
your talkin loud sayin nothin
get you dad get your cousin
go and get your boy cause hes as big as a house
now take your pussy ass click and get the fk out
im the estranged deranged i got domains like states
i live in plush hotels with them hourly rates
i do big plates eight times a day
the crew be livin large at the seafood bay
got a way with the world and now im lookin to scramble
aint about to ass out on a no good gamble
could handle anything but i aint down for broke
so before somebody slides somebodys getting choked
im a no good freak tweak skin like rashes
i lose a little love with everyday that passes
aint a masotistic rock statistics vocabulary
im a very shy simplistic
and get this some people say i changed
im the same mother fker with the same old name
a little extra game and extra cash could see
you could fk me but dont put it past me
you wanna bash me and got no reason
i can lay up in the caymans for four straight seasons
i aint a punk i refuse to be
i live for what is not what used to be
your all up in the past thats ass
hear what i say
im all about today and im a die that way
