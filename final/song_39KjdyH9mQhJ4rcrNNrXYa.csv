where you goin why you leavin the fuck is up
i feel your soul here with me but your bodys gone
when im alone i feel you near i feel you close
it feels so wrong its been some years still i dont know
where you went and who what and
when i close my eyes i see somethin i dont like
wake up and i still hate what ive become
i cant believe my eyes
blacked out drunk im numb im dumb high

prechorus
seems like nothing has changed like i said it would
i know i said that id change but i never could

chorus
im still lonely and fucked up
and ima be this way right here til my lucks up
ive never been the same ever since i lost one
all that i ever wanted was to be just loved oh oh
im still lonely and fucked up
and im realizing now that i need your love
shadows over my heart got nobody to trust
all that i ever wanted was to be just loved oh oh

verse 2
i never thought that id be here ohoh and still feel lost
it dont feel right without you here it dont i need your love
thought i was good but i was wrong i thought
drownin my thoughts in hennessy prayin to god
askin myself whered i go wrong
i tried but i cant find
i said im fine i lied
i know that i was wrong and it hurts to know you were right
