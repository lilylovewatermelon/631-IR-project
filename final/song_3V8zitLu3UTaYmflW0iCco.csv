verse 3 lil wayne
bitch i’m on probation so my nerves bad
and they say time flies well mine’s first class
i landed in the sky i fell from the streets
i talk a lot of shit and practice what i preach
back from hell cell 23
tell the warden kiss my ass pockets on monique
bitch i’m from the murder capital ho i’m far from practical
shit happens and since i’m the shit i’m who it happens to
young money cash money blood bitch i’m red hot
i don’t see nobody see no body like a head shot
all that bullshit is for the birds throw some bread out
