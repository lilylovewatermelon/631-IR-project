um so i brought in this idea called blank space and this was me playing it for max and johan for the first time and theyre shouting out these proju— production ideas like you know the oh at the beginning of the chorus um and that ended up in the song
so this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called blank space

nice to meet you where you been
i could show you incredible things
diamonds seasides all these gems

like oh my god listen in

dont believe what you hear about me hear about me
cause its gonna be forever or gonna go—
