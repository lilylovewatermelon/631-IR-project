honey hows that drink goin down
seems a little stiff for 2 pm
holler if you need anything
ive got an ear to lend
ill be right here cuttin limes
countin cash and stockin beers
ive got an idea whats on your mind
so in the meantime think on this

chorus
ive seen girls like you in here before
watched broken hearts break
through that door a time or two
and ill bet he packed all his things
you set out to curse his name and have a few
and ill bet youre doin your best to move on
well youre not the only lonely one

verse 2
this aint my first rodeo
ive seen the other side of this bar
pourin salts on an open wound
sittin right there where you are
and i know it probably stings right now
somehow more than that jim beam
but that clock on the wall will cure it all
even though that aint how it seems
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
ive seen girls like you in here before
watched broken hearts break
through that door a time or two
and ill bet he packed all his things
you set out to curse his name and have a few
and ill bet youre doin your best to move on
well youre not the only lonely one

bridge
ive seen em come ive seen em go
girl you aint in this thing alone
oh no oh no

chorus
ive seen girls like you in here before
watched broken hearts break
through that door a time or two
and ill bet he packed all his things
you set out to curse his name and have a few
and ill bet youre doin your best to move on
well youre not the only lonely one
no youre not the only lonely one1embed"
