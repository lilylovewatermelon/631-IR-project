paint it black and white if you like
the stories still the same
a generation built on a lie
that everyone of us is safe
paint it black and white if you like
if it keeps you sane
you know the world just aint right
so tell me whos to blame

prechorus
and i will catch you but you might break the fall

chorus
god damn i might be the son of sam
the only child of a holy man
i stand alone for all to see
cause they aint never seen a war like me
god damn son of sam
god damn son of sam

verse 2
burning buildings from above
send their best and send their love
turn away goodbye goodnight
go to sleep now dont you cry
are you afraid your life means less
are you concerned you might be next
its much too soon for me to tell
if youre in heaven or in hell
see shinedown liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus
and i will catch you but you might break the fall

chorus
god damn i might be the son of sam
the only child of a holy man
i stand alone for all to see
cause they aint never seen a war like me
god damn son of sam
god damn son of sam
god damn

verse 3
your ceiling falling piece by pieces
raining down like concrete
just surrender and remember
what youve done to me
look now over your shoulder
no its not over
its just beginning
and i will write the final ending

chorus
god damn i might be the son of sam
the only child of a holy man
i stand alone for all to see
cause they aint never seen a war like me
god damn i might be the son of sam
the only child of a holy man
i stand alone for all to see
cause they aint never seen a war like me
son of sam son of sam
cause they aint never seen a war like me
son of sam son of sam
cause they aint never seen a war like me
son of sam son of sam1embed"
