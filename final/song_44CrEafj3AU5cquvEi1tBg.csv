me and daddyd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a chevrolet
old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
we would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
one little country station was all there was
checking gates fixing fence and roads
that is how my story goes

chorus
if you want to know the real me just turn the page in my dirt road diary
its right there for you to see
every kiss every beer every cotton field memory
tan legs and some dixie land delight
ridin round windows down on a summer night
i was there that was me
its right here in my dirt road diary

verse 2
i remember when i turned sixteen i got a license and some gasoline
aint a curve or a straight away we didnt fly down
if it wasnt the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river
every inch of that county was sacred ground
i wish i knew where that old truck was
if it could talk it could tell on us

chorus
if you want to know the real me just turn the page in my dirt road diary
its right there for you to see
every kiss every beer every cotton field memory
tan legs and some dixie land delight
ridin round windows down on a summer night
i was there that was me
its right here in my dirt road diary
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
it aint a book underneath my bed
just a dusty memory lane burned in my head

chorus
tan legs and some dixie land delight
ridin round windows down feelin right
i was there that was me
its right here in my dirt road diary
just ride around my little town and youll see how i wrote my dirt road diary5embed"
