yeah
are we ready
uhhuh

verse 1
when your mom and dad are ten feet tall
you got a superhero poster on your wall
dont know the worlds full of greed and lust
you just slide into third and ride the school bus
wrestling is real summer goes fast
a dollar bill feels like a wad of cash
theres war and drugs and guns on hips
but all youre thinkin bouts how far you can skip a rock
a rock
a rock

verse 2
then the wheels on your bike turn to gasoline
get your first taste of love and nicotine
your heart gets broke your folks find your lighter
you lose a few fights and learn you aint a fighter
you know whats wrong and you know whats right
but you wanna be cool on a friday night
somebody puts a bottle in front of your face
for the first time youre stuck between a hard place and a rock
a rock
a rock

verse 3
then youre paying bills and youre working hard
and youre with your friends at the local bar
hook up with someone tell em how you feel
and just like that its something real
then you meet their mom and you meet their dad
start having thoughts that you never had
like thats the kinda thing worth waking up for
next thing you know youre saving up for a rock yeah
a rock
a rock

verse 4
and one day your breath costs life itself
your book gets hung on heavens shelf
they say a few words like its a damn shame
then they lay you down and they write your name on a rock
a rock
a rock
