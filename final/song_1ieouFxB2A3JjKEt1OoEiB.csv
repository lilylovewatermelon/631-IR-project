a smoky room a small café
they come to hear you play
and drink and dance the night away
i sit out in the crowd and close my eyes
dream youre mine
but you dont know
you dont even know that i am there

chorus
i wish that i was in your arms
like that spanish guitar
and you would play me through the night
till the dawn ooh
i wish youd hold me in your arms
like that spanish guitar
all night long long
all night long all night long
id be your song
id be your song

verse 2
steal my heart with every note you play
i pray youll look my way
and hold me to your heart someday yeah
i long to be the one that
you caress with a tenderness
and you dont know
you dont even know that i exist

y sueñas que soy tuyo
pero yo no sé ni siquiera que estas ahí
me gustaría tenerte entre mis brazos amor
