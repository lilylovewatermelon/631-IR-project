ooh ooh
oh i know it aint the same

verse 1
i wish i could believe you then ill be alright
but now everything you told me really dont apply
to the way i feel inside
lovin you was easy once upon a time
but now my suspicions of you have multiplied
and its all because you lied

chorus
i only give you a hard time
cause i cant go on and pretend like
i havent tried to forget this
but im much too full of resentment

verse 2
just cant seem to get over ooh
the way you hurt me ooh
dont know how you gave another
who didnt mean a thing no mean a thing
the very thing you gave to me ooh
i thought i could forgive you ooh
and i know youve changed ooh
as much as i wanna trust you ooh
i know it aint the same it aint the same
and its all because you lied

i know she was attractive but i was here first
been ridin with you for six years
why did i deserve to be treated this way by you

and see shes had half of me you lied
