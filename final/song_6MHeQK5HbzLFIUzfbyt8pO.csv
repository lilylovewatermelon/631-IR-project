i cant believe i had to see
the girl of my dreams cheating on me
the pain you caused has left me dead inside
im gonna make sure you regret that night
i feel you close i feel you breathe
and now its like youre here
youre haunting me
youre out of line youre out of sight
youre the reason that we started this fight

chorus max
but i i i know
i just gotta let it go
i i shouldve known
i gotta learn to say goodbye now
i throw my armour down
and leave the battleground
for the final time now
i i know
im running from a warzone

verse 2 jay  nathan
in our house i hate that place
everywhere i walk i see your face
try to erase a memory with a flame
and hope ill never see you again
standing here in this burning room
you know the end could never come so soon
its clear to me the lies you used
the ones that killed me aint hurting you so
