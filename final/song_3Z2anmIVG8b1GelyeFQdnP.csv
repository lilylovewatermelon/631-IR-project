tell me lover
now that you made your change
was your soul rediscovered
was your heart rearranged
are you still taking pills in the morning
and did you lose that longing now
for a walk through an ocean town
cause this towns just an ocean now

verse 2
you dont hate the summers
youre just afraid of the space
asking strangers for answers
to forget what they say
a boat beside a dock in the sunlight
nothing but the water and the sunrise now
just the lack of an open mouth
cause this towns just an ocean now
chorus
bad
ill miss this place your head and your heart
and my dad still tells me when theyre playing your songs
laughing at the way that you would say
if only baby there were cameras in the traffic lights
theyd make me a star
theyd make me a star

chorus
bad
ill miss this place your head and your heart
and my dad still tells me when theyre playing your songs
laughing at the way
that you would say
if only baby there were cameras in the traffic lights
theyd make me a star
theyd make me a star

postchorus
i wanna go to maine
i wanna go to maine god

outro
tell me lover
once youve had your change of heart
cause were no more than the fossils
on crescent beach state park
and we used to sing along to church bells on sundays
and can you even hear em from the subway now
and i hope that we make you proud
cause this towns just an ocean now3embed"
