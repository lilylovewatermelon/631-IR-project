verse
from out the streets became a millionaire
i know niggas started in the trap and they still there
member i was robbin i bought jewelry and i still wear it
came a long way with all my niggas and they still here
my big bro behind bars fighting two hundred years
i got that call i lost my dawg and i dont know how to feel
gotta stay on savage time you know its war time
i remember i aint used to leave the house without my 45
i aint got no time
member pappy had the mackie at the stop sign
shit was too too real
i got my glock and laid em down nigga you knew the deal
thats why i moved to the hills and im new to it
cause i aint sure why my dawg had to make the news reel
got promethazine in my eyes im cryin purple tears
the streets left me coldhearted they hurt me still
uh and thats why im on tour thats why my house a resort
thats why i got the four by four
i remember when i was low tryna trap in front of the store
hop fences on the police from handcuffs to rollies
these hoes didnt know a nigga now she claim she know me
i been counting up the bag yeah yeah
i get the load on the bag im fuckin up yens
i go get the birdie birdie nigga i need some hens
thirty before thirty i been settin trends
hop on the forbes i hop on the forbes i hop on the forbes
i been countin millions every time i board
spend your whole budget in the designer store
walk inside my closet its designer galore
bad bitch give me yaya in an aventador
bad bitch give me neeeeeeeeck
flooded my wrist its wet wet wet wet wet wet wet wet
im boutta pack up the whole house put it inside the suitcase
put my dick inside her mouth like its crest toothpaste
yeah she gave me head like a toupée huh
got twenty hoes they all my roommates huh
ten in the bed ten in the pool bae huh
i need some bread been trappin for two days
if he rockin with the opps we gotta wet the block
got my glock in the dior but i got on gucci socks
drip too hard you cant ride this wave
put my baby mama and my mom in a bentaygayou might also like42embed"
