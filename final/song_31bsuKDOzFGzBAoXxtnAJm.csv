you said fuck me and i was like cool
so now whats the problem

chorus
dont go hiding again
tired of asking where you been
you left so abruptly
i guess its fuck me
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
before its over
i need you to come over once again
and before you give me closure
need you to come a little bit closer

verse
still steppin like omega psi phi for mine
if bein real was a crime id be doin life
like that nigga not nicе i dont know polite
im the first evеr antisocial socialite
the pain that i seen in my mothers eyes in 2009
have me workin til its 2049
and get hate when i tell you oh some other time
like i really got some other time
you just tell me never mind
know i sound crazy to a lazy mind
know itll be a different kind
shout out to the people workin nine to five
i be workin nine to nine
and the six upside down its a nine
you already know the vibe
and they leave cause of pride but they comin back every time
the devils that i recognize most of them got pretty eyes
titties and some plans of just gettin by thats the way they live or die
easy to judge but girl who am i
truth or dare ima take a double dare
truth is a suicide
i would rather live a lie keep you on the outside
introduce you to the guys
have you throwin up the south side like youre one of mine
but youre not one of mine
you belong to everybody else when youre bored in your free time
shit could make a thug cry play it like a tough guy
couldnt even land in the hamptons they didnt have the stairs for the shit i fly
swear its like a metaphor i cant even get down from the shit i climb
cant even get down from the shit i climb
yeah girl youre my size
make me tell you one time
we was on the front line shit was in my bloodline
waitin for the sunshine
but the sun never shines on me on me
sleepin in the whip sometimes girl i was sleepin upright
henny red cup life broski kept it tucked tight
niggas talkin bare shit about what they gon do to mine
aw now their tongues tied
we was smokin watched the sun climb
i would trap until my thumbs cried
tryna change it all in one line
never seen a thug cry
love its been a long time
bet you never seen a thug cry
hit me on my hotline
and no ma im not fine at all
see drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likechorus
dont go hiding again
tired of asking where you been
you left so abruptly
i guess its fuck me
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
tell me what did i do wrong
before its over
i need you to come over once again
and before you give me closure
need you to come a little bit closer8embed"
