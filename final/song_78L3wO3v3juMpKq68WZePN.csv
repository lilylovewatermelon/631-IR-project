seems innocent enough when your buying the drinks at the bar and youre both getting loaded
dont even know just the danger youre in cause youre so caught up in the moment
but you shoot a smile cuts through the smoke
hits you before you even know

chorus
a girl is a gun
shes harder to handle than you think son
you feel safe when youre with her
think twice before you pull the trigger
she feels good in your hand from the first little spark
but guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
heartbreaks a bitch
shell kill you with a kiss
so before careful when youre holding one
cause a girl is a gun

verse 2
shes cold and shes hot
shes fun but shes not some play thing two dollar pistol
say the right thing shell go off with a bang
but be careful cause she kicks a little
hold her just right dont let her down
youre gonna get hurt if you mess around

think twice before you pull the trigger
she feels good in your hand from the first little spark
but guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
heartbreaks a bitch
shell kill you with a kiss
so before careful when youre holding one
cause a girl is a gun

chorus
yeah a girl is a gun
shes harder to handle than you think son
you feel safe when youre with her
think twice before you pull the trigger
she feels good in your hand from the first little spark
but guns shoot bullets and bullets break hearts
heartbreaks a bitch
shell kill you with a kiss
so before careful when youre holding one
cause a girl is a gun
yeah a girl is a gunembed"
