thinking bout something else
as you lay beside me
it was a rude awakening
as i wiped the sleep from my eyes

but its a beautiful day
its a beautiful sunrise
i dont want to see you cry

you started whispering
this cant be happening
cause i dont want to lose my cool
but was it something i said
or something i did
ooh to spark a flame
but it hurts to see your face
it hurts to hear you cry
it hurts to see the look in your eyes

cause its a beautiful day
its a beautiful sunrise
well i dont want to see you cry
but i can take away your pain
the feelings just the same
but i cant stand to see you cry
you might also likethe list goes on and on
theres never enough
but who is when and when is where
weve been there its tough
but if ive come to far
its not far enough
well get there just take your time realize
believe in me

cause its a beautiful day
its a beautiful sunrise
and i cant stand to see you cry
but i can take away your pain
the feelings just the same yea
well i cant stand to see you cry

but its a beautiful day
its a beautiful sunrise
oh i just want to see you smile
cause i can take away your pain
the feelings just the same
yea i just want to see you smile

the list goes on and on1embed"
