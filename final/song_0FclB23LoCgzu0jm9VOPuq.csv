shotgun to the back of my heart
i dont turn around to see who let one ring out
said youd never do me wrong
guess we see how that plays out
is it true is it true

hook
heading to the massacre
bodies arriving every day
what were those shells you heard
picking the bones up along the way
let it ring out
let it ring out
let it ring out
let it ring out

verse 2
sharpshooting in my backyard
killed a small boy once never told no one
if it wasnt for my shotgun
hed be alive and id be halfway to heaven
instead of sitting in the dark going through hell
you shouldve been here
wish you had been here
see sza liveget tickets as low as 143you might also likehook
heading to the massacre
bodies arriving every day
what were those shells you heard
picking the bones up along the way
let it ring out
let it ring out
let it ring out
let it ring out

reprise
shotgun to the back of my heart
i dont turn around to see who let one ring out

pt ii i doubt it

outro
lately ive been questioning
am i all that i pretend to be
i doubt it i doubt it
lately ive been questioning
am i all that i pretend to be
