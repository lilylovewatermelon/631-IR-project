remember when we had it all
remember when you took my calls
you were my whole world
you were my whole world
not a thing said to me
question now if my heart bleeds
you were my whole world
you were my whole world

prechorus
i cant stop watching my phone
cant turn it off
what is wrong with me i cant baby
but if you change your mind then ill miss it
now im crying alone
hotel never much fun
not when theres nobody to catch your tears out here

chorus
i know last night we made some midnight decisions
did i mess up oh god i hope i didnt
its all a blur when we talk through the liquor
i always regret midnight decisions
i always regret midnight decisions
i always regret midnight decisions
i always regret midnight decisions
i always regret midnight decisions

keep the voices from screaming
he was my whole world
he was my whole world
