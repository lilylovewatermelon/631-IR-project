verse
lookin for some happiness again again fame changed everything
starin at the walls in the dark no i dont sleep late at night
my new hood aint like my old hood but i still sleep with my fire
i dont get no sleep i have nightmares of them takin my life
sometimes i sit and remember
but my life was never simple
do you remember 2014 when i was fourteen
locked up for lettin that 44 sing how you dont know me
break in your shit like im a dope fiend duckin the police
i had real kickindoor dreams this rap shit chose me
and im forever grateful this shit changed my life
but so much came with this shit i feel it cant be right
im always busy always workin how im posed to
always keep my distance these days cant be too social
i dont dot the door without my fire cause this shit dangerous
i dont want no bitch off ig live she wanna be famous
how the fuck we went from love birds to strangers uh
tell me how that work girl hows it feel to be my worst girl
its okay cause i know it get worse girl
and dear my soulmate i know its late to make amends i
i guess its safe to say that thats what time did
i tried to fix it you were busy listenin to your friends
too famous to find love again
they say love hurts cause love hurts uh
fame made love worse yeahyeah
yeahyeah
they say time heals cause time heals
what about all the shit time killed
yeahyeah yeahyeah yeah
woah
woahwoah woahwoah
