im big on the underground whats the point of knocking me down
everyone knows im already good on the ground
most of us stay strong shit dont really bound us
gon go on my own making bombs with rubber bands
have my heart down so i need a man for romance
streets are making em hard so theyre selfish little roamers
jumpin girl to girlmake us meat like burgers
when i get fat im gon pop me out some leaders

verse 2
protocol to be a rocawear model
it didnt really drop that way my legs hit the hurdle
protocol to be a rocker on a label
it didnt really drop that way my beats were too evil
now i put away paper for later so im stable
a better something better come gotta get cable
ghetto pops food drops stored up in my stable
pop em up pop em down eat em off the table

verse 3
village got on the phones said the street is comin to town
they wanna check my papers see what i carry around
credentials are boring i burnt them at the burial ground
dont order me about im an outlaw from the badlands
put away shots for later so im stable
live in trees chew on feet watch lost on cable
bird flu gonna get you made it in my stable
from the crap you drop on my crop when they pay yousee mia liveget tickets as low as 146you might also like3embed"
