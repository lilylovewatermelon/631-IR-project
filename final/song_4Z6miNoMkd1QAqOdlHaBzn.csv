and this week the trend
was to not wake up till 3pm
i picked a few conscious hours that i chose to spend
and slept away the rest of them
and this week the trend
was to crash and burn and then return again
to practice the life that i pretend
provides enough to get me through the weekend

chorus
so i say give me a solution
and watch me run with it
then you gave you gave me a solution
what have i done with it
cause i was absolutely sure i had it all figured out way back then
and now its this minute this hour this day

verse 2
and this week the trend
was to backstab every single one of my friends
and leave a voicemail message trying to make amends
all the while hoping things work out in the end

verse 3
this week the trend
was to borrow all the strength that you could lend
to keep my head above the water and not descend
back to where i said id never go again

so i say give me a solution
and watch me run with it
and then you gave you gave me a solution
what have i done with it
cause i was absolutely sure i had it all figured out way back then
but after this day its this week all over again

bridge
and i just want to get mugged at knifepoint
to get cut enough to wake me up
cause i know that i dont want to die
sitting around watching my life go by
and what we take from this is what well get
and we havent quite figured it out just yet
because all of us are all too stuck
strapped to a chair watching our lives blow up
stuck watching our lives blow up
