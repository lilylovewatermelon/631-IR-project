listen to the same song
cry for no reason at all
get it out of my system

you know i used to love getting bored
but now without you i have so much time to think
theres nothing to think about anymore

i dont feel like myself right now
feel like a stranger
wonder who that person might be
and if youd still love her

and today i get upset over this song that i heard
and i guess i was just upset because why didnt i think of it first

and tell me why am i sad
when there is somewhere i dont want to go
even though you invited me and i still said nosee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeembed"
