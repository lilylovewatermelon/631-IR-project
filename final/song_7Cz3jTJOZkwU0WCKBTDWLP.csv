the other night dear as i laid sleeping
i dreamt i held you in my tired arms
when i awoke dear i was mistaken
so i bowed my head and i cried

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
so please dont take my sunshine away

verse 2
ive always loved you made you happy
and nothin else could come between
but now youve left me to love another
and youve shattered all my dreams

chorus
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
so please dont take my sunshine away
