everywhere you look you can write a book
on the trouble with a woman and a man
but you can not impose you cant stick your nose
into something that you dont understand

chorus
but still you wonder
whos cheatin who whos being true
who dont even care anymore
it makes you wonder
whos doing right with someone tonight
and whose car is parked next door

verse 2
i thought i knew her well i really couldnt tell
that she had another lover on her mind
you see it felt so right when she held me tight
how could i be so blind

chorus
but still you wonder
whos cheatin who whos being true
who dont even care anymore
it makes you wonder
whos doing right with someone tonight
whose car is parked next door

as long as you keep it outta sight
