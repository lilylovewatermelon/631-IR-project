kiss the girl
kiss the girl

verse 1
there you see her
sitting there across the way
she dont got a lot to say
but theres something about her
and you dont know why but youre dying to try
you wanna kiss the girl

look at her you know ya do
its possible she wants you too
there is one way to ask her
it dont take a word not a single word
go on and kiss the girl kiss the girl

its such a shame too bad
