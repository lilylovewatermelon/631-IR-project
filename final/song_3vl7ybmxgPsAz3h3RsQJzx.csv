we are amazed but not amused
by all the things you say that youll do
though much concerned but not involved
with decisions that are made by you

chorus
but we are sick and tired of hearing your song
telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
cause if you really want to hear our views
you havent done nothin

verse 2
its not too cool to be ridiculed
but you brought this upon yourself
the world is tired of pacifiers
we want the truth and nothing else yeah

and we are sick and tired of hearing your song
telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
cause if you really want to hear our views
you havent done nothin
