i know that it is freezing but i think we have to walk
i keep waving at the taxis they keep turning their lights off
but julie knows a party at some actors west side loft
supplies are endless in the evening by the morning theyll be gone

verse 2
when everything is lonely i can be my own best friend
i get a coffee and the paper have my own conversations
with the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
the mask i polish in the evening by the morning looks like shit

chorus
and i know you have a heavy heart
i can feel it when we kiss
so many men stronger than me
have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
but me im not a gamble
you can count on me to split
the love i sell you in the evening
by the morning wont exist

verse 3
youre looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
you just keep going to the bathroom always say youll be right back
well it takes one to know one kid i think youve got it bad
but whats so easy in the evening by the mornings such a drag
you might also likeverse 4
i got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
and if you promise to stay conscious i will try and do the same
well we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
but what was normal in the evening by the morning seems insane

chorus
and im not sure what the trouble was
that started all of this
the reasons all have run away
but the feeling never did
its not something i would recommend
but it is one way to live
cause what is simple in the moonlight
by the morning never is

outro
it was so simple in the moonlight
now its so complicated
it was so simple in the moonlight
so simple in the moonlight
so simple in the moonlight36embed"
