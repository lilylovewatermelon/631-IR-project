verse
yeah whats your definition of success ayy
i dont trust the thoughts that come inside my head woo
i dont trust this thing that beats inside my chest
who i am and who i wanna be cannot connect why
dont think i deserve it you get no respect woo
i just made a couple mil still not impressed
let you down goes triple platinum yeah okay okay i guess ayy
smile for a moment then these questions startin to fill my head not again
i push away the people that i love the most why woo
i dont want no one to know im vulnerable why woo
that makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable why ayy
stop askin me questions i just wanna feel alive
until i die—this isnt nates flow woo
just let me rhyme im in disguise
im a busy person got no time for lies one of a kind
they dont see it i pull out they eyes im on the rise
ive been doin this for most my life with no advice woo
take my chances i just roll the dice do what i like
as a kid i was afraid of heights put that aside
now im here and they look so surprised well so am i woo
they dont invite me to the parties but i still arrive
kick down the door and then i go inside
give off that i do not belong here vibe
then take the keys right off the counter lets go for a ride
why do yall look mortified ayy
i keep to myself they think im sorta shy organized
let you downs the only song youve heard of well then youre behind woo
story time wish that i could think like big sean does but i just cant decide aah
if i should stick my knife inside of pennywise
i i dont care what anybody else thinks—lies haha
i do not need nobody to help me—lies
i kinda feel guilty cause im wealthy why
i dont understand its got me questionin like
why just tell me why—not back to this flow
inside i feel divided
back when i aint had a dime but had the drive
back before i ever signed i questioned life like who am i man woo
nothin to mes ever good enough
i could be workin for 24 hours a day and think i never did enough
my life is a movie but there aint no tellin what youre gonna see in my cinema no
i wanna be great but i get in the way of myself and i think about everything that i could never be
why do i do it though ayy yeah
why you always lookin aggravated
not a choice you know i had to make it
when they talk about the greatest they gon probably never put us in the conversation
like somethin then i gotta take it
write somethin then i might erase it
i love it then i really hate it
whats the problem nathan i dont know
i know i like to preach to always be yourself yeah
but my emotions make me feel like i am someone else
me and pride had made a pact that we dont need no help
which feels like im at war inside myself but i forgot the shells
i hold my issues up for all to see like show and tell
a lot of people know me but not a lot know me well
hold my issues up for all to see like show and tell
a lot of people know me but they dont know me well
