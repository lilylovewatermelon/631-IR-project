dont kill me
just help me run away from everyone
i need a place to stay where i can cover up my face
dont cry i am just a freak

chorus
i am just a freak
i am just a freak
i am just a freak

verse 2
my head is filled with parasites
black holes cover up my eyes
i dream of you almost every night
hopefully i wont wake up this time

chorus
i wont wake up this time
i wont wake up this time
i wont wake up this timeyou might also like52embed"
