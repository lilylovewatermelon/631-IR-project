fumbling his confidence
and wondering why the world has passed him by
hoping that hes bid for more than arguments
and failed attempts to fly fly

chorus
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside
somewhere we live inside
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside

verse 2
dreaming about providence
and whether mice and men have second tries
maybe weve been livin with our eyes half open
maybe were bent and broken were broken broken

chorus
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside
somewhere we live inside
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside

we want more than this worlds got to offer
we want more than this worlds got to offer
we want more than the wars of our fathers
and everything inside
it screams for second life
yeah
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
we were meant to live
we were meant to liveembed"
