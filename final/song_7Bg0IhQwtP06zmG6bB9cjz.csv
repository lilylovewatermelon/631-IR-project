uh this is for my
this is for my one love one love

verse 1
i had a dream when i was just a little boy
to find a girl like you
we would meet at the park after school
and talk til the day was through
then you take me to your parents house
and i would comb your hair
and we would dream of all the cities
and places we could go
oh oh oh

chorus
say the words that you know i wanna hear
put your heart up close to my ear
we dont need to know the time
we could stay til the day turns to night

verse 2
i can still remember dreams as a little boy
now i’m a man and still cant put down my toys
hey hey hey
real love will never come if you in it now
but i had to learn that lesson down in the south
back to spending nights on the town just to have a little fun
in my mind im wishing she’s the one i said to myself
is this too close to reality
for you to be that girl from my fantasy

say the words that you know i wanna hear
put your heart up close to my ear
we dont need to know the time
we could stay til the day turns to night

bridge
she stole my head and let’s go play the dream again
to find a girl like you only you and me around
i look into your eyes
and i see our universe you and i are intertwined
i look into your eyes
and i see our universe love is pure so divine

chorus
say the words that you know i wanna hear
put your heart up close to my ear
we dont need to know the time
we could stay til the day turns to night
say the words that you know i wanna hear
put your heart up close to my ear
we dont need to know the time
we could stay til the day turns to night

outro
this is dedicated
from the fire well rise
to my one and only ever love
i would never ever ever ever love again
this is dedicated you know who you are
to my one and only ever love the only girl ive ever loved1embed"
