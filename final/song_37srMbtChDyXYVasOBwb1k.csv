your eyes followed me here
your eyes seamless and sure
they leave me broken and in need of a cure
your eyes followed me here
your eyes sifting my soul
they leave me broken and forge diamonds from the coal

prechorus 1
they race me along
the infinite synapse of white lines
and then while chasing the dawn
with storybook syntax

chorus 1
your eyes slit the throat
of all i know
about myself in this life
this silhouette lie

verse 2
and your eyes speaking in tongues vigilant still
filling my lungs testing my will
they leave me broken and bruised and bleeding
your eyes resting in flame
leave me breathless again
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeprechorus 2
like hydrogen
split on fault lines
or ten years living with
exposure to radon

chorus 1
your eyes slit the throat
of all i know
about myself in this life
this silhouette lie

bridge
your eyes your eyes
speaking in tongues
vigilant still and always
your eyes your eyes
filling my lungs
testing my will

chorus 2
you slit the throat
of all i know
about myself in this life
this silhouette lie
chorus 3
you slit my throat
because i know
that this life is a lie
so slit my throat2embed"
