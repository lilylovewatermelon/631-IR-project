same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
our song on the radio but it dont sound the same
when our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little when i hear your name

prechorus
it all just sounds like ooh ooh
mm too young too dumb to realize

chorus
that i shouldve bought you flowers
and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours
when i had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my babys dancin
but shes dancin with another man

verse 2
uh my pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways
caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
now ill never never get to clean up the mess i made oh
and that haunts me every time i close my eyes

bridge
although it hurts
ill be the first to say that
i was wrong
oh i know im probably much too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but i just want you to know

chorus
i hope he buys you flowers
i hope he holds your hand
give you all his hours
when he has the chance
take you to every party
cause i remember how much you love to dance
do all the things i shouldve done
when i was your man
do all the things i shouldve done
when i was your man180embed"
