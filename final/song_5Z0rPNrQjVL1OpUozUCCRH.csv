verse 1
im just being myself
plus i gotta be me too
silly of me to think that i couldnt bring myself to be you
ah but behold there is benevolence behind this
but dont stare though
be careful cause ill kill you with kindness
thats why im dressed quite neatly
cause its easy and discreetly they seek me
and when they reach me and see me
they believe me completely
im a real live wire i aint lying i aint lying
if its between me and you i aint dying
i can transform i can transform i can transform without even trying

now im someone else
now someone can be me too
behold the beautiful and bold
everyday i wake up to be new
ah but its simple but they still cant understand why
i think i can i think i can i think i can
or can i
im a microchip off the old block
you know not but i was a robot
and i sold rock
and you would get for sure shot
with a gold glock boy i rode pac
im something that you wont see again
what the hell might as well be a friend
i can transform im a transformer
aint no telling who ill have to be again
