i think im coming undone
i think im getting started
us humans we dont know one thing
about ourself or anything
and i for one know nothing
but you can tell me something
you can whisper something

you think im coming undone
you think im going crazy
us humans we dont know one thing
about ourself or anything
and he for one knows everything
and she wont tell you nothing
she just sits their cuffing no
lets think about how we created this oh
lets think about how we let this happen ohohoh
we want our freedoms without responsibility
and we are so scared to see

so you run to your roots

verse 3
im independent i stay on the beach i roll with the seas
im not an investment you have no control over me
maybe i could say one thing maybe
maybe i could pretend like money grows on trees
but it does and thats the funny thing
the ironic thing uh the kind of scary thing
it all destroys for me ah
