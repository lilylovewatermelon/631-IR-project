verse 1
can you hear the drums fernando
i remember long ago another starry night like this
in the firelight fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

verse 2
they were closer now fernando
every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and im not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

chorus
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando

now were old and grey fernando
since many years i havent seen a rifle in your hand
can you hear the drums fernando
do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the rio grande
i can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

chorus
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though i never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though i never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
yes if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
outro
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando10embed"
