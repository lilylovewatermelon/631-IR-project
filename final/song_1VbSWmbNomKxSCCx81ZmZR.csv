strawberry shimmer on hot lips
silver buckle hangin off her hips
eyes sparkle when she smiles
shinedown on the radio dial
homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip
dont stop girl you know i love it when you

chorus
get your shine on
cause you and me be rockin all night long
summer sky drippin rhinestones
turn your party lights on
baby get your shine on shine on
baby get your shine on

verse 2
silverado candy painted
raybans got the whole world shaded
chrome piece tucked in the console
ridin high roll up on the down low
feelin lucky got hooked up with some kentucky clear
so slide that little sugar shaker over here

chorus
and get your shine on
cause you and me be rockin all night long
summer sky drippin rhinestones
turn your party lights on
baby get your shine on shine on
baby get your shine on
