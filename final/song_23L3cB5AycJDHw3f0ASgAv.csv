id like to take a minute to apologize
for not taking advantage of you
through all the years youve passed me by
honestly i really wanted to be mad at you yes
for so many hours waiting yeah
i finally know what it means to be patient yeah
and everything has its place yeah
and reason and ive learned that

and everything yeah
is gonna take its time for it to happen
time waits for nothing oh
and everything is gonna take its time
cause it will happen
time waits for nothing yeah
and no one
cause everything has its time

verse 2
i used to think that if i tried then maybe i
huh could change the things that i regretted in my past life
but through all the lessons that you taught me
i have learned my experiences enhanced my character yeah
now as i look back with what i know now i can say
that i wouldnt change a thing
cause i love who i became yeah
and when its all said and done
i can only live for today
cause ive learned that

i used to find it hard to believe
hard to believe
and almost impossible to conceive yeah
to conceive
that everything i do revolves around you
and knowing that its kind crazy to me
now if i had a dollar for every moment that i spent
watching my days go by
doing doing doing nothing
id probably never be penniless or hopeless
hoohohohohohoh

verse 3
so for a while now ive kept in mind
cause what they say is true
that you are of the essence
down to the very last second
and im so glad that ive grown to respect you
