i dont feel so good where am i
this is not where i laid down
who are these people whos home is this
wheres my clothes and wheres my car
how did i get in the bathtub
not again not again
the phone is off and i need a ride
none of these people are my friends
fell off of the wagon coughin and dragging a viceroy
gulping a magnum a nice boy turned shitty
burning fiftys of daddys money on the top of a can
instead of copping the van i got you poppin a ativan
thought you had a gram what did ya do with it
check both pockets shit wheres your wallet
dumb alcoholic time for the panic

hook
sit around now waitin on a chest pain
lookin for a sign right brain left brain
something inside startin to feel strange
friends wonder where you been
go take a vitamin throw your cigarettes away
clean up the beer cans its a beautiful day
time you reported to your life
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likeverse 2
yes i should have stayed in college no i was to cool for that
cooking soft up into solid yall know where to find me at
seems too hard to get better what do i do after that
waiting on an answer does anybody out there hear me
take your ass home you aint gon last long
youre sick tired wired youre dyin
looking mom in the eyes and lyin
cant you tell your brain cells are fryin
dont go a chance in hell youre buyin
death by the bag and your breath is ass
what are you runnin from take a bath
but before you do pass that grass

hook
sit around now waitin on a chest pain
looking for a sign right brain left brain
something inside startin to feel strange
friends wonder where you been
go take a vitamin throw your cigarettes away
clean up the beer cans its a beautiful day
time you reported to your life

verse 3
why is everything so technical got me thinkin mechanical
puffin on them botanicals every second so critical
bored with the human language pain beat on my mental
messing with chemicals sick as the appetites of cannibals
far away they shoot a laser from a computer
ricochets off a satellite panel to a missile silo in cuba
eyes behold catastrophe foreseen by nostradamus
the prophets peep the millennium age of the broken promise
more religions than park pigeons the poor envy the rich and
monetary decisions make pessimistic divisions
its like the whole planet went off the deep end while i was sleepin
men be leapin off ledges when their women leave for the weekend why
hook
sit around now waitin on a chest pain
looking for a sign right brain left brain
something inside startin to feel strange
friends wonder where you been
go take a vitamin throw your cigarettes away
clean up the beer cans its a beautiful day
time you reported to your life

go take a vitamin clean up the beer cans beautiful day
time you reported to your lifeembed"
