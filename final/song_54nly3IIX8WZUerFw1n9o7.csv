like a semiauto trailer
i dive so deep in the sea
to avoid killer whales
a perfect moment here and gone
it has sailed
ill use a hammerhead to drive
rusty nail inside

im feeling the sea beneath me beneath you
im feeling the sea beneath you beneath me

imagine if our world was blue and weightless
i never meant to do wrong to you
youre my starfish
you moan a tone so low beyond me
a telepathic subsonic frequency
i need a little air for emergency
you have to understand this urgency

im feeling the sea beneath me beneath you
white sand beneath my feet
no brain between my ears
im feeling the sea beneath you beneath me
i know that if i had one
id spare us both these years
