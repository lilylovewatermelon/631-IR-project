there is no doubt tonight
im falling im falling so
in love with how you are to me
for you i would give anything
try and be a man
im falling im falling so
so far from what i thought was clear
no theres no turning back from here

chorus
now that we have the world in front of us
were never turning back
how could we ever not believe
now that i have the world in front of me
im never turning back
how could i ever let this go let this go

verse 2
so many times i fall
im falling i fall apart
im so concerned with pity things
it drags me farther down
why do we run from things were scared of
i see it now its all so clear
no theres no turning back from here
