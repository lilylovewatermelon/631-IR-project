it is a gift i know
a moment of bliss that we hold
a firecracker flash of light then on to the next plane soul remain
come along if you dare
it’s gonna be that you’re scared
lovely life i thank you for the reason to see the pain through

prechorus 1
light a candle for the dead
the wick is burning returning what we have
it’s who we are
we’ll reach you if you’re beyond the furthest star

prechorus 2
don’t give up the fight to stay alive and even if you have to
find the reason of another’s pain if they lose you
if not for your self then those around who care like i do
one day you’ll see the clear blue

chorus
beyond the gray sky
beyond the gray sky
beyond the gray sky

light a candle…
the wick…
it’s who we are…
one day you’ll see the clear blue

i can’t believe you didn’t call

to help you see beyond the gray sky2embed"
