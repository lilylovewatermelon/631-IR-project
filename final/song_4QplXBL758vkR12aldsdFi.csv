youve got to have an ace in the hole
a little secret that nobody knows
life is a gamble a game we all play
but you need to save something for a rainy day
youve got to learn to play your cards right
if you expect to win in life
dont put it all on the line for just one roll
youve got to have an ace in the hole

verse 1
if youre headed down a one way street
and youre not sure its the way you want to go
in money or love or all the above
have a little more than what you show

verse 2
when life deals out a surprise
have a few surprises of your own
no matter what you do no matter where you go
youve got to have an ace in the hole

chorus
youve got to have an ace in the hole
a little secret that nobody knows
life is a gamble a game we all play
but you need to save something for a rainy day
youve got to learn to play your cards right
if you expect to win in life
dont put it all on the line for just one roll
youve got to have an ace in the hole

dont put it all on the line for just one roll
youve got to have an ace in the hole
