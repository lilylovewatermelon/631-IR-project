blood and tears and the enemys right here
sickened broken blood shed murder your children
torture treason never falling out
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken

sleep my angel life has slowly slipped away

killing fields and im starting to miss you
pornographs all i got for a bedroom
sickened broken blood shed murder your children
torture treason never falling out
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken

sleep my angel life has slowly slipped away
standing on broken glass standing on broken
lifes so fragile revolution taking place

bullet shells and famine and stab wounds
i wish i could do more than write you
im so sickened broken blood shed murder your children
torture treason never falling out
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken glass
standing on broken
see buckcherry liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likesleep my angel life has slowly slipped away
standing on broken glass standing on broken
lifes so fragile revolution taking place
standing on broken glass standing on broken
sleep my angel life has slowly slipped away
