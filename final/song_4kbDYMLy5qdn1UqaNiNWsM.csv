we were alone on the road driving faster
so far from home we were chasing disaster
hard on the gas til the car caught on fire
we had to laugh as the smoke billowed higher

prechorus
i want to feel alive forever after
and you say you say you want to feel alive forever after
and i and i and i say

chorus
fooollow the liiight through the dreams and disasters
fooollow the liiight to the edge and the after
we wont turn around
we will not slow down
fooollow the liiight through the dreams and disasters

verse 2
think of the sun and the sound of it rising
still on the run with our eyes on the horizon

prechorus
i want to feel alive forever after
and you say you say you want to feel alive forever after
and i and i and i say
