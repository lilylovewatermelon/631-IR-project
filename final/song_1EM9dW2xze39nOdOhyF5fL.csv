because youre afraid
that well all see

silence the more you speak
the less i believe
you plant words like weeds

scream loud youll never fool me
sing out youll never fool me
hear now youll never fool me
do you see how fake you sound

your lips are poison and sweet
but love doesnt come cheap
talk is nothing to me
take a bullet for me
maybe then ill believe

righteous you claim to be
put your forked tongue behind your teeth

your words are poison and sweet
but trust doesnt come cheap
talk is nothing to me
take a bullet for me
maybe then ill believe
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likemaybe then i will see
maybe then you could be
something more than just air
coming out when you speak
maybe then ill believe

your words mean nothing to me
its time to eat what you speak
take a bullet for me
maybe then ill believe

youre the wolf in the sheep
but youll never fool me

i will never believeembed"
