im out of breath already and im only on the second page

i bite off their button eyes and swallow them whole i spit the buttons in an old glass jar next to the poison receptacles in the basement next to the corrugated cardboard water damaged rats millipedes mold its dark and scary already  to a time before you changed your mind i think its so fucking hysterical that i smell like vanilla pudding nobody can spoon me nobody can catch me nobody can hold me down that easily do you think my insides are really that mild and sweet what do you think is inside of me id never have time to show you im not served tonight youll never have time to sleep with me i have to go to bed tomorrow i have to get up and exert myself i mean insert myself into a cubicle i have to pretend to be pleasant i have to resist my urge to turn into a guard dog and attack yank the chain out of the muddy ground what am i guarding why am i so heavily guarded why cant i find a boy willing to swim through the toxic mold of this armored fortress why cant i find a boy wellequipped to scale the toilet stall and rescue me from my urge to purge id never have time to hurl it all out before the bitter aftertaste takes over my knees are already inkstained my knees are already skinned peaches sliced into syrup canned beware of the metal rim as you try to pry it open im sick why cant you just pull my hair out of the way why cant you just pull my hair a little help me unwind this tension in these artifice knots these tight braids they dangle down my back like whips fine so im not rapunzel fine so my tower is just a toilet stall just another constraining cubicle and im so bored im eating my own ragged cuticles hook me up with some pharmaceuticals before i consume myself im obsessed with my own dark circles i wish i was listening to sonic youth diverted by someone elses dissonance i wish another cute young boy would plant a kiss on my blowup doll lips and just admit that i tasted like plastic like leather like scuffed patent leather i want to experience this vinyl with you i mean the backseat of this rusty car with my chocolate chapsticks mirroring the mirrors and in the rearview a murder a murder of crows im being stalked by these blackwinged things flaunting their beaks like costume jewelry their eyes already look taxidermed their cries sound so desperate like a bmovie victim to me ive started drawing black wings from the corners of my eyes ive started to cultivate my unsettled feelings ive started to get rid of my eyebrows plucking them thinner and thinner until i look like a movie star vixen victim go ahead and victimize me go ahead and patronize me go ahead and tell me whos the consumer and whos the product in this scene sometimes its hard to tell the difference between a commercial and a dream one image blurred into the next if its not a strange juxtaposition it doesnt make sense my parameters are shifting please pay attention to me im desperate to regain my youthful resiliency my glossy sheen but the magazine page starring me has a tone of gory pornography redeem me redeem me like im a coupon for the latest exfoliant that does not deliver on its sexy claims this buildup of dead skin cells is a defense that cannot be penetrated defense mechanisms mechanism of torture symbol of disgrace a chemical taste a chemical peel gone terribly awry a microdermabrasion nightmare heres a new definition of sexy eyes pecked out to reveal the empty sockets of a saint a contemporary twist on sadomasochistic christian imagery empty eye sockets filled with chocolatecovered cherries what do you see plastic surgery tracheotomy orthopedic shoes on the wrong feet im trying to make our bad habits sexy im trying to start a new trend in hook arms zoom in on the hook arm and it looks like a meat hook and who do you think is hanging there its a massacre its a movie soundtrack its a dream soundtrack for a girl with relapsing fever for a girl who won the costume contest tailored by scrap metal stars dug up from some stinking landfill tailored by a murder of crows they dive bomb for tufts of stained fur to refill the empty sockets and all the other holes hey i paid for these holes so ill buy the jewelry do you understand were being pulled towards a sticky center of a sickly design i told you i was sick and i told you i was insatiable and i told you if you put your two cents in my slot id still feel empty my stomach acids dissolve all your offerings theres an acid bath inside this little piggy bank are you banking on blowing down my house are you banking on blowing my mind are you banking on being on the receiving end of another mindnumbing blowjob i told you id bite it off and you said you were willing to take that risk we take too many risks we spend too much money on namebrand sugar and cream you try to fill me up with wellcrafted coffee and it better be a bottomless cup the refills taste weaker and weaker or is that just me being needy i used to enjoy the taste but now its just a vehicle for the caffeine just another brokendown vehicle that always seems to stall across the railroad tracks and when you get out to push it you suddenly turn into a villain go ahead and blindfold me it just feels like a sleeping mask go ahead and hogtie me to the tracks i like the way it makes me feel innocent like a fairytale princess oblivious to the impending doom please distract me with your long hair and highpitched wails weird music that sounds like a lullaby to me im so tired im so tied up im so nice and cut down take a deep breath inhale inhale until you choke on my cliched addiction second hand codependent dependent on obsessive compulsive rituals to get through the day im tired of walking lets drive untie me and stash me in the trunk or the passenger side lets drive a little longer until the perimeters bleed lets go get a new piercing the piercer must be cute so i can really get into the pain it can be a boy or it can be a girl cause im not that straight im a twisty thing im a piggy bank i want the hungry shiny crows to pick my bones clean in a sexy sordid murder scene ill lie ill wail ill flail but there will be no measured rhythm i lost that rhythm long ago and i never could go with the flow i never could mesh with the status quo someone tore me out of the fabric or maybe i tore myself on one of those days when i had the delusion that i was a magazine page i could no longer pinpoint where the airbrushing ended and real me began i could no longer separate the fantasy from the alternate reality my own pores are making me nauseous my scar tissue is hideous im not even sure i exist until i look in the mirror and then im a horror movie character but am i the mutilated or the mutilator no wonder im obsessed with makeup techniques special effects no wonder i fire my words like theyre pyrotechnics no wonder im a kleptomaniac who steals only unwanted fragments ive cultivated clever tricks with scissors the selective cut and paste the collage that hides another collage underneath what would happen if i cut off your hair if i cut you down are you tired of me yet are my words scratching like broken needles are they only scratching the surface get out your rusty dissecting pins lets go deeper inside im raw and mean and unclean im unsanitized im just teasing because i know you like it dirty well just look under the nails pressed into my lids does this box turn you on do you want to suck on the filthy contents do you want to pry do you want to find out if its a jewelry box or a coffin can you see your own face in my taxidermed eyes hang up the receiver and let me sleep this isnt phone sex and you arent him as the phone cord snakes around my neck i think of autoerotic asphyxiation i think what if he was playing a neurotic game and just wrote that suicide note to be funny i saw him once at the midnight café his poetry planted this suggestion in my mind his poetry took hold of me his words his voice his delivery delivered me a parcel of gleaming crow feathers bound with black twine i actually shut my mouth i actually pretended my lips were sealed with electrical tape i felt his sticky pressure i felt my hair begin to stand on end electrostatic generator sexy man vibrating hum on the railroad tracks where we can collect the most interesting debris metal methadone fit for a candy dish exposed metal metal in a hot embrace around burning cake let me lick your poetry i dont care if it burns my tongue ill suck down your tainted crème brulé i saw him at a sonic youth concert good show he didnt even look at me at the midnight café i stepped behind the scene he was sitting out back exuding that dark energy i was tipsy i told him i liked his poetry and his voice made me want to scuff up my knees wont you please pay attention to me i know its not that easy its not that easy to write about someone i hardly knew its not that easy to tell the truth when im an evil mannequin with paintedon black eyes that can never cry even when i dwell on railroad tracks car wrecks and fully engorged pics that cause relapsing fever were diseased i just want to go to bed and get some beauty sleep but its not even that easy to sleep my pillow lost its fluffiness are there really feathers inside do you want to tear it open and see do you want to bite another hole in me with your wellhoned teeth do you want to go hook ourselves up with a pair of those custommade fangs and pretend were vampires we can sleep all day and fetishize our friends blood all night i never said i would be easy i never said i would be fun i never said i could afford to quit my day job even though its draining me and im spinning negatively and you cant filter my negativity and i will smoke you down and my lungs will turn black and im just winging it im trying to fly away im trying to run away im trying to say catch me if you can but youll just catch my disease my disease my evictions to ordering tighties online so i can flaunt my tits before they sag before you gag on me im a tight tease and you dont have time to penetrate me come here go away i know what youll try to do youll try to untie my red hood and examine the threads youll try to make me shed my inhibitions listen do you seriously think youre the first boy who tried to tell me to stick with a lollipop sure ill suck it but its no mystery flavor i know what it tastes like it tastes like nail polish remover im wearing pink nails in your fairy tales but if im in a fairy tale im fake if im in a nightmare im asleep if im a blowup doll its all about sex and im a false cover painted on the crudest sex manual around so pick your favorite paragraph it doesnt really matter to me i can play the role i can sigh and moan when you lick my pussy like im a little girl i can dominate you with my visual imagery i can spritz on more vanilla and offer a pleasing contrast to this fuckfest i can even lie on your dirty sheets and pretend im dead whatever more stained sheets of paper more mean poems another dumdum sucker cream soda whatever more plastic handcuffs more careless spit another silver tool that doesnt really get the job done go ahead and shave me go ahead and pluck my eyebrows until your fingers numb around what youre trying to grasp what am i trying to tell you maybe this is just another version of the same recurring dream in which my teeth are loose loose loose another variation on the same sickly theme its happened so many times its not even a nightmare anymore im just casually posed in front of the mirror plucking my own eyebrows then plucking out my teeth like theyre splinters or something i dont even have to sterilize the needle i dont even have to get out that alcohol im already numb i dont even have to put the needle on the record to find out how this song ends i open my mouth to sing along and instead of my teeth its a mouthful of rusty hooks my mouth some contortionists dream my mouth controlled by some mean master of marionettes who bit down hard on the bait and now is pulling my strings my stained teeth with their bloody roots are hidden in pink cupcake papers the papers will be artfully arranged into the metal socket of your muffin pan no need to grease it no need to even turn the oven on its already burned much darker than golden brown its unfit for public consumption its worse than sodden bread and chemical water its my extra special dessert what truth were you on when you thought i looked good across the table you need a handful of diet pills and i crave a diet of sleeping pills dissolved in sugar water a bedtime kiss ill dream of his dirty fingers drumming drastic measures on my stomach breaking into dissonant chords twisted chords that swell into discordant music fever music fetish soundtrack to what no matter how sweetly i tell it no matter how neatly i spread it in the middle of the night it gets messy my hair entangles my neck lip bends gag me and i spit them out loose hair looseleaf pages loose skirt that displays black panties what color did you think they would be have you been following my trail of clues have you been following the railroad tracks this trail of lost cargo and threatening debris and sexy garbage has to end somewhere maybe this is where he choked on the wailing music he just couldnt bear it anymore he just couldnt keep eating cookie cutouts from a fairy tale edited to fit in an etiquette column he already knew the beanstalks were phone poles the gingerbread boys eyes were just shriveled dehydrated grapes he felt his own eyes sinking he felt deflated he felt impaled this isnt how the fairy tale said it would end so the fairy tale was just another carefully constructed deception this fairy dust was just some cheap hallucinogen once upon a time on acid i turned into an old woman sitting on the ramshackle porch of a crumbling house drinking rancid orange juice from a coffee mug and cackling and screaming stop looking at me then i saw orange the color of the powder janitors use to absorb things im nauseous so i keep trying to tell myself youre only 28 but what of all these cracks in my surface what the hell happened to my face last month i was only 28 last month i took a little vacation and bought myself a red glass venus de milo lamp a symbol of mutilation an icon of art a severed shape to preside over my writing desk i thought sometimes i confused disfigurement with transcendence but what do i know i know my sleeping pills are not the magic ingredient somethings missing some potency is lacking some stupid boy should have used something stronger than aspirin with codeine when weakly curling his fingers around a note blaming me they pumped his stomach and his breath reeked of acid when he tried to kiss me i pushed him away i didnt feel a damn bit sorry for him him and his bad breath and his unstylish sweatshirt and his juvenile charades that made the cops question me i mean what was i supposed to say im strangely drawn to psychos im strangely drawn i like artistic losers and melodramatic freaks as long as they can pull it off with a certain style a certain degree of finesse i like them but i suppose i should try to avoid them since they bring out the worst side of me i know where you sleep but ill try to avoid it ill try not to engage in complicity ill try to control myself ill sleep by myself invest in my metal pinched dreams ill cultivate my own power of suggestion and it will manifest a white possum with red veins it will chase you it will sink its fine teeth into you it will taint your blood until stale stage blood flows through your brain your organs will begin to feel like theyre embalmed already but surgery can fix all that laser surgery will get rid of the imprints and a lobotomy can cure that chemical imbalance and then youll be ready for your implants fluffy pillows saline stained a surgeons scalpel can even dissect the stain film but heres another perspective on plastic my cool whiff container is still filled with dead mice dead flower petals mark certain pages in my dictionary certain words i heard the way he used words once or twice sometimes ten minutes can last forever preserved in the sickly sweetness of formaldehyde preserved newspaper clipping taped into a book of warped collage art shiny cover but inside death and words and blackwinged birds and stalking cats that purr and claw and caterwaul until it spirals down i just want to fall asleep in a fresh bed outside of the crime scene outline im wary of my connection to this image ive created ive exploited this image so much my manipulations are almost effortless almost expected so im almost disposable and i asked for it i asked to lie down on a huge sheet of butcher paper and get traced and filled in the outline of my body with crayons whose colors i renamed i asked to recline and view this murder of crows from a luxurious angle from a critical angle i handcuffed myself to the examination table covered with stiff white paper so my flesh doesnt corrode the metal dangle your implements in front of my face and then sink them away i dont want to look anymore i dont want to think about him anymore the only thing i like about sadness is how it grants me reprieve for my anger but not for long the anger comes back strong until i think im not a poet or artist at all im just some angry girl i just wanted to flirt with his sexual tension all wrapped up in his dark hair i failed to notice the present was wrapped up like a bomb i just wanted to brush his hair and see what happened i just wanted to attract his attention but his attention span was gone or i wasnt attractive enough i wasnt dark enough for him i couldnt hiss and curl around his neck like the serpentine solace of his own tangled strands that sultry hissing tension that ends in a sordid sigh a last exhalation a snap something snaked from his mouth with a succulent hiss a deathly kiss black paint on warped nails turning blue you grew your hair so long after he died my hair is so long it mingles entangles entangles it may be long but its fine when i use my finetoothed comb i see ive been shot with silver gray so i cant be the fake fairy tale heroine anymore ill have to be the witch with a flock of pet crows to do my bidding im talking of murder im talking a searing oven where all the artists will burn like candycoated martyrs in the sweetest sacrifice ill slide out the silver tray of gingerbread poets and ill consume them all ill stash all their words inside my rib cage until i hack them up magic dust potent drugs all nice and cut down maybe i meant to stop with a spoonful but i grabbed a knife by mistake so i took that as a sign to cut out the shape of a candybutton boy to bite off the eyes and let them know the right tone on my tongue that buzzing wailing tone that haircurling tone that excruciating vibration of motorized pinpricks and red beads that tone that wraps around necks like a tight necklace now you tell me you cant breathe now you tell me you cant collect all the beads that they spill onto hollow chocolate floors with the sound of dollhouse bullets do you think im just a doll do you think my eyes snap open and close when my head tilts back why dont you get your dick out of my mouth and focus on my hairdo i want a new wig to hide the ugly roots that twist us up inside the imprint and sharpness of stiletto in my side im unsatisfied im unsettled im insatiable my lips are marooned theyre painted so prettily you want to stick something in fine go ahead and shut me up go ahead and fuck me while i sleep in my dream or in my alternate reality his voice seeps into the room through the cracks and twisted floorboards through the cracks in the veneer through the cracks in my makeup it rises up and slinks around my throat like a black boa feathers float and spike my bare shoulders im freshly showered and drinking freshly squeezed juice in an exotic flavor im naked and wet and my hair is dripping a sweetsmelling trail down my spine spiky black feathers and lovely perfume float all around us until we almost feel like were flying like were angels but then i see all the spiders with mocking demon eyes did he think that rope was dragline silk did he think that gag was a kiss did he think that choking sensation was pure bliss i wish the music in my dreams would wake me up to the truth i wish i could transcend all this fiction and deranged pain but my dream intersects with real life in one way the floating never lasts as long as the sinking

hey there okay im doneembed"
