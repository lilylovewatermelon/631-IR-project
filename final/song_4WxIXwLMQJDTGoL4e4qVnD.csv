goodbye crack of dawn
goodbye harvester
goodbye hello baby
after a long hard day of plowin dirt
goodbye way of life
goodbye pass it down
goodbye up all night of prayin for rain a two year drought
walkin on faith and toughin it out

chorus
hey whats past is past
oh nothin in this world lasts
hey arent those four lanes
fast

verse 2
goodbye gravel road
thanks for the ride
for watchin over me
remember the time i rolled my truck
and you were there when i woke up
you walked me home yeah you lead me home
but

chorus
hey whats past is past
oh nothin in this world lasts
hey arent those four lanes
