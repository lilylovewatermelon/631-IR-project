well ive been out in the cold
frosting up my breath
and i dont mind where ill end up tonight
unless it takes me to my death
the snow keeps falling on my head
ive got snowflakes drifting off my dreads
stay close in the blizard
or keep the vultures in the sky well fed
its all in your head

chorus
you keep saying its all in my head
all the creatures circling my bed
and all your friends are saying why
toes are falling off tonight

verse 2
well ive been out in the cold

and i dont mind where ill end up tonight
unless it takes me to my death
the snow keeps falling on my head
ive got snowflakes drifting off my dreads
stay close in the blizard
or keep the vultures in the sky well fed
its all in your head
