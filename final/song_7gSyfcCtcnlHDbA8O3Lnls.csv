one two now

verse 1 macklemore
those threeplus years i was so proud of
and i threw em all away for two styrofoam cups
the irony everyone will think that he lied to me
made my sobriety so public theres no fuckin privacy
if i dont talk about it then i carry a date
a 081008 that now has been changed
and everyone that put me in some box as a saint
that i never was just a false prophet that never came
and will they think that everything that ive written has all been fake
or will i just take my slip to the grave
uh what the fuck are my parents gonna say
the success story that got his life together and changed
and you know what pain looks like
when you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
deceit on your shoulders deceivingly heavy weight
havent seen tears like this on my girl in a while
the trust that i once builts been betrayed
but id rather live tellin the truth and be judged for my mistakes
than falsely held up given props loved and praised
i guess i gotta get this on the page
feeling sick and helpless lost the compass where self is
i know what i gotta do and i cant help it
one day at a time is what they tell us
now i gotta find a way to tell them uh
god help em yeah
one day at a time is what they tell us
now i gotta find a way to tell them

verse 2 macklemore
and every kid that came up to me
and said i was the music they listened to when they first got clean
now look at me a couple days sober im fightin demons
back of that meeting on the east side shakin tweakin
hope that they dont see it hope that no one is lookin
that no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
just posted in the back with my hands crossed shooken
if they call on me im passin if they talk to me im bookin
out that door but before i can make it
somebody stops me and says are you macklemore
maybe this isnt the place or time i just wanted to say that
if it wasnt for otherside i wouldnt have made it
i just look down at the ground and say thank you
she tells me she has nine months and that shes so grateful
tears in her eyes lookin like shes gonna cry fuck
i barely got fortyeight hours treated like im some wise monk
i wanna tell her i relapsed but i cant
i just shake her hand and tell her congrats
get back to my car and i think im trippin yeah
cause god wrote otherside that pen was in my hand
im just a flawed man man i fucked up
like so many others i just never thought i would
i never thought i would didnt pick up the book
doin it by myself didnt turn out that good
bridge macklemore
if i can be an example of gettin sober
then i can be an example of startin over
if i can be an example of gettin sober
then i can be an example of startin over
