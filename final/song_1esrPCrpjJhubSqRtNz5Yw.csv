unit 300021
is warming makes a hummin sound
when its circuits duplicate emotions
and a sense of coldness detaches
as it tries to comfort your sadness

chorus
one more robot learns to be
something more than a machine
when it tries the way it does
makes it seem like it can love
cause its hard to say whats real
when you know the way you feel
is it wrong to think its love
when it tries the way it does

verse 2
feelin a synthetic kind of love
dreamin a sympathetic wish
as the lights blink faster and brighter

chorus
one more robot learns to be
somethin more than a machine
when it tries the way it does
makes it seem like it can love
cause its hard to say whats real
when you know the way you feel
is it wrong to think its love
when it tries the way it doessee the flaming lips liveget tickets as low as 87you might also like1embed"
