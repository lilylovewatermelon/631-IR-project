verse
you broke that bond now when it come to you my feelings weak
you let your selfish ways come in between our chemistry
why you play with my heart and not show love consistently
i put my life on the line you wouldnt take that risk for me
fucked up my trust wish i could delete all our memories
keep poppin these pills i hope it take away my misery
i got a dead soul i been facing blunts of my enemies
emotions bottled up i dont know whats wrong and its killing me
i cut so many off my heart cold as december be
my mind keep racing i been overthinking i dont get no sleep
you dont understand how hard it was i swear this shit so deep
i made it to the top and they all looked up in disbelief
they hate that im doin better theyd much rather get rid of me
i flex with no regrets cause they aint show me no sympathy
i came a long way but i aint as far as im finna be
i promise ima die a legend ima make sure that you remember me
i used to daydream i pictured everything so vividly
i had a feeling wed be rich since the elementary
my peoples gone got to witness everything they aint get to see
long live maxine i miss your love wish you was here with me
you was a part of me and since you left im incomplete
my lifestyle used to be jump shots and sticking d
life overwhelmed me i said fuck school and hit the streets
i devoted my life to that corner just so i can get a g
fuck a twofour nigga i aint been home and its been a week
we used to break down eightballs wishing we could get a key
was tryna duck that indictment the feds did a sweep
i hope you grippin on your gun when them drillers creep
lil nigga grabbed his first glizzy went on a killing spree
caught him at that red light snoozin he thought this shit was sweet
if he come from that other side we make him rest in peace
im way too solid for the gimmicks fuck the industryyou might also like24embed"
