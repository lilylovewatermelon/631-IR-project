shes a throwaway woah
cant get high no ayy yo ayy

verse
cant get high no more tell me when its over
she wanna take my soul go away ayy
thirty twenty rolls made it off of shows
spend it on some bows control the pace
i dont trust them hoes but i love em though
spend it on her clothes she a throwaway ayy
im not in the mood i cant eat no food
everything i choose stomach throw it away ayy
i miss my old hood i hope they all good
we just grew apart and its okay ayy
hope they try to rob me for my hopes and dreams
im a real reactor and i wont blink uh
she wanna be a factor and thats okay ayy
he wanna be a actor and get no pay ayy
everybody be upset talkin bout my old ways
we just on a different level and its okay ayy
cant get high no more tell me when its over
i wish my po would just go away ayy
she wanna take my soul spend it on her clothes
and ima let the bitch cause its okay ayy
everybody but her trippin on my old ways
im my mothers baby i see your face ayy
westside til the low tatted on my soul
im an austin nigga like stone cold steve ayy

cant get high no more and its o ayy ayy ayy
cant get high no more tell me when its over
she wanna take my soul go away ayyembed"
