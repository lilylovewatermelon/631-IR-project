you think you think youre pretty smart
but i can cause a little pain
she wraps the cord around her arm
tries hard to find the little vein

chorus
oh she lines the pictures in a pretty row
to create the circumstances that the evidence will show
and who will be a witness for the solitary host
if you sleep tonight the visitation of the ghost

verse 2
you think that i dont know your game
a pretty pretty pretty little face
despite every book and every little kiss you took
shell take your place

chorus
oh she lines the pictures in a pretty row
to create the circumstances that the evidence will show
and who will be a witness for the solitary host
if you sleep tonight the visitation of the ghost
