give me a little bit a little bit
just a little bit or a lot

verse
pieces of the dream that i pick up in my mind
is not blind how i fly
every day when i look into your brown eyes
i get high oh how high
pieces of the dream that i pick up in my mind
is not blind how i fly
every day when i look into your brown eyes
i get high i get high
i i get high
look in your brown eyes
i get hiiiigh

outro
higher higher
higher higher
higher higher
higher you make me higher
i fly i fly i fly i fly
i fly i fly i fly
i fly take me there i fly take me there
