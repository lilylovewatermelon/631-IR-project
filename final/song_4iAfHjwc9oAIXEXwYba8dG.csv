dontcha let nobody
try to steal your fun
cause a little touch of lipstick
never hurt no one
the futures got a million roads
for you to choose
but youll walk a little taller
in some highheel shoes
and once you find the style
that makes you feel like you
something fresh
something new
step on out
hear us shout
mama thats your cue

hey tracy hey baby look at me
