he took nobody there with him
and hell take nobody back
he drinks his herbal remedy
and tucks his stomach fat
he wanders up the hallway
just before his show he
sees the newlyweds kiss
eyes the bouquet rose

prechorus 1
hell play the chords and sing
despite despondent mind
come heartache or hangups hes your guy

chorus
wedding singer whatcha gonna do
weddings over wholl go home with you
wedding singer looks like youre not who you think you are

verse 2
he finds the buffet empty
the chickens cold and grey
the dirty chocolate fountain
the halfprice potpourri
he mixes hooch and liquor
and grows his lonely grin hes
a soft soul in decline
hes a frenchman in berlin
see matt maltese liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likeprechorus 2
he whispers to himself
as hes chewing on a bun
ill always be a bridesmaid
and ill never take one home

chorus
wedding singer whatcha gonna do
weddings over wholl go home with you
wedding singer looks like youre not who you think you are

bridge
id like to welcome to the stage mr misery
hes not as bad as he might seem
hes just a bird without a tree
a player without a team
and just like all of us he learns
that lifes adjusting dreams

chorus
wedding singer whatcha gonna do
its all about adjusting your dreams
weddings over wholl go home with you
noone thats my guess
wedding singer looks like youre not who you think you are1embed"
