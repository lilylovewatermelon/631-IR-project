motion blurred dream visions and kindred faces
thoughts  like bursts of youth taking me places
living  the best outcome of myself
‘cause i do remember where i come from

chorus
i’m happy my home found me
by  which force i do not know
i  found my home and it grows by me in beauty

verse 2
i feel air from another planet akin
like  a sense of truth that comes from within
a budding sapling reaching through
giving rise to higher fruit and view

chorus
i’m happy my home found me
by  which force i do not know
i found my home and it grows by me in beauty
i’m happy my home found me
by which force i do not know
i found my home and it grows by me in beautysee men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeembed"
