alexander our older brother
set out for a great adventure
he tore our images out of his pictures
he scratched our names out of all his letters

chorus win butler  régine chassagne

just named you laika

verse 2 win butler
come on alex you can do it
come on alex theres nothing to it
if you want something dont ask for nothing
if you want nothing dont ask for something

chorus win butler  régine chassagne win butler

just named you laika
its for your own good
its for the neighborhood
the neighborhood

verse 3 win butler  régine chassagne
our older brother bit by a vampire
for a year we caught his tears in a cup
and now were gonna make him drink it
come on alex dont die or dry up

when daddy comes home you always start a fight
so the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights
the police disco lights

now the neighbors can dance the police
now the neighbors can dance disco lights
