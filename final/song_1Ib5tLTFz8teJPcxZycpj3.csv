like a stone you watch it fall and let it roll out over the fields
you take your time and watch it crawl like youre the big shot symphony
but oh what would you say if i told you the pitch is wrong with a smile
i took a trip to wonderland gonna get you nowhere by a mile

chorus
i i could light it up for you
i i could light it up for you
we we aint got a shot to lose
put it on but fade it out tell you what you wanna love
acting like your favourite drug raise a cup
we can light it up we can light it up

verse 2
i took a shot and missed the mark well every single day i multiply
a million drums of kerosene baby like a hotel in the sky
i just want to see all the sparks youre trying to hide
lets take a trip to wonderland we can just tune this fire tonight

chorus
i i could light it up for you
i i could light it up for you
we we aint got a shot to lose
put it on but fade it out tell you what you wanna love
acting like your favourite drug raise a cup
we can light it up we can light it up
