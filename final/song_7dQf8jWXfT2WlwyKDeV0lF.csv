im just a little girl walking in the forest
youre smiling wide its not alright
im just a little girl but i stand mighty yeah i stand mighty
i feel the sunrise on my side

prechorus
but i see a tiny space in his eyes
its very tucked away it wont hide
im the heroin inside of the syringe
and im not going in

chorus
and im just a girl
walking through the woods but im mighty
ima climb this mountain
and aint nobody gonna stop me
not even you not even you oh oh
not even you not even you oh oh
i know it is true i know it is true

verse 2
i am just a little girl walking in a forest
got the crystals in the bag in my right hand
vibrations rising so the molecules porous
i can see straight through the trees with the touch of my hand
you might also likebridge
but i am just the molecules there inside
its very far away i wont hide
its now a part of me im not gonna cry
not gonna cry not gonna cry
im gonna climb im gonna climb

verse 3
in this tree cause its a fractal of me
dont try to analyze the breeze
akashic records in your teeth
thats why im surfing over reefs
thats why im sleeping under tepees
with my native culture
my hugs are warm and my words are colder

outro
i am just a little girl walking through the forest
i am just a little girl walking through the forest
i am just a little girl walking through the forest
i am just a little girl
im sitting in the world5embed"
