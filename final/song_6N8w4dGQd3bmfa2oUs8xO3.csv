ill do anything you ask me to
and if you want another kind of love
ill wear a mask for you
if you want a partner
take my hand
or if you want to strike me down in anger
here i stand
im your man

if you want a boxer
i will step into the ring for you
and if you want a doctor
ill examine every inch of you
if you want a driver
climb inside
or if you want to take me for a ride
you know you can
cause im your man

ah the moons too bright
the chains too tight
the beast wont go to sleep
ive been running through these promises to you
that i made and could not keep
ah but a man never got a woman back
not by begging on his knees
or id crawl to you baby
and id fall at your feet
and id howl at your beauty
like a dog in heat
and id claw at your heart
and id tear at your sheet
id say please
cause im your man
you might also likeand if youve got to sleep
a moment on the road
i will steer for you
and if you want to work the street alone
ill disappear for you
and if you want a father for your child
or only want to walk with me a while
across the sand
well im your man

if you want a lover
ill do anything you ask me to
and if you want another kind of love
ill wear a mask for youembed"
