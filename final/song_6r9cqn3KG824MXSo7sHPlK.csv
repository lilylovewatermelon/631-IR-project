been through the wringer a couple times
i came out callous and cruel
and my two friends know this very well
because they went through it too
the three of us were initiates
we had to learn how to deal
and when we spotted a second chance
we had to learn how to steal

prechorus
hollowed out and filled up with hate
all we want is you to give us a break

chorus
were driving fast in my car
weve got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
no were not looking for violence oh ohohoh
tonight we want to have fun

verse 2
no ones the same as they used to be
much as we try to pretend
no ones as innocent as could be
we all fall short we all sin
but now we arent looking backward
we wont try raising the dead
we only see whats in front of us
we only see straight ahead

hollowed out and filled up with hate
all we want is you to give us a break

weve got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun

get in my car and well drive around
well make believe we are free
already proved we can tough it out
and we get along so sweetly
