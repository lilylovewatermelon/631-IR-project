its gon be a bunch of little kids a lot
a bunch of little boys and girls singin this lil part right here
make— make it easy where its somethin like this

chorus
money money all i need all i want yeah
take it from me leave you stank smell the funk you stink
money money all they need all they want yeah uhuh uh
take it from me no you cant no you dont uh uh

verse 1
look nigga money on my mind more than half the time
they put our massa on the money so i mastermind
dont mind the mess i’m a mad scientist rappin rhymes
jid really jimmy neutron mixin a nuclеar bomb
and as they eyes arе watchin god im tryna rise above
poverty philosophies and prophecies arise
follow me for forever never fall too far behind
as i tell my testimonies testaverdes at a time sixteen
uh he was done without a dime
youngest in the family succumb from outta crime
came from east atlanta moreland ave to south deshon
in his path twenty east was probably like the autobahn
better get his autograph he gon have grammys and noms
member he was smokin little grammies in the slums
tryin not to panic couldnt imagine what was done
father time fucked mother earth and had an uncle tom
now them crackers snatchin black cats by they tongue
for the cheese rats creepin on yo tv screen sellin you dreams
granny buyin holy waters off of joel osteen
rubbin it in my brother head say a prayer on her knees
i used to be jealous of jared and patrel ahkim even farad
had the new js and new jeans on its what i wanted at the time
as a preteen pretend im a star
pretty model in a gstring sitting on top the car
with the bottle that she drinkin leavin from out the bar
scheme on the dollar thinkin if anybody is talkin put some green on his head he better be marcus smart
but we never had a thing so hes always in my thoughts
because i ate so many bologna sandwiches as a child
ill kill a nigga if he made one for me right now
ironic that being broke is an expensive lifestyle
no wonder they sellin dope from sun rose to sundown
tryna get mo screamin out the window

money money all i need all i want yeah

money money all they need all they want yeah uhuh uh

verse 2
look nigga money on my mind more than most the time
and most of my grind go to promotin my rhymes a nigga dont blow i shine
i feel like coach prime i throw a bomb if they encroach the line
and dont socialize the goal is to get the most dimes before its the end of yo time aw man
its hard for a nigga to score when they keep on movin the goal line its time to get some money dawg
now he outside the liquor store with a lottery ticket
leavin a double shift at the walmart on gresham road life for me aint been no crystal stair dawg
still tryna keep composure rollin past the gas station where he owe niggas
fuckin with that parlay play and a nigga may spray bout that dough
so a nigga dont play bout no code
back in the day we was told bout reparations get a mule 40 acres or so
justification or repayment for the pain in yo soul
fast forward fuck patience i aint waitin no more
i got to take it paper chasin like im dre or im hov
ye with the clothes
fuck hulk hogan and fuck joe rogan because it flows you know how it goes
need a bitch thats down with opp and down with ipos
feel like odb you hoes better have my pesos
thinkin about them days mama said she had to pray more
cause feedin seven kids plus the mortgage got to pay more
the food from in the fridge from last night is on the table
yall sit down and say yall grace because we ate so many bologna sandwiches as a child
id kill for one of them shits if i could have one right now
ironic im havin dope but dont promote the lifestyle
just want my people to grow lets make a toast to right now get some money
say it with me loud now
chorus
money money all i need all i want yeah
take it from me leave you stank smell the funk you stink
money money all they need all they want yeah uhuh uh
take it from me no you cant no you dont uh uh5embed"
