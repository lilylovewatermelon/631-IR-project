you heard my voice
i came out of the woods by choice
shelter also gave their shade
but in the dark i have no name

verse 2
so leave that click in my head
and i will remember the words that you said
left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
but i was sure we could see a new start

prechorus
so when your hopes on fire
but you know your desire
dont hold a glass over the flame
dont let your heart grow cold
i will call you by name
i will share your road

chorus
but hold me fast hold me fast
cause im a hopeless wanderer
and hold me fast hold me fast
cause im a hopeless wanderer

i wrestled long with my youth
we tried so hard to live in the truth
but do not tell me all is fine
when i lose my head i lose my spine

verse 4
so leave that click in my head
and i wont remember the words that you said
you brought me out from the cold
now how i long how i long to grow old

prechorus
so when your hopes on fire
but you know your desire
dont hold a glass over the flame
dont let your heart grow cold
i will call you by name
i will share your road

chorus
but hold me fast hold me fast
cause im a hopeless wanderer
and hold me fast hold me fast
cause im a hopeless wanderer

and i will learn i will learn

to love the skies im under
the skies im under19embed"
