i’ve never been a “cool hand luke”
the quarterback of the winning team
or the guy with the right kinda punchlines
everybody wants to be
i never was that lucky ol cuss with a straight flush in his hand
oh but with you i am

verse 2
i ain’t no patrick swayze my old boots never danced on air
never walked with a swag looking sharp as a tack
lit up like times square
who’s that guy with a big old smile as wide as the rio grande
oh with you i am

chorus
strong as an oak soft like leather
high as a pine and light as a feather
the same ol boy but a whole lot better
whenever you’re holding my hand
i used to poke fun at them punchdrunk lovers
i never thought i’d be that man
oh but with you i am
oh baby with you i am

verse 3
i’ve always been a “do it my way” drifter
another highway another town
never thought bout that little white house
with a porch all the way around
yeah i never saw me on a swing talking sweet talking dreams
but i’ll be damned
with you i am

strong as an oak soft like leather
high as a pine and light as a feather
the same ol boy but a whole lot better
whenever you’re holding my hand
i used to poke fun at them punchdrunk lovers
i never thought i’d be that man
oh baby with you i am

chorus
strong as an oak soft like leather
high as a pine and light as a feather
the same ol boy but a whole lot better
whenever you’re holding my hand
i used to poke fun at them punchdrunk lovers
i never thought i’d be that man
oh baby with you i am
oh baby with you i am
with you i amembed"
