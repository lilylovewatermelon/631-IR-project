i feel bad inside knowing this is all built on lies
i feel like an awful person
cause end of the day were forcing love
that dont exist

chorus
this is so unrighteous
this is so not like us
love at first sight
that was gone by the end of the night
we both know that this is going to end
its only time and touch we spend
no chance were going to make it
but baby can we fake it
cause even though i know youre not the one
this has really been a lot of fun mmm

verse 2
i know i dont really like you
but i still choose to stay
i know you dont really care this is just a phase
but you still play the part so well

chorus
this is so unrighteous
this is so not like us
love at first sight
that was gone by the end of the night
we both know that this is going to end
its only time and touch we spend
no chance were going to make it
but baby can we fake it
cause even though i know youre not the one
this has really been a lot of fun mmm
this is so unrighteous
