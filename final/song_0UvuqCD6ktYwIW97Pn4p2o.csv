dreams of earthquakes
dreams of hurricanes
dreams of pouring rain
dreams of tidal waves to wash us all away
dreams of guns blazed
dreams of fire rage
dreams of swollen graves
dreams of hollow pain
all gone

prechorus
no more fallen
no more enemy
no more casualty
no more dream

chorus
fall into sleep
fall into me
i have a dream
but nobody cares
nobody wants to listen
fall into sleep
fall into me
hang onto a dream
that nobody wants
nobody cares anymore

dreams of mourning grief
dreams of disbelief
dreams of tragedy
dreams of our disease to take us all away
dreams of fidelity
dreams of inner peace
dreams of loyalty
dreams of unity
all gone
all gone

chorus
fall into sleep
fall into me
i have a dream
but nobody cares
nobody wants to listen
fall into sleep
fall into me
hang onto a dream
that nobody wants
nobody cares anymore

bridge
the angels are injured
fall with broken burning wings
are we dead inside
are we blind
we cant keep moving forward
backwards with closed eyes
were losing sight
all lost inside
prechorus
no more fallen
no more enemy

chorus
fall into sleep
fall into me
i have a dream
but nobody cares
nobody wants to listen
fall into sleep
fall into me
hang onto a dream
that nobody wants
nobody cares
nobody wants
nobody cares anymore

outro
all gone
all gone
all gone
all gone3embed"
