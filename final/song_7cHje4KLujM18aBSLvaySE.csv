verse 1
know just how to make me miss ya
when im feelin sentimental
goin in our separate ways
but wind up back here in the middle
losin you i couldnt face
but to love you is worse
waitin for you just in case
one day it doesnt hurt nah nah nah

prechorus
said its the last time but nah nah nah nah
just like the last time yeah nah nah nah nah
tired of building up my walls yeah
just to watch them fall again

chorus
so fuck this love callin my name
get out of my veins
if you need your space then just walk away
you know how to fuck me up then make it okay
i guess thats just your game
and im the one who gets played
again and again and again and again
