oh ohohoh ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh
oh ohohoh ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh

verse 1
id fallen through the floor again crashed into the basement
the pain was swallowing me
i was like a lead balloon i couldnt even get up to turn the lights on
the dark is swallowing me

prechorus
lord knows you cant trust your head
when youre standing on the edge of breaking down
lord knows you cant trust your head
when youre hanging by a thread
i was breaking down and i saw

chorus
only two footprints in the sand
thought youd abandoned me and let go of my hand
but you were carrying me carrying me to safety
two footprints your footprints in the sand
two footprints two footprints your footprints in the sand
two footprints your footprints in the sand

verse 2
oh i forgot the things i knew it was i whod abandoned you
forgive me i was lost in doubt
you had never left my side picked me up when i thought i would die
you held me and i was found

lord knows you cant trust your head
when youre standing on the edge of breaking down
lord knows you cant trust your head
when youre hanging by a thread
and im breaking down

chorus
only two footprints in the sand
thought youd abandoned me and let go of my hand
but you were carrying me carrying me to safety
two footprints your footprints in the sand
only two footprints in the sand
thought youd abandoned me and let go of my hand
but you were carrying me carrying me to safety
two footprints your footprints in the sand
two footprints two footprints your footprints in the sand
two footprints your footprints in the sand5embed"
