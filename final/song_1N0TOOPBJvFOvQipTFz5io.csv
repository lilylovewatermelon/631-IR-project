rex made the beat so you know i gotta murder it
they act all tough but in person they be murmuring
and mumbling pull a gun out they get to stumbling tumbling
and the chopper get to thundering
shitting on all these haters like where the plunger at
im excited cause now i can throw a party and all the people that hated on me wont be invited
true religion on me like the buddha indian style im enlightened
i rеmember up in kindergartеn the teacher told me i wouldnt be shit
and then she saw me play the piano and made all the other kids sea sick
even though i got a couple demons im still screaming out thank jesus
upside down pyramid on me just to compliment the jesus pieces
i was a fan of yugioh thats why i pull cards on these stupid hoes
got a arrow not a bullet cupid ho ha yeah
i pop percs to numb all the pain cause it hurt to live
i gotta take everything cause sometimes it hurt to give
i make money even though sometimes it dont make sense
speaking of taking everything its time to take shits on every single person that said i wouldnt do it
every single person that said i was stupid
every single person that said i was that netflix special whats the name of the show ah clueless
but no i aint clueless i got this
im on top so now nobody can top this
now its time to change the topic
i got a way with words like im running with a phonics book
in school i didnt do the homework but i still got the subjects
money aint the object money is the objective gotta admit that
im successful but i feel like my head sometimes a little dreadful
i grew up on rock rap heavy metal
now im ridin bikes pedal to the metal
i dont even gotta pedal its a throttle so excuse me
these niggas faker than some optical illusions
i be looking like what the fuck is you doing
you aint getting money you aint changing shit you aint changing the world you just stupid
talkin bout you crackin cards selling drugs killing niggas and going hard
watch a real nigga come up in your car now you lookin all scared
finna piss yourself shit yourself you gotta admit yourself you need some help
i gotta admit myself im on these drugs feel like i cant save myself
sometimes i wanna take myself and break myself so i can reshape myself huh
nobody ever felt the pain i felt so i share it
put it out to the whole world i aint embarrassed
bunch of these niggas is my sons
i apologize to em cause i been a bad parent
dont try me cause im not the one see i wont even count to twoyou might also like14embed"
