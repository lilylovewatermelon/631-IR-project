state champs white and blue
yeah i remember you
you sure had a hell of a view
from way up there
high above the yellow pines and the
first baptist jesus saves sign
i talked to you a million times
bout gettin outta here

chorus
water tower it sure is good to see you
ive been away for way too long
water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
you help me find my way back home

verse 2
how far did you think id get
when i pointed my wheels out west
a little young and dumb i guess
gotta learn somehow
slowin down and drivin in
i can finally breathe again
its like i found a long lost friend
god ive missed this town

water tower it sure is good to see you
ive been away way too long
water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
you help me find my way back home

bridge
you and that lonesome full moon watching over me
im right where im supposed to be

chorus
water tower it sure is good to see you
ive been away way too long
water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
you help me find my way back home

you help me find my way2embed"
