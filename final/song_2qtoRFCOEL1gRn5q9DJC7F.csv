ayy so now im

verse andré 3000
so low that i can see under the skirt of an ant
so low that i dont get high no more
when i geronimo i just go heh
solo my cup is a rojo my cholo my friend
so low that i can admit
when i hear that another kid is shot by the popo
it aint an event no more
so low that no more high horses so hard to wear polo
when i do i cut the pony off
now theres a hole where there once was a logo how fitting
so low that i can give a fuck about what is trending
tryna cut down on my spending
regardless of winning instead of pretending
and bending over backwards
over half of these hoes had work done
sayin they want something real from a man
just saying it we being real persons
i hate that its like this i feel for you ant
i dont know what its like with a skirt on
so pardon me if i am being insensitive
but darling this only worsens
so low my halo stay way low it feels like its bent
so low that when they throw pussy or pesos
dont pay no attention to it
so low that i am no rookie but feel like a kid
lookin at the other kids
with astonishment while im on punishment
watchin the summer come close to an end
after twenty years in im so naive i was under the im—
pression that everyone wrote they own verses
its comin back different and yeah that shit hurts me
im hummin and whistlin to those not deserving
ive stumbled and lived every word was i working just way too hardyou might also like115embed"
