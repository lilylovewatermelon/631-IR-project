it glistens it glistens
theres nowhere left to go now
if you teach me ill listen
a favorite time for mistakes
in salt lakes we all shake
consider me your apprentice
repentant yet hesitant

please show me a sign

come inside kneel
remember who built your home
i built you flesh and bone

this image comes from somewhere
who is it spiritual visit
coincidence is one thing
overwhelming immaculate timing
everything we had is gone
something new must come up strong now
i feel that i belong
and i trust you and i love you

please show me a sign

remember what you hear
and ill be still right here
come inside kneel
remember who built your home
i built you flesh and bone

and im torn between halos demons
all these words with cryptic meanings
separate seasons
all these issues and mixed up feelings
and i have to choose
and i have to choose
and i have to choose

everything we had is gone
something new must come up strong now
i feel that i belong
and i trust you and i love you

please show me a sign

come inside kneel
remember what you hear
and ill be still right here
come inside kneel
remember who built your home
i built you flesh and bone
come inside look around
ill lift off the ground
i snapped your ribs made a lover
so you could share each other
come inside kneel
remember
