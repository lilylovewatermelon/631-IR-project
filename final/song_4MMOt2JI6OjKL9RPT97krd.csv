on my roof
dark and im burning a rose
i dont need proof
im torn apart and you know
what you did to me was a crime
cold case love
and i let you reach me one more time
but thats enough

prechorus
your love was breaking the law
but i needed a witness ohoh oh
so wake me up when its over
it dont make any difference ohoh oh
will it ever be solved
or am i taking the fall
truth was there all along
tell me how did we miss it

chorus
we opened up a cold case love
and it got the best of us
and now prints pictures and white outlines
are all thats left at the scene of a crime
of a cold case love
you might also likeverse 2
shouldve investigated
but love blinded eyes couldnt see no
and then i tried to cage it
but your love aint the kind that you can keep
release me now cause i did my time
of this cold case love
my hearts no longer cold and confined
ive had enough

prechorus
your love was breaking the law
but i needed a witness ohoh oh
so wake me up when its over
it dont make any difference ohoh oh
will it ever be solved
or am i taking the fall
truth was there all along
tell me how did we miss it

chorus
we opened up a cold case love
and it got the best of us
and now prints pictures and white outlines
are all thats left at the scene of a crime
of a cold case love  oh oh ohoh
bridge
we lost our way
took this too far
now ill never find the pieces of my heart
weve lost enough looking for a truth
that was here all along no

chorus
a cold case love
and it got the best of us
and now prints pictures and white outlines
are all thats left at the scene of a crime
of a cold case love
we opened up a cold case love
and it got the best of us
and now prints pictures and white outlines
are all thats left at the scene of a crime
of a cold case love
