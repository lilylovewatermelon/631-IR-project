uh i thank the lord im not a broke nigga i’m dope nigga
change my name i aint like average joe nigga
up above wit my above average ho nigga
tight frame with a tight cameltoe nigga
i got killers on the front line you on the sideline
follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
killas on the inside and on your blindside
shoot you right between your motherfuckin’ eyebrows
ooh kill em—its that carter v let me get em
im feeling like john gotti lennon
and you gon respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
you got money on your mind and we aimin at your temple
check me out or just be quiet in the library nigga
or the flowers on your grave gon be dyin’ every winter
and as long as i’m alive im a financial wizard
long as i can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
thank the lord i’m not a broke nigga

chorus snoop dogg
i get money im a hustler
so if you buyin what im sellin’ you a customer
see i can get it to you anywhere anything
but its pointblank range when the pistol bang
i mix it up i fix it up and i switched it up
i locked down this end and got it twisted up
see im a dog but i loc with my locs
they say you are what you smoke
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likerefrain lil wayne
i grew up around dope niggas
uh uh uh dope niggas
i grew up around dope niggas

verse 2 lil wayne
yeah i grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
and most niggas was both nigga two sport niggas
i was no different from those niggas but i was chose nigga
see those niggas saw more in me than these hoes nigga
momma was a gogetter a coach nigga
taught me everything i know nigga a soul sister
taught me how to be a goal tender support system
for that bitch who played her role with ya and those children
i aint lyin slime all my niggas balling its a fuckin team sport
i could change the world but i done lost the remote
all my niggas balling thats how its supposed to be ho
i could change the world id rather change to beast mode
coke sniffers and dope stickers
and most niggas was both nigga explode nigga
pop a motherfuckin cork nigga to those niggas
cause lifes too fuckin short nigga—get old nigga
i aint lyin got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
be a role player role model while you roll with em
they say you dont need to be with us stay on the road nigga
that way i wouldnt come to the end of the road with em
man all my niggas targets thats includin me ho
i could change the world id rather change the people
and definitions cause were defined by our legal roles
all your haters fuelin and my needle broke
lord i aint a broke nigga
refrain lil wayne
i thank the lord i aint a broke nigga
i thank the lord i aint a broke nigga

chorus snoop dogg  lil wayne
i get money im a hustler
so if you buyin what im sellin you a customer
see i can get it to you anywhere anything
but its pointblank range when the pistol bang
i thank the lord i aint a broke nigga
i mix it up i fix it up and i switched it up
i locked down this end and got it twisted up
see im a dog but i loc with my locs
