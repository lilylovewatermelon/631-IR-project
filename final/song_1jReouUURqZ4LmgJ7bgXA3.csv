verse
hold up i got a lil more in me fore you say im finished
before you judge me take a minute go to the beginning
when we was grinding i was minding my own fucking business
now all these niggas think its straight to go state they opinion
kicked out the house bitch i was grinding savin every penny
kicked out the house i had my own house that same december
aint do no hatin i was waiting patiently to get it
used to let my cousin use the kitchen cook a half a chicken
thats a half a block he cut a thousand rocks in thirty minutes
now that im straight its like they hate to see a nigga winnin
i just did xxl me and my nigga jigga
didnt want to do it but i did it had to rep the city
go ask the city who the best that ever fuckin did it
and when you ask em try to ask em for to be realistic
now that im up they try they hardest just to break a nigga
say what you want but on my soul i aint changing nigga
cant shake the hood cause hollywood nothin like where im from
still love the hood but they hate it when that cheddar come
rod crashed the vette but he came back in a better one
