ayy zeuz

verse
i see your spirit comin through your shirt
with the slightest touch i make you squirt
every time you hurtin i can tell it
you beautiful with no cosmetics
baby spread your legs so i can surf
if i cheat on you then im a jerk
i hope this time we make it work
ill try to make it last this time and always put you first
go to school to be a nurse
anything you tryna do im rockin
your body like my vert
you got more curves than the projects
ooh child ooh child ooh child
you got me feelin like a baby
she from the rough but educated
that dress on you look painted
our memories last so long every time you gone i still can taste it
im picturin you naked
vivid imagination social media validation
me and bae aint never chasin
ooh child ooh child ooh child
many i have felt before but ima save that girl
cant wait til im off probation we gon travel the world
pray to god he bless this love and he got all of our steps
if i aint never went through that phone id probably still be with my ex
you know the ceiling best dont make me feel like a junkie
dont make me feel basic you worth way more than my money
know youre not tryna use me and abuse me
youre the only girl i can chill with and watch movies with
and bae you make me laugh
everybody else want my all but they just give me half
you might also likeoutro
and im just sayin like
just tellin you i love you isnt enough my love
ooh child ooh child ooh child
ima keep that baby
ktb girl trust
kodak the boss off top dont never forget itembed"
