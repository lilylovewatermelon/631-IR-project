well i know my way
round a six string flat top
hand one over
i can play whatever song you wanna hear
hand me a bottle
and ill go full throttle til that sun comes up
and the stars hanging in the sky just disappear
but i need help when it comes to you
i dont know what i got into

chorus
you love like a wildfire
light me up like a live wire
but i cant get enough
you kiss like a hurricane
off the tracks like a runaway train
but i think ill try my luck
but ill roll the dice and play my hand
oh i might lose it
girl i like the way youre more than i know what to do with

verse 2
what is the deal cuss and lie
when it comes to a girl like you
you gotta wait too much
let loose and sometimes i cant believe my eyes
the way you move and the way you dance
im like sand running through your hands
i dont know how long i got but im gonna take my chance

you love like a wildfire
light me up like a live wire
but i cant get enough
you kiss like a hurricane
off the tracks like a runaway train
but i think ill try my luck
but ill roll the dice and play my hand
oh i might lose it
girl i like the way youre more than i know what to do with

chorus
you love like a wildfire
light me up like a live wire
but i cant get enough
you kiss like a hurricane
off the tracks like a runaway train
but i think ill try my luck
but ill roll the dice and play my hand
