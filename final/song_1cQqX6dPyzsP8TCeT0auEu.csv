well youve got the perfect disguise and youre looking okay
from the bottom of the best of the worst well what can i say

chorus
cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
and i dont give a damn about you or this town no more
no but i know the score

verse 2
need me to fall down so you can climb up
some foolass ladder well good luck
i hope i hope theres something better up there

chorus
cause you cocked your head to shoot me down
and i dont give a damn about you or this town no more
no cause i know the score
