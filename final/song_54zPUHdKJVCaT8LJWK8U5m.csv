dont even know my schedule levels reachin several
rose petals deliver make you feel special
they thought the money shouldve changed it
slides still blue why the world keep tryin to paint it
when the life around you changes try to keep your sameness
try to keep your brain maintainin through the lameness lameness

chorus
sometimes i just wanna go
back to blue slide park the only place i call home home
i hope its never all gone gone dont think its ever all gone gone
sometimes i just wanna go
back to blue slide park the only place i call home home
i hope its never gone forever long forever longyou might also like7embed"
