i used to care so much about what others think about
i almost didnt have a thought of my own
the slightest remark would make me embark on a journey of self doubt
but that was a while ago
this girl has got stronger
and if i knew then what i know now
i wouldve told myself dont worry any longer
its okay

chorus
cause a face without freckles is like a sky without the stars
why waste a second not loving who you are
those little imperfections make you beautiful lovable valuable
they show your personality inside your heart
reflecting who you are

postchorus
who you are who you are who you are
oh yeah yeah uh

verse 2
i wondered if i could trade my body with somebody else in magazines
would the whole world fall at my feet
i felt unworthy and would blame my failures on the ugliness i could see
when the mirror looked at me sometimes i feel
sometimes i still feel like that little girl who doesnt belong in her own world
but im get it better by reminding myself yeah
