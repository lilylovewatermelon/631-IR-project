i asked you a question
i feel a rise burning in the back of my head
if she could kill me with a look id already be dead
excited at the thought of possibly two in my bed
i said some shit that i instantly regretted i said
i hid my deception with absolute discretion
wanted to turn around and give up an accidental confession
i turned to look at her and shes just standin there
facial expression says it all war has been declared

verse
she said is there anything you wanna tell me
im standin there with my head down and im thinkin
oh no here we go
what the hell was i thinkin man i wish i was drinkin
so i could blame it on the liquor why did i paint the picture
why did i think it was something that she would even consider
now im avoidin eye contact as if i owe her money
tryna laugh it off clearly she dont think its funny

chorus
and then she stepped to me comin so steady
looked at me like she knew already
i betrayed her trust it weighs heavy
on my head and then she said
why cant i be loved
why cant i feel love
why am i not worthy of
oh why cant i feel love
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeoutro
all she wanted was somethin real somethin true
with tears in her eyes she said i believed in you
i said please dont leave please dont go away
she said you broke my heart how could i stay
itd be a year before id see integrity again
over there they said hes over there
i see him there he is
neyo is this dude what are you doing
bruh dont you know you got a show in 10 minutes from now
you drinking before what is you doing
relax im not drunk guess who i ran into today4embed"
