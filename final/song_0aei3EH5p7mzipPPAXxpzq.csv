for once in my life ive got someone who needs me
someone ive needed so long
for once unafraid i can go where life leads me
and somehow i know ill be strong
for once i can touch what my heart used to dream of
long before i knew someone warm like you
could make my dreams come true

verse 2
for once in my life i wont let sorrow hurt me
not like its hurt me before
for once i have someone i know wont desert me
im not alone anymore
for once i can say this is mine you cant take it
long as i know ive got love i can make it
for once in my life ive got someone who needs me

outro
at least for once i can say this is mine you cant take it
long as i know ive got love i can make it
for once in my life ive got someone
for once in my life i found someone
for once in my life ive got someone who needs meyou might also likeembed"
