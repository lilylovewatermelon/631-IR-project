pack yourself a toothbrush dear
pack yourself a favorite blouse
take a withdrawal slip take all of your savings out
cause if we dont leave this town
we might never make it out
i was not born to drown baby come on

verse 1
forget what father brennan said
we were not born in sin
leave a note on your bed
let your mother know youre safe
and by the time she wakes
well have driven through the state
well have driven through the night
baby come on

chorus
if the sun dont shine on me today
and if the subways flood and bridges break
will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
or will you rail against your dying day

verse 2
and when we looked outside couldnt even see the sky
how do you pay the rent is it your parents
or is it hard work dear
holding the atmosphere
i dont wanna live like that
you might also likechorus
if the sun dont shine on me today
if the subways flood and the bridges break

bridge
jesus christ cant save me tonight
put on your dress yes wear something nice
decide on me yeah decide on us
oh oh oh illinois illinois

outro
pack yourself a toothbrush dear
pack yourself a favorite blouse
take a withdrawal slip take all of your savings out
cause if we dont leave this town
we might never make it out28embed"
