alright

verse 1
im gonna wear my flipflops and
im gonna play some flipcup and
rock a little bit of hiphop and haggard and jagger
and throw a 20 on the corn hole game
album version if im lucky yeah i might get laid
single version if im lucky yeah i might get paid
the way that its goin the keg gon be floatin

chorus
album versionall i wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
single version all i wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and stay home
work a little less play a little more
thats what this day is for
and all i wanna do is lace my js and lace some jack in my coke
work on my laid back aint nothin wrong
with gettin my sun daze on
gettin my sun daze on

verse 2
girl you know youre the life of my party
you can stay and keep sippin bacardi
stir it up as we turn on some marley
if you want you can pet on my harley
i sit you up on a kitchen sink
stick the pink umbrella in your drink
the way that were feelin we gone by this evenin
