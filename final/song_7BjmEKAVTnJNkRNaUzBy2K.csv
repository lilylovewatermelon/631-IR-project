you see that mountain over there yeah
well one of these days im going to climb that mountain

chorus
oh play me some mountain music
like grandma and grandpa used to play
then ill float on down the river
to a cajun hideaway

verse
drift away like tom sawyer ride a raft with old huck finn
take a nap like rip van winkle daze dreaming again

chorus
oh play me some mountain music
like grandma and grandpa used to play
then ill float on down the river
to a cajun hideaway

verse 2
swim across the river just to prove that im a man
spend the day being lazy just being natures friend
climb a long tall hickory bend it over skinning cats
playing baseball with chert rocks using sawmill slabs for bats
see alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
play some backhome comeon music
that comes from the heart
play something with lots of feeling
because thats where music has to start

chorus
oh play me some mountain music
like grandma and grandpa used to play
then ill float on down the river
to a cajun hideaway

outro
oh play me mountain music
oh play me mountain music
oh play me mountain music
oh play me mountain musicembed"
