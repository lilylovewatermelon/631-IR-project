verse 1

i aint mean to say that shit girl i was goddamn high
so we left the crib now we in the goddamn ride

i wanted a bitch who was down to earth
but she want the goddamn sky

chorus

got this one on my line that wont stop fuckin callin
its crazy i made her that way
every time i see her out i see the hate in her face
like why you do that
tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
why you do why you do that
tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
