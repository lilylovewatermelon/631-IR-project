if we can stop fighting each other
long enough for us to see that see that see that
that we are stronger together than separate babe
you gotta believe that lieve that lieve that
but you love me today dont want me around tomorrow
every time you change your mind
i follow caught up all up in your maze and im so dizzy babe
cant keep going back and forth on these waves
im getting sea sick sea sick sea sick

prechorus melody thornton
like the way we were before and i wanna know
if we can go back to the days when we was close
sometimes i think im so low
think you dont want me no more
and ive gotta get up off this seesaw
were like an elevator

chorus nicole scherzinger  darkchild
we go up and we go down down down
like an elevator
we touch the sky then touch the ground ground ground
like an elevator
youre stuck on one while im pressing three
then we end up on the fourth floor
and then we disagree
then you keep on blamin me
but i wish that you would see that
im just tryna elevate you
like an elevator

take you higher tttake you higher
that im just tryna elevate you
like an elevator
take you higher tttake you higher
that im just tryna elevate you
like an elevator

verse 2 nicole scherzinger
and i feel like were speaking two different languages
its hard to read ya read ya read ya
but i know if you at least try to make it half way
i swear that ill meet ya meet ya meet ya
but we cant have a conversation without beefing
yellin back and forth for no good reason
i wont let you leave and you keep asking me to stay
one of us better figure out what we want
cause im getting a headache headache headache
