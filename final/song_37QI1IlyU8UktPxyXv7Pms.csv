she know i been to hell and through i need what reverends do
power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
i gotta shine boy i be a star on fire thats a meteor
so im either or on tv with a rita ora set your dvr
stacking money face to face what that mean cpr
everyday the day date gangbang major pain
dtown i ride around me and my dog like charlie brown
just trying to get that white money you know countin cake and kks
on a day to day base then vacay for eight days

put palm trees up in my house and have a staycation
getting paid while im chilling thats a paidcation
full glass of champagne oh no you cant taste it

chorus

interlude big sean

verse 3  big sean
all i care bouts my crew my family and women
except these women that’s hoing and these hoes that be stealing
trying to get them a cut that’s how you end up with stitches
i tell a bitch quit playing and play ya position
either move or get devoured fuck a coward
i be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
if i rocked eddie bauer but i dont
aura gold everything i do i do it overboard michael phelps splash
smile for the polaroid selfemployed
now you shelf employed dboy
never sold but i still got more lines than corduroy
and im with the same crew til im an old man
cause there no such thing as new old friends
