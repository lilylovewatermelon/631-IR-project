hey man dont look so scared
you know im only testing you out
hey man dont look so angry
youre real close to figuring me out
we are a part of a circle its like a mobius strip
and it goes round and round until it loses a link

chorus
and theres a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain oh oh
and shit is gonna fly once again

verse 2
hey man we look at each other with ample eyes
and why not some time to discover whats behind your eyes
and ive got so many questions that i want to ask you
i am so tired of mirrors  pour me a glass of your wine

chorus
and theres a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain oh oh
and shit is gonna fly once again

bridge
ive got a bunch of government cheques at my door
each morning i try to send them back but they only send me more
i look at myself in the mirror
am i vital today
hey man i let my conscience get in the way

and theres a shadow in the sky but it looks like rain oh oh
and shit is gonna fly once again oh
and i dont mean to rain on your parade
but pathos has got me once again oh
