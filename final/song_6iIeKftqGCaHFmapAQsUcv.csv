fake your way through a conversation
tell her all the things you wish were true
maybe youre the voice of a generation
and a princess somewhere waits for you

prechorus
but if youre never gonna change the world
if youre never gonna be a movie star
if youre never gonna change the world
maybe youre looking too hard

chorus
dont synthesizer her
dont redesign her
shes no prize for
a synthesizer

verse 2
pretend you meet your own expectations
add another name below your list
maybe youre the next world wide sensation
you probably know a thousand ones like this

prechorus
but if youre never gonna change the world
if youre never gonna be a movie star
if youre never gonna change the world
maybe youre looking too hard
