im not the hero who will always save the day
dont always wear the white hat dont always know the way
i may not even be the dream you wanted to come true
but ill always be the man in love with you

verse 2
im not the key that opens every door
i dont have the power to give you all you want and more
but when youre needing something special you can hold on to
ill always be the man in love with you

verse 3
i never could work miracles
there may be others who can do what i cant do
but no one else can be as good as me at loving you

verse 4
so when the world wont turn the way you wish it would
and the dreams you have dont come alive as often as they should
remember that theres someone there whose heart is always true
ill always be the man in love with you

outro
remember that theres someone there whose heart is always true
someone there to help you make it through
ill always be the man in love with yousee george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likeembed"
