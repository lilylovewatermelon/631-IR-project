i want to make money to take away my problems
but my problems get bigger with the more money i make
i want to find love but thats my problem
because the money makes it hard to tell the real from fake
i wanna spend time with my son oh every hour
but the money and the problems and the women keep me away
i want to be happy for just one hour
but the only time im happy anymore is on the stage

i get drunk in the morning i dont look for afternoons
i dont care if tomorrow never comes
ive been pushed and kicked around it seems my whole life
and now im tired lord im so damn tired inside

so lets rock it with the band turn this shit up to ten now
i got a feeling youve been waiting for way too long now
and if youre looking for a party you came to the right spot
so drink them down motherfuckers and roll with the kid rock
and the band plays

chorus
and i thank you people for feeling me im feeling you too
oh what a ride its been
up and down all around the world
weve been were back youre here
lets make the most of our time now
and if you get up i wont let you down

i got a fifth of good music if youre holding out pour more

verse 3
and i thank you people for feeling me im feeling you too

and if you get up i wont let you down
