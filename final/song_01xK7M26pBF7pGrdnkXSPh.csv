i spent all of christmas eve fake angry at you for
who knows what now or then
and you spoke so fast i just sat back
relaxed and took you all in

verse 1
i spent all of christmas eve trying to get warmer
after standing outside for hours
knowing at this point id be
lucky to get any sleep
and ill toss and turn until the early morning
happily ignoring
that my blue jeans didnt do
a fuckin thing for me against this cold
sober or not i locked everything you sent me
cause whats better than seeing
what im missing daily
i guess what im trying to say is that

chorus
you might run oh but
i wont hide shed an
ounce of light on my half
hopeless life
dont let me go back
you might also likeverse 2
and though id like to say more
i guess ill just duck and cover
almost praying that you trip over
the cluster of words i laid out before having to leave
but since youve taken the time to read so carefully
everything ive ever sent
i guess ill spend the next few lines hoping and wishing
yet thanking appropriately

chorus
you might run oh but
i wont hide shed an
ounce of light on my half
hopeless life
you might run oh but
i wont hide shed an
ounce of light on my half
hopeless life

outro
to erin

cause i dont think i have the heart

to erin
you might run oh but
please read later
i wont hide shed an
cause i dont think i have the heart
ounce of light on my half
to let you read this now
hopeless life
but if i had the heart oh
you might run oh but
you know that i know better
i wont hide shed an
this isnt how you say aloud
ounce of light on my half
oh say aloud
