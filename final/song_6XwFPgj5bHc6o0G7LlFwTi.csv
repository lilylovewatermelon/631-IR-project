believe when you lie
you will never need to recognize yourself
to deceive
to remove all chance of doubt and be received
with your lie
the deception is complete when you concede
and decide
to reject your lives sacrificed to me

prechorus
penance cant absolve your sin
into me penance cant absolve your sin

chorus
all your belief cannot absolve your sin
all your belief cannot absolve your sin

verse 2
believe when you lie
you will never need to recognize
the source of deceit
to renew your faith in god
you must believe in your lie
the redemption is complete
when you conceive and decline
to release your lives sacrificed to me

reap your life like you want to
recognize all youve come to
reap your life like you want to
recognize all youve come to

reap your life veiled in shadow
recognize faces of the crucified
i can hear their screams tonight
ever haunting me

burn your lie

into me penance cant absolve your sin
into me penance cant absolve your sin
