verse 1 tom delonge  mark hoppus
i got no regret right now im feelin this
the air is so cold and null im feelin this
let me go in her room im feelin this
i wanna take off her clothes im feelin this
show me the way to bed im feelin this
show me the way you move im feelin this
fuck it its such a blur im feelin this
i love all the things you do im feelin this

chorus mark hoppus
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna

verse 2 tom delonge  mark hoppus
where do we go from here
turn all the lights down now
smiling from ear to ear im feelin this
our breathings got too loud im feelin this
show me the bedroom floor im feelin this
show me the bathroom mirror im feelin this
were taking this way too slow im feelin this
take me away from here im feelin this

bridge mark hoppus
this place was never the same again after you came and went
how could you say you meant anything
different to anyone standing alone on the
street with a cigarette on the first night we met
look to the past and remember and smile
and maybe tonight i can breathe for a while
im not in this scene i think im falling asleep
but then all that it means is ill always be dreaming of you

chorus mark hoppus tom delonge both
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer so lost and disillusioned
place your hand in mine
ill leave when i wanna so lost and disillusioned
fate fell short this time are we alone do you feel it
your smile fades in the summer so lost and disillusioned
place your hand in mine are we alone do you feel it
ill leave when i wanna so lost and disillusioned
fate fell short this time are we alone do you feel it
your smile fades in the summer so lost and disillusioned
place your hand in mine are we alone do you feel it
ill leave when i wanna so lost and disillusioned20embed"
