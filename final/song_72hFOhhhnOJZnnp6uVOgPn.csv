uh dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
brown skinned but your blue eyes tell me your mama cant run
sneak dissin
sneak me through the back window i’m a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
you know id go the distance you know im ten toes down
even if masters listenin i got the worlds attention
so ima say somethin thats vital and critical for survival
of mankind a feline color should never rival
beauty is what you make it i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces
then whit told me a woman is woman love the creation
it all came from god then you was my confirmation
i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with
chorus pete rock

where the homegirl rapsody at
i need you to speak your mind real quick loved one
verse 3 rapsody
let me talk my stu scott scuse me on my 2pac
keep your head up when the juice stop loving thy
color of your skin color of your eyes
thats the real blues baby like you met jays baby uh
you blew me away you think more beauty in blue green and grey
all my solemn men up north twelve years a slave
twelve years of age thinkin my shade too dark
i love myself i no longer need cupid
enforcin my dark side like a young george lucas
light dont mean you smart bein dark dont make you stupid
and frame of mind for them bustas aint talkin woohah
need a paradox for the pair of docs they tutored
like two todds ll you lose two times
if you dont see you beautiful in your complexion
it aint complex to put it in context
find the air beneath the kite thats the context
yeah baby im conscious aint no contest
if you like it i love it all your earth tones been blessed
aint no stress jiggaboos wanna be
i aint talkin jay i aint talkin bey
im talkin days we got school watchin movie screens
and spike your selfesteem
the new james bond gon be black as me
black as brown hazelnut cinnamon black tea
and its all beautiful to me
call your brothers magnificent call all the sisters queens
we all on the same team blues and pirus know colors aint a thing
outro kendrick lamar
barefoot babies with no care
teenage gun toters that dont play fair should i get out the car
i dont see compton i see something much worse
the land of the landmines the hell thats on earth112embed"
