your mama packed yall up and moved you to the south
packed a uhaul cross a onetree yard
to a tin roof shotgun house
you didnt know nobody didnt talk too much
had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
a little shy side a little wild side
with your long blonde hair all pulled up
then you got in with some southern belles
cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
learned the talk of the bible belt
now girl i melt when you

chorus
move i love it
yeah i love it when you get that beat
boots on stomp your feet
its like youve been waiting all week
move like you do
all sexy and smooth
like you love to
oh girl look at you
legs and your hips
live oak moonlit
when that song hits
damn you turn it loose
stars of the southern sky
buzz of the fire and ice
dj plays that throwback tune
but i cant move when you move
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
its like theres something in the air
that turns you wild when a country song
is way up loud and the sun goes down
right about then you lock eyes on me
you got me where you want me where i wanna be
all up in the middle of your left and right
just side to side yeah youre right on time when you

chorus
move i love it
yeah i love it when you get that beat
boots on stomp your feet
its like youve been waiting all week
move like you do
all sexy and smooth
like you love to
oh girl look at you
legs and your hips
live oak moonlit
when that song hits
damn you turn it loose
stars of the southern sky
buzz of the fire and ice
dj plays that throwback tune
and i cant move when you move
bridge
let me talk to you
move
i love it when you love it when you feel the beat
come
come on i wanna see you

chorus
move like you do
all sexy and smooth
like you love to
oh girl look at you
legs and your hips
live oak moonlit
when that song hits
damn you turn it loose
stars of the southern sky
buzz of the fire and ice
dj playing throwback tunes
i wanna move when you
but i cant move when you
no i cant move when you move
no i cant move when you move1embed"
