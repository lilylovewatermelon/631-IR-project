seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
itll form as a habit and seep in your soul
till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
danger is double and pleasures are few
where the rain never falls the sun never shines
its a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

well its many a man that that ive seen in my day
like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
a man will have lust for the lure of the mine

and a pray when im dead and my ages shall roll
that my body would blacken and turn into coal
then ill look from the door of my heavenly home
and pity the miner digging my bones

where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
danger is double pleasures are few
where the rain never falls the sun never shines
its a dark as a dungeon way down in the mineyou might also likeembed"
