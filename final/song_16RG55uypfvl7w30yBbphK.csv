can we call it a day
now would that be ok
can we just go our own separate ways ways
cause im cold and wet
and im willing to bet
that you constructed this maze maze

verse 2
i stumble around
try to follow the sound
then something takes hold of my hand my hand
if we cause such a mess
and id venture to guess
that you concocted this plan plan

verse 3
i dont know what to do
cause its always been you
who helps me to make up my mind my mind
but ill stake my life
and i swear by this knife
that its all by your design design

verse 4
enough has been said
it goes round in my head
until i break down and cry and cry
i wouldnt be surprised
if that look in your eyes
was your way of saying goodbye
