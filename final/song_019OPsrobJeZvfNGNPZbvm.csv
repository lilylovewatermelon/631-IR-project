bring it

verse 1
my life is perfect so you believe
are you that stupid cause i strongly disagree
im not a martyr more like a thief
your rules are twisted and they dont affect me

you saw me comin so why you runnin
whats the matter its just little old me
i know your kind youre fuckin blind
i give a shit dont give a shit about anything

chorus
there aint nothin in this world for free
theres not a man not a man i believe
give a rats ass what you think about me
ill dot your eyes and cross your fuckin teeth bring it

verse 2
youre just a trend its gotta end
i stand in place while you motherfuckers bend
you own a clock your time is up
you bottomfeeders its just time to give up
ready to throw down this is a showdown
you get the memo cause its all about to go down
i know im twisted i cant resist it
i give a shit dont give a shit about anything

there aint nothin in this world for free
theres not a man not a man i believe
give a rats ass what you think about me
ill dot your eyes and cross your fuckin teeth bring it

theres nothin in this world for me
i gave away gave away fuckin everything
this is the man that im choosing to be
ill dot your eyes and cross your fuckin teeth bring it

bridge
pressures building breaking down
suffocating till i drown

you know how the saying goes
its not the size of the dog in the fight
its the size of the fight in the dog

yeah bring it

chorus
there aint nothin in this world for free
theres not a man not a man i believe
give a rats ass what you think about me
ill dot your eyes and cross your fuckin teeth bring it
theres nothin in this world for me
i gave away gave away fuckin everything
this is the man that im choosing to be
ill dot your eyes and cross your fuckin teeth bring itembed"
