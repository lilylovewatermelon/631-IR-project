theres a place where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop em in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from

verse 1
take one part sand and one part sea
and one part shade of banana tree
and the drinks theyre cold and the reggae is hot
and i know this is the place for me

chorus
get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop em in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves jimmy

verse 2
see the problem is that youre right there
theres a perfectly good island somewhere
where a ride that floats and dont grab your coat
you wont need it where we are going

chorus
get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop em in the blue ocean
but you gotta get away to where the boat leaves from

down in the sand where its cool

and when i fall off my stool

ill just sleep there til morning comes round
with sunshine tanned ladies and pi√±a coladas
and bob marley songs that are playin
theres a song in my ear that i want you to hear
soft tropical lips that are singin

chorus
get away to where the boat leaves from
it takes away all of your big problems
you got worries you can drop em in the blue ocean
