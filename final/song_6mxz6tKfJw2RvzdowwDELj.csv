verse 2
thousand karats on my hand bout to get xanned out
i can always lean on these bands when niggas was down and out
i got an ak on my shoulder my trigger finger hot
i feel like pink floyd with the lean out
i feel like pretty boy money team out
kissin on the water with my chains out
my life is more effective than a cocaine drought
cause i was trappin at grandmas house when i came out
i said fuck the streets and made my own lane now
when you get high enough you can dodge raindrops
but tell your momma and your daddy you in a gang now
