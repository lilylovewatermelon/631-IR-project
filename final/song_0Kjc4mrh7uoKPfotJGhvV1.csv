if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly
common man of men and the king of many
hed lay his hands on his brother man save us all from sinning
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly

if was here today i bet hed drive a chevrolet
working at the plant and drawing workers pay
hed preach in some little country church outside of the city
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly

chorus
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly
common man of men and the king of many
hed lay his hands on his brother man save us all from sinning
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly

verse 2
his long hair and sandaled feet would be in style
surround himself with the good old boys to tell his tale
hed have a mighty cross tattoo
on his hands by the nail holes that killed him
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly

chorus
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly
common man of men and the king of many
hed lay his hands on his brother man save us all from sinning

you know theyd probably send him off to some kind of loony bin
they wouldnt hang him on the cross
but theyd find some way to condemn him
if jesus walked the world today hed probably be a hillbilly
