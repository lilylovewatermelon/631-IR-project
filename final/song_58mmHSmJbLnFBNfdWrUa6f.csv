ive been staring at the ceiling
watching the fans swirl around around and round
cause i cant hear my breathing
the words we said are still so loud loud loud

prechorus
and we been drifting off so far
and i dont even know where we are
before we jump before we leap
and all is lost for you and me yeah

chorus
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love
find our way through this
its not worth just giving up
cause ive got some fight left in me
and i dont see us ending this way
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love love

verse 2
ive been weighed down by the silence
all these words that dont come out out
been tempted just to write it
and say im sorry without a sound sound sound
you might also likeprechorus
cause we been drifting off so far
that i dont even know where we are
but we can try and we can speak
before were lost indefinitely

chorus
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love
find our way through this
its not worth just giving up
cause ive got some fight left in me
and i dont see us ending this way
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love love

bridge
i been terribly human
using you like a punching bag
and youve been terribly angry
taking out all your worst words on me
and i see what we were
and i know that weve hurt
but i know that its worth it to fight
for all our love tonight

chorus
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love
find our way through this
its not worth just giving up
cause ive got some fight left in me
and i dont see us ending this way
if were not stupid well both hold on for dear love love
love love love1embed"
