i put my heart in my lyrics
i gave it all i could give
i made it hot at the crib
i kept that fire at the crib
where you gon go when you dip
how ima know who for real
i pour a four in a fifth
you already know what it is
i keep a pole in the whip
cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
it aint no ho in the clique
none of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
i dont even show no sympathy
sipping on hennessy got me bending sideways
everything on me drippin you niggas cant ride the wave
nigga run around with the juice nigga come spill your drank
i done earn my stripes now im tryna go get me some real rank

chorus
readin through my third eye cause i got tunnel vision
had to open my mind then i opened a benz
its like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
fuck all that playing now im grown i put my heart in it
i had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas im serious
and its like every song im on i be calling my spirits

i put my hublot on rocks
i put moscato on rocks
where i’m from we don’t say opp
shoot at an ov shoot at a cop
shoot at the police shoot at your top
i made a million off socks
free all my niggas who stuck in a box
locked up and watching the clock
locked up they fighting with locks
locked up they swinging they knifes
i cant be living this life
no more bacardi alright
i dont want cardi so ima pour henny on ice
my vision is vivid told you im really a menace
ill show you im destined to get it
i be outside with the glizzy
toting that fire i be trippin
i just might die how im livin
aint take no bath but im drippin
niggas aint catching me slipping ayy yeah
i make you laugh when you with me
know that my swag is terrific glee glee
aint seen my dad in a minute
but i cant be mad i got millions
i just pulled up in a lemon
thuggin so fuck your opinion
im thuggin so fuck how you feeling
im calling my spirit
chorus
readin through my third eye cause i got tunnel vision
had to open my mind then i opened a benz
its like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
fuck all that playing now im grown i put my heart in it
i had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas im serious
and its like every song im on i be calling my spirits28embed"
