well thats alright if thats alright
two thousand miles but still thats alright
and thats alright if thats alright
ill see you in the mornin if thats alright

verse 1
and what would you do if i wrote you a song
would you give me some lovin when i get home
or would you be mad at me if i had a hard time
gettin a hold of you i try all the time

chorus
and ill bet that
you dont know anybody that could be so bad
but if you did youd be wondering where im at
well ill be home when tomorrow mornin comes

verse 2
and what would you do if i sang you this song
the connection is bad but thats only the phone
cause when my words kiss your ear ill be right there
the message is long cause baby this is your song

chorus
ill bet that
you dont know anybody that could be so bad
but if you did youd be wondering where im at
well ill be home when tomorrow mornin
and ill bet that
you dont know anybody that could be so bad
but if you did youd be wonderin where im at
well ill be home when tomorrow mornin
