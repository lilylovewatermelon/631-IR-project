i didnt mean to kiss you
i mean i did but i didn’t think itd go this far
i didnt mean to kiss you
now you can’t focus on the road when im in your car

prechorus lizzy mcalpine
now were going one hundred
your hands arent on the wheel
cause youre just staring at me like youre not convinced that i am real
and now were at one eighty
and i can finally see
but then it’s over in a second crashed the car into the tree
yeah i can see it all happen
you’d rather die than take your eyes off me

chorus lizzy mcalpine
i dont love you like that
i’m a careful driver
and i tell you all the timе to keep your eyes on the road
but you lovе me like that
youre a reckless driver
and one day itll kill us if i dont let go

verse 2 ben kessler

and i lie when i tell you
i know exactly where were going
