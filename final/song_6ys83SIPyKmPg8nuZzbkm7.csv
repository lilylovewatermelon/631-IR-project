please dont flatter yourself
youre not the only one this heart has ever felt
please dont exaggerate
dont tell me youre okay okay okay

chorus
i will admit it if you admit it
its harder than we both thought
its easier to fall apart look where we are
look where we are where we are
i can forgive it i cant forget it
youve left me here with all these scars
and you cant deny the hardest part
im not in your arms

verse 2
were more hurt than we appear
the world will never know
we both have tasted tears my dear
youre denying what i say
dont act like its okay cause its not okay

chorus
i will admit it if you admit it
its harder than we both thought
its easier to fall apart look where we are
look where we are where we are
i can forgive it i cant forget it
youve left me here with all these scars
and you cant deny the hardest part
im not in your arms
you might also likebridge
its not in the cards
its not in the stars
im not sorry im not sorry
youre not sorry

outro
i will admit if you admit it
just please dont flatter yourself
please dont flatter yourselfembed"
