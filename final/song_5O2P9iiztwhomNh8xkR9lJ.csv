goin out tonight changes into something red
her mother doesnt like that kind of dress
everything she never had shes showing off
driving too fast moon is breaking through her hair
shes heading for something that she wont forget
having no regrets is all that she really wants

chorus all harry
ooh were only getting older baby
ooh and ive been thinking about it lately
ooh does it ever drive you crazy
ahahah just how fast the night changes
ooh everything that youve ever dreamed of
ooh disappearing when you wake up
ooh but theres nothing to be afraid of
ahahah even when the night changes
ooh it will never change me and you

verse 2 louis niall
chasing her tonight doubts are running round her head
hes waiting hides behind a cigarette
heart is beating loud and she doesnt want it to stop
moving too fast moon is lightin up her skin
shes falling doesnt even know it yet
having no regrets is all that she really wants

goin out tonight changes into something red
her mother doesnt like that kind of dress
reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
