my guilt and my shame
always sell me short always feel the same
and my face and my soul
always wear me thin always under control
but the longest hours youll have in your life
are the ones you sit through to know if youre right
so ill wait but ill pray that im wrong
because i think i know whats going on

verse 2
so let me get this straight
the only will is my own
i do whatever i want and stay alone
all my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
im gonna suffer for the rest of my life
but i will always find a way to survive
im not a failure but i know what its like
i can take it or leave it or die

chorus
stay you dont always know where you stand
til you know that you wont run away
theres something inside me that feels
like breathing in sulfur

my life is undone
and im a sinner to most but a sage to some
and my gods are untrue
im probably wrong but im better than you
and the longest hours ive had in my life
were the ones i went through to know i was right
so im safe but im a little outside
im gonna laugh when im buried alive

chorus
stay you dont always know where you stand
til you know that you wont run away
theres something inside me that feels
like breathing in sulfur
