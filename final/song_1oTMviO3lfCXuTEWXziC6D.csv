ive been walking over graves
carving out the headstone
that i own
my own

im like a monster in a cage
trapped inside a maze
i am home
im home

prechorus
im here and gone
im dead and done

chorus
i know theres nothing i can change
and i regret the things i didnt say
i resent how i walked away
now im digging my own grave
now im digging my own
digging my own grave

verse 2
is there peace beyond the rage
tell me where this truly
all went wrong
went wrong
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likeive been walking through the graves
dancing with the lonely
and the strong
the strong

prechorus
im here and gone
im dead and done

chorus
i know theres nothing i can change
and i regret the things i didnt say
i resent how i walked away
now im digging my own grave
now im digging my own
digging my own grave

solo

bridge
digging my
digging my own grave

chorus
i know theres nothing i can change
and i regret the things i didnt say
digging my
digging my own grave
i resent how i walked away
now im digging my own grave
now im digging my own
digging my own grave

is there peace beyond rage
cause ive been digging my own
