known to dish the raw dish the law if they come up
and cheddar till the sun up
if theres a ransom and the law get involved then we never get it summed up
never put ya gun up if ya come round me
i go to war wit niggas round the corner from round me
you could front round me but i read through that
wit the mili and i aint talkin bout no segal mac
niggas see shoot back we can see to that
hit yo front letters see through back bring yo peoples back
and i used to grind out on my friends spot
til hes mom wanted my timbots

or transquo all around the world like i was signed to pimpdot
and if its ten targets and i got ten shots
im tryin to leave at least nine out of them ten shot

chumpyou dont really wanna war
with the state prop clique if ya clique shot us squad up
sp game so damn tough the 4 4 in the 5th tucked yall cant hang
transporter turned rapper get a camcorder film my life
still acclompished tryin to fill they cups
the rap version of mandela call my bluff
we still the street dwellers feel my pain my pain
i spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
a foolproof when the full force open you up what
twista
twista will rock you you dont want the thug apostle to pop you
hostile when i drop you turnin everything colossal to fossiles
i speak street gospel all they life i spit words and paint portraits
for real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
hit em in the body wit the powerful forces thatll end all your doubt
make em clean up your house bag up an ounce hit the dance floor and bounce
we blessed wit the talent fuck wit this clique it aint gon be easy
cause you fuckin wit twist if you fuck wit chris bleek and freewheezy
so speak and breath easy or the scutches my future in 3d
i like wars im from a city full of vice lords and gds
breeds and souls 26s kings bds and stones
spanish cobras and all the true soldiers survive and im gone
watch me spit if for the killers and hustlers flippin all the pounds and bricks
hate on me imma bust at you hoes and i put eleven down wit a clip
niggas servin fiftys and hundreds when i see you and im on yo tip
twista and this eastcoast regime its that chiroc shitembed"
