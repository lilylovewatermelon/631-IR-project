we gather here we line up weepin in a sunlit room
and if im on fire youll be made of ashes too
even on my worst day did i deserve babe
all the hell you gave me
cause i loved you i swear i loved you
til my dying day

chorus
i didnt have it in myself to go with grace
and youre the hero flying around saving face
and if im dead to you why are you at the wake
cursing my name wishin i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

verse 2
we gather stones nevеr knowing what theyll mean
some to throw somе to make a diamond ring
you know i didnt want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me

chorus
i didnt have it in myself to go with grace
cause when id fight you used to tell me i was brave
and if im dead to you why are you at the wake
cursing my name wishin i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want just not home
and you can aim for my heart go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you
when im screaming at the sky
and when you cant sleep at night
you hear my stolen lullabies

chorus
i didnt have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me but it killed you just the same
cursing my name wishin i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and youre tossing out blame drunk on this pain
crossin out the good years
and youre cursing my name wishin i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet

outro
yeah look at how my tears ricochet
look at all of my tears
turnin into your tears
look at how my tears ricochet2embed"
