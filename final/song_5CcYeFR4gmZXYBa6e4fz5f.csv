i wasnt trying to do no harm
i was just trying to prove i was tough
what i lacked in years i made up in guts
i aint saying it was smart
or that i had some master plan
i just grabbed that bottle and off i ran
i got a night in jail and a pissed old man

chorus
young and wild like they said we shouldve never been
and still a child filling those nights with grown up sin
i burned up some cars burned down some hearts
just to call myself a man
i might not do it the same but id do it all again
to stay young and wild as long as you can

verse 2
i wasnt trying to change the world
i just wanted to change her mind
in the backseat of my daddys ride
no i didnt have a clue
no i didnt have a plan
oh but i didnt care what i didnt have
yeah she made me want to feel like a man

young and wild like they said we shouldve never been
and still a child filling those nights with grown up sin
i burned up some cars burned down some hearts
just to call myself a man
i might not do it the same but id do it all again
to stay young and wild as long as you can
i might not do it the same but id do it all again
to stay young and wild as long as you can
