cause i cant stand it when you look at me that way
i wont sleep in that bed any more
id rather be lying here on this hardwood floor

i found your jacket with your front door key
you took the shoes i bought to walk away from me
i cant even pour myself a little wine
cause every glass is stained in your lipstick shine

how long before my little pill starts kicking in
how long before your broken heart starts giving in
here we go up
here we go down
mary go round and round and round
mary go up
mary go down
mary go round
i tell myself that you can be replaced
i try with someone else but its you that i taste
we go in circles on this rusty old ride
maybe its our time to say goodbye
maybe its our time
yeah

how long before your broken heart starts giving in
here we go up
here we go down
mary go round and round and round
mary go up
mary go down
mary go round

how long before my little pill starts kicking in
how long before your broken heart starts giving in
here we go up
here we go down
mary go round and round and round
mary go up
mary go down
mary go round

how long before my little pill starts kicking in
how long before your broken heart starts giving in

how long
tell me tell me tell me right now
how longembed"
