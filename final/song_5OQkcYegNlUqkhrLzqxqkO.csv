ignore the moaning as it tumbles to the ground
be brave and save your day
these days are cold numbers rule ive been told
the patterns clear better fit in the mould
you need to be brave to save your day

you need to be brave to save your day

to cough up sympathy isnt hard but it costs
hold tight to your life savings
you have to do what you must
to save your day
so poke the body and roll it down
the grave looks cold but were still young
were still youngsee josé gonzález liveget tickets as low as 50you might also like2embed"
