dawg you gotta feel me on this one
what it be like dawg im on some some adult grown up type shit
look who i be around nigga look who i been around nigga
jeezy juvie turk b and slim dawg pay attention dawg

verse 1 lil wayne
age is nothing but some digits nigga trust me on this
cause i think i speak for everyone when i say life is a bitch
i ride d l in the c l gun right in my grip
i slip a clip in every whip cause haters likely to trip
come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
she end up catching rights to her lip behind diapers and shit
but i like me a spliff drink henny without the ice when im pissed
go to the club and start a fight thinking im tyson and shit
but im a man so im able to handle my situations correctly
and i know i might be young but nigga gone definitely respect me
but in the mean while im fighting gun charges in court
and in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
its like im never happy now
except for the fact my daughter saying i love you daddy now
and that kinda juice me up but i smoke bout 3 blunts
and puff a cooler boost me up
and say a prayer for everyday
just so i get through the stuff but i be like

awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man

verse 2 lil wayne
i try to keep my head up but i die to keep my bread up
and usually im fed up thinking everythings a set up
but i get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
and i get hit up with all kinda stress
and put up wit the stuff just trust me its tough
but i maintain to climb through it all
and i still manage to be lil wayne therefore i shine and i ball
and dawg i live for today and hope and pray theres a tomorrow
and i borrow confidence from out my heart when things get awful
and im often on the edge stuck without a solution
someway i still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
and i dont need nobody so keep yo advice and just doubt me
cause yall cats dont really know me yall just know about me
but my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
and plus i know my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
and i aint never say i thought they aint appreciate what i do
but just know if i wasnt a man we wouldnt make it through but i be like
chorus
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man

verse 3 lil wayne
who would have known that this was someday turn out so hectic
but i chose my own life so i gradually accept it
and im influenced and effected by the way it became
and i dont play with it at all so i dont say its a game
and even though i grew up hard and i have gracefully changed
im always street so ill forever be facing a change
and ill keep the slang brutained on the waist of my pants
and i demand respect from all if not then im wasting a man
and if i want it then i get and if i need it i have it
take care of them family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
and ever so often im congratulated for the succeeding at last
but when they turn they back i just have jesus leading my path
and i aint ask for you to like me i dont care if you hate me
but dont mistake me no other man can never make me or break me
now i be faithfully inspired by the hood til im gone
and i dawg i do believe im grown so ill be good on my own but i be like
chorus
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man
awww man its complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everyone in ya home man
and when you feel like everything is going wrong man
im gone stand cause i am a grown man
