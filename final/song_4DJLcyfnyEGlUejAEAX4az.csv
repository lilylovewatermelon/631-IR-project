ive been here looking dynamite
alone against the wall
girls like you give it all so cold
talking cheap in a bathroom stall
and you look so smooth
you better tell me the truth
would you trade me
out for someone cool
i know you better than you do
so put out your cigarette
and kiss me on
the lips tonight

chorus
me and you
you and me
lets go back
lets go back
1983 is calling
ive been on my knees and crawling
back to you
its coming all back to me
1983

verse 2
ive got something that ive kept inside
and the blood is on the blade
youre there sucking on your lollipop
like you havent aged a day
and it aint so pretty when youre playing cute
when your bodys up against some fool
does he feel it
â€˜cause i feel it
you might also likechorus
me and you
you and me
lets go back
lets go back
1983 is calling
ive been on my knees and crawling
back to you
its coming all back to me
1983

bridge
the year i was born
i wont be ignored
so get your feet on the floor
im the only one
are you afraid
i still make you move
me and you
you and me
lets go back to 1983
me and you
you and me
lets go back to 1983
whoa whoa whoa
chorus

lets go back
lets go back
1983 is calling
ive been on my knees and crawling
back to you
its coming all back to me
1983

you and me

lets go back
1983 is calling
ive been on my knees and crawling
