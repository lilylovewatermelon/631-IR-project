seven days underpaid gotta give it up
got no time for this life that i’m living up
shackled down kicked around now slave to the grind
need some time for myself

chorus
i’ll give you anything that you want me to
but i dont have the time so i’ll get up with you
if you dont understand man you’ve gotta believe
theres too much of you but theres not enough of me
theres not enough of me

verse 2
same old song world moves on while i’m still in bed
meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
jump the gun on the run
i’m the only one who thinks i’m falling behind

chorus
i’ll give you anything that you want me to
but i dont have the time so i’ll get up with you
if you dont understand man you’ve gotta believe
theres too much of you but theres not enough of me
theres not enough of me

if you dont understand man you’ve gotta believe
theres too much of you theres too much of me
i’ll give you anything that you want me to
but i dont have the time so i’ll get up with you
if you dont understand man you’ve gotta believe
theres too much of you but theres not enough of me
theres not enough of meembed"
