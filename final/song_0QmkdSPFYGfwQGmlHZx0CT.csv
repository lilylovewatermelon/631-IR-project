they dont want you none virginia
why dont you just go on home
im not being fair virginia
id rather see you all alone
this old towns the way you left it
and sleep is good when you can get it

chorus
love letters and cigarettes
its been three years and i cant forget
and wrap this chain around my neck for good
i memorized every word you wrote
and each night they go up in smoke
and im gonna die or im gonna choke its true
im still not done with you
oh no im still not done with you

verse 2
the big screen waits for you virginia
its where i wanted you to be
when it came to being with you
this place just wouldnt let go of me
every road and every stop light
i see your face on a good night

oh no im still not done with you

every road and every stop light
i see your face on a good night
