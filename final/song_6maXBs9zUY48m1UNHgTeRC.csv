they got one eye watching you
one eye on what you do
so be careful who it is youre talking to
they got one eye watching you
one eye on what you do
so be careful what it is youre trying to do
and be careful when youre walking into view
just be careful when youre walking into view

got one eye on the road and one on you

verse 2
they got one eye watching you
and one eye on what you do
so be careful cause nothing they say is true
no dont believe a word
its just us against the world
and we just got to turn up to be heard
hear the crocodiles ticking round the world
hear those crocodiles ticking they go ticking round the world
