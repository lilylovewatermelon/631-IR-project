where i wont see outside again
til i write all the fog away
im putting words in their place
between me and the windows pane
from my inarticulate brain
but all of the fog is erased
when i write all the words that i never said
to you

now the impulse wont go away
distracted by something youd say
cause you dont see anything
its just between windows and me
wait til it rains again
and i write all the words that i never said
to you

will you try to read these lines
focus hard and give it time
who you are in my life
reads as the water washes

now the dirt on the window is showing
i should have drawn something instead
the dirt on the window is showing
i should never have written my head
i should never have written what i never said
