please take a long hard look
through your text book cause im history
when i strap my helmet on ill be long gone
cause ive been dying to leave
yeah ill ride the range
and hide all my loose change in my bedroll
cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike
always takes its toll on me
ive had just about enough
of quote diamonds in the rough
because my backbone is paper thin

chorus
get me out of this cavern or ill cave in
ill cave in ill cave in

verse 2
if the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
the sun will still be shining
because ive heard it said that
every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
though im always undermining too deep to know
swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
cause the road tastes like wintergreen
the wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
mixed with stale gasoline
ill soak up the sound
try to sleep on the wet ground
ill get ten minutes give or take
cause i just dont foresee myself getting drowsy
when cold integrity keeps me wide awake
awake awake awake awake
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likechorus
get me out of this cavern or ill cave in
cave in cave in cave in cave in
get me out of this cavern or ill cave in

verse 3
ill keep my helmet on
just in case my head caves in
in case my head caves in
cause if my thoughts collapse
or my framework snaps
itll make a mess like you wouldnt believe
tie my handlebars to the stars
so i stay on track so i stay on track
and if my intentions stray ill wrench them away
then ill take my leave and i wont even look back

outro
i wont even look back
