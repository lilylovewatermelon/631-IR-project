never have you seen in your lifetime
a more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
facin all kinda time but smile like im fine
brag with such passion and shine without tryin
believe me pains a small thang to a giant
i was born without a dime out the gutter i climbed
spoke my mind and didnt stutter one time
ali say even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
so i huff and puff rhymes lyrics so sick wit it
set the standard in atlanta how to getgetget it
so you upandcoming rappers wanna diss just kill it
im officially the realest point blank period
whether i still live in the hood or just visit
whatever you can do in the hood i done did it
thats why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
this still his city long as tip livin nigga

hook
i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah no matter what people
here i am yeah no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so yeah i know haha
here i go yeah no matter what shawty here i go
no matter what shawty
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeverse 2
you let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
im sure to be in jail until 2027
rather see me in the cell instead of this new mclaren
god will take you through hell just to get you to heaven
so even though its heavy the load i will carry
grin and still bear it win and still share it
apologies to the fans i hope you can understand it
life can change your directions even when you aint planned it
all you can do is handle worst thing you can do is panic
use it to your advantage avoid insanity manage to conquer
every obstacle make impossible possible
even when winning illogical losings still far from optional and
yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
but when life throw punches block and counter like a boxer do
been locked inside mi casa too long i did a song
to make it known that the king lives on pimpin

hook
i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah no matter what people
here i am yeah no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so yeah i know haha
here i go yeah no matter what shawty here i go
no matter what shawty
verse 3
even in solitude theres still no hotter dude
i show you how to do what you do you aint gotta clue
all you do is follow dude sound like a lotta dudes
ill weather whatever storm make it out without a bruise
i understand why now with my hands tied
they take shots cause if im out there its a landslide
but revenge is best served as a cold dish
and suckas will get served better know this
guess it was understood for me it was overwith
but i dont quit if you aint noticed yet
they couldnt wait to say goodnight shawty
so they could try to rhyme act and look like shawty
go get a beat from toomp and make a hook like shawty
before ya know it im back what it look like shawty
i lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
somehow i rise above my problems and remain here
yeah and i hope the picture painted clear
if your heart filled with faith then you cant fear
wonder how i face years and im still chillin
easy let go and let god deal with it

hook
i aint dead nah i aint done nah
i aint scared of what i aint run from who
but still i stand yeah no matter what people
here i am yeah no matter what remember
i aint break never i aint fold never
they hate me more so yeah i know haha
here i go yeah no matter what shawty here i go
no matter what shawty13embed"
