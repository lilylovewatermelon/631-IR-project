verse 1
you know you best to watch out watch your back nigga
til you be fresh out of clout fresh water trout
rumors that out of water he got a mouth on the street somebody tell him yo

who knows who is watchin in streets is watchin

as much he thinks they know
that what he drinks drano
rat but she winks rainbows
