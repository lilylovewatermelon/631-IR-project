read my lips
i dont want to
get involved with relativity
take my time
use it wisely
youre controlling
certain gravities

youre coming around so late in the day
ive been here before i know what to say
youre moving the ground
youre making me feel as if the universe is you
the universe is you
the universe is you
the universe is you

verse 2
tell yourself
you cant have me
i rely on probability

chorus
youre coming around so late in the day
ive been here before i know what to say

youre coming around so late in the day
ive been here before i know what to say
youre moving the ground
youre making me feel as if the universe is you
youre coming around so late in the day
ive been here before so i know what to say
