slip it in her drink and in the blink of an eye
i can make a white girl look chink
dont know what to think cause last time i attempted this shit
the judge ordered me to see a shrink
started with the link
contended her to meet me at the local odd future wolf gang skating rink
we was uniquely in sync
already fuckin and we only met last week
we were both young not yet antique
so her mindset was working for my technique
tell her that i love her and by next week
you can hеar her shriek from the gashеs in her cheeks
no im not a freak i am meekly a creep
the neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
and it reeks on the sheet girl
streaks of red even though all pussy is pink
oblivion makes obvious seeks
which make meats for my obvious feasts
used to just blot up thoughts plot and rethink
now i get daughters and tie em and clink
got my dick harder than iron and zinc
now they just rot up arms caught in the sink
where they get cut up to fit my physique
critique my chic in this brand new mink go
see tyler the creator liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likebridge
yeah wolf gang
wolf haley how you doin
all good cool
we cool im upset
alright swag

verse 2
bitches running round down pussy take a trip
make her strip got my dick harder than the unzip
tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of taylor swifts slit
round trip in that pussy here comes a ticket
film clips popping on that canon
busting ottoman cannons on the pill
is he real gaza stripping in my living room
wolf gang full moon im assuming mushrooms mushrooms
im a necrolampoon not of charles manson
this fuck is ending soon because im ejaculatingembed"
