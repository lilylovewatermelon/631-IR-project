sitting in traffic on the tappan zee
fifty million people out in front of me
trying to cross the water but it just might be a while
rains coming down i cant see a thing
radios broken so im whistling
new york to nyack feels like a hundred miles

chorus
its not right
its not fair
im still a mess
and you still dont care
i go to work
i come back home
but youre still gone
and im still alone
and the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
on my big black plastic japanese cordless phone
oh no

verse 2
stuck in a meeting on monday night
trying to get the numbers to come out right
im getting tired i think i just might need a drink
and as im reaching in the bottom drawer
im dreaming bout the way it was before
life was so easy i never really had to think
you might also likechorus
its not right
its not fair
im still a mess
and you still dont care
i go to sleep
when i wake up
the pain sets in
and it never stops
and the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
on the desktop mailbox of my big black laptop
oh no
its not right
its not fair
im still a mess
and you still dont care
i go to work
i come back home
but youre still gone
and im still alone
and the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
no no the little red lights not blinking
on my big black radio shack digital portable phone
oh noembed"
