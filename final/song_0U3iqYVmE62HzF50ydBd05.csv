i saw you standing in the corner
on the edge of a burning light
i saw you standing in the corner

chorus
come to me again in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night

verse 2
you make me feel a little older
like a full grown woman might
but when youre gone i grow colder

chorus
come to me again in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night

bridge
i hear you walking by my front door
i hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
i dont care what other people say
im going to love you anyway

chorus
come to me again in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night
you might also likeverse 3
i cant stand it any longer
i need the fuel to make my fire bright
so dont fight it any longer

chorus
come to me again in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night

outro
and i know that you feel it too
when my skin turns into glue
you will know that its warm inside
and youll come run to me
in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night
in the cold cold night5embed"
