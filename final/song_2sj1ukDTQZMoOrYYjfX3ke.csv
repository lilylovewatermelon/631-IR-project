cause you threw my heart into the cage again
so im hangin on by letting go
and i cant stop this
its bigger than ive ever known
im not alone

and im here because of faith
and not all of the times you left me bleeding
it was faith and not all of the times you left me bleeding
you kept me going
i want you to know thanks to you ive come around
it was faith

ive been awakened
by the lonely tears falling down my face again
and the bitterness on my skin
its not forgotten
but youve forgiven everything ive ever done

and im here because of faith
and not all of the times you left me bleeding
it was faith and not all of the times you left me bleeding
you kept me going
i want you to know thanks to you ive come around
it was faith
you might also likeyeah you know it was faith
im trying hard to never see you leave again
you know it was faith
say goodbye to yesterday

thought you were heaven sent
cause you threw my heart into the cage again

so im here because of faith
and not all of the times you left me bleeding
id give you everything
youre the reason im still breathing
you kept me going
i want you to know thanks to you ive come around
somehow you kept me going
i want you to know that weve become closer now
it was faithembed"
