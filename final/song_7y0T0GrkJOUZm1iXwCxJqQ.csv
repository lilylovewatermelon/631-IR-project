see most of yall sucka ass niggas wouldnt last a week in my hood
if you was broke and wouldnt last a day if you had money
i seen grown men cry grown men die for the love of that money
in god we trust

verse 1
my trigger finger itchin palms itchin too
we backtoback in ghosts playin peekaboo
we went to war with sosa over a brick or two
so for a hundred kis think what my clique could do
im talkin clappin toasts bulletsll hit your roof
they hit his body he went in shock no pikachu
niggas ain’t bout it they talkin’ but really pick and choose
we on our second strike we ain’t got shit to lose
all my niggas is felons all you niggas is tellin’
sold your soul to them people they gon’ get you to sell it
they gon’ get you to move it they gon’ get you a buick
they gon’ get you a wire like niggas gon’ use it
you gon’ tell on your brothas what a lame homie
i got a bullet with your name on it and a full clip i autographed
kids cryin’ at the viewing i guess it was sorta sad

hook
we done went to war with the realest shot it out with the best
talkin’ highend guerillas banana clips make a mess
i seen young niggas cry i seen young niggas fold
i seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
for the love of the money for the love of the money
for the love of the money love of the money
man them young niggas hungry for the love of the money
i seen real niggas cry i seen real niggas hit
i seen real niggas die cuz a real nigga snitch
in god we trust

lotta niggas act tonylike

but he got killers lurkin’ outside at your home tonight
they gon’ hit the crib and kill the kids oh that’s kony right
oh that’s konylike everybody bleed
cuz he come out in 2060 christmas eve
first time he went to prison he ain’t get to leave
feds takin’ pictures niggas is rats you should say cheese
once a local dude shit the fire now
never ever spit a rap but he got bars now
i’m talkin fed time yard up yard down
baby mama can’t pay the bills shit is hard now
how that make you feel you should pay them bills
inmates spittin in them trays when they make yo’ meal
niggas shittin’ out them packs just to take them pills
and his baby mama brought em in boy this shit is real
niggas turn to muslim niggas turn to christian
they gave him life he try’n appeal it got him on a mission
his homies ain’t learn they still in the kitchen
they firin’ bullshit that coka ain’t swimmin’
it’s coming up short no food on the fork
niggas is catchin’ cases niggas is goin’ to court
he done slaved in the field you the one on the porch
with the gun in your hand try and run with the man

and then they start talkin’ that shit
