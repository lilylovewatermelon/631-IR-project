but it hurts to think youre somewhere on a search for me
im right here with no words to speak
daydreaming about what could never be
it will never be
but i wonder do you think of me
do you think of me cause im thinking of

verse 1
all i wanted was to keep this love alive yeah
and all i wanted was to be there by your side yeah yeah
i know better than to keep on telling lies
should have swallowed my pride
but i think sometimes that

chorus
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go

i think its best that we let it go
no stress than the mess we was headed for
cause only trouble had vision in the telescope
a peace of mind better than mission impossible
who want a possible
i take a bird in the hand if its toucan
but two cant play the star in a new band
rockin wit you get it poppin wit you
when da gossip hit you i dont wanna say i shoulda coulda woulda would
any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge
deadly flow kid you aint never seen a dove
dancing over trouble what its papas daughter
rolling stones she cant hide in a louis clutch
the bigger man when i look back at it pretty much
another chance at it pass on it like a bud
just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club
i think its best it was best that we split up

chorus
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
but it hurts to think
youre somewhere on a search for me
im right here with no words to speak
daydreaming about what could never be
it will never be
but i wonder
do you think of me
do you think of me
cause im thinking of you
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
verse 3
and all i ever wanted was a good girl
good girls come within i got a tell a little girl
shawty lil mama lets try to save the drama
i know i aint a saint but still believe in karma
im gon try to get my shit together
oh yeah i know its misery
so what the hell i tell her
hello good morning
i was out with my homie for his birthday
but that excuse had neva had me comin home late
you straight im straight i dont wanna deal with it
yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it
no yo let me know i might come visit
thats when you know you got the rope around your neck
pitchin scratching choking whatever
hangin from the tree the next time i know better
face tattooed on me shouldve got letters
dead to her face if i could ill tell her

chorus
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
but it hurts to think
youre somewhere on a search for me
im right here with no words to speak
daydreaming about what could never be
it will never be
but i wonder
do you think of me

cause im thinking of you
maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
maybe it was best it was best that we let it goembed"
