im sick of being alone when are you coming home
just a glimpse of your face
i can remember smelling your hair ill meet you anywhere
somewhere that no one can retrace
somewhere where nobody will know our faces

chorus
she has two arms to hold me
and four legs to wrap around me
shes not your typical girlfriend
shes my alien
my alien

verse 2
she knows when something is wrong
when something doesnt belong
she can read in my mind
and she can be assured that with me
there is no conspiracy
shes not wasting her time
she can take me to the place that she calls home
in a spaceship that will someday be my own
please take me to your leader
tell her i will surrender
i will surrender

she has two arms to hold me
and four legs to wrap around me
shes not your typical girlfriend
shes my alien

chorus
she has two arms to hold me
and four legs to wrap around me
shes not your typical girlfriend
she has two arms to hold me
and four legs to wrap around me
shes not your typical girlfriend
