quand tu
quand tu me prends dans tes bras
quand je regarde dans tes yeux
je vois quun dieu existe
ce nest pas dur dy croire

verse 1
before i met you i wasnt terribly lucky
every prince charming lost charm after twelve
but then you came and made the past look so funny
put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf

verse 2
if this was meant to be
dont condemn me to be free
and even if we never marry
i will always love you baby
childishly

prechorus
cause something
youve got something i cant resist
things are what they will be
when i look into your eyes
they say to me that god still exists
you might also likechorus
and theres something
youve got something i cant resist
things are what they will be
when i look into your eyes
they say to me that god still exists
you make me believe
you make me believe

verse 3
i love the temperature and smell of your body
the shape of your lips
the size of your nose
i love that everything you say is so funny
plus youre the best kisser that ive ever known

verse 4
you see the way i am
without makeup without clothes
and you accept me like nobody
and i will always love you baby
with eyes closed

prechorus
cause something
youve got something i cant resist
things are what they will be
when i look into your eyes
they say to me that god still exists
chorus
and theres something
youve got something i cant resist
things are what they will be
when i look into your eyes
they say to me that god still exists
you make me believe
you make me believe

bridge
quand tu
