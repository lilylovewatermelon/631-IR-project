you call me out upon the waters
the great unknown where feet may fail
and there i find you in the mystery
in oceans deep my faith will stand

chorus
and i will call upon your name
and keep my eyes above the waves
when oceans rise my soul will rest in your embrace
for i am yours and you are mine

verse 2
your grace abounds in deepest waters
your sovereign hand will be my guide
where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
youve never failed and you wont start now

chorus
so i will call upon your name
and keep my eyes above the waves
when oceans rise my soul will rest in your embrace
for i am yours and you are mine oh
and you are mine oh

let me walk upon the waters wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
and my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my saviour

take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
