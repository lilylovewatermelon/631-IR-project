but the almighty lord hath struck him
and hath delivered him into the hands of
a woman

the vulgate judith xvi 7

my company was charming

opposite me by the massive renaissance fireplace sat venus she was not a casual woman of the halfworld who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex like mademoiselle cleopatra but the real true goddess of love

she sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire whose
reflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them

her head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes it was all i could see of her she had wrapped her marblelike body in a huge fur and rolled herself up trembling like a cat

i dont understand it i exclaimed it isnt really cold any
longer for two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather you must be nervous

much obliged for your spring she replied with a low stony voice and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely twice in succession i really cant stand it here much longer and i am beginning to understand

what dear lady

i am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the ununderstandable all of a sudden i understand the germanic virtue of woman and german philosophy and i am no longer surprised that you of the north do not know how to love havent even an idea of what love is

but madame i replied flaring up i surely havent given you any reason

oh you the divinity sneezed for the third time and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace thats why i have always been nice to you and even come to see you now and then although i catch a cold every time in spite of all my furs do you remember the first time we met

how could i forget it i said you wore your abundant hair in
brown curls and you had brown eyes and a red mouth but i recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marblelike palloryou always wore a violetblue velvet jacket edged with squirrelskin

you were really in love with the costume and awfully docile
you have taught me what love is your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years

and my faithfulness to you was without equal

well as far as faithfulness goes

ungrateful

i will not reproach you with anything you are a divine woman but nevertheless a woman and like every woman cruel in love

what you call cruel the goddess of love replied eagerly is
simply the element of passion and of natural love which is womans nature and makes her give herself where she loves and makes her love everything that pleases her

can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the
unfaithfulness of the woman he loves

indeed she replied we are faithful as long as we love but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love and the giving of herself without enjoyment who is cruel therewoman or man you of
the north in general take love too soberly and seriously you talk
of duties where there should be only a question of pleasure

that is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous and our
relations permanent

and yet a restless always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of
paganism she interrupted but that love which is the highest joy
which is divine simplicity itself is not for you moderns you
children of reflection it works only evil in you as soon as you
wish to be natural you become common to you nature seems something
hostile you have made devils out of the smiling gods of greece and
out of me a demon you can only exorcise and curse me or slay
yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar and if ever one of
you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth he makes a barefoot
pilgrimage to rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow
from his withered staff while under my feet roses violets and
myrtles spring up every hour but their fragrance does not agree with
you stay among your northern fogs and christian incense let us
pagans remain under the debris beneath the lava do not disinter us
pompeii was not built for you nor our villas our baths our temples
you do not require gods we are chilled in your world

the beautiful marble woman coughed and drew the dark sables still
closer about her shoulders

much obliged for the classical lesson i replied but you cannot
deny that man and woman are mortal enemies in your serene sunlit
world as well as in our foggy one in love there is union into a
single being for a short time only capable of only one thought one
sensation one will in order to be then further disunited and you
know this better than i whichever of the two fails to subjugate will
soon feel the feet of the other on his neck

and as a rule the man that of the woman cried madame venus with
proud mockery which you know better than i

of course and that is why i dont have any illusions

you mean you are now my slave without illusions and for that
reason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy

madame

dont you know me yet yes i am cruelsince you take so much
delight in that wordand am i not entitled to be so man is the one
who desires woman the one who is desired this is womans entire but
decisive advantage through his passion nature has given man into
womans hands and the woman who does not know how to make him her
subject her slave her toy and how to betray him with a smile in the
end is not wise

exactly your principles i interrupted angrily

they are based on the experience of thousands of years she
replied ironically while her white fingers played over the dark fur
the more devoted a woman shows herself the sooner the man sobers
down and becomes domineering the more cruelly she treats him and the
more faithless she is the worse she uses him the more wantonly she
plays with him the less pity she shows him by so much the more will
she increase his desire be loved worshipped by him so it has
always been since the time of helen and delilah down to catherine
the second and lola montez

i cannot deny i said that nothing will attract a man more than
the picture of a beautiful passionate cruel and despotic woman who
wantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her
whim

and in addition wears furs exclaimed the divinity

what do you mean by that

i know your predilection

do you know i interrupted that since we last saw each other
you have grown very coquettish

in what way may i ask

in that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater
advantage than by these dark furs and that

the divinity laughed

you are dreaming she cried wake up and she clasped my arm
with her marblewhite hand do wake up she repeated raucously with
the low register of her voice i opened my eyes with difficulty

i saw the hand which shook me and suddenly it was brown as bronze
the voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who
stood before me at his full height of nearly six feet

do get up continued the good fellow it is really disgraceful

what is disgraceful

to fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides he snuffed
the candles which had burned down and picked up the volume which had
fallen from my hand with a book byhe looked at the title page
by hegel besides it is high time you were starting for mr
severins who is expecting us for tea

a curious dream said severin when i had finished he supported
his arms on his knees resting his face in his delicate finely
veined hands and fell to pondering

i knew that he wouldnt move for a long time hardly even breathe this
actually happened but i didnt consider his behavior as in any way
remarkable i had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly
three years and gotten used to his peculiarities for it cannot be
denied that he was peculiar although he wasnt quite the dangerous
madman that the neighborhood or indeed the entire district of kolomea
considered him to be i found his personality not only interestingand
that is why many also regarded me a bit madbut to a degree
sympathetic for a galician nobleman and landowner and considering his
agehe was hardly over thirtyhe displayed surprising sobriety a
certain seriousness even pedantry he lived according to a minutely
elaborated halfphilosophical halfpractical system like clockwork
not this alone but also by the thermometer barometer aerometer
hydrometer hippocrates hufeland plato kant knigge and lord
chesterfield but at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion and
gave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a
wall at such times every one preferred to get out of his way

while he remained silent the fire sang in the chimney and the large
venerable samovar sang and the ancient chair in which i sat rocking
to and fro smoking my cigar and the cricket in the old walls sang
too i let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus skeletons of
animals stuffed birds globes plastercasts with which his room
was heaped full until by chance my glance remained fixed on a
picture which i had seen often enough before but today under the
reflected red glow of the fire it made an indescribable impression
on me

it was a large oil painting done in the robust fullbodied manner
of the belgian school its subject was strange enough

a beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face with abundant
hair tied into a classical knot on which white powder lay like a
soft hoarfrost was resting on an ottoman supported on her left arm
she was nude in her dark furs her right hand played with a lash
while her bare foot rested carelessly on a man lying before her like
a slave like a dog in the sharply outlined but wellformed
linaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate
devotion he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a
martyr this man the footstool for her feet was severin but
beardless and it seemed some ten years younger

venus in furs i cried pointing to the picture that is the way
i saw her in my dream

i too said severin only i dreamed my dream with open eyes

indeed

it is a tiresome story

your picture apparently suggested my dream i continued but do
tell me what it means i can imagine that it played a role in your
life and perhaps a very decisive one but the details i can only get
from you

look at its counterpart replied my strange friend without
heeding my question

the counterpart was an excellent copy of titians wellknown venus
with the mirror in the dresden gallery

and what is the significance

severin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which
titian garbed his goddess of love

it too is a venus in furs he said with a slight smile i
dont believe that the old venetian had any secondary intention he
simply painted the portrait of some aristocratic mesalina and was
tactful enough to let cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her
majestic allure with cold satisfaction he looks as though his task
were becoming burdensome enough the picture is painted flattery
later an expert in the rococo period baptized the lady with the
name of venus the furs of the despot in which titians fair model
wrapped herself probably more for fear of a cold than out of
modesty have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that
constitute womans essence and her beauty

but enough of that the picture as it now exists is a bitter
satire on our love venus in this abstract north in this icy
christian world has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch
cold

severin laughed and lighted a fresh cigarette

just then the door opened and an attractive stoutish blonde girl
entered she had wise kindly eyes was dressed in black silk and
brought us cold meat and eggs with our tea severin took one of the
latter and decapitated it with his knife

didnt i tell you that i want them softboiled he cried with a
violence that made the young woman tremble

but my dear sevtchu she said timidly

sevtchu nothing he yelled you are to obey obey do you
understand and he tore the kantchuk footnote a long whip with a
short handle which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook

the woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe

just wait ill get you yet he called after her

but severin i said placing my hand on his arm how can you treat
a pretty young woman thus

look at the woman he replied blinking humorously with his eyes
had i flattered her she would have cast the noose around my neck
but now when i bring her up with the kantchuk she adores me

nonsense

nonsense nothing that is the way you have to break in women

well if you like it live like a pasha in your harem but dont
lay down theories for me

why not he said animatedly goethes you must be hammer or anvil
is absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman
didnt lady venus in your dream prove that to you womans power lies
in mans passion and she knows how to use it if man doesnt
understand himself he has only one choice to be the tyrant over or
the slave of woman as soon as he gives in his neck is under the
yoke and the lash will soon fall upon him

strange maxims

not maxims but experiences he replied nodding his head i have
actually felt the lash i am cured do you care to know how

he rose and got a small manuscript from his massive desk and put
it in front of me

you have already asked about the picture i have long owed you an
explanation hereread

severin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me and seemed
to dream with open eyes silence had fallen again and again the fire
sang in the chimney and the samovar and the cricket in the old
walls i opened the manuscript and read

confessions of a supersensual man

the margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the wellknown
lines from faust

thou supersensual sensual wooer
a woman leads you by the nose
mephistopheles

i turned the titlepage and read what follows has been compiled
from my diary of that period because it is impossible ever frankly
to write of ones past but in this way everything retains its fresh
colors the colors of the present

gogol the russian moliere sayswhere well somewherethe real
comic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down

a wonderful saying

so i have a very curious feeling as i am writing all this down the
atmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers
which overcomes me and gives me a headache the smoke of the
fireplace curls and condenses into figures small graybearded
kokolds that mockingly point their finger at me chubbycheeked
cupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees i have to smile
involuntarily even laugh aloud as i am writing down my adventures
yet i am not writing with ordinary ink but with red blood that drips
from my heart all its wounds long scarred over have opened and it
throbs and hurts and now and then a tear falls on the paper

the days creep along sluggishly in the little carpathian healthresort
you see no one and no one sees you it is boring enough to write idyls
i would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings
furnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season a dozen
virtuosos with concertos trios and duos butwhat am i sayingthe
upshot of it all is that i dont do much more than to stretch the
canvas smooth the bow line the scores for i amno false modesty
friend severin you can lie to others but you dont quite succeed any
longer in lying to yourselfi am nothing but a dilettante a dilettante
in painting in poetry in music and several other of the socalled
unprofitable arts which however at present secure for their masters
the income of a cabinet minister or even that of a minor potentate
above all else i am a dilettante in life

up to the present i have lived as i have painted and written poetry
i never got far beyond the preparation the plan the first act the
first stanza there are people like that who begin everything and
never finish anything i am such a one

but what am i saying

to the business in hand

i lie in my window and the miserable little town which fills me
with despondency really seems infinitely full of poetry how
wonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven
with golden sunlight mountaintorrents weave through them like
ribbons of silver how clear and blue the heavens into which
snowcapped crags project how green and fresh the forested slopes
the meadows on which small herds graze down to the yellow billows
of grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again

the house in which i live stands in a sort of park or forest or
wilderness whatever one wants to call it and is very solitary

its sole inhabitants are myself a widow from lemberg and madame
tartakovska who runs the house a little old woman who grows older
and smaller each day there are also an old dog that limps on one
leg and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn this
ball of yarn i believe belongs to the widow

she is said to be really beautiful this widow still very young
twentyfour at the most and very rich she dwells in the first story
and i on the ground floor she always keeps the green blinds drawn and
has a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbingplants i for my
part down below have a comfortable intimate arbor of honeysuckle in
which i read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs i
can look up on the balcony sometimes i actually do so and then from
time to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network

really the beautiful woman up there doesnt interest me very much for i
am in love with someone else and terribly unhappy at that far more
unhappy than the knight of toggenburg or the chevalier in manon
lescault because the object of my adoration is of stone

in the garden in the tiny wilderness there is a graceful little
meadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully on this meadow is
a stone statue of venus the original of which i believe is in
florence this venus is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen in
all my life

that however does not signify much for i have seen few beautiful
women or rather few women at all in love too i am a dilettante who
never got beyond the preparation the first act

but why talk in superlatives as if something that is beautiful
could be surpassed

it is sufficient to say that this venus is beautiful i love her
passionately with a morbid intensity madly as one can only love a
woman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally
uniform eternally calm stony smile i literally adore her

i often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when
the sun broods over the forest often i visit that cold cruel
mistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her with the
face pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest and
my prayers go up to her

the rising moon which just now is waning produces an indescribable
effect it seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow
in its gleam of silver the goddess stands as if transfigured and
seems to bathe in the soft moonlight

once when i was returning from my devotions by one of the walks
leading to the house i suddenly saw a womans figure white as
stone under the illumination of the moon and separated from me
merely by a screen of trees it seemed as if the beautiful woman of
marble had taken pity on me become alive and followed me i was
seized by a nameless fear my heart threatened to burst and instead

well i am a dilettante as always i broke down at the second
stanza rather on the contrary i did not break down but ran away
as fast as my legs would carry me

                            

what an accident through a jew dealing in photographs i secured a
picture of my ideal it is a small reproduction of titians venus
with the mirror what a woman i want to write a poem but instead
i take the reproduction and write on it venus in furs

you are cold while you yourself fan flames by all means wrap
yourself in your despotic furs there is no one to whom they are more
appropriate cruel goddess of love and of beautyafter a while i add
a few verses from goethe which i recently found in his paralipomena
to faust

to amor

the pair of wings a fiction are
the arrows they are naught but claws
the wreath conceals the little horns
for without any doubt he is
like all the gods of ancient greece
only a devil in disguise

then i put the picture before me on my table supporting it with a
book and looked at it

i was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by
the cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms
in her furs of dark sable by the severity and hardness which lay in
this cold marblelike face again i took my pen in hand and wrote
the following words

to love to be loved what happiness and yet how the glamour of
this pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a
woman who makes a plaything out of us of being the slave of a
beautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot even samson the
hero the giant again put himself into the hands of delilah even
after she had betrayed him and again she betrayed him and the
philistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end
he kept fixed drunken with rage and love upon the beautiful
betrayer

i was breakfasting in my honeysuckle arbor and reading in the book
of judith i envied the hero holofernes because of the regal woman
who cut off his head with a sword and because of his beautiful
sanguinary end

the almighty lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman

this sentence strangely impressed me

how ungallant these jews are i thought and their god might choose
more becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex

the almighty lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the
hands of a woman i repeated to myself what shall i do so that he
may punish me

heaven preserve us here comes the housekeeper who has again
diminished somewhat in size overnight and up there among the green
twinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again is it venus
or the widow

this time it happens to be the widow for madame tartakovska makes
a courtesy and asks me in her name for something to read i run to
my room and gather together a couple of volumes

later i remember that my picture of venus is in one of them and now
it and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there
together what will she say

i hear her laugh

is she laughing at me

it is full moon it is already peering over the tops of the low
hemlocks that fringe the park a silvery exhalation fills the
terrace the groups of trees all the landscape as far as the eye
can reach in the distance it gradually fades away like trembling
waters

i cannot resist i feel a strange urge and call within me i put on
my clothes again and go out into the garden

some power draws me toward the meadow toward her who is my
divinity and my beloved

the night is cool i feel a slight chill the atmosphere is heavy
with the odor of flowers and of the forest it intoxicates

what solemnity what music round about a nightingale sobs the
stars quiver very faintly in the paleblue glamour the meadow seems
smooth like a mirror like a covering of ice on a pond

the statue of venus stands out august and luminous

butwhat has happened from the marble shoulders of the goddess a
large dark fur flows down to her heels i stand dumbfounded and stare
at her in amazement again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me
and i take flight

i hasten my steps and notice that i have missed the main path as
i am about to turn aside into one of the green walks i see venus
sitting before me on a stone bench not the beautiful woman of
marble but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing
pulses she has actually come to life for me like the statue that
began to breathe for her creator indeed the miracle is only half
completed her white hair seems still to be of stone and her white
gown shimmers like moonlight or is it satin from her shoulders the
dark fur flows but her lips are already reddening and her cheeks
begin to take color two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall
upon me and now she laughs

her laughter is very mysterious veryi dont know it cannot be
described it takes my breath away i flee further and after every
few steps i have to pause to take breath the mocking laughter
pursues me through the dark leafy paths across light open spaces
through the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce i can no
longer find my way i wander about utterly confused with cold drops
of perspiration on the forehead

finally i stand still and engage in a short monologue

it runswellone is either very polite to ones self or very rude

i say to myself

donkey

this word exercises a remarkable effect like a magic formula which
sets me free and makes me master of myself

i am perfectly quiet in a moment

with considerable pleasure i repeat donkey

now everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again
there is the fountain there the alley of boxwood there the house
which i am slowly approaching

yetsuddenly the appearance is here again behind the green screen
through which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with
silver i again see the white figure the woman of stone whom i
adore whom i fear and flee

with a couple of leaps i am within the house and catch my breath and
reflect

what am i really a little dilettante or a great big donkey

a sultry morning the atmosphere is dead heavily laden with odors
yet stimulating again i am sitting in my honeysuckle arbor reading
in the odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers
into beasts a wonderful picture of antique love

there is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my
book rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling

a womans dress

she is therevenusbut without fursno this time it is merely
the widowand yetvenusoh what a woman

as she stands there in her light white morning gown looking at me her
slight figure seems full of poetry and grace she is neither large nor
small her head is alluring piquantin the sense of the period of the
french marquisesrather than formally beautiful what enchantment and
softness what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth her
skin is so infinitely delicate that the blue veins show through
everywhere even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom how
abundant her red hairit is red not blonde or goldenyellowhow
diabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck now her eyes
meet mine like green lightningsthey are green these eyes of hers
whose power is so indescribablegreen but as are precious stones or
deep unfathomable mountain lakes

she observes my confusion which has even made me discourteous for i
have remained seated and still have my cap on my head

she smiles roguishly

finally i rise and bow to her she comes closer and bursts out into
a loud almost childlike laughter i stammer as only a little
dilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion

thus our acquaintance began

the divinity asks for my name and mentions her own

her name is wanda von dunajew

and she is actually my venus

but madame what put the idea into your head

the little picture in one of your books

i had forgotten about it

the curious notes on its back

why curious

she looked at me

i have always wanted to know a real dreamer some timefor the sake
of the changeand you seem one of the maddest of the tribe

dear ladyin fact again i fell victim to an odious asinine
stammering and in addition blushed in a way that might have been
appropriate for a youngster of sixteen but not for me who was
almost a full ten years older

you were afraid of me last night

reallyof coursebut wont you sit down

she sat down and enjoyed my embarrassmentfor actually i was even
more afraid of her now in the full light of day a delightful
expression of contempt hovered about her upper lip

you look at love and especially woman she began as something
hostile something against which you put up a defense even if
unsuccessfully you feel that their power over you gives you a
sensation of pleasurable torture of pungent cruelty this is a
genuinely modern point of view

you dont share it

i do not share it she said quickly and decisively shaking her
head so that her curls flew up like red flames

the ideal which i strive to realize in my life is the serene
sensuousness of the greekspleasure without pain i do not believe
in the kind of love which is preached by christianity by the
moderns by the knights of the spirit yes look at me i am worse
than a heretic i am a pagan

doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel
when in idas grove she was pleased with the hero achilles

these lines from goethes roman elegy have always delighted me

in nature there is only the love of the heroic age when gods and
goddesses loved at that time desire followed the glance enjoyment
desire all else is factitious affected a lie christianity whose
cruel emblem the cross has always had for me an element of the
monstrous brought something alien and hostile into nature and its
innocent instincts

the battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern
man i do not care to have a share in it

yes mount olympus would be the place for you madame i replied
but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity least of
all in love the idea of sharing a woman even if it were an aspasia
with another revolts us we are jealous as is our god for example
we have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious phryne

we prefer one of holbeins meagre pallid virgins which is wholly
ours to an antique venus no matter how divinely beautiful she is
but who loves anchises today paris tomorrow adonis the day after
and if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing
passionate devotion to such a woman her serene joy of life appears
to us as something demonic and cruel and we read into our happiness
a sin which we must expiate

so you too are one of those who rave about modern women those
miserable hysterical feminine creatures who dont appreciate a real
man in their somnambulistic search for some dreamman and masculine
ideal amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their christian
duties they cheat and are cheated they always seek again and choose
and reject they are never happy and never give happiness they
accuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and
live as helen and aspasia lived nature admits of no permanence in
the relation between man and woman

but my dear lady

let me finish it is only mans egoism which wants to keep woman
like some buried treasure all endeavors to introduce permanence in
love the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence
have gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies vows and
legalities can you deny that our christian world has given itself
over to corruption

but

but you are about to say the individual who rebels against the
arrangements of society is ostracized branded stoned so be it i
am willing to take the risk my principles are very pagan i will
live my own life as it pleases me i am willing to do without your
hypocritical respect i prefer to be happy the inventors of the
christian marriage have done well simultaneously to invent
immortality i however have no wish to live eternally when with
my last breath everything as far as wanda von dunajew is concerned
comes to an end here below what does it profit me whether my pure
spirit joins the choirs of angels or whether my dust goes into the
formation of new beings shall i belong to one man whom i dont love
merely because i have once loved him no i do not renounce i love
everyone who pleases me and give happiness to everyone who loves me
is that ugly no it is more beautiful by far than if cruelly i
enjoy the tortures which my beauty excites and virtuously reject
the poor fellow who is pining away for me i am young rich and
beautiful and i live serenely for the sake of pleasure and
enjoyment

while she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly and i had taken
hold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them but
being a genuine dilettante i hastily let go of them again

your frankness i said delights me and not it alone

my confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were
a rope around my neck

you were about to say

i was about to sayi wasi am sorryi interrupted you

how so

a long pause she is doubtless engaging in a monologue which
translated into my language would be comprised in the single word
donkey

if i may ask i finally began how did you arrive at thesethese
conclusions

quite simply my father was an intelligent man from my cradle onward
i was surrounded by replicas of ancient art at ten years of age i
read gil blas at twelve la pucelle where others had
hopomythumb bluebeard cinderella as childhood friends mine
were venus and apollo hercules and lackoon my husbands personality
was filled with serenity and sunlight not even the incurable illness
which fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow
on the very night of his death he took me in his arms and during the
many months when he lay dying in his wheel chair he often said
jokingly to me well have you already picked out a lover i blushed
with shame dont deceive me he added on one occasion that would
seem ugly to me but pick out an attractive lover or preferably
several you are a splendid woman but still half a child and you
need toys

i suppose i hardly need tell you that during his life time i had
no lover but it was through him that i have become what i am a
woman of greece

a goddess i interrupted

which one she smiled

venus

she threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows perhaps
even a venus in furs watch out i have a large very large fur
with which i could cover you up entirely and i have a mind to catch
you in it as in a net

do you believe i said quickly for an idea which seemed good in
spite of its conventionality and triteness flashed into my head do
you believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the
present time that venus would be permitted to stray with impunity
among our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and
serenity

undraped of course not but in furs she replied smiling would
you care to see mine

and then

what then

beautiful free serene and happy human beings such as the greeks
were are only possible when it is permitted to have slaves who will
perform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else
labor for them

of course she replied playfully an olympian divinity such as
i am requires a whole army of slaves beware of me

why

i myself was frightened at the hardiness with which i uttered this
why it did not startle her in the least

she drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became
visible and then said lightly as if she were discussing some
trifling matter do you want to be my slave

there is no equality in love i replied solemnly whenever it is
a matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled it seems much
more satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman but
where shall i find the woman who knows how to rule calmly full of
selfconfidence even harshly and not seek to gain her power by
means of petty nagging

oh that might not be so difficult

you think

ifor instance she laughed and leaned far backi have a real
talent for despotismi also have the necessary fursbut last night
you were really seriously afraid of me

quite seriously

and now

now i am more afraid of you than ever

we are together every day i andvenus we are together a great
deal we breakfast in my honeysuckle arbor and have tea in her
little sittingroom i have an opportunity to unfold all my small
very small talents of what use would have been my study of all the
various sciences my playing at all the arts if i were unable in the
case of a pretty little woman

but this woman is by no means little in fact she impresses me
tremendously i made a drawing of her today and felt particularly
clearly how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a
cameohead like hers the configuration of her face has little of the
roman but much of the greek

sometimes i should like to paint her as psyche and then again as
astarte it depends upon the expression in her eyes whether it is
vaguely dreamy or halfconsuming filled with tired desire
she however insists that it be a portraitlikeness

i shall make her a present of furs

how could i have any doubts if not for her for whom would princely
furs be suitable

                            

i was with her yesterday evening reading the roman elegies to her
then i laid the book aside and improvised something for her she
seemed pleased rather more than that she actually hung upon my
words and her bosom heaved

or was i mistaken

the rain beat in melancholy fashion on the windowpanes the fire
crackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort i felt quite at home
with her and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman
i kissed her hand and she permitted it

then i sat down at her feet and read a short poem i had written for
her

venus in furs

place thy foot upon thy slave
oh thou half of hell half of dreams
among the shadows dark and grave
thy extended body softly gleams

andso on this time i really got beyond the first stanza at her
request i gave her the poem in the evening keeping no copy and now
as i am writing this down in my diary i can only remember the first
stanza

i am filled with a very curious sensation i dont believe that i am
in love with wanda i am sure that at our first meeting i felt
nothing of the lightninglike flashes of passion but i feel how her
extraordinary really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares
about me it isnt any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me it
is a physical subjection coming on slowly but for that reason more
absolutely

i suffer under it more and more each day and sheshe merely smiles

                            

without any provocation she suddenly said to me today you
interest me most men are very commonplace without verve or poetry
in you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a
deep seriousness which delight me i might learn to love you

after a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow
and the statue of venus all about us the earth steamed mists rose
up toward heaven like clouds of incense a shattered rainbow still
hovered in the air the trees were still shedding drops but sparrows
and finches were already hopping from twig to twig they are
twittering gaily as if very much pleased at something everything
is filled with a fresh fragrance we cannot cross the meadow for it
is still wet in the sunlight it looks like a small pool and the
goddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirrorlike
surface about her head a swarm of gnats is dancing which
illuminated by the sun seem to hover above her like an aureole

wanda is enjoying the lovely scene as all the benches along the
walk are still wet she supports herself on my arm to rest a while
a soft weariness permeates her whole being her eyes are half closed
i feel the touch of her breath on my cheek

how i managed to get up courage enough i really dont know but i
took hold of her hand asking

could you love me

why not she replied letting her calm clear look rest upon me
but not for long

a moment later i am kneeling before her pressing my burning face
against the fragrant muslin of her gown

but severinthis isnt right she cried

but i take hold of her little foot and press my lips upon it

you are getting worse and worse she cried she tore herself free
and fled rapidly toward the house the while her adorable slipper
remained in my hand

is it an omen

                            

all day long i didnt dare to go near her toward evening as i was
sitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the
greenery of her balcony why dont you come up he called down
impatiently

i ran upstairs and at the top lost courage again i knocked very
lightly she didnt say comein but opened the door herself and
stood on the threshold

where is my slipper

it isi havei want i stammered

get it and then we will have tea together and chat

when i returned she was engaged in making tea i ceremoniously
placed the slipper on the table and stood in the corner like a child
awaiting punishment

i noticed that her brows were slightly contracted and there was an
expression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted
me

all of a sudden she broke out laughing

soyou are really in lovewith me

yes and i suffer more from it than you can imagine

you suffer she laughed again

i was revolted mortified annihilated but all this was quite
useless

why she continued i like you with all my heart

she gave me her hand and looked at me in the friendliest fashion

and will you be my wife

wanda looked at mehow did she look at me i think first of all
with surprise and then with a tinge of irony

what has given you so much courage all at once

courage

yes courage to ask anyone to be your wife and me in particular
she lifted up the slipper was it through a sudden friendship with
this but joking aside do you really wish to marry me

yes

well severin that is a serious matter i believe you love me
and i care for you too and what is more important each of us finds
the other interesting there is no danger that we would soon get
bored but you know i am a fickle person and just for that reason
i take marriage seriously if i assume obligations i want to be able
to meet them but i am afraidnoit would hurt you

please be perfectly frank with me i replied

well then honestly i dont believe i could love a man longer than
she inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused

a year

what do you imaginea month perhaps

not even me

oh youperhaps two

two months i exclaimed

two months is very long

you go beyond antiquity madame

you see you cannot stand the truth

wanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace
watching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece

what shall i do with you she began anew

whatever you wish i replied with resignation whatever will give
you pleasure

how illogical she cried first you want to make me your wife
and then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with

wandai love you

now we are back to the place where we started you love me and
want to make me your wife but i dont want to enter into a new
marriage because i doubt the permanence of both my and your
feelings

but if i am willing to take the risk with you i replied

but it also depends on whether i am willing to risk it with you
she said quietly i can easily imagine belonging to one man for my
entire life but he would have to be a whole man a man who would
dominate me who would subjugate me by his inate strength do you
understand and every mani know this very wellas soon as he falls
in love becomes weak pliable ridiculous he puts himself into the
womans hands kneels down before her the only man whom i could love
permanently would be he before whom i should have to kneel ive gotten
to like you so much however that ill try it with you

i fell down at her feet

for heavens sake here you are kneeling already she said
mockingly you are making a good beginning when i had risen again
she continued i will give you a years time to win me to convince
me that we are suited to each other that we might live together if
you succeed i will become your wife and a wife severin who will
conscientiously and strictly perform all her duties during this year
we will live as though we were married

my blood rose to my head

in her eyes too there was a sudden flame

we will live together she continued share our daily life so that
we may find out whether we are really fitted for each other i grant
you all the rights of a husband of a lover of a friend are you
satisfied

i suppose ill have to be

you dont have to

well then i want to

splendid that is how a man speaks here is my hand

                            

for ten days i have been with her every hour except at night all
the time i was allowed to look into her eyes hold her hands listen
to what she said accompany her wherever she went

my love seems to me like a deep bottomless abyss into which i
subside deeper and deeper there is nothing now which could save me
from it

this afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the
venusstatue i plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap she
wound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess

suddenly wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became
confused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration losing
command over myself i threw my arms about her and clung to her lips
and sheshe drew me close to her heaving breast

are you angry i then asked her

i am never angry at anything that is natural she replied but
i am afraid you suffer

oh i am suffering frightfully

poor friend she brushed my disordered hair back from my forehead i
hope it isnt through any fault of mine

no i repliedand yet my love for you has become a sort of
madness the thought that i might lose you perhaps actually lose
you torments me day and night

but you dont yet possess me said wanda and again she looked at
me with that vibrant consuming expression which had already once
before carried me away then she rose and with her small transparent
hands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head
of venus half against my will i threw my arm around her body

i can no longer live without you oh wonderful woman i said
believe me believe only this once that this time it is not a
phrase not a thing of dreams i feel deep down in my innermost soul
that my life belongs inseparably with yours if you leave me i shall
perish go to pieces

that will hardly be necessary for i love you she took hold of my
chin you foolish man

but you will be mine only under conditions while i belong to you
unconditionally

that isnt wise severin she replied almost with a start dont
you know me yet do you absolutely refuse to know me i am good when
i am treated seriously and reasonably but when you abandon yourself
too absolutely to me i grow arrogant

so be it be arrogant be despotic i cried in the fulness of
exaltation only be mine mine forever i lay at her feet
embracing her knees

things will end badly my friend she said soberly without moving

it shall never end i cried excitedly almost violently only death
shall part us if you cannot be mine all mine and for always then i
want to be your slave serve you suffer everything from you if only
you wont drive me away

calm yourself she said bending down and kissing my forehead i
am really very fond of you but your way is not the way to win and
hold me

i want to do everything absolutely everything that you want only
not to lose you i cried only not that i cannot bear the thought

do get up

i obeyed

you are a strange person continued wanda you wish to possess me
at any price

yes at any price

but of what value for instance would that beshe pondered a
lurking uncanny expression entered her eyesif i no longer loved
you if i belonged to another

a shudder ran through me i looked at her she stood firmly and
confident before me and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam

you see she continued the very thought frightens you a
beautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face

i feel a perfect horror when i imagine that the woman i love and
who has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless
of me but have i still a choice if i love such a woman even unto
madness shall i turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake
of a bit of boastful strength shall i send a bullet through my
brains i have two ideals of woman if i cannot obtain the one that
is noble and simple the woman who will faithfully and truly share
my life well then i dont want anything halfway or lukewarm then
i would rather be subject to a woman without virtue fidelity or pity
such a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal if
i am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love fully and wholly
i want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs i want to
be maltreated and betrayed by the woman i love and the more cruelly
the better this too is a luxury

have you lost your senses cried wanda

i love you with all my soul i continued with all my senses and
your presence and personality are absolutely essential to me if i
am to go on living choose between my ideals do with me what you will
make of me your husband or your slave

very well said wanda contracting her small but strongly arched
brows it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man
who interests me and loves me completely in my power at least i
shall not lack pastime you were imprudent enough to leave the choice
to me therefore i choose i want you to be my slave i shall make
a plaything for myself out of you

oh please do i cried halfshuddering halfenraptured if the
foundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement it is
likewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites we
are such opposites almost enemies that is why my love is part hate
part fear in such a relation only one can be hammer and the other
anvil i wish to be the anvil i cannot be happy when i look down
upon the woman i love i want to adore a woman and this i can only
do when she is cruel towards me

but severin replied wanda almost angrily do you believe me
capable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do and whom i love

why not if i adore you the more on this account it is possible to
love really only that which stands above us a woman who through her
beauty temperament intelligence and strength of will subjugates us
and becomes a despot over us

then that which repels others attracts you

yes that is the strange part of me

perhaps after all there isnt anything so very unique or strange
in all your passions for who doesnt love beautiful furs and
everyone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are
related

but in my case all these elements are raised to their highest
degree i replied

in other words reason has little power over you and you are by
nature soft sensual yielding

were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature

the martyrs

on the contrary they were supersensual men who found enjoyment in
suffering they sought out the most frightful tortures even death
itself as others seek joy and as they were so am isupersensual

have a care that in being such you do not become a martyr to love
the martyr of a woman

we are sitting on wandas little balcony in the mellow fragrant
summer night a twofold roof is above us first the green ceiling of
climbingplants and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable
stars the low wailing lovecall of a cat rises from the park i am
sitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity and am telling her
of my childhood

and even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked
in you asked wanda

of course i cant remember a time when i didnt have them even in
my cradle so mother has told me i was supersensual i scorned the
healthy breast of my nurse and had to be brought up on goats milk
as a little boy i was mysteriously shy before women which really was
only an expression of an inordinate interest in them i was oppressed
by the gray arches and halfdarknesses of the church and actually
afraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints secretly
however i sneaked as to a secret joy to a plastervenus which stood
in my fathers little library i kneeled down before her and to her i
said the prayers i had been taughtthe paternoster the ave maria
and the credo

once at night i left my bed to visit her the sickle of the moon
was my light and showed me the goddess in a paleblue cold light i
prostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet as i had seen
our peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead savior

an irresistible yearning seized me

i got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold
lips a deep shudder fell upon me and i fled and later in a dream
it seemed to me as if the goddess stood beside my bed threatening
me with upraised arm

i was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium i
passionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world
of antiquity accessible to me soon i was more familiar with the gods
of greece than with the religion of jesus i was with paris when he
gave the fateful apple to venus i saw troy burn and followed
ulysses on his wanderings the prototypes of all that is beautiful
sank deep into my soul and consequently at the time when other boys
are coarse and obscene i displayed an insurmountable aversion to
everything base vulgar unbeautiful

to me the maturing youth love for women seemed something
especially base and unbeautiful for it showed itself to me first in
all its commonness i avoided all contact with the fair sex in
short i was supersensual to madness

when i was about fourteen my mother had a charming chambermaid
young attractive with a figure just budding into womanhood i was
sitting one day studying my tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the
virtues of the ancient teutons while she was sweeping my room
suddenly she stopped bent down over me in the meantime holding fast
to the broom and a pair of fresh full adorable lips touched mine
the kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder
but i raised up my germania like a shield against the temptress
and indignantly left the room

wanda broke out in loud laughter it would indeed be hard to find
another man like you but continue

there is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period
i continued my story countess sobol a distant aunt of mine was
visiting my parents she was a beautiful majestic woman with an
attractive smile i however hated her for she was regarded by the
family as a sort of messalina my behavior toward her was as rude
malicious and awkward as possible

one day my parents drove to the capital of the district my aunt
determined to take advantage of their absence and to exercise
judgment over me she entered unexpectedly in her furlined
kazabaika footnote a womans jacket followed by the cook
kitchenmaid and the cat of a chambermaid whom i had scorned
without asking any questions they seized me and bound me hand and
foot in spite of my violent resistance then my aunt with an evil
smile rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch
she whipped so hard that the blood flowed and that at last
notwithstanding my heroic spirit i cried and wept and begged for
mercy she then had me untied but i had to get down on my knees and
thank her for the punishment and kiss her hand

now you understand the supersensual fool under the lash of a
beautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman in her
furjacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen and from then on
my aunt became the most desirable woman on gods earth

my catolike austerity my shyness before woman was nothing but an
excessive feeling for beauty in my imagination sensuality became a
sort of cult i took an oath to myself that i would not squander its
holy wealth upon any ordinary person but i would reserve it for an
ideal woman if possible for the goddess of love herself

i went to the university at a very early age it was in the capital
where my aunt lived my room looked at that time like doctor
faustuss everything in it was in a wild confusion there were huge
closets stuffed full of books which i bought for a song from a
jewish dealer on the servanica footnote the street of the jews in
lemberg there were globes atlases flasks charts of the heavens
skeletons of animals skulls the busts of eminent men it looked as
though mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge
green store as a wandering scholiast at any moment

i studied everything in a jumble without system without selection
chemistry alchemy history astronomy philosophy law anatomy and
literature i read homer virgil ossian schiller goethe
shakespeare cervantes voltaire moliere the koran the kosmos
casanovas memoirs i grew more confused each day more fantastical
more supersensual all the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my
imagination every so and so often she appeared before me like a
vision among my leatherbound books and dead bones lying on a bed of
roses surrounded by cupids sometimes she appeared gowned like the
olympians with the stern white face of the plaster venus sometimes in
braids of a rich brown blueeyes in my aunts red velvet
kazabaika trimmed with ermine

one morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my
imagination in all her smiling beauty i went to see countess sobol
who received me in a friendly even cordial manner she gave me a
kiss of welcome which put all my senses in a turmoil she was
probably about forty years old but like most wellpreserved women
of the world still very attractive she wore as always her furedged
jacket this time it was one of green velvet with brown marten but
nothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was
now discernable

on the contrary there was so little of cruelty in her that without
any more ado she let me adore her

only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence
and it pleased her to make me happy as for myselfi was as happy
as a young god what rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her
on my knees and to kiss her hands those with which she had scourged
me what marvellous hands they were of beautiful form delicate
rounded and white with adorable dimples i really was in love with
her hands only i played with them let them submerge and emerge in
the dark fur held them against the light and was unable to satiate
my eyes with them

wanda involuntarily looked at her hand i noticed it and had to
smile

from the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those
days you can see that i was in love only with the cruel lashes i
received from my aunt and about two years later when i paid court
to a young actress only in the roles she played still later i became
the admirer of a respectable woman she acted the part of
irreproachable virtue only in the end to betray me with a rich jew
you see it is because i was betrayed sold by a woman who feigned
the strictest principles and the highest ideals that i hate that
sort of poetical sentimental virtue so intensely give me rather a
woman who is honest enough to say to me i am a pompadour a lucretia
borgia and i am ready to adore her

wanda rose and opened the window

you have a curious way of arousing ones imagination stimulating
all ones nerves and making ones pulses beat faster you put an
aureole on vice provided only if it is honest your ideal is a
daring courtesan of genius oh you are the kind of man who will
corrupt a woman to her very last fiber

                            

in the middle of the night there was a knock at my window i got up
opened it and was startled without stood venus in furs just as
she had appeared to me the first time

you have disturbed me with your stories i have been tossing about
in bed and cant go to sleep she said now come and stay with me

in a moment

as i entered wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had
kindled a small fire

autumn is coming she began the nights are really quite cold
already i am afraid you may not like it but i cant put off my furs
until the room is sufficiently warm

not like ityou are jokingyou know i threw my arm around her
and kissed her

of course i know but why this great fondness for furs

i was born with it i replied i already had it as a child
furthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized
natures this is due both to general and natural laws it is a
physical stimulus which sets you tingling and no one can wholly
escape it science has recently shown a certain relationship between
electricity and warmth at any rate their effects upon the human
organism are related the torrid zone produces more passionate
characters a heated atmosphere stimulation likewise with
electricity this is the reason why the presence of cats exercises
such a magic influence upon highlyorganized men of intellect this
is why these longtailed graces of the animal kingdom these
adorable scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite
animal of a mahommed cardinal richelieu crebillon rousseau
wieland

a woman wearing furs then cried wanda is nothing else than a
large cat an augmented electric battery

certainly i replied that is my explanation of the symbolic
meaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty
monarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in
this sense for their costume exclusively great painters used it
only for queenly beauty the most beautiful frame which raphael
could find for the divine forms of fornarina and titian for the
roseate body of his beloved was dark furs

thanks for the learned discourse on love said wanda but you
havent told me everything you associate something entirely
individual with furs

certainly i cried i have repeatedly told you that suffering has
a peculiar attraction for me nothing can intensify my passion more
than tyranny cruelty and especially the faithlessness of a
beautiful woman and i cannot imagine this woman this strange ideal
derived from an aesthetics of ugliness this soul of nero in the body
of a phryne except in furs

i understand wanda interrupted it gives a dominant and imposing
quality to a woman

not only that i continued you know i am supersensual with me
everything has its roots in the imagination and thence it receives
its nourishment i was already prematurely developed and highly
sensitive when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs
fell into my hands i remember reading with a kind of horror which
really was rapture of how they pined in prisons were laid on the
gridiron pierced with arrows boiled in pitch thrown to wild
animals nailed to the cross and suffered the most horrible torment
with a kind of joy to suffer and endure cruel torture from then on
seemed to me exquisite delight especially when it was inflicted by a
beautiful woman for ever since i can remember all poetry and
everything demonic was for me concentrated in woman i literally
carried the idea into a sort of cult

i felt there was something sacred in sex in fact it was the only
sacred thing in woman and her beauty i saw something divine because
the most important function of existencethe continuation of the
speciesis her vocation to me woman represented a personification of
nature isis and man was her priest her slave in contrast to him
she was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served
her purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it to him her
cruelties even death itself still were sensual raptures

i envied king gunther whom the mighty brunhilde fettered on the
bridal night and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress
had sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game i
envied the knight ctirad whom the daring amazon scharka craftily
ensnared in a forest near prague and carried to her castle divin
where after having amused herself a while with him she had him
broken on the wheel

disgusting cried wanda i almost wish you might fall into the
hands of a woman of their savage race in the wolfs skin under the
teeth of the dogs or upon the wheel you would lose the taste for
your kind of poetry

do you think so i hardly do

have you actually lost your senses

possibly but let me go on i developed a perfect passion for
reading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described i
loved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented
them all the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne the
inquisitors who had the heretics tortured roasted and butchered
all the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful
beautiful and violent women like libussa lucretia borgia agnes of
hungary queen margot isabeau the sultana roxolane the russian
czarinas of last centuryall these i saw in furs or in robes
bordered with ermine

and so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you said wanda and
simultaneously she began to drape her magnificent furcloak
coquettishly about her so that the dark shining sable played
beautifully around her bust and arms well how do you feel now
half broken on the wheel

her piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking
satisfaction overcome by desire i flung myself down before her and
threw my arms about her

yesyou have awakened my dearest dream i cried it has slept
long enough

and this is she put her hand on my neck

i was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this
warm little hand and of her regard which tenderly searching fell
upon me through her halfclosed lids

to be the slave of a woman a beautiful woman whom i love whom
i worship

and who on that account maltreats you interrupted wanda laughing

yes who fetters me and whips me treads me underfoot the while
she gives herself to another

and who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of
you to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must
meet him face to face who will turn you over to his absolute mercy
why not this final tableau doesnt please you so well

i looked at wanda frightened

you surpass my dreams

yes we women are inventive she said take heed when you find
your ideal it might easily happen that she will treat you more
cruelly than you anticipate

i am afraid that i have already found my ideal i exclaimed
burying my burning face in her lap

not i exclaimed wanda throwing off her furs and moving about the
room laughing she was still laughing as i went downstairs and when
i stood musing in the yard i still heard her peals of laughter above

                            

do you really then expect me to embody your ideal wanda asked
archly when we met in the park today

at first i could find no answer the most antagonistic emotions were
battling within me in the meantime she sat down on one of the
stonebenches and played with a flower

wellam i

i kneeled down and seized her hands

once more i beg you to become my wife my true and loyal wife if
you cant do that then become the embodiment of my ideal absolutely
without reservation without softness

you know i am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand if
you prove to be the man i am seeking wanda replied very seriously
but i think you would be more grateful to me if through me you
realized your imaginings well which do you prefer

i believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in
your personality

you are mistaken

i believe i continued that you enjoy having a man wholly in
your power torturing him

no no she exclaimed quickly or perhaps she pondered

i dont understand myself any longer she continued but i have
a confession to make to you you have corrupted my imagination and
inflamed my blood i am beginning to like the things you speak of
the enthusiasm with which you speak of a pompadour a catherine the
second and all the other selfish frivolous cruel women carries
me away and takes hold of my soul it urges me on to become like those
women who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during
their lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves

you will end by making of me a despot in miniature a domestic
pompadour

well then i said in agitation if all this is inherent in you
give way to this trend of your nature nothing halfway if you cant
be a true and loyal wife to me be a demon

i was nervous from loss of sleep and the proximity of the beautiful
woman affected me like a fever i no longer recall what i said but
i remember that i kissed her feet and finally raised her foot and
put my neck under it she withdrew it quickly and rose almost angrily

if you love me severin she said quickly and her voice sounded
sharp and commanding never speak to me of those things again
understand never otherwise i might really she smiled and sat
down again

i am entirely serious i exclaimed halfraving i adore you so
infinitely that i am willing to suffer anything from you for the
sake of spending my whole life near you

severin once more i warn you

your warning is vain do with me what you will as long as you
dont drive me away

severin replied wanda i am a frivolous young woman it is
dangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power you will
end by actually becoming a plaything to me who will give warrant
that i shall not abuse your insane desire

your own nobility of character

power makes people overbearing

be it i cried tread me underfoot

wanda threw her arms around my neck looked into my eyes and shook
her head

i am afraid i cant but i will try for your sake for i love you
severin as i have loved no other man

                            

today she suddenly took her hat and shawl and i had to go shopping
with her she looked at whips long whips with a short handle the
kind that are used on dogs

are these satisfactory said the shopkeeper

no they are much too small replied wanda with a sideglance at
me i need a large

for a bulldog i suppose opined the merchant

yes she exclaimed of the kind that are used in russia for
intractable slaves

she looked further and finally selected a whip at whose sight i
felt a strange creeping sensation

now goodby severin she said i have some other purchases to
make but you cant go along

i left her and took a walk on the way back i saw wanda coming out
at a furriers she beckoned me

consider it well she began in good spirits i have never made a
secret of how deeply your serious dreamy character has fascinated
me the idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power actually
lying enraptured at my feet of course stimulates mebut will this
attraction last woman loves a man she maltreats a slave and ends
by kicking him aside

very well then kick me aside i replied when you are tired of
me i want to be your slave

dangerous forces lie within me said wanda after we had gone a
few steps further you awaken them and not to your advantage you
know how to paint pleasure cruelty arrogance in glowing colors
what would you say should i try my hand at them and make you the
first object of my experiments i would be like dionysius who had the
inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his
wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox

perhaps i am a female dionysius

be it i exclaimed and my dreams will be fulfilled i am yours
for good or evil choose the destiny that lies concealed within my
breast drives me ondemoniacallyrelentlessly

my beloved

i do not care to see you today or tomorrow and not until evening
the day after tomorrow and then as my slave

your mistress

wanda

as my slave was underlined i read the note which i received early
in the morning a second time then i had a donkey saddled an animal
symbolic of learned professors and rode into the mountains i wanted
to numb my desire my yearning with the magnificent scenery of the
carpathians i am back tired hungry thirsty and more in love than
ever i quickly change my clothes and a few moments later knock at
her door

come in

i enter she is standing in the center of the room dressed in a gown
of white satin which floods down her body like light over it she
wears a scarlet kazabaika richly edged with ermine upon her
powdered snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds she stands with
her arms folded across her breast and with her brows contracted

wanda i run toward her and am about to throw my arm about her to
kiss her she retreats a step measuring me from top to bottom

slave

mistress i kneel down and kiss the hem of her garment

that is as it should be

oh how beautiful you are

do i please you she stepped before the mirror and looked at
herself with proud satisfaction

i shall become mad

her lower lip twitched derisively and she looked at me mockingly
from behind halfclosed lids

give me the whip

i looked about the room

no she exclaimed stay as you are kneeling she went over to
the fireplace took the whip from the mantlepiece and watching
me with a smile let it hiss through the air then she slowly rolled
up the sleeve of her furjacket

marvellous woman i exclaimed

silence slave she suddenly scowled looked savage and struck me
with the whip a moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me and
pityingly bent down to me did i hurt you she asked halfshyly
halftimidly

no i replied and even if you had pains that come through you
are a joy strike again if it gives you pleasure

but it doesnt give me pleasure

again i was seized with that strange intoxication

whip me i begged whip me without mercy

wanda swung the whip and hit me twice are you satisfied now

no

seriously no

whip me i beg you it is a joy to me

yes because you know very well that it isnt serious she
replied because i havent the heart to hurt you this brutal game
goes against my grain were i really the woman who beats her slaves
you would be horrified

no wanda i replied i love you more than myself i am devoted
to you for death and life in all seriousness you can do with me
whatever you will whatever your caprice suggests

severin

tread me underfoot i exclaimed and flung myself face to the
floor before her

i hate all this playacting said wanda impatiently

well then maltreat me seriously

an uncanny pause

severin i warn you for the last time began wanda

if you love me be cruel towards me i pleaded with upraised eyes

if i love you repeated wanda very well she stepped back and
looked at me with a sombre smile be then my slave and know what
it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman and at the
same moment she gave me a kick

how do you like that slave

then she flourished the whip

get up

i was about to rise

not that way she commanded on your knees

i obeyed and she began to apply the lash

the blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms each one
cut into my flesh and burned there but the pains enraptured me they
came from her whom i adored and for whom i was ready at any hour to
lay down my life

she stopped i am beginning to enjoy it she said but enough for
today i am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far
your strength goes i take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and
writhe beneath my whip and in hearing your groans and wails i want
to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy until you
lose your senses you have awakened dangerous elements in my being
but now get up

i seized her hand to press it to my lips

what impudence

she shoved me away with her foot

out of my sight slave

                            

after having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams i
awoke dawn was just beginning to break

how much of what was hovering in my memory was true what had i
actually experienced and what had i dreamed that i had been whipped
was certain i can still feel each blow and count the burning red
stripes on my body and she whipped me now i know everything

my dream has become truth how does it make me feel am i
disappointed in the realization of my dream

no i am merely somewhat tired but her cruelty has enraptured me
oh how i love her adore her all this cannot express in the
remotest way my feeling for her my complete devotion to her what
happiness to be her slave

                            

she calls to me from her balcony i hurry upstairs she is standing
on the threshold holding out her hand in friendly fashion i am
ashamed of myself she says while i embrace her and she hides her
head against my breast

why

please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday she said with
quivering voice i have fulfilled your mad wish now let us be
reasonable and happy and love each other and in a year i will be
your wife

my mistress i exclaimed and i your slave

not another word of slavery cruelty or the whip interrupted
wanda i shall not grant you any of those favors none except
wearing my furjacket come and help me into it

                            

the little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his
bolt struck midnight

i rose and wanted to leave

wanda said nothing but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman
she began to kiss me anew and this silent language was so
comprehensible so convincing

and it told me more than i dared to understand

a languid abandonment pervaded wandas entire being what a
voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her halfclosed
eyes in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the
white powder in the red and white satin which crackled about her
with every movement in the swelling ermine of the kazabaika
in which she carelessly nestled

please i stammered but you will be angry with me

do with me what you will she whispered

well then whip me or i shall go mad

havent i forbidden you said wanda sternly but you are
incorrigible

oh i am so terribly in love i had sunken on my knees and was
burying my glowing face in her lap

i really believe said wanda thoughtfully that your madness is
nothing but a demonic unsatisfied sensuality our unnatural way
of life must generate such illnesses were you less virtuous you
would be completely sane

well then make me sane i murmured my hands were running through
her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur which rose
and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom and drove all
my senses into confusion

and i kissed her no she kissed me savagely pitilessly as if she
wanted to slay me with her kisses i was as in a delirium and had
long since lost my reason but now i too was breathless i sought
to free myself

what is the matter asked wanda

i am suffering agonies

you are suffering she broke out into a loud amused laughter

you laugh i moaned have you no idea

she was serious all of a sudden she raised my head in her hands
and with a violent gesture drew me to her breast

wanda i stammered

of course you enjoy suffering she said and laughed again but
wait ill bring you to your senses

no i will no longer ask i exclaimed whether you want to belong
to me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication i want
to drain my happiness to the full you are mine now and i would
rather lose you than never to have had you

now you are sensible she said she kissed me again with her
murderous lips i tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and
her naked breast surged against mine

then my senses left me

the first thing i remember is the moment when i saw blood dripping
from my hand and she asked apathetically did you scratch me

no i believe i have bitten you

                            

it is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as
soon as a new person enters

we spent marvellous days together we visited the mountains and
lakes we read together and i completed wandas portrait and how
we loved one another how beautiful her smiling face was

then a friend of hers arrived a divorced woman somewhat older more
experienced and less scrupulous than wanda her influence is already
making itself felt in every direction

wanda wrinkles her brows and displays a certain impatience with me

has she ceased loving me

                            

for almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us
her friend lives with her and we are never alone a circle of men
surrounds the young women with my seriousness and melancholy i am
playing an absurd role as lover wanda treats me like a stranger

today while out walking she staid behind with me i saw that this
was done intentionally and i rejoiced but what did she tell me

my friend doesnt understand how i can love you she doesnt think
you either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise she is
telling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous
life in the capital hinting at the advantages to which i could lay
claim the large parties which i would find there and the
distinguished and handsome admirers which i would attract but of
what use is all this since it happens that i love you

for a moment i lost my breath then i said i have no wish to stand
in the way of your happiness wanda do not consider me then i
raised my hat and let her go ahead she looked at me surprised but
did not answer a syllable

when by chance i happened to be close to her on the way back she
secretly pressed my hand her glance was so radiant so full of
promised happiness that in a moment all the torments of these days
were forgotten and all their wounds healed

i now am aware again of how much i love her

                            

my friend has complained about you said wanda today

perhaps she feels that i despise her

but why do you despise her you foolish young man exclaimed
wanda pulling my ears with both hands

because she is a hypocrite i said i respect only a woman who is
actually virtuous or who openly lives for pleasures sake

like me for instance replied wanda jestingly but you see
child a woman can only do that in the rarest cases she can neither
be as gaily sensual nor as spiritually free as man her state is
always a mixture of the sensual and spiritual her heart desires to
enchain man permanently while she herself is ever subject to the
desire for change the result is a conflict and thus usually against
her wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality
and corrupt her character

certainly that is true i said the transcendental character with
which woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception

but the world likewise demands it wanda interrupted look at
this woman she has a husband and a lover in lemberg and has found
a new admirer here she deceives all three and yet is honored by all
and respected by the world

i dont care i exclaimed but she is to leave you alone she
treats you like an article of commerce

why not the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously every woman
has the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions
and much is to be said for giving ones self without love or pleasure
because if you do it in cold blood you can reap profit to best
advantage

wanda what are you saying

why not she said and take note of what i am about to say to you
never feel secure with the woman you love for there are more
dangers in womans nature than you imagine women are neither as
good as their admirers and defenders maintain nor as bad as their
enemies make them out to be womans character is characterlessness
the best woman will momentarily go down into the mire and the worst
unexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to
shame those that despise her no woman is so good or so bad but that
at any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the
most divine of the filthiest as well as of the purest thoughts
emotions and actions in spite of all the advances of civilization
woman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature she has the
nature of a savage who is faithful or faithless magnanimous or
cruel according to the impulse that dominates at the moment
throughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has
produced moral character man even when he is selfish or evil always
follows principles woman never follows anything but impulses
dont ever forget that and never feel secure with the woman you
love

                            

her friend has left at last an evening alone with her again it
seems as if wanda had saved up all the love which had been kept from
her for this superlative evening never had she been so kind so
near so full of tenderness

what happiness to cling to her lips and to die away in her arms in
a state of relaxation and wholly mine her head rests against my
breast and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other

i cannot yet believe comprehend that this woman is mine wholly
mine

she is right on one point wanda began without moving without
opening her eyes as if she were asleep

who

she remained silent

your friend

she nodded yes she is right you are not a man you are a
dreamer a charming cavalier and you certainly would be a priceless
slave but i cannot imagine you as husband

i was frightened

what is the matter you are trembling

i tremble at the thought of how easily i might lose you i replied

are you made less happy now because of this she replied does
it rob you of any of your joys that i have belonged to another
before i did to you that others after you will possess me and would
you enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you

wanda

you see she continued that would be a way out you wont ever
lose me then i care deeply for you and intellectually we are
harmonious and i should like to live with you always if in addition
to you i might have

what an idea i cried you fill me with a sort of horror

do you love me any the less

on the contrary

wanda had raised herself on her left arm i believe she said
that to hold a man permanently it is vitally important not to be
faithful to him what honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved
as a hetaira

there is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved
woman it is the highest kind of ecstacy

for you too wanda asked quickly

for me too

and if i should give you that pleasure wanda exclaimed mockingly

i shall suffer terrible agonies but i shall adore you the more
i replied but you would never deceive me you would have the daemonic
greatness of saying to me i shall love no one but you but i shall
make happy whoever pleases me

wanda shook her head i dont like deception i am honest but what
man exists who can support the burden of truth were i say to you
this serene sensual life this paganism is my ideal would you be
strong enough to bear it

certainly i could endure anything so as not to lose you i feel
how little i really mean to you

but severin

but it is so said i and just for that reason

for that reason you would she smiled roguishlyhave i guessed
it

be your slave i exclaimed be your unrestricted property
without a will of my own of which you could dispose as you wished
and which would therefore never be a burden to you while you drink
life at its fullness while surrounded by luxury you enjoy the
serene happiness and olympian love i want to be your servant put
on and take off your shoes

you really arent so far from wrong replied wanda for only as
my slave could you endure my loving others furthermore the freedom
of enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery it
must give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before
one and tremble i want a slave do you hear severin

am i not your slave

then listen to me said wanda excitedly seizing my hand i want
to be yours as long as i love you

a month

perhaps even two

and then

then you become my slave

and you

i why do you ask i am a goddess and sometimes i descend from my
olympian heights to you softly very softly and secretly

but what does all this mean said wanda resting her head in both
hands with her gaze lost in the distance a golden fancy which never
can become true an uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her
entire being i have never seen her like that

why unachievable i began

because slavery doesnt exist any longer

then we will go to a country where it still exists to the orient
to turkey i said eagerly

you wouldseverinin all seriousness wanda replied her eyes
burned

yes in all seriousness i want to be your slave i continued i
want your power over me to be sanctified by law i want my life to
be in your hands i want nothing that could protect or save me from
you oh what a voluptuous joy when once i feel myself entirely dependent
upon your absolute will your whim at your beck and call and then
what happiness when at some time you deign to be gracious and the
slave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him i knelt
down and leaned my burning forehead against her knee

you are talking as in a fever said wanda agitatedly and you
really love me so endlessly she held me to her breast and covered
me with kisses

you really want it

i swear to you now by god and my honor that i shall be your slave
wherever and whenever you wish it as soon as you command i
exclaimed hardly master of myself

and if i take you at your word said wanda

please do

all this appeals to me she said then it is different from
anything elseto know that a man who worships me and whom i love
with all my heart is so wholly mine dependent on my will and
caprice my possession and slave while i

she looked strangely at me

if i should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame she
continued it almost seems as if you were afraid of me already but
you have sworn

and i shall keep my oath

i shall see to that she replied i am beginning to enjoy it
and heaven help me we wont stick to fancies now you shall become
my slave and ii shall try to be venus in furs

                            

i thought that at last i knew this woman understood her and now i
see i have to begin at the very beginning again only a little while
ago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile and now she
tries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness

she has drawn up a contract according to which i give my word of
honor and agree under oath to be her slave as long as she wishes

with her arm around my neck she reads this unprecedented
incredible document to me the end of each sentence she punctuates
with a kiss

but all the obligations in the contract are on my side i said
teasing her

of course she replied with great seriousness you cease to be my
lover and consequently i am released from all duties and obligations
towards you you will have to look upon my favors as pure
benevolence you no longer have any rights and no longer can lay
claim to any there can be no limit to my power over you remember
that you wont be much better than a dog or some inanimate object
you will be mine my plaything which i can break to pieces whenever
i want an hours amusement you are nothing i am everything do you
understand she laughed and kissed me again and yet a sort of cold
shiver ran through me

wont you allow me a few conditions i began

conditions she contracted her forehead ah you are afraid
already or perhaps you regret but it is too late now you have
sworn i have your word of honor but let me hear them

first of all i should like to have it included in our contract
that you will never completely leave me and then that you will never
give me over to the mercies of any of your admirers

but severin exclaimed wanda with her voice full of emotion and
with tears in her eyes how can you imagine that iand you a man
who loves me so absolutely who puts himself so entirely in my power
she halted

no no i said covering her hands with kisses i dont fear
anything from you that might dishonor me forgive me the ugly
thought

wanda smiled happily leaned her cheek against mine and seemed to
reflect

you have forgotten something she whispered coquettishly the
most important thing

a condition

yes that i must always wear my furs exclaimed wanda but i
promise you ill do that anyhow because they give me a despotic
feeling and i shall be very cruel to you do you understand

shall i sign the contract i asked

not yet said wanda i shall first add your conditions and the
actual signing wont occur until the proper time and place

in constantinople

no i have thought things over what special value would there be
in owning a slave where everyone owns slaves what i want is to
have a slave i alone here in our civilized sober philistine
world and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on
account of my beauty and personality not because of law of property
rights or compulsions this attracts me but at any rate we will go
to a country where we are not known and where you can appear before
the world as my servant without embarrassment perhaps to italy to
rome or naples

                            

we were sitting on wandas ottoman she wore her ermine jacket her
hair was loose and fell like a lions mane down her back she clung
to my lips drawing my soul from my body my head whirled my blood
began to seethe my heart beat violently against hers

i want to be absolutely in your power wanda i exclaimed
suddenly seized by that frenzy of passion when i can scarcely think
clearly or decide freely i want to put myself absolutely at your
mercy for good or evil without any condition without any limit to
your power

while saying this i had slipped from the ottoman and lay at her
feet looking up at her with drunken eyes

how beautiful you now are she exclaimed your eyes halfbroken
in ecstacy fill me with joy carry me away how wonderful your look
would be if you were being beaten to death in the extreme agony you
have the eye of a martyr

                            

sometimes nevertheless i have an uneasy feeling about placing
myself so absolutely so unconditionally into a womans hands
suppose she did abuse my passion her power

well then i would experience what has occupied my imagination since
my childhood what has always given me the feeling of seductive
terror a foolish apprehension it will be a wanton game she will play
with me nothing more she loves me and she is good a noble
personality incapable of a breach of faith but it lies in her hands
if she wants to she can what a temptation in this doubt this
fear

now i understand manon lescault and the poor chevalier who even
in the pillory while she was another mans mistress still adored
her

love knows no virtue no profit it loves and forgives and suffers
everything because it must it is not our judgment that leads us
it is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover that
make us abandon ourselves or that repel us

it is a sweet soft enigmatic power that drives us on we cease to
think to feel to will we let ourselves be carried away by it and
ask not whither

                            

a russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade
he aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure
magnificent face and splendid bearing the women particularly gaped
at him as though he were a wild animal but he went his way gloomily
without paying attention to any one he was accompanied by two
servants one a negro completely dressed in red satin and the other
a circassian in his full gleaming uniform suddenly he saw wanda and
fixed his cold piercing look upon her he even turned his head after
her and when she had passed he stood still and followed her with
his eyes

and sheshe veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyesand
did everything possible to meet him again

the cunning coquetry with which she walked moved and looked at
him almost stifled me on the way home i remarked about it she knit
her brows

what do you want she said the prince is a man whom i might
like who even dazzles me and i am free i can do what i please

dont you love me any longer i stammered frightened

i love only you she replied but i shall have the prince pay
court to me

wanda

arent you my slave she said calmly am i not venus the cruel
northern venus in furs

i was silent i felt literally crushed by her words her cold look
entered my heart like a dagger

you will find out immediately the princes name residence and
circumstances she continued do you understand

but

no argument obey exclaimed wanda more sternly than i would have
thought possible for her and dont dare to enter my sight until you
can answer my questions

it was not till afternoon that i could obtain the desired
information for wanda she let me stand before her like a servant
while she leaned back in her armchair and listened to me smiling
then she nodded she seemed to be satisfied

bring me my footstool she commanded shortly

i obeyed and after having put it before her and having put her feet
on it i remained kneeling

how will this end i asked sadly after a short pause

she broke into playful laughter why things havent even begun yet

you are more heartless than i imagined i replied hurt

severin wanda began earnestly i havent done anything yet not
the slightest thing and you are already calling me heartless what
will happen when i begin to carry your dreams to their realization
when i shall lead a gay free life and have a circle of admirers
about me when i shall actually fulfil your ideal tread you
underfoot and apply the lash

you take my dreams too seriously

too seriously i cant stop at makebelieve when once i begin
she replied you know i hate all playacting and comedy you have
wished it was it my idea or yours did i persuade you or did you
inflame my imagination i am taking things seriously now

wanda i replied caressingly listen quietly to me we love each
other infinitely we are very happy will you sacrifice our entire
future to a whim

it is no longer a whim she exclaimed

what is it i asked frightened

something that was probably latent in me she said quietly and
thoughtfully perhaps it would never have come to light if you had
not called it to life and made it grow now that it has become a
powerful impulse fills my whole being now that i enjoy it now that
i cannot and do not want to do otherwise now you want to back out
youare you a man

dear sweet wanda i began to caress her kiss her

dontyou are not a man

and you i flared up

i am stubborn she said you know that i havent a strong
imagination and like you i am weak in execution but when i make up
my mind to do something i carry it through and the more certainly
the more opposition i meet leave me alone

she pushed me away and got up

wanda i likewise rose and stood facing her

now you know what i am she continued once more i warn you you
still have the choice i am not compelling you to be my slave

wanda i replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes dont
you know how i love you

her lips quivered contemptuously

you are mistaken you make yourself out worse than you are you are
good and noble by nature

what do you know about my nature she interrupted vehemently you
will get to know me as i am

wanda

decide will you submit unconditionally

and if i say no

then

she stepped close up to me cold and contemptuous as she stood
before me now the arms folded across her breast with an evil smile
about her lips she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams her
expression seemed hard and nothing lay in her eyes that promised
kindness or mercy

well she said at last

you are angry i cried you will punish me

oh no she replied i shall let you go you are free i am not
holding you

wandai who love you so

yes you my dear sir you who adore me she exclaimed
contemptuously but who are a coward a liar and a breaker of
promises leave me instantly

wanda i

wretch

my blood rose in my heart i threw myself down at her feet and began
to cry

tears too she began to laugh oh this laughter was frightful
leave mei dont want to see you again

oh my god i cried beside myself i will do whatever you
command be your slave a mere object with which you can do what you
willonly dont send me awayi cant bear iti cannot live without
you i embraced her knees and covered her hand with kisses

yes you must be a slave and feel the lash for you are not a
man she said calmly she said this to me with perfect composure
not angrily not even excitedly and it was what hurt most now i
know you your doglike nature that adores where it is kicked and
the more the more it is maltreated now i know you and now you
shall come to know me

she walked up and down with long strides while i remained crushed
on my knees my head was hanging supine tears flowed from my eyes

come here wanda commanded harshly sitting down on the ottoman
i obeyed her command and sat down beside her she looked at me
sombrely and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior
of her eye smiling she drew me toward her breast and began to kiss
the tears out of my eyes

                            

the odd part of my situation is that i am like the bear in lilys
park i can escape and dont want to i am ready to endure everything
as soon as she threatens to set me free

                            

if only she would use the whip again there is something uncanny in
the kindness with which she treats me i seem like a little captive
mouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays she is ready at any
moment to tear it to pieces and my heart of a mouse threatens to
burst

what are her intentions what does she purpose to do with me

                            

it seems she has completely forgotten the contract my slavehood or
was it actually only stubbornness and she gave up her whole plan as
soon as i no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim

how kind she is to me how tender how loving we are spending
marvellously happy days

today she had me read to her the scene between faust and
mephistopheles in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar
her glance hung on me with strange pleasure

i dont understand she said when i had finished how a man who
can read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression and
interpret them so clearly concisely and intelligently can at the
same time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are

were you pleased said i and kissed her forehead

she gently stroked my brow i love you severin she whispered i
dont believe i could ever love any one more than you let us be
sensible what do you say

instead of replying i folded her in my arms a deep inward yet
vaguely sad happiness filled my breast my eyes grew moist and a
tear fell upon her hand

how can you cry she exclaimed you are a child

                            

on a pleasure drive we met the russian prince in his carriage he
seemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by wandas side and
looked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his
electric gray eyes she however did not seem to notice him i felt
at that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet
she let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an
inanimate object a tree for instance and turned to me with her
gracious smile

                            

when i said goodnight to her today she seemed suddenly
unaccountably distracted and moody what was occupying her

i am sorry you are going she said when i was already standing on
the threshold

it is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my
trial to cease tormenting me i pleaded

do you imagine that this compulsion isnt a torment for me too
wanda interjected

then end it i exclaimed embracing her be my wife

never severin she said gently but with great firmness

what do you mean

i was frightened in my innermost soul

you are not the man for me

i looked at her and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about
her waist then i left the room and sheshe did not call me back

                            

a sleepless night i made countless decisions only to toss them
aside again in the morning i wrote her a letter in which i declared
our relationship dissolved my hand trembled when i put on the seal
and i burned my fingers

as i went upstairs to hand it to the maid my knees threatened to
give way

the door opened and wanda thrust forth her head full of curlingpapers

i havent had my hair dressed yet she said smiling what have
you there

a letter

for me

i nodded

ah you want to break with me she exclaimed mockingly

didnt you tell me yesterday that i wasnt the man for you

i repeat it now

very well then my whole body was trembling my voice failed me
and i handed her the letter

keep it she said measuring me coldly you forget that is no
longer a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man as a slave
you will doubtless do well enough

madame i exclaimed aghast

that is what you will call me in the future replied wanda
throwing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt put
your affairs in order within the next twentyfour hours the day
after tomorrow i shall start for italy and you will accompany me
as my servant

wanda

i forbid any sort of familiarity she said cutting my words short
likewise you are not to come in unless i call or ring for you and
you are not to speak to me until you are spoken to from now on your
name is no longer severin but gregor

i trembled with rage and yet unfortunately i cannot deny it i
also felt a strange pleasure and stimulation

but madame you know my circumstances i began in my confusion
i am dependent on my father and i doubt whether he will give me the
large sum of money needed for this journey

that means you have no money gregor said wanda delightedly so
much the better you are then entirely dependent on me and in fact
my slave

you dont consider i tried to object that as man of honor it is
impossible for me

i have indeed considered it she replied almost with a tone of
command as a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your
promise to follow me as slave whithersoever i demand and to obey
whatever i command now leave me gregor

i turned toward the door

not yetyou may first kiss my hand she held it out to me with a
certain proud indifference and i the dilettante the donkey the
miserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips
which were dry and hot with excitement

there was another gracious nod of the head

then i was dismissed

                            

though it was late in the evening my light was still lit and a fire
was burning in the large green stove there were still many things
among my letters and documents to be put in order autumn as is
usually the case with us had fallen with all its power

suddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip

i opened and saw her standing outside in her erminelined jacket and
in a high round cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great
catherine favored

are you ready gregor she asked darkly

not yet mistress i replied

i like that word she said then you are always to call me
mistress do you understand we leave here tomorrow morning at nine
oclock as far as the district capital you will be my companion and
friend but from the moment that we enter the railwaycoach you are
my slave my servant now close the window and open the door

after i had done as she had demanded and after she had entered she
asked contracting her brows ironically well how do you like me

wanda you

who gave you permission she gave me a blow with the whip

you are very beautiful mistress

wanda smiled and sat down in the armchair kneel downhere beside
my chair

i obeyed

kiss my hand

i seized her small cold hand and kissed it

and the mouth

in a surge of passion i threw my arms around the beautiful cruel
woman and covered her face arms and breast with glowing kisses
she returned them with equal fervorthe eyelids closed as in a
dream it was after midnight when she left

                            

at nine oclock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure
as she had ordered we left the little carpathian healthresort in a
comfortable light carriage the most interesting drama of my life had
reached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible
to foretell

so far everything went well i sat beside wanda and she chatted
very graciously and intelligently with me as with a good friend
concerning italy pisemskis new novel and wagners music she wore
a sort of amazonesque travellingdress of black cloth with a short
jacket of the same material set with dark fur it fitted closely and
showed her figure to best advantage over it she wore dark furs her
hair wound into an antique knot lay beneath a small dark furhat
from which a black veil hung wanda was in very good humor she fed
me candies played with my hair loosened my neck cloth and made a
pretty cockade of it she covered my knees with her furs and
stealthily pressed the fingers of my hand when our jewish driver
persistently went on nodding to himself she even gave me a kiss and
her cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal
rose which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and
upon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice

                            

we are at the district capital we get out at the railway station
wanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm and goes
to secure the tickets

when she returns she has completely changed

here is your ticket gregor she says in a tone which supercilious
ladies use to their servants

a thirdclass ticket i reply with comic horror

of course she continues but now be careful you wont get on
until i am settled in my compartment and dont need you any longer
at each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders dont
forget and now give me my furs

after i had helped her into them humbly like a slave she went to
find an empty firstclass coupe i followed supporting herself on
my shoulder she got on and i wrapped her feet in bearskins and placed
them on the warming bottle

then she nodded to me and dismissed me i slowly ascended a thirdclass
carriage which was filled with abominable tobaccosmoke that seemed
like the fogs of acheron at the entrance to hades i now had the leisure
to muse about the riddle of human existence and about its greatest
riddle of allwoman

                            

whenever the train stops i jump off run to her carriage and with
drawn cap await her orders she wants coffee and then a glass of
water at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands and
thus it goes on she lets several men who have entered her
compartment pay court to her i am dying of jealousy and have to leap
about like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and
not miss the train

in this way the night passes i havent had time to eat a mouthful
and i cant sleep i have to breathe the same oniony air with polish
peasants jewish peddlers and common soldiers

when i mount the steps of her coupe she is lying stretched out
on cushions in her comfortable furs covered up with the skins of
animals she is like an oriental despot and the men sit like indian
deities straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to
breathe

                            

she stops over in vienna for a day to go shopping and particularly
to buy series of luxurious gowns she continues to treat me as her
servant i follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces she
hands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look
and laden down like a donkey i pant along behind

before leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel
waiters i am ordered to put on her livery it is a cracovian costume
in her colors lightblue with red facings and red quadrangular cap
ornamented with peacockfeathers the costume is rather becoming to
me

the silver buttons bear her coat of arms i have the feeling of having
been sold or of having bonded myself to the devil my fair demon leads
me from vienna to florence instead of linengarbed mazovians and
greasyhaired jews my companions now are curlyhaired contadini a
magnificent sergeant of the first italian grenadiers and a poor german
painter the tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions but of salami and
cheese

night has fallen again i lie on my wooden bed as on a rack my arms and
legs seem broken but there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the
affair the stars sparkle round about the italian sergeant has a face
like apollo belvedere and the german painter sings a lovely german
song

now that all the shadows gather
and endless stars grow light
deep yearning on me falls
and softly fills the night

through the sea of dreams
sailing without cease
sailing goes my soul
in thine to find release

and i am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal
comfort among her soft furs

                            

florence crowds cries importunate porters and cabdrivers wanda
chooses a carriage and dismisses the porters

what have i a servant for she says gregorhere is the ticket
get the luggage

she wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while i
drag the heavy trunks hither one after another i break down for a
moment under the last one a goodnatured carabiniere with an
intelligent face comes to my assistance she laughs

it must be heavy said she all my furs are in it

i get up on the drivers seat wiping drops of perspiration from my
brow she gives the name of the hotel and the driver urges on his
horse in a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated
entrance

have you any rooms she asks the portier

yes madame

two for me one for my servant all with stoves

two firstclass rooms for you madame both with stoves replied
the waiter who had hastily come up and one without heat for your
servant

she looked at them and then abruptly said they are satisfactory
have fires built at once my servant can sleep in the unheated room

i merely looked at her

bring up the trunks gregor she commands paying no attention to
my looks in the meantime ill be dressing and then will go down
to the diningroom and you can eat something for supper

as she goes into the adjoining room i drag the trunks upstairs and
help the waiter build a fire in her bedroom he tries to question
me in bad french about my employer with a brief glance i see the
blazing fire the fragrant white posterbed and the rugs which cover
the floor tired and hungry i then descend the stairs and ask for
something to eat a goodnatured waiter who used to be in the
austrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in german
shows me the diningroom and waits on me i have just had the first
fresh drink in thirtysix hours and the first bite of warm food on
my fork when she enters

i rise

what do you mean by taking me into a diningroom in which my
servant is eating she snaps at the waiter flaring with anger she
turns around and leaves

meanwhile i thank heaven that i am permitted to go on eating later
i climb the four flights upstairs to my room my small trunk is
already there and a miserable little oillamp is burning it is a
narrow room without fireplace without a window but with a small
airhole if it werent so beastly cold it would remind me of one
of the venetian piombi footnote these were notorious prisons
under the leaden roof of the palace of the doges involuntarily i
have to laugh out aloud so that it reechoes and i am startled by
my own laughter

suddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical
italian gesture calls you are to come down to madame at once i
pick up my cap stumble down the first few steps but finally arrive
in front of her door on the first floor and knock

come in

i enter shut the door and stand attention

wanda has made herself comfortable she is sitting in a neglige of
white muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a
footstool that matches she has thrown her furcloak about her it
is the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time
as goddess of love

the yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections
their reflections in the large mirrors and the red flames from the
open fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet the darkbrown
sable of the cloak the smooth white skin and the red flaming hair
of the beautiful woman her clear but cold face is turned toward me
and her cold green eyes rest upon me

i am satisfied with you gregor she began

i bowed

come closer

i obeyed

still closer she looked down and stroked the sable with her
hand venus in furs receives her slave i can see that you are more
than an ordinary dreamer you dont remain far in arrears of your
dreams you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into
effect no matter how mad they are i confess i like this it
impresses me there is strength in this and strength is the only
thing one respects i actually believe that under unusual
circumstances in a period of great deeds what seems to be your
weakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power under the early
emperors you would have been a martyr at the time of the reformation
an anabaptist during the french revolution one of those inspired
girondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their
lips but you are my slave my

she suddenly leaped up the furs slipped down and she threw her
arms with soft pressure about my neck

my beloved slave severin oh how i love you how i adore you how
handsome you are in your cracovian costume you will be cold tonight
up in your wretched room without a fire shall i give you one of my
furs dear heart the large one there

she quickly picked it up throwing it over my shoulders and before
i knew what had happened i was completely wrapped up in it

how wonderfully becoming furs are to your face they bring out your
noble lines as soon as you cease being my slave you must wear a
velvet coat with sable do you understand otherwise i shall never
put on my furjacket again

and again she began to caress me and kiss me finally she drew me
down on the little divan

you seem to be pleased with yourself in furs she said quick
quick give them to me or i will lose all sense of dignity

i placed the furs about her and wanda slipped her right arm into
the sleeve

this is the pose in titians picture but now enough of joking
dont always look so solemn it makes me feel sad as far as the
world is concerned you are still merely my servant you are not yet
my slave for you have not yet signed the contract you are still
free and can leave me any moment you have played your part
magnificently i have been delighted but arent you tired of it
already and dont you think i am abominable well say somethingi
command it

must i confess to you wanda i began

yes you must

even it you take advantage of it i continued i shall love you
the more deeply adore you the more fanatically the worse you treat
me what you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my
senses i held her close to me and clung for several moments to her
moist lips

oh you beautiful woman i then exclaimed looking at her in my
enthusiasm i tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth
against her neck

you love me even when i am cruel said wanda now goyou bore
medont you hear

she boxed my ears so that i saw stars and bells rang in my ears

help me into my furs slave

i helped her as well as i could

how awkward she exclaimed and was scarcely in it before she
struck me in the face again i felt myself growing pale

did i hurt you she asked softly touching me with her hand

no no i exclaimed

at any rate you have no reason to complain you want it thus now
kiss me again

i threw my arms about her and her lips clung closely to mine as
she lay against my breast in her large heavy furs i had a curiously
oppressive sensation it was as if a wild beast a shebear were
embracing me it seemed as if i were about to feel her claws in my
flesh but this time the shebear let me off easily

with my heart filled with smiling hopes i went up to my miserable
servants room and threw myself down on my hard couch

life is really amazingly droll i thought a short time ago the
most beautiful woman venus herself rested against your breast and
now you have an opportunity for studying the chinese hell unlike us
they dont hurl the damned into flames but they have devils chasing
them out into fields of ice

very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated
rooms

                            

during the night i startled out of my sleep with a scream i had
been dreaming of an icefield in which i had lost my way i had been
looking in vain for a way out suddenly an eskimo drove up in a
sleigh harnessed with reindeer he had the face of the waiter who had
shown me to the unheated room

what are you looking for here my dear sir he exclaimed this is
the north pole

a moment later he had disappeared and wanda flew over the smooth
ice on tiny skates her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled the
ermine of her jacket and cap but especially her face gleamed whiter
than the snow she shot toward me inclosed me in her arms and began
to kiss me suddenly i felt my blood running warm down my side

what are you doing i asked horrorstricken

she laughed and as i looked at her now it was no longer wanda but
a huge white shebear who was digging her paws into my body

i cried out in despair and still heard her diabolical laughter when
i awoke and looked about the room in surprise

early in the morning i stood at wandas door and the waiter brought
the coffee i took it from him and served it to my beautiful
mistress she had already dressed and looked magnificent all fresh
and roseate she smiled graciously at me and called me back when i
was about to withdraw respectfully

come gregor have your breakfast quickly too she said then we
will go househunting i dont want to stay in the hotel any longer
than i have to it is very embarassing here if i chat with you for
more than a minute people will immediately say the fair russian
is having an affair with her servant you see the race of catherines
isnt extinct yet

half an hour later we went out wanda was in her clothgown with the
russian cap and i in my cracovian costume we created quite a stir i
walked about ten paces behind looking very solemn but expected
momentarily to have to break out into loud laughter there was scarcely
a street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear
the sign camere ammobiliate wanda always sent me upstairs and only
when the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself
ascend by noon i was as tired as a staghound after the hunt

we entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable
habitation wanda was already somewhat out of humor suddenly she said
to me severin the seriousness with which you play your part is
charming and the restrictions which we have placed upon each other are
really annoying me i cant stand it any longer i do love you i must
kiss you lets go into one of the houses

but my lady i interposed

gregor she entered the next open corridor and ascended a few
steps of the dark stairway then she threw her arms about me with
passionate tenderness and kissed me

oh severin you were very wise you are much more dangerous as
slave than i would have imagined you are positively irrestible and
i am afraid i shall have to fall in love with you again

dont you love me any longer then i asked seized by a sudden
fright

she solemnly shook her head but kissed me again with her swelling
adorable lips

we returned to the hotel wanda had luncheon and ordered me also
quickly to get something to eat

of course i wasnt served as quickly as she and so it happened
that just as i was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth
the waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture
madame wants you at once

i took a rapid and painful leave of my food and tired and hungry
hurried toward wanda who was already on the street

i wouldnt have imagined you could be so cruel i said
reproachfully with all these fatiguing duties you dont even leave
me time to eat in peace

wanda laughed gaily i thought you had finished she said but
never mind man was born to suffer and you in particular the
martyrs didnt have any beefsteaks either

i followed her resentfully gnawing at my hunger

i have given up the idea of finding a place in the city wanda
continued it will be difficult to find an entire floor which is
shut off and where you can do as you please in such a strange mad
relationship as ours there must be no jarring note i shall rent an
entire villaand you will be surprised you have my permission now
to satisfy your hunger and look about a bit in florence i wont be
home till evening if i need you then i will have you called

i looked at the duomo the palazzo vecchio the logia di lanzi and
then i stood for a long time on the banks of the arno again and
again i let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient florence whose
round cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue
cloudless sky i watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide
arches the lively waves of the beautiful yellow river ran and the
green hills which surrounded the city bearing slender cypresses and
extensive buildings palaces and monasteries

it is a different world this one in which we area gay sensuous
smiling world the landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and
somberness of ours it is a long ways off to the last white villas
scattered among the pale green of the mountains and yet there isnt
a spot that isnt bright with sunlight the people are less serious
than we perhaps they think less but they all look as though they
were happy

it is also maintained that death is easier in the south

i have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn
and love of the senses without torment does exist

wanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the
winter it is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the
arno opposite the cascine it is surrounded by an attractive garden
with lovely paths grass plots and magnificent meadow of camelias
it is only two stories high quadrangular in the italian fashion an
open gallery runs along one side a sort of loggia with plastercasts
of antique statues stone steps lead from it down into the garden
from the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin
from which winding stairs lead to my mistress bedchamber

wanda occupies the second story by herself

a room on the ground floor has been assigned to me it is very
attractive and even has a fireplace

i have roamed through the garden on a round hillock i discovered a
little temple but i found its door locked however there is a chink
in the door and when i glue my eye to it i see the goddess of love
on a white pedestal

a slight shudder passes over me it seems to me as if she were
smiling at me saying are you there i have been expecting you

                            

it is evening an attractive maid brings me orders to appear before
my mistress i ascend the wide marble stairs pass through the
anteroom a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence and
knock at the door of the bedroom i knock very softly for the luxury
displayed everywhere intimidates me consequently no one hears me
and i stand for some time in front of the door i have a feeling as
if i were standing before the bedroom of the great catherine and
it seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping
furs with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast and with
her little white powdered curls

i knocked again wanda impatiently pulls the door open

why so late she asks

i was standing in front of the door but you didnt hear me knock
i reply timidly she closes the door and clinging to me she leads
me to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting the
entire arrangement of the room is in red damaskwallpaper
curtains portieres hangings of the bed a magnificent painting of
samson and delilah forms the ceiling

wanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille her white satin
dress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body
leaving her arms and breast bare and carelessly they nestle amid the
dark hair of the great fur of sable lined with green velvet her red
hair falls down her back as far as the hips only half held by
strings of black pearls

venus in furs i whisper while she draws me to her breast and
threatens to stifle me with her kisses then i no longer speak and
neither do i think everything is drowned out in an ocean of
unimagined bliss

do you still love me she asks her eye softening in passionate
tenderness

you ask i exclaimed

you still remember your oath she continued with an alluring
smile now that everything is prepared everything in readiness i
ask you once more is it still your serious wish to become my slave

am i not ready i asked in surprise

you have not yet signed the papers

paperswhat papers

oh i see you want to give it up she said well then we will
let it go

but wanda i said you know that nothing gives me greater
happiness than to serve you to be your slave i would give
everything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power even
unto death

how beautiful you are she whispered when you speak so
enthusiastically so passionately i am more in love with you than
ever and you want me to be dominant stern and cruel i am afraid
it will be impossible for me to be so

i am not afraid i replied smiling where are the papers

so that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power i
have drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have
decided to kill yourself in that way i can even kill you if i so
desire

give them to me

while i was unfolding the documents and reading them wanda got pen
and ink she then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck and
looked over my shoulder at the paper

the first one read

agreement between mme von dunajew and severin von kusiemski

severin von kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced
of mme wanda von dunajew and renounces all the rights appertaining
thereunto he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a
man and nobleman that hereafter he will be her slave until such
time that she herself sets him at liberty again

as the slave of mme von dunajew he is to bear the name gregor and
he is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes and to
obey every one of her commands he is always to be submissive to his
mistress and is to consider her every sign of favor as an
extraordinary mercy

mme von dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she
deems best even for the slightest inadvertence or fault but also
is herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her
or merely for the sake of whiling away the time should she so desire
she may kill him whenever she wishes in short he is her
unrestricted property

should mme von dunajew ever set her slave at liberty severin von
kusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or
suffered as her slave and promises never under any circumstances and
in no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation

mme von dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as
often as possible in her furs especially when she purposes some
cruelty toward her slave

appended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present
day

the second document contained only a few words

having since many years become weary of existence and its
illusions i have of my own free will put an end to my worthless
life

i was seized with a deep horror when i had finished there was still
time i could still withdraw but the madness of passion and the
sight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder
carried me away

this one you will have to copy severin said wanda indicating
the second document it has to be entirely in your own handwriting
this of course isnt necessary in the case of the agreement

i quickly copied the few lines in which i designated myself a
suicide and handed them to wanda she read them and put them on the
table with a smile

now have you the courage to sign it she asked with a crafty
smile inclining her head

i took the pen

let me sign first said wanda your hand is trembling are you
afraid of the happiness that is to be yours

she took the agreement and pen while engaging in my internal struggle
i looked upward for a moment it occurred to me that the painting on the
ceiling like many of those of the italian and dutch schools was
utterly unhistorical but this very fact gave it a strange mood which
had an almost uncanny effect on me delilah an opulent woman with
flaming red hair lay extended halfdisrobed in a dark furcloak upon
a red ottoman and bent smiling over samson who had been overthrown and
bound by the philistines her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of
a diabolical cruelty her eyes halfclosed met samsons and his with
a last look of insane passion cling to hers for already one of his
enemies is kneeling on his breast with the redhot iron to blind him

now said wanda why you are all lost in thought what is the
matter with you everything will remain just as it was even after
you have signed dont you know me yet dear heart

i looked at the agreement her name was written there in bold
letters i peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic
then i took the pen and quickly signed the agreement

you are trembling said wanda calmly shall i help you

she gently took hold of my hand and my name appeared at the bottom
of the second paper wanda looked once more at the two documents and
then locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman

now then give me your passport and money

i took out my wallet and handed it to her she inspected it nodded
and put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness i kneeled
before her leaning my head against her breast

suddenly she thrusts me away with her foot leaps up and pulls the
bellrope in answer to its sound three young slender negresses
enter they are as if carved of ebony and are dressed from head to
foot in red satin each one has a rope in her hand

suddenly i realize my position and am about to rise wanda stands
proudly erect her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and
contemptous eyes is turned toward me she stands before me as
mistress commanding gives a sign with her hand and before i really
know what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the
ground and have tied me hand and foot as in the case of one about
to be executed my arms are bound behind my back so that i can
scarcely move

give me the whip haydee commands wanda with unearthly calm

the negress hands it to her mistress kneeling

and now take off my heavy furs she continues they impede me

the negress obeyed

the jacket there wanda commanded

haydee quickly brought her the kazabaika set with ermine which lay
on the bed and wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful
movements

now tie him to the pillar here

the negresses lifted me up and twisting a heavy rope around my
body tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which
supported the top of the wide italian bed

then they suddenly disappeared as if the earth had swallowed them

wanda swiftly approached me her white satin dress flowed behind her
in a long train like silver like moonlight her hair flared like
flames against the white fur of her jacket now she stood in front
of me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips in her right hand
she held the whip she uttered an abrupt laugh

now play has come to an end between us she said with heartless
coldness now we will begin in dead earnest you fool i laugh at you
and despise you you who in your insane infatuation have given
yourself as a plaything to me the frivolous and capricious woman
you are no longer the man i love but my slave at my mercy even
unto life and death

you shall know me

first of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness
without having done anything to deserve it so that you may
understand what to expect if you are awkward disobedient or
refractory

with a wild grace she rolled back her furlined sleeve and struck
me across the back

i winced for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh

well how do you like that she exclaimed

i was silent

just wait you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip she
threatened and simultaneously began to strike me again

the blows fell quickly in rapid succession with terrific force
upon my back arms and neck i had to grit my teeth not to scream
aloud now she struck me in the face warm blood ran down but she
laughed and continued her blows

it is only now i understand you she exclaimed it really is a
joy to have some one so completely in ones power and a man at that
who loves youyou do love menooh ill tear you to shreds yet
and with each blow my pleasure will grow now twist like a worm
scream whine you will find no mercy in me

finally she seemed tired

she tossed the whip aside stretched out on the ottoman and rang

the negresses entered

untie him

as they loosened the rope i fell to the floor like a lump of wood
the black women grinned showing their white teeth

untie the rope around his feet

they did it but i was unable to rise

come over here gregor

i approached the beautiful woman never did she seem more seductive
to me than today in spite of all her cruelty and contempt

one step further wanda commanded now kneel down and kiss my
foot

she extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin and i the
supersensual fool pressed my lips upon it

now you wont lay eyes on me for an entire month gregor she
said seriously i want to become a stranger to you so you will more
easily adjust yourself to our new relationship in the meantime you
will work in the garden and await my orders now off with you
slave

                            

a month has passed with monotonous regularity heavy work and a
melancholy hunger hunger for her who is inflicting all these
torments on me

i am under the gardeners orders i help him lop the trees and prune
the hedges transplant flowers turn over the flower beds sweep the
gravel paths i share his coarse food and his hard cot i rise and
go to bed with the chickens now and then i hear that our mistress
is amusing herself surrounded by admirers once i heard her gay
laughter even down here in the garden

i seem awfully stupid to myself was it the result of my present
life or was i so before the month is drawing to a closethe day
after tomorrow what will she do with me now or has she forgotten
me and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day

a written order

the slave gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service

wanda dunajew

with a beating heart i draw aside the damask curtain on the
following morning and enter the bedroom of my divinity it is still
filled with a pleasant half darkness

is it you gregor she asks while i kneel before the fireplace
building a fire i tremble at the sound of the beloved voice i
cannot see her herself she is invisible behind the curtains of the
fourposter bed

yes my mistress i reply

how late is it

past nine oclock

breakfast

i hasten to get it and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed

here is breakfast my mistress

wanda draws back the curtains and curiously enough at the first
glance when i see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair
she seems an absolute stranger a beautiful woman but the beloved
soft lines are gone this face is hard and has an expression of
weariness and satiety

or is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this

she fixes her green eyes upon me more with curiosity than with
menace perhaps even somewhat pityingly and lazily pulls the dark
sleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder

at this moment she is very charming very maddening and i feel my
blood rising to my head and heart the tray in my hands begins to
sway she notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on
the toilettable

you are awkward slave she says furrowing her brow

i lower my looks to the ground and hold the tray as steadily as
possible she eats her breakfast yawns and stretches her opulent
limbs in the magnificent furs

she has rung i enter

take this letter to prince corsini

i hurry into the city and hand the letter to the prince he is a
handsome young man with glowing black eyes consumed with jealousy
i take his answer to her

what is the matter with you she asks with lurking spitefulness
you are very pale

nothing mistress i merely walked rather fast

at luncheon the prince is at her side and i am condemned to serve
both her and him they joke and i am as if nonexistent for both
for a brief moment i see black i was just pouring some bordeaux into
his glass and spilled it over the tablecloth and her gown

how awkward wanda exclaimed and slapped my face the prince
laughed and she also but i felt the blood rising to my face

after luncheon she drove in the cascine she has a little carriage
with a handsome brown english horse and holds the reins herself
i sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts and nods with a
smile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her

as i help her out of the carriage she leans lightly on my arm the
contact runs through me like an electric shock she is a wonderful
woman and i love her more than ever

                            

for dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women i
serve but this time i do not spill any wine over the tablecloth

a slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures it makes you
understand very quickly especially when the instruction is by the
way of a small womans hand

                            

after dinner she drives to the pergola theater as she descends the
stairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and
with a diadem of white roses on her hair she is literally stunning
i open the carriagedoor and help her in in front of the theater
i leap from the drivers seat and in alighting she leaned on my arm
which trembled under the sweet burden i open the door of her box
and then wait in the vestibule the performance lasts four hours she
receives visits from her cavaliers the while i grit my teeth with
rage

it is way beyond midnight when my mistresss bell sounds for the
last time

fire she orders abruptly and when the fireplace crackles tea

when i return with the samovar she has already undressed and with
the aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee

haydee thereupon leaves

hand me the sleepingfurs says wanda sleepily stretching her
lovely limbs i take them from the armchair and hold them while she
slowly and lazily slides into the sleeves she then throws herself
down on the cushions of the ottoman

take off my shoes and put on my velvet slippers

i kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts
hurry hurry wanda exclaims you are hurting me just you waiti
will teach you she strikes me with the whip but now the shoe is
off

now get out still a kickand then i can go to bed

                            

tonight i accompanied her to a soiree in the entrancehall she
ordered me to help her out of her furs then with a proud smile
confident of victory she entered the brilliantly illuminated room
i again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts watching hour after
hour run by from time to time the sounds of music reached me when
the door remained open for a moment several servants tried to start
a conversation with me but soon desisted since i knew only a few
words of italian

finally i fell asleep and dreamed that i murdered wanda in a
violent attack of jealousy i was condemned to death and saw myself
strapped on the board the knife fell i felt it on my neck but i
was still alive

then the executioner slapped my face

no it wasnt the executioner it was wanda who stood wrathfully
before me demanding her furs i am at her side in a moment and help
her on with it

there is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs and
in seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in
the precious soft furs and to lift the flowing hair over the collar
when she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her
body still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable it is enough to
drive one mad

                            

finally a day came when there were neither guests nor theater nor
other company i breathed a sigh of relief wanda sat in the gallery
reading and apparently had no orders for me at dusk when the
silvery evening mists fell she withdrew i served her at dinner she
ate by herself but had not a look not a syllable for me not even
a slap in the face

i actually desire a slap from her hand tears fill my eyes and i
feel that she has humiliated me so deeply that she doesnt even find
it worth while to torture or maltreat me any further

before she goes to bed her bell calls me

you will sleep here tonight i had horrible dreams last night and
am afraid of being alone take one of the cushions from the ottoman
and lie down on the bearskin at my feet

then wanda put out the lights the only illumination in the room was
from a small lamp suspended from the ceiling she herself got into
bed dont stir so as not to wake me

i did as she had commanded but could not fall asleep for a long
time i saw the beautiful woman beautiful as a goddess lying on her
back on the dark sleepingfurs her arms beneath her neck with a
flood of red hair over them i heard her magnificent breast rise in
deep regular breathing and whenever she moved ever so slightly i
woke up and listened to see whether she needed me

but she did not require me

no task was required of me i meant no more to her than a nightlamp or
a revolver which one places under ones pillow

                            

am i mad or is she does all this arise out of an inventive wanton
womans brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual
fantasies or is this woman really one of those neronian characters
who take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot like a worm
human beings who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs

what have i experienced

when i knelt with the coffeetray beside her bed wanda suddenly
placed her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine

what beautiful eyes you have she said softly and especially now
since you suffer are you very unhappy

i bowed my head and kept silent

severin do you still love me she suddenly exclaimed
passionately can you still love me

she drew me close with such vehemence that the coffeetray upset
the can and cups fell to the floor and the coffee ran over the
carpet

wandamy wanda i cried out and held her passionately against me
i covered her mouth face and breast with kisses

it is my unhappiness that i love you more and more madly the worse
you treat me the more frequently you betray me oh i shall die of
pain and love and jealousy

but i havent betrayed you as yet severin replied wanda smiling

not wanda dont jest so mercilessly with me i cried havent
i myself taken the letter to the prince

of course it was an invitation for luncheon

you have since we have been in florence

i have been absolutely faithful to you replied wanda i swear it
by all that is holy to me all that i have done was merely to fulfill
your dream and it was done for your sake

however i shall take a lover otherwise things will be only half
accomplished and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having
treated you cruelly enough my dear beautiful slave but today you
shall be severin again the only one i love i havent given away
your clothes they are here in the chest go and dress as you used
to in the little carpathian healthresort when our love was so intimate
forget everything that has happened since oh you will forget it
easily in my arms i shall kiss away all your sorrows

she began to treat me tenderly like a child to kiss me and caress
me finally she said with a gracious smile go now and dress i too
will dress shall i put on my furjacket oh yes i know now run
along

when i returned she was standing in the center of the room in her
white satin dress and the red kazabaika edged with ermine her hair
was white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond
diadem for a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of catherine
the second but she did not give me much time for reminiscences she
drew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful
hours she was no longer the stern capricious mistress she was
entirely a fine lady a tender sweetheart she showed me photographs
and books which had just appeared and talked about them with so much
intelligence clarity and good taste that i more than once carried
her hand to my lips enraptured she then had me recite several of
lermontovs poems and when i was all afire with enthusiasm she
placed her small hand gently on mine her expression was soft and her
eyes were filled with tender pleasure

are you happy

not yet

she then leaned back on the cushions and slowly opened her
kazabaika

but i quickly covered the halfbared breast again with the ermine
you are driving me mad i stammered

come

i was already lying in her arms and like a serpent she was kissing
me with her tongue when again she whispered are you happy

infinitely i exclaimed

she laughed aloud it was an evil shrill laugh which made cold
shivers run down by back

you used to dream of being the slave the plaything of a beautiful
woman and now you imagine you are a free human being a man my
loveryou fool a sign from me and you are a slave again down on
your knees

i sank down from the ottoman to her feet but my eye still clung
doubtingly on hers

you cant believe it she said looking at me with her arms folded
across her breast i am bored and you will just do to while away
a couple of hours of time dont look at me that way

she kicked me with her foot

you are just what i want a human being a thing an animal

she rang the three negresses entered

tie his hands behind his back

i remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this they led me
into the garden down to the little vineyard which forms the
southern boundary corn had been planted between the espaliers and
here and there a few dead stalks still stood to one side was a
plough

the negresses tied me to a post and amused themselves sticking me
with their golden hairneedles but this did not last long before
wanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head and with her hands
in the pockets of her jacket she had me untied and then my hands
were fastened together on my back she finally had a yoke put around
my neck and harnessed me to the plough

then her black demons drove me out into the field one of them held
the plough the other one led me by a line the third applied the
whip and venus in furs stood to one side and looked on

                            

when i was serving dinner on the following day wanda said bring
another cover i want you to dine with me today and when i was
about to sit down opposite her she added no over here close by
my side

she is in the best of humors gives me soup with her spoon feeds me
with her fork and places her head on the table like a playful kitten
and flirts with me i have the misfortune of looking at haydee who
serves in my place perhaps a little longer than is necessary it is
only now that i noticed her noble almost european cast of
countenance and her magnificent statuesque bust which is as if hewn
out of black marble the black devil observes that she pleases me
and grinning shows her teeth she has hardly left the room before
wanda leaps up in a rage

what you dare to look at another woman besides me perhaps you
like her even better than you do me she is even more demonic

i am frightened i have never seen her like this before she is
suddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles venus in
furs is jealous of her slave she snatches the whip from its hook and
strikes me in the face then she calls her black servants who bind
me and carry me down into the cellar where they throw me into a
dark dank subterranean compartment a veritable prisoncell

then the lock of the door clicks the bolts are drawn a key sings
in the lock i am a prisoner buried

i have been lying here for i dont know how long bound like a calf
about to be hauled to the slaughter on a bundle of damp straw
without any light without food without drink without sleep it
would be like her to let me starve to death if i dont freeze to
death before then i am shaking with cold or is it fever i believe
i am beginning to hate this woman

                            

a red streak like blood floods across the floor it is a light
falling through the door which is now thrust open

wanda appears on the threshold wrapped in her sables holding a
lighted torch

are you still alive she asks

are you coming to kill me i reply with a low hoarse voice

with two rapid strides wanda reaches my side she kneels down beside
me and places my head in her lap are you ill your eyes glow so
do you love me i want you to love me

she draws forth a short dagger i start with fright when its blade
gleams in front of my eyes i actually believe that she is about to
kill me she laughs and cuts the ropes that bind me

                            

every evening after dinner she now has me called i have to read to
her and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and
subjects she seems entirely transformed it is as if she were
ashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty
with which she treated me a touching gentleness transfigures her
entire being and when at the goodnight she gives me her hand a
superhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes of the kind
which calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the
miseries of existence and all the terrors of death

                            

i am reading manon lescault to her she feels the association she
doesnt say a word but she smiles from time to time and finally she
shuts up the little book

dont you want to go on reading

not today we will ourselves act manon lescault today i have a
rendezvous in the cascine and you my dear chevalier will accompany
me i know you will do it wont you

you command it

i do not command it i beg it of you she says with irresistible
charm she then rises puts her hands on my shoulders and looks at
me

your eyes she exclaims i love you severin you have no idea
how i love you

yes i have i replied bitterly so much so that you have
arranged for a rendezvous with some one else

i do this only to allure you the more she replied vivaciously i
must have admirers so as not to lose you i dont ever want to lose
you never do you hear for i love only you you alone

she clung passionately to my lips

oh if i only could as i would give you all of my soul in a kiss
thusbut now come

she slipped into a simple black velvet coat and put a dark bashlyk
footnote a kind of russian cap on her head then she rapidly went
through the gallery and entered the carriage

gregor will drive she called out to the coachman who withdrew in
surprise

i ascended the drivers seat and angrily whipped up the horses

in the cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path wanda
got out it was night only occasional stars shone through the gray
clouds that fled across the sky by the bank of the arno stood a man
in a dark cloak with a brigands hat and looked at the yellow
waves wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery and tapped him on
the shoulder i saw him turn and seize her hand and then they
disappeared behind the green wall

an hour full of torments finally there was a rustling in the bushes
to one side and they returned

the man accompanied her to the carriage the light of the lamp fell
full and glaringly upon an infinitely young soft and dreamy face
which i had never before seen and played in his long blond curls

she held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect then she
signaled to me and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy
wall which follows the river like a long green screen

                            

the bell at the gardengate rings it is a familiar face the man
from the cascine

whom shall i announce i ask him in french he timidly shakes his
head

do you perhaps understand some german he asks shyly

yes your name please

oh i havent any yet he replies embarrassedtell your
mistress the german painter from the cascine is here and would like
but there she is herself

wanda had stepped out on the balcony and nodded toward the stranger

gregor show the gentleman in she called to me

i showed the painter the stairs

thanks ill find her now thanks thanks very much he ran up the
steps i remained standing below and looked with deep pity on the
poor german

venus in furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair he will
paint her and go mad

                            

it is a sunny winters day something that looks like gold trembles
on the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level
of the meadow the camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious
in their abundant buds wanda is sitting in the loggia she is
drawing the german painter stands opposite her with his hands folded
as in adoration and looks at her no he rather looks at her face
and is entirely absorbed in it enraptured

but she does not see him neither does she see me who with the
spade in my hand am turning over the flowerbed solely that i may
see her and feel her nearness which produces an effect on me like
poetry like music

                            

the painter has gone it is a hazardous thing to do but i risk it
i go up to the gallery quite close and ask wanda do you love the
painter mistress

she looks at me without getting angry shakes her head and finally
even smiles

i feel sorry for him she replies but i do not love him i love no
one i used to love you as ardently as passionately as deeply as
it was possible for me to love but now i dont love even you any
more my heart is a void dead and this makes me sad

wanda i exclaimed deeply moved

soon you too will no longer love me she continued tell me when
you have reached that point and i will give back to you your
freedom

then i shall remain your slave all my life long for i adore you
and shall always adore you i cried seized by that fanaticism of
love which has repeatedly been so fatal to me

wanda looked at me with a curious pleasure consider well what you
do she said i have loved you infinitely and have been despotic
towards you so that i might fulfil your dream something of my old
feeling a sort of real sympathy for you still trembles in my
breast when that too has gone who knows whether then i shall give
you your liberty whether i shall not then become really cruel
merciless even brutal toward whether i shall not take a diabolical
pleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships
me idolatrously the while i remain indifferent or love someone else
perhaps i shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me consider
this well

i have long since considered all that i replied as in a glow of
fever i cannot exist cannot live without you i shall die if you
set me at liberty let me remain your slave kill me but do not
drive me away

very well then be my slave she replied but dont forget that
i no longer love you and your love doesnt mean any more to me than
a dogs and dogs are kicked

                            

today i visited the venus of medici

it was still early and the little octagonal room in the tribuna was
filled with halflights like a sanctuary i stood with folded hands
in deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity

but i did not stand for long

not a human soul was in the gallery not even an englishman and i
fell down on my knees i looked up at the lovely slender body the
budding breasts the virginal and yet voluptuous face the fragrant
curls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead

                            

my mistresss bell

it is noonday she however is still abed with her arms intertwined
behind her neck

i want to bathe she says and you will attend me lock the door

i obey

now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked

i descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the
bath my feet gave way beneath me and i had to support myself
against the iron banister after having ascertained that the door
leading to the loggia and the garden was locked i returned wanda
was now sitting on the bed with loosened hair wrapped in her green
velvet furs when she made a rapid movement i noticed that the furs
were her only covering it made me start terribly i dont know why
i was like one condemned to death who knows he is on the way to the
scaffold and yet begins to tremble when he sees it

come gregor take me on your arms

you mean mistress

you are to carry me dont you understand

i lifted her up so that she rested in my arms while she twined
hers around my neck slowly step by step i went down the stairs
with her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her
foot sought support against my knee i trembled under the beautiful
burden i was carrying and every moment it seemed as if i had to
break down beneath it

the bath consisted of a wide high rotunda which received a soft
quiet light from a red glass cupola above two palms extended their
broad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions from here
steps covered with turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which
occupied the center

there is a green ribbon on my toilettable upstairs said wanda
as i let her down on the couch go get it and also bring the whip

i flew upstairs and back again and kneeling put both in my mistresss
hands she then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot
which i fastened with the green ribbon then i prepared the bath i did
this very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me again
and again i had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet
cushions and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and
there beneath the furs some magnetic power stronger than my will
compelled me to look i felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in
that which is halfconcealed or intentionally disclosed and the truth
of this i recognized even more acutely when the basin at last was full
and wanda threw off the furcloak with a single gesture and stood
before me like the goddess in the tribuna

at that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled
beauty as did the divinity of long ago i sank down on my knees
before her and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot

my soul which had been stormtossed only a little while earlier
suddenly was perfectly calm and i now felt no element of cruelty in
wanda

she slowly descended the stairs and i could watch her with a
calmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was
intermingled i could see her plunge into and rise out of the
crystalline water and the wavelets which she herself raised played
about her like tender lovers

our nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says a real apple is
more beautiful than a painted one and a living woman is more
beautiful than a venus of stone

and when she left the bath and the silvery drops and the roseate
light rippled down her body i was seized with silent rapture i
wrapped the linen sheets about her drying her glorious body the
calm bliss remained with me even now when one foot upon me as upon
a footstool she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak
the lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marblelike body
her left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan
in the dark fur of the sleeve while her left hand played carelessly
with the whip

by chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite
and i cried out for i saw the two of us in its golden frame as in
a picture the picture was so marvellously beautiful so strange so
imaginative that i was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that
its lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist

what is the matter asked wanda

i pointed to the mirror

ah that is really beautiful she exclaimed too bad one cant
capture the moment and make it permanent

and why not i asked would not any artist even the most famous
be proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by
means of his brush

the very thought that this extraordinary beauty is to be lost to
the world i continued still watching her enthusiastically is
horribleall this glorious facial expression this mysterious eye
with its green fires this demonic hair this magnificence of body
the idea fills me with a horror of death of annihilation but the
hand of an artist shall snatch you from this you shall not like the
rest of us disappear absolutely and forever without leaving a trace
of your having been your picture must live even when you yourself
have long fallen to dust your beauty must triumph beyond death

wanda smiled

too bad that presentday italy hasnt a titian or raphael she
said but perhaps love will make amends for genius who knows our
little german might do she pondered

yes he shall paint you and i will see to it that the god of love
mixes his colors

                            

the young painter has established his studio in her villa he is
completely in her net he has just begun a madonna a madonna with
red hair and green eyes only the idealism of a german would attempt
to use this thoroughbred woman as a model for a picture of
virginity the poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than i
am our misfortune is that our titania has discovered our asss ears
too soon

                            

now she laughs derisively at us and how she laughs i hear her
insolent melodious laughter in his studio under the open window of
which i stand jealously listening

                            

are you mad meah it is unbelievable me as the mother of god
she exclaimed and laughed again wait a moment i will show you
another picture of myself one that i myself have painted and you
shall copy it

her head appeared in the window luminous like a flame under the
sunlight

gregor

i hurried up the stairs through the gallery into the studio

lead him to the bath wanda commanded while she herself hurried
away

a few moments passed and wanda arrived dressed in nothing but the
sable fur with the whip in her hand she descended the stairs and
stretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion i lay
at her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me her right hand
played with the whip look at me she said with your deep
fanatical look thats it

the painter had turned terribly pale he devoured the scene with his
beautiful dreamy blue eyes his lips opened but he remained dumb

well how do you like the picture

yes that is how i want to paint you said the german but it was
really not a spoken language it was the eloquent moaning the
weeping of a sick soul a soul sick unto death

                            

the charcoal outline of the painting is done the heads and flesh
parts are painted in her diabolical face is already becoming visible
under a few bold strokes life flashes in her green eyes

wanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her
breast

this picture like many of those of the venetian school is
simultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story
explained the painter who again had become pale as death

and what will you call it she asked but what is the matter with
you are you ill

i am afraid he answered with a consuming look fixed on the
beautiful woman in furs but let us talk of the picture

yes let us talk about the picture

i imagine the goddess of love as having descended from mount olympus
for the sake of some mortal man and always cold in this modern world
of ours she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur
and her feet in the lap of her lover i imagine the favorite of a
beautiful despot who whips her slave when she is tired of kissing
him and the more she treads him underfoot the more insanely he loves
her and so i shall call the picture venus in furs

                            

the painter paints slowly but his passion grows more and more
rapidly i am afraid he will end up by committing suicide she plays
with him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve and he
feels his blood congealing in the process but it amuses her

during the sitting she nibbles at candies and rolls the paperwrappers
into little pellets with which she bombards him

i am glad you are in such good humor said the painter but your face
has lost the expression which i need for my picture

the expression which you need for your picture she replied
smiling wait a moment

she rose and dealt me a blow with the whip the painter looked at
her with stupefaction and a childlike surprise showed on his face
mingled with disgust and admiration

while whipping me wandas face acquired more and more of the cruel
contemptuous character which so haunts and intoxicates me

is this the expression you need for your picture she exclaimed
the painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her
eye

it is the expression he stammered but i cant paint now

what said wanda scornfully perhaps i can help you

yes cried the german as if taken with madness whip me too

oh with pleasure she replied shrugging her shoulders but if
i am to whip you i want to do it in sober earnest

whip me to death cried the painter

will you let me tie you she asked smiling

yes he moaned

wanda left the room for a moment and returned with ropes

wellare you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of
venus in furs the beautiful despot for better or worse she began
ironically

yes tie me the painter replied dully wanda tied his hands on
his back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his
body and fettered him to the crossbars of the window then she
rolled back the fur seized the whip and stepped in front of him

the scene had a grim attraction for me which i cannot describe i
felt my heart beat when with a smile she drew back her arm for the
first blow and the whip hissed through the air he winced slightly
under the blow then she let blow after blow rain upon him with her
mouth halfopened and her teeth flashing between her red lips until
he finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous blue eyes it
was indescribable

                            

she is sitting for him now alone he is working on her head

she has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain
where i cant be seen but can see everything

what does she intend now

is she afraid of him she has driven him insane enough to be sure
or is she hatching a new torment for me my knees tremble

they are talking he has lowered his voice so that i cannot
understand a word and she replies in the same way what is the
meaning of this is there an understanding between them

i suffer frightful torments my heart seems about to burst

he kneels down before her embraces her and presses his head
against her breast and shein her heartlessnesslaughsand now
i hear her saying aloud

ah you need another application of the whip

woman goddess are you without a heartcant you love exclaimed
the german dont you even know what it means to love to be
consumed with desire and passion cant you even imagine what i
suffer have you no pity for me

no she replied proudly and mockingly but i have the whip

she drew it quickly from the pocket of her furcoat and struck him
in the face with the handle he rose and drew back a couple of paces

now are you ready to paint again she asked indifferently he did
not reply but again went to the easel and took up his brush and
palette

the painting is marvellously successful it is a portrait which as
far as the likeness goes couldnt be better and at the same time it
seems to have an ideal quality the colors glow are supernatural
almost diabolical i would call them

the painter has put all his sufferings his adoration and all his
execration into the picture

                            

now he is painting me we are alone together for several hours every
day today he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said

you love this woman

yes

i also love her his eyes were bathed in tears he remained silent
for a while and continued painting

we have a mountain at home in germany within which she dwells he
murmured to himself she is a demon

                            

the picture is finished she insisted on paying him for it
munificently in the manner of queens

oh you have already paid me he said with a tormented smile
refusing her offer

before he left he secretly opened his portfolio and let me look
inside i was startled her head looked at me as if out of a mirror
and seemed actually to be alive

i shall take it along he said it is mine she cant take it
away from me i have earned it with my hearts blood

                            

i am really rather sorry for the poor painter she said to me today
it is absurd to be as virtuous as i am dont you think so too

i did not dare to reply to her

oh i forgot that i am talking with a slave i need some fresh air
i want to be diverted i want to forget

the carriage quick

her new dress is extravagant russian halfboots of violetblue
velvet trimmed with ermine and a skirt of the same material
decorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs above it is an
appropriate closefitting jacket also richly trimmed and lined with
ermine the headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of
catherine the second with a small aigrette held in place by a
diamondagraffe her red hair falls loose down her back she ascends
on the drivers seat and holds the reins herself i take my seat
behind how she lashes on the horses the carriage flies along like
mad

apparently it is her intention to attract attention today to make
conquests and she succeeds completely she is the lioness of the
cascine people nod to her from carriages on the footpath people
gather in groups to discuss her she pays no attention to anyone
except now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen
with a slight nod

suddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed
as soon as he sees wanda he stops his horse and makes it walk when
he is quite close he stops entirely and lets her pass and she too
sees himthe lioness the lion their eyes meet she madly drives
past him but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of
his look and she turns her head after him

my heart stops when i see the halfsurprised halfenraptured look
with which she devours him but he is worthy of it

for he is indeed a magnificent specimen of man no rather he is
a man whose like i have never yet seen among the living he is in the
belvedere graven in marble with the same slender yet steely
musculature with the same face and the same waving curls what makes
him particularly beautiful is that he is beardless if his hips were
less narrow one might take him for a woman in disguise the curious
expression about the mouth the lions lip which slightly discloses
the teeth beneath lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful
face

apollo flaying marsyas

he wears high black boots closely fitting breeches of white
leather short fur coat of black cloth of the kind worn by italian
cavalry officers trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops on his
black locks is a red fez

i now understand the masculine eros and i marvel at socrates for
having remained virtuous in view of an alcibiades like this

                            

i have never seen my lioness so excited her cheeks flamed when she
left from the carriage at her villa she hurried upstairs and with
an imperious gesture ordered me to follow

walking up and down her room with long strides she began to talk so
rapidly that i was frightened

you are to find out who the man in the cascine was immediately

oh what a man did you see him what do you think of him tell me

the man is beautiful i replied dully

he is so beautiful she paused supporting herself on the arm of
a chair that he has taken my breath away

i can understand the impression he has made on you i replied my
imagination carrying me away in a mad whirl i am quite lost in
admiration myself and i can imagine

you may imagine she laughed aloud that this man is my lover
and that he will apply the lash to you and that you will enjoy being
punished by him

but now go go

                            

before evening fell i had the desired information

wanda was still fully dressed when i returned she reclined on the
ottoman her face buried in her hands her hair in a wild tangle
like the red mane of a lioness

what is his name she asked uncanny calm

alexis papadopolis

a greek then

i nodded

he is very young

scarcely older than you they say he was educated in paris and
that he is an atheist he fought against the turks in candia and is
said to have distinguished himself there no less by his racehatred
and cruelty than by his bravery

all in all then a man she cried with sparkling eyes

at present he is living in florence i continued he is said to
be tremendously rich

i didnt ask you about that she interrupted quickly and sharply
the man is dangerous arent you afraid of him i am afraid of him
has he a wife

no

a mistress

no

what theaters does he attend

tonight he will be at the nicolini theater where virginia marini
and salvini are acting they are the greatest living artists in
italy perhaps in europe

see that you get a boxand be quick about it she commanded

but mistress

do you want a taste of the whip

                            

you can wait down in the lobby she said when i had placed the
operaglasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted
the footstool

i am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so
as not to fall down with envy and rageno rage isnt the right
word it was a mortal fear

i saw her in her box dressed in blue moire with a huge ermine cloak
about her bare shoulders he sat opposite i saw them devour each
other with their eyes for both of them the stage goldonis pamela
salvini marini the public even the entire world were nonexistant
tonight and iwhat was i at that moment

                            

today she is attending the ball at the greek ambassadors does she
know that she will meet him there

at any rate she dressed as if she did a heavy seagreen silk dress
plastically encloses her divine form leaving the bust and arms bare in
her hair which is done into a single flaming knot a white waterlily
blossoms from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose
strands fall down toward her neck there no longer is any trace of
agitation or trembling feverishness in her being she is calm so calm
that i feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her
glance slowly with a weary indolent majesty she ascends the marble
staircase lets her precious wrap slide off and listlessly enters the
hall where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist

for a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze then i pick up her
furs which without my being aware had slipped from my hands they
are still warm from her shoulders

i kiss the spot and my eyes fill with tears

                            

he has arrived

in his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable he is a
beautiful haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men
he stands in the anteroom looking around proudly and his eyes rest
on me for an uncomfortably long time

under his icy glance i am again seized by a mortal fear i have a
presentiment that this man can enchain her captivate her subjugate
her and i feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity i
am filled with envy with jealousy

i feel that i am a queer weakly creature of brains merely and what
is most humiliating i want to hate him but i cant why is that
among all the host of servants he has chosen me

with an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to
him and ii obey his callagainst my own will

take my furs he quickly commands

my entire body trembles with resentment but i obey abjectly like
a slave

                            

all night long i waited in the anteroom raving as in a fever
strange images hovered past my inner eye i saw their meetingtheir
long exchange of looks i saw her float through the hall in his arms
drunken lying with halfclosed lids against his breast i saw him
in the holy of holies of love lying on the ottoman not as slave
but as master and she at his feet on my knees i served them the
teatray faltering in my hands and i saw him reach for the whip
but now the servants are talking about him

he is a man who is like a woman he knows that he is beautiful and
he acts accordingly he changes his clothes four or five times a day
like a vain courtesan

in paris he appeared first in womans dress and the men assailed
him with loveletters an italian singer famous equally for his art
and his passionate intensity even invaded his home and lying on his
knees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldnt be his

i am sorry he replied smiling i should like to do you the
favor but you will have to carry out your threat for i am a man

                            

the drawingroom has already thinned out to a marked degree but she
apparently has no thought of leaving

morning is already peering through the blinds

at last i hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along
behind her like green waves she advances step by step engaged in
conversation with him

i hardly exist for her any longer she doesnt even trouble to give
me an order

the cloak for madame he commands he of course doesnt think of
looking after her himself

while i put her furs about her he stands to one side with his arms
crossed while i am on my knees putting on her fur overshoes she
lightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder she asks

and what about the lioness

when the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is
attacked by another the greek went on with his narrative the
lioness quietly lies down and watches the battle even if her mate
is worsted she does not go to his aid she looks on indifferently as
he bleeds to death under his opponents claws and follows the victor
the strongerthat is the females nature

at this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me

it made me shudder though i didnt know whyand the red dawn
immerses me and her and him in blood

                            

she did not go to bed but merely threw off her balldress and undid
her hair then she ordered me to build a fire and she sat by the
fireplace and stared into the flames

do you need me any longer mistress i asked my voice failed me
at the last word

wanda shook her head

i left the room passed through the gallery and sat down on one of
the steps leading from there down into the garden a gentle north
wind brought a fresh damp coolness from the arno the green hills
extended into the distance in a rosy mist a golden haze hovered over
the city over the round cupola of the duomo

a few stars still tremble in the paleblue sky

i tore open my coat and pressed my burning forehead against the
marble everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere
childs play but now things were beginning to be serious terribly
serious

i anticipated a catastrophe i visualized it i could lay hold of it
with my hands but i lacked the courage to meet it my strength was
broken and if i am honest with myself neither the pains and
sufferings that threatened me not the humiliations that impended
were the thing that frightened me

i merely felt a fear the fear of losing her whom i loved with a
sort of fanatical devotion but it was so overwhelming so crushing
that i suddenly began to sob like a child

                            

during the day she remained locked in her room and had the negress
attend her when the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky i saw
her pass through the garden and carefully following her at a
distance watched her enter the shrine of venus i stealthily
followed and peered through the chink in the door

she stood before the divine image of the goddess her hands folded
as in prayer and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue
rays over her

                            

on my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such
powerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me i
lighted the little red oillamp which hung in the corridor beneath
a saints image and entered her bedroom covering the light with one
hand

the lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted she
had fallen asleep among her pillows lying on her back her hands
clenched breathing heavily a dream seemed to oppress her i slowly
withdrew my hand and let the red light fall full on her wonderful
face

but she did not awaken

i gently set the lamp on the floor sank down beside wandas bed
and rested my head on her soft glowing arm

she moved slightly but even now did not awaken i do not know how
long i lay thus in the middle of the night turned as into a stone
by horrible torments

finally a severe trembling seized me and i was able to cry my
tears flowed over her arm she quivered several times and finally sat
up she brushed her hand across her eyes and looked at me

severin she exclaimed more frightened than angry

i was unable to reply

severin she continued softly what is the matter are you ill

her voice sounded so sympathetic so kind so full of love that it
clutched my breast like redhot tongs and i began to sob aloud

severin she began anew my poor unhappy friend her hand gently
stroked my hair i am sorry very sorry for you but i cant help
you with the best intention in the world i know of nothing that
would cure you

oh wanda must it be i moaned in my agony

what severin what are you talking about

dont you love me any more i continued havent you even a
little bit of pity for me has the beautiful stranger taken complete
possession of you

i cannot lie she replied softly after a short pause he has made
an impression on me which i havent yet been able to analyse further
than that i suffer and tremble beneath it it is an impression of the
sort i have met with in the works of poets or on the stage but i
always thought it was a figment of the imagination oh he is a man
like a lion strong and beautiful and yet gentle not brutal like the
men of our northern world i am sorry for you severin i am but i
must possess him what am i saying i must give myself to him if he
will have me

consider your reputation wanda which so far has remained
spotless i exclaimed even if i no longer mean anything to you

i am considering it she replied i intend to be strong as long
as it is possible i want she buried her head shyly in the pillows
i want to become his wifeif he will have me

wanda i cried seized again by that mortal fear which always
robs me of my breath makes me lose possession of myself you want
to be his wife belong to him for always oh do not drive me away
he does not love you

who says that she exclaimed flaring up

he does not love you i went on passionately but i love you i
adore you i am your slave i let you tread me underfoot i want to
carry you on my arms through life

who says that he doesnt love me she interrupted vehemently

oh be mine i replied be mine i cannot exist cannot live
without you have mercy on me wanda have mercy

she looked at me again and her face had her cold heartless
expression her evil smile

you say he doesnt love me she said scornfully very well then
get what consolation you can out of it

with this she turned over on the other side and contemptuously
showed me her back

good god are you a woman without flesh or blood havent you a
heart as well as i i cried while my breast heaved convulsively

you know what i am she replied coldly i am a woman of stone
venus in furs your ideal kneel down and pray to me

wanda i implored mercy

she began to laugh i buried my face in her pillows pain had
loosened the floodgates of my tears and i let them flow

for a long time silence reigned then wanda slowly raised herself

you bore me she began

wanda

i am tired let me go to sleep

mercy i implored do not drive me away no man no one will
love you as i do

let me go to sleepshe turned her back to me again

i leaped up and snatched the poinard which hung beside her bed
from its sheath and placed its point against my breast

i shall kill myself here before your eyes i murmured dully

do what you please wanda replied with complete indifference but
let me go to sleep she yawned aloud i am very sleepy

for a moment i stood as if petrified then i began to laugh and cry
at the same time finally i placed the poinard in my belt and again
fell on my knees before her

wanda listen to me only for a few moments i begged

i want to go to sleep dont you hear she cried leaping angrily
out of bed and pushing me away with her foot you forget that i am
your mistress when i didnt budge she seized the whip and struck
me i rose she struck me againthis time right in the face

wretch slave

with clenched fist held heavenward i left her bedroom with a sudden
resolve she tossed the whip aside and broke out into clear
laughter i can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been
very droll

                            

i have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman who
has treated me so cruelly and is now about to break faith and betray
me as a reward for all my slavish devotion for everything i have
suffered from her i packed my few belongings into a bundle and then
wrote her as follows

dear madam

i have loved you even to madness i have given myself to you as no man
ever has given himself to a woman you have abused my most sacred
emotions and played an impudent frivolous game with me however as
long as you were merely cruel and merciless it was still possible for
me to love you now you are about to become cheap i am no longer
the slave whom you can kick about and whip you yourself have set me
free and i am leaving a woman i can only hate and despise

severin kusiemski

i handed these lines to the negress and hastened away as fast as i
could go i arrived at the railwaystation all out of breath
suddenly i felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped i began to
weep it is humiliating that i want to flee and i cant i turn back
whitherto her whom i abhor and yet at the same time adore

again i pause i cannot go back i dare not

but how am i to leave florence i remember that i havent any money
not a penny very well then on foot it is better to be an honest
beggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan

but still i cant leave

she has my pledge my word of honor i have to return perhaps she
will release me

after a few rapid strides i stop again

she has my word of honor and my bond that i shall remain her slave
as long as she desires until she herself gives me my freedom but
i might kill myself

i go through the cascine down to the arno where its yellow waters
plash monotonously about a couple of stray willows there i sit and
cast up my final accounts with existence i let my entire life pass
before me in review on the whole it is rather a wretched affaira
few joys an endless number of indifferent and worthless things and
between these an abundant harvest of pains miseries fears
disappointments shipwrecked hopes afflictions sorrow and grief

i thought of my mother whom i loved so deeply and whom i had to
watch waste away beneath a horrible disease of my brother who full
of the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth
without even having put his lips to the cup of life i thought of my
dead nurse my childhood playmates the friends that had striven and
studied with me of all those covered by the cold dead indifferent
earth i thought of my turtledove who not infrequently made his
cooing bows to me instead of to his mateall have returned dust
unto dust

i laughed aloud and slid down into the water but at the same
moment i caught hold of one of the willowbranches hanging above the
yellow waves as in a vision i see the woman who has caused all my
misery she hovers above the level of the water luminous in the
sunlight as though she were transparent with red flames about her
head and neck she turns her face toward me and smiles

                            

i am back again dripping wet through glowing with shame and
fever the negress has delivered my letter i am judged lost in the
power of a heartless affronted woman

well let her kill me i am unable to do it myself and yet i have
no wish to go on living

as i walk around the house she is standing in the gallery leaning
over the railing her face is full in the light of the sun and her
green eyes sparkle

still alive she asked without moving i stood silent with bowed
head

give me back my poinard she continued it is of no use to you
you havent even the courage to take your own life

i have lost it i replied trembling shaken by chills

she looked me over with a proud scornful glance

i suppose you lost it in the arno she shrugged her shoulders no
matter well and why didnt you leave

i mumbled something which neither she nor i myself could understand

oh you havent any money she cried here with an
indescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse

i did not pick it up

both of us were silent for some time

you dont want to leave then

i cant

                            

wanda drives in the cascine without me and goes to the theater
without me she receives company and the negress serves her no one
asks after me i stray about the garden irresolutely like an animal
that has lost its master

lying among the bushes i watch a couple of sparrows fighting over
a seed

suddenly i hear the swish of a womans dress

wanda approaches in a gown of dark silk modestly closed up to the
neck the greek is with her they are in an eager discussion but i
cannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying he stamps
his foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions and he
lashes the air with his riding whip wanda startles

is she afraid that he will strike her

have they gone that far

he has left her she calls him he does not hear her does not want
to hear her

wanda sadly lowers her head and then sits down on the nearest
stonebench she sits for a long time lost in thought i watch her with
a sort of malevolent pleasure finally i pull myself together by sheer
force of will and ironically step before her she startles and
trembles all over

i come to wish you happiness i said bowing i see my dear
lady too has found a master

yes thank god she exclaimed not a new slave i have had enough
of them a master woman needs a master and she adores him

you adore him wanda i cried this brutal person

yes i love him as i have never loved any one else

wanda i clenched my fists but tears already filled my eyes and
i was seized by the delirium of passion as by a sweet madness very
well take him as your husband let him be your master but i want
to remain your slave as long as i live

you want to remain my slave even then she said that would be
interesting but i am afraid he wouldnt permit it

he

yes he is already jealous of you she exclaimed he of you he
demanded that i dismiss you immediately and when i told him who you
were

you told him i repeated thunderstruck

i told him everything she replied our whole story all your
queerness everythingand he instead of being amused grew angry
and stamped his foot

and threatened to strike you

wanda looked to the ground and remained silent

yes indeed i said with mocking bitterness you are afraid of
him wanda i threw myself down at her feet and in my agitation
embraced her knees i dont want anything of you except to be your
slave to be always near you i will be your dog

do you know you bore me said wanda indifferently

i leaped up everything within me was seething

you are now no longer cruel but cheap i said clearly and
distinctly accentuating every word

you have already written that in your letter wanda replied with
a proud shrug of the shoulders a man of brains should never repeat
himself

the way you are treating me i broke out what would you call it

i might punish you she replied ironically but i prefer this
time to reply with reasons instead of lashes you have no right to
accuse me havent i always been honest with you havent i warned
you more than once didnt i love you with all my heart even
passionately and did i conceal the fact from you that it was
dangerous to give yourself into my power to abase yourself before
me and that i want to be dominated but you wished to be my
plaything my slave you found the highest pleasure in feeling the
foot the whip of an arrogant cruel woman what do you want now

dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me but you were the
first to awaken them if i now take pleasure in torturing you
abusing you it is your fault you have made of me what i now am and
now you are even unmanly weak and miserable enough to accuse me

yes i am guilty i said but havent i suffered because of it
let us put an end now to the cruel game

that is my wish too she replied with a curious deceitful look

wanda i exclaimed violently dont drive me to extremes you see
that i am a man again

a fire of straw she replied which makes a lot of stir for a
moment and goes out as quickly as it flared up you imagine you can
intimidate me and you only make yourself ridiculous had you been
the man i first thought you were serious reserved stern i would
have loved you faithfully and become your wife woman demands that
she can look up to a man but one like you who voluntarily places his
neck under her foot she uses as a welcome plaything only to toss
it aside when she is tired of it

try to toss me aside i said jeeringly some toys are dangerous

dont challenge me exclaimed wanda her eyes began to flash and
a flush entered her cheeks

if you wont be mine now i continued with a voice stifled with
rage no one else shall possess you either

what play is this from she mocked seizing me by the breast she
was pale with anger at this moment dont challenge me she
continued i am not cruel but i dont know whether i may not become
so and whether then there will be any bounds

what worse can you do than to make your lover your husband i
exclaimed more and more enraged

i might make you his slave she replied quickly are you not in
my power havent i the agreement but of course you will merely
take pleasure in it if i have you bound and say to him

do with him what you please

woman are you mad i cried

i am entirely rational she said calmly i warn you for the last
time dont offer any resistance one who has gone as far as i have
gone might easily go still further i feel a sort of hatred for you
and would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death i am still
restraining myself but

scarcely master of myself any longer i seized her by the wrist and
forced her to the ground so that she lay on her knees before me

severin she cried rage and terror were painted on her face

i shall kill you if you marry him i threatened the words came
hoarsely and dully from my breast you are mine i wont let you go
i love you too much then i clutched her and pressed her close to
me my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which i still had
in my belt

wanda fixed a large calm incomprehensible look on me

i like you that way she said carelessly now you are a man and
at this moment i know i still love you

wanda i wept with rapture and bent down over her covering her
dear face with kisses and she suddenly breaking into a loud gay
laugh said have you finished with your ideal now are you
satisfied with me

you mean i stammered that you werent serious

i am very serious she gaily continued i love you only you and
youyou foolish little man didnt know that everything was only
makebelieve and playacting how hard it often was for me to strike
you with the whip when i would have rather taken your head and
covered it with kisses but now we are through with that arent we
i have played my cruel role better than you expected and now you
will be satisfied with my being a good little wife who isnt
altogether unattractive isnt that so we will live like rational
people

you will marry me i cried overflowing with happiness

yesmarry youyou dear darling man whispered wanda kissing my
hands

i drew her up to my breast

now you are no longer gregor my slave said she but severin
the dear man i love

and heyou dont love him i asked in agitation

how could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type you were
blind to everything i was really afraid for you

i almost killed myself for your sake

really she cried ah i still tremble at the thought that you
were already in the arno

but you saved me i replied tenderly you hovered over the
waters and smiled and your smile called me back to life

                            

i have a curious feeling when i now hold her in my arms and she lies
silently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles i feel
like one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium or
like a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that
momentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe
shore

                            

i hate this florence where you have been so unhappy she
declared as i was saying goodnight to her i want to leave
immediately tomorrow you will be good enough to write a couple of
letters for me and while you are doing that i will drive to the
city to pay my farewell visits is that satisfactory to you

of course you dear sweet beautiful woman

                            

early in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how i had slept
her tenderness is positively wonderful i should never have believed
that she could be so tender

                            

she has now been gone for over four hours i have long since
finished the letters and am now sitting in the gallery looking down
the street to see whether i cannot discover her carriage in the
distance i am a little worried about her and yet i know there is
no reason under heaven why i should doubt or fear however a feeling
of oppression weighs me down and i cannot rid myself of it it is
probably the sufferings of the past days which still cast their
shadows into my soul

                            

she is back radiant with happiness and contentment

well has everything gone as you wished i asked tenderly kissing
her hand

yes dear heart she replied and we shall leave tonight help
me pack my trunks

                            

toward evening she asked me to go to the postoffice and mail her
letters myself i took her carriage and was back within an hour

mistress has asked for you said the negress with a grin as i
ascended the wide marble stairs

has anyone been here

no one she replied crouching down on the steps like a black cat

i slowly passed through the drawingroom and then stood before her
bedroom door

why does my heart beat so am i not perfectly happy

opening the door softly i draw back the portiere wanda is lying on
the ottoman and does not seem to notice me how beautiful she looks
in her silvergray dress which fits closely and while displaying
in telltale fashion her splendid figure leaves her wonderful bust
and arms bare

her hair is interwoven with and held up by a black velvet ribbon
a mighty fire is burning in the fireplace the hanging lamp casts
a reddish glow and the whole room is as if drowned in blood

wanda i said at last

oh severin she cried out joyously i have been impatiently
waiting for you she leaped up and folded me in her arms she sat
down again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her
side but i softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her
lap

do you know i am very much in love with you today she whispered
brushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes

how beautiful your eyes are i have always loved them as the best
of you but today they fairly intoxicate me i am all she
extended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath
her red lashes

and youyou are coldyou hold me like a block of wood wait ill
stir you with the fire of love she said and again clung fawningly
and caressingly to my lips

i no longer please you i suppose ill have to be cruel to you
again evidently i have been too kind to you today do you know you
little fool what i shall do i shall whip you for a while

but child

i want to

wanda

come let me bind you she continued and ran gaily through the
room i want to see you very much in love do you understand here
are the ropes i wonder if i can still do it

she began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind
my back pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner

so she said with gay eagerness can you still move

no

fine

she then tied a noose in a stout rope threw it over my head and
let it slip down as far as the hips she drew it tight and bound me
to a pillar

a curious tremor seized me at that moment

i have a feeling as if i were about to be executed i said with a
low voice

well you shall have a thorough punishment today exclaimed wanda

but put on your furjacket please i said

i shall gladly give you that pleasure she replied she got her
kazabaika and put it on then she stood in front of me with
her arms folded across her chest and looked at me out of halfclosed
eyes

do you remember the story of the ox of dionysius she asked

i remember it only vaguely what about it

a courtier invented a new implement of torture for the tyrant of
syracuse it was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were
to be shut and then pushed into a mighty furnace

as soon as the iron ox began to get hot and the condemned person
began to cry out in his torment his wails sounded like the bellowing
of an ox

dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor and to put his
invention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox

it is a very instructive story

it was you who innoculated me with selfishness pride and cruelty
and you shall be their first victim i now literally enjoy having a
human being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power
i love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than i
especially a man who loves me

do you still love me

even to madness i exclaimed

so much the better she replied and so much the more will you
enjoy what i am about to do with you now

what is the matter with you i asked i dont understand you
there is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes today and you are
strangely beautifulcompletely venus in furs

without replying wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me
i was again seized by my fanatical passion

where is the whip i asked

wanda laughed and withdrew a couple of steps

you really insist upon being punished she exclaimed proudly
tossing back her head

yes

suddenly wandas face was completely transformed it was as if
disfigured by rage for a moment she seemed even ugly to me

very well then you whip him she called loudly

at the same instant the beautiful greek stuck his head of black
curls through the curtains of her fourposter bed at first i was
speechless petrified there was a horribly comic element in the
situation i would have laughed aloud had not my position been at
the same time so terribly cruel and humiliating

it went beyond anything i had imagined a cold shudder ran down my
back when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots his
tightfitting white breeches and his short velvet jacket and i saw
his athletic limbs

you are indeed cruel he said turning to wanda

only inordinately fond of pleasure she replied with a wild sort
of humor pleasure alone lends value to existence whoever enjoys
does not easily part from life whoever suffers or is needy meets
death like a friend

but whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the
ancient world he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others
he must never feel pity he must be ready to harness others to his
carriage or his plough as though they were animals he must know how to
make slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does and use them for
his service and pleasure without remorse it is not his affair whether
they like it or whether they go to rack and ruin he must always
remember this that if they had him in their power as he has them they
would act in exactly the same way and he would have to pay for their
pleasure with his sweat and blood and soul that was the world of the
ancients pleasure and cruelty liberty and slavery went hand in hand
people who want to live like the gods of olympus must of necessity have
slaves whom they can toss into their fishponds and gladiators who will
do battle the while they banquet and they must not mind if by chance a
bit of blood bespatters them

her words brought back my complete selfpossession

unloosen me i exclaimed angrily

arent you my slave my property replied wanda do you want me
to show you the agreement

untie me i threatened otherwise i tugged at the ropes

can he tear himself free she asked he has threatened to kill me

be entirely at ease said the greek testing my fetters

i shall call for help i began again

no one will hear you replied wanda and no one will hinder me
from abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game
with you she continued repeating with satanic mockery phrases from
my letter to her

do you think i am at this moment merely cruel and merciless or am
i also about to become cheap what do you still love me or do you
already hate and despise me here is the whip she handed it to the
greek who quickly stepped closer

dont you dare i exclaimed trembling with indignation i wont
permit it

oh because i dont wear furs the greek replied with an ironical
smile and he took his short sable from the bed

you are adorable exclaimed wanda kissing him and helping him
into his furs

may i really whip him he asked

do with him what you please replied wanda

beast i exclaimed utterly revolted

the greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the
whip his muscles swelled when he drew back his arms and made the
whip hiss through the air i was bound like marsyas while apollo was
getting ready to flay me

my look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling
where samson lying at delilahs feet was about to have his eyes put
out by the philistines the picture at that moment seemed to me like
a symbol an eternal parable of passion and lust of the love of man
for woman each one of us in the end is a samson i thought and
ultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves
whether he wears an ordinary coat or sables

now watch me break him in said the greek he showed his teeth
and his face acquired the bloodthirsty expression which startled
me the first time i saw him

and he began to apply the lashso mercilessly with such frightful
force that i quivered under each blow and began to tremble all over
with pain tears rolled down over my cheeks in the meantime wanda
lay on the ottoman in her furjacket supporting herself on her arm
she looked on with cruel curiosity and was convulsed with laughter

the sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes
of an adored woman cannot be described i almost went mad with shame
and despair

what was most humiliating was that at first i felt a certain wild
supersensual stimulation under apollos whip and the cruel laughter
of my venus no matter how horrible my position was but apollo
whipped on and on blow after blow until i forgot all about poetry
and finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage and cursed my wild
dreams woman and love

all of a sudden i saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion
and lust have led man ever since holofernes and agamemnoninto a
blind alley into the net of womans treachery into misery slavery
and death

it was as though i were awakening from a dream

blood was already flowing under the whip i wound like a worm that
is trodden on but he whipped on without mercy and she continued to
laugh without mercy in the meantime she locked her packed trunk and
slipped into her travelling furs and was still laughing when she
went downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage

then everything was silent for a moment

i listened breathlessly

the carriage door slammed the horse began to pullthe rolling of
the carriage for a short timethen all was over

                            

for a moment i thought of taking vengeance of killing him but i
was bound by the abominable agreement so nothing was left for me to
do except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth

                            

my first impulse after this the most cruel catastrophe of my life
was to seek laborious tasks dangers and privations i wanted to
become a soldier and go to asia or algiers but my father was old and
ill and wanted me

so i quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his
burdens and learned how to look after the estate which i had never
done before to labor and to do my duty was comforting like a
drink of fresh water then my father died and i inherited the estate
but it meant no change

i had put on my own spanish boots and went on living just as
rationally as if the old man were standing behind me looking over
my shoulder with his large wise eyes

one day a box arrived accompanied by a letter i recognized wandas
writing

curiously moved i opened it and read

sir

now that over three years have passed since that night in florence
i suppose i may confess to you that i loved you deeply you
yourself however stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and
your insane passion from the moment that you became my slave i knew
it would be impossible for you ever to become my husband however
i found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person
and while i gloriously amused myself perhaps to cure you

i found the strong man for whom i felt a need and i was as happy
with him as i suppose it is possible for any one to be on this
funny ball of clay

but my happiness like all things mortal was of short duration
about a year ago he fell in a duel and since then i have been living
in paris like an aspasia

and youyour life surely is not without its sunshine if you have
gained control of your imagination and those qualities in you have
materialized which at first so attracted me to youyour clarity of
intellect kindness of heart and above all else yourmoral
seriousness

i hope you have been cured under my whip the cure was cruel but
radical in memory of that time and of a woman who loved you
passionately i am sending you the portrait by the poor german

venus in furs

i had to smile and as i fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly
stood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine with the
whip in her hand and i continued to smile at the woman i had once
loved so insanely at the furjacket that had once so entranced me
at the whip and ended by smiling at myself and saying the cure was
cruel but radical but the main point is i have been cured

                            

and the moral of the story i said to severin when i put the
manuscript down on the table

that i was a donkey he exclaimed without turning around for he
seemed to be embarrassed if only i had beaten her

a curious remedy i exclaimed which might answer with your
peasantwomen

oh they are used to it he replied eagerly but imagine the
effect upon one of our delicate nervous hysterical ladies

but the moral

that woman as nature has created her and as man is at present
educating her is his enemy she can only be his slave or his despot
but never his companion this she can become only when she has
the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work

at present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil and i
was the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him do you
understand

the moral of the tale is this whoever allows himself to be
whipped deserves to be whipped

the blows as you see have agreed with me the roseate supersensual
mist has dissolved and no one can ever make me believe again that
these sacred apes of benares footnote one of schopenhauers
designations for women or platos rooster footnote diogenes
threw a plucked rooster into platos school and exclaimed here
you have platos human being are the image of god
