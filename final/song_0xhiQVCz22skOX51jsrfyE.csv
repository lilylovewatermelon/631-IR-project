you feel like a candle in a hurricane
just like a picture with a broken frame
alone and helpless like youve lost your fight
but youll be alright youll be alright

chorus
cause when push comes to shove
you taste what youre made of
you might bend til you break
cause its all you can take
on your knees you look up
decide youve had enough
you get mad you get strong
wipe your hands shake it off
then you stand then you stand

verse 2
lifes like a novel with the end ripped out
the edge of a canyon with only one way down
take what youre given before its gone
and start holdin on keep holdin on

chorus
cause when push comes to shove
you taste what youre made of
you might bend til you break
cause its all you can take
on your knees you look up
decide youve had enough
you get mad you get strong
wipe your hands shake it off
then you stand yeah then you stand
you might also likebridge
every time you get up
and get back in the race
one more small piece of you
starts to fall into place yeah

chorus
cause when push comes to shove
you taste what youre made of
you might bend til you break
cause its all you can take
on your knees you look up
decide youve had enough
you get mad you get strong
wipe your hands shake it off
yeah then you stand
yeah baby
woo hoo woo hoo
woo hoo woo hoo
then you stand yeah yeahembed"
