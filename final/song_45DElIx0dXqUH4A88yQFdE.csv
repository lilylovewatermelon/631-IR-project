she said ill throw myself away
theyre just photos after all
i cant make you hang around
i cant wash you off my skin
outside the frame is what were leaving out
you wont remember anyway

chorus
i can go with the flow
dont say it doesnt matter with the flow
matter anymore
i can go with the flow i can go
do you believe it in your head

verse 2
its so safe to play along
little soldiers in a row
falling in and out of love
something sweet to throw away
i want something good to die for
to make it beautiful to live
i want a new mistake
lose is more than hesitate
do you believe it in your head
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus
i can go with the flow
dont say it doesnt matter with the flow
matter anymore
i can go with the flow i can go
do you believe it in your head

do you believe it in your head
do you believe it in your head18embed"
