softer her laughter
the harder to see her
she scares me gives me the horrors
follows me with her martyrs

prechorus owain
cause youre half the way there
do you ever care
do you ever think
suckling on a drink
cause youre half the way to me
will you ever see
half the way to earth
do you feel my worth

chorus owain
ill bathe the angels in blood
cause its that time of the month
i wanna worship the sun
dont pull a face when you cum
you never suffered the truth
because you wasted your youth
i wanna do what i please
because they fuck you with ease

liar the father
higher the mother
she scares me gives me the horrors
follows me with her martyrs

prechorus owain
cause youre half the way there
do you ever care
do you ever think
suckling on a drink
half the way to me
will you ever see
half the way to earth
do you feel my worth

chorus owain
he wants to prove he can kill
he wants to live with the thrill
i wanna keep when i share
i wanna watch when you tear
i put salt in your wounds
i hope i lighten your mood
i wanna unlock the door
and catch you on all fours
i wanna break you like glass
i wanna do it with class
i wanna kiss like a girl
i wanna fuck up your world
i wanna live like he loves
but it is never enough
i wanna stand but i fall
cause ill be taking it all9embed"
