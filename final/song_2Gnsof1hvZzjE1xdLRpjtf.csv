how im feeling it doesnt matter
cause you know im okay
instead i ask myself why do you worry
when you know you know im the same
i know i know you dont love me baby
theyre trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body

verse 1 drake
i think i killed everybody in the game last year
man fuck it i was on though
and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
mmmmmm fuck it i was wrong though
shout out to all my niggas livin taxfree
nowadays its six figures when they tax me
oh well guess you lose some and win some
long as the outcome is income
you know i want it all and then some
shout out to asian girls let the lights dim some
shots came i dont know where they was sent from
probably some bad hoes im bout to take the hint from
yeah you know me well nigga yeah
i mean you aint the only real nigga
they got me on these white women like seal nigga
slave to the pussy but im just playin the field nigga yeah
are these people really discussin my career again
askin if ill be goin platinum in a year again
dont i got the shit the world wanna hear again
dont michael jordan still got his hoop earring in
man all of your flows bore me paint dryin
and i dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
and i be hearin the shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time yeah
its been that way from the beginnin
i just been playin i aint even notice i was winnin
and this is the only sound you should fear

verse 2 drake

cause if im goin anywhere its probably too far
just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
used half of the money to beat my brothers case
red wine over fed time
but shout out to the niggas thats doin dead time
and shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
and fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
yeah dont make me take your life apart boy
you and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
oh you wanna be a motherfuckin funny guy
dont make me break your kevin hart boy

i think maybe i was numb to it last year
but you know i feel it now more than ever
my city love me like mac dre in the bay
second album im back pavin the way
the backpackers are back on the bandwagon
like this was my comeback season back back in the day
and i met your baby moms last night
we took a picture together i hope she frames it
and i was drinkin at the palms last night
and ended up losin everything that i came with yeah
feel like ive been here before huh
i still got ten years to go huh
and this is the only sound you should fear
man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

oh i know you dont love me baby
