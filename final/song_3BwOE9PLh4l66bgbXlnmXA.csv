faded jeans and politics and shooters in the sky
diagnosed a menus and im broken in the mind
the doctor said the ritalin would surely work out fine
youre always there youre always with me you always fill me up
its scary out there
youre always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
flower rich emotion and i cant control my mind
a drop of antimatter and ill blow up all mankind
maybe i am jaded or im mean or i am blind
live in fear or god is real theres nothing left to hide
youre always there youre always with me you always fill me up
its scary out there
youre always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
its not the same living on the edge
im not the same so go ahead and ride
never had the chance to love you
hard cock suicide
youre always there youre always with me you always fill me up
its scary out there
youre always fair you always miss me you always bring me love
never be scaredsee buckcherry liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeembed"
