verse
i ain’t been scared to die since 16
been off adderall and big dreams
so i cant find a time to get sleep

we been on that road like a ten speed
knew that you would leave because they all do
i was there when you needed me
but when i needed peace i couldn’t call you

chorus
i been prepared for the worst since a juvenile
young nigga full of pain you cant turn him down
reminisce on dark days make it hard to smile lord lord
okay so right before you leave
look me in my eyes tell me what you see
