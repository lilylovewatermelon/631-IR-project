were both throwing smoke into the night
its raining i suppose that you need a ride
she said ive got nothin to do and neither do you
theres a place down the road where we can waste the whole afternoon

chorus
i overheard that she was nineteen
shes got a fake id and a nose ring
those kind of girls tend to know things
better than i do
and im dying
to figure out what shes hiding
shes playing it cool but shes lying
better than i do

verse 2
feels like a night to carry a tune
ive been carrying yours since you wrecked my room
and ive got nothin to do and neither do you
so well chase jack with love
and waste away the whole afternoon

chorus
i overheard that she was nineteen
shes got a fake id and a nose ring
those kind of girls tend to know things
better than i do
and im dying
to figure out what shes hiding
shes playing it cool but shes lying
better than i do
