tangled in a state of suffocation
slave to self righteousness
damnation is on your lips
from sorrow to serenity
the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity
its on your head come on
this is my last serenade
i feel you as you fall away
this is my last
from yourself you cant run away
its your choice
point the finger
but its on your head
your destination is a choice within yourself
will you rise
or become a slave
to self righteousness
open up your heart and gaze within
from sorrow to serenity
the truth is absolution
from sorrow to serenity
its on your head
this is my last
i feel you as you fall away
this is my last
from yourself you cant run awaysee killswitch engage liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likeembed"
