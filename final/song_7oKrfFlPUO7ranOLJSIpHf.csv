i cant get out of this
altered state of mind
im going overboard
my conscience meets decline
into reality
i know this cant be fine

cause im all messed up
making perfect nonsense
drowning in my doubt to hell
cause im all messed up
going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
so blind

who are these voices in my head
i cant go on like this
living like the dead
i havent slept so long
feeling sad i dread
im talking to myself
forgot what i just said

cause im all messed up
making perfect nonsense
drowning in my doubt to hell
cause im all messed up
going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
so blind
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likewell i hold my only enemy as closely as a friend
and i sold my own reality to further my descent
selfdestruction taking over its so easy to pretend
introduction to this nightmare that now seems may never end

can anyone help me drag my heels
im running overtime
i cant hold down my meals
my mind is racing by
staring blankly feels
like pulling out my teeth
while this engine winds

cause im all messed up
making perfect nonsense
drowning in my doubt to hell
cause im all messed up
going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
so blindembed"
