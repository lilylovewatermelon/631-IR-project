the time has come to an end
yeah this is what nature planned
being tracked by a starving beast
looking for its daily feast
a predator on the verge of death
close to its last breath
getting close to its last breath

prechorus
rules of nature

chorus
and they run when the sun comes up
with their lives on the line
alive for a while
no choice gotta follow the laws of the wild
alive with their lives on the line
no choice out here only the strong survive

verse 2
whats done is done survived to see another day
the dance of life the hunter and the agile prey
no guarantee which of them will succeed
strong or weak
