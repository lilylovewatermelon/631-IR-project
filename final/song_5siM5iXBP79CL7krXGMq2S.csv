as i was saying
just before you left the room before
before i assumed that you might not
come around
as i was saying
just after i took my foot from
my mouth and put it back
on the ground

chorus
well i dont want to disappoint you
and i dont want to disappear
from here or now or you

verse 2
this is worth saving
cause the sum of us is more than us
if you add us up then subtract
my lack of sleep
cause my mind feels crazy
when all these thoughts come rushing in
should i be trusting them or
only let them be

chorus
cause i dont want to disappoint you
and i dont want to disappear
from here or now or you
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likebridge
is it just a matter of time
does it even matter at all
cause even if this story should fall from the sky to the sea
if i should fall would you fall down with me
would you fall with me

verse 3
found my foundation
it was underneath me all alone
on this path im on now i
never walk alone
and ive been erasing
rewrote the second half like this
so my protagonist might find
his way back home

chorus
and i dont want to disappoint you
i dont want to disappear
from here or now or you
no not from here or now or you1embed"
