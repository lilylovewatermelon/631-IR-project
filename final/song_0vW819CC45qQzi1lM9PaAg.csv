i watch your troubled eyes as you rest
and i fall in love with every breath
wonder if those eyes are really shut
and am i the one youre dreaming of

prechorus
cause underneath the darkness
theres a light thats trying so hard to be seen
and i know this cause i’ve noticed
a little bit shining through the seams

chorus
and if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
if this is what it takes
ill break down these walls that are in our way
if this is what it takes

verse 2
you keep on telling me im wasting time
but to call it wasting time oh thats a crime
and you think its crazy what im tryna do
well baby im a fool for you

prechorus
cause underneath the darkness
theres a light thats trying so hard to be seen
and i know this cause i’ve noticed
a little bit shining through the seams

cause if you dont understand yet
then ill never let you forget

ill be your shoulder to lean on
ill be your right when you feel wrong
