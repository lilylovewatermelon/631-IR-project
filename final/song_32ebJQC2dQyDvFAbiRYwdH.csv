we have come too far to let our fulfillment fall away
i must refuse to renounce my integrity
we stand in defiance to their ethics
let the grief they have inflicted serve as our call to arms
are you ready  are you ready
are you willing to be the catalyst
we can no longer be indifferent
restore this dying world

chorus 1
from misery we have turned away
ignite the past
let the bridges burn

verse 2
my eyes watch the unholy be left in the distance
the division of our souls from our blasphemous tongues
this is our atonement

chorus 2
from misery we have turned away
ignite the past
let the bridges burn
from sorrow from sorrow
we have turned away
to the past to the past
let the bridges burn
see killswitch engage liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likebridge
i have bled for the truth
there is no surrender
move forward
commit yourself
destroy all lies

verse 3
from ashes to ashes
from dust to dust
from ashes to ashes
from dust to dust

chorus 1
from misery we have turned away
ignite the past
let the bridges burn

outro
let the bridges burn
let the bridges burnembed"
