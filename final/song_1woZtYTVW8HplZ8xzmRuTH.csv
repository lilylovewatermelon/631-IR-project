indistinguishable from one another
no possible intention to even bother
it doesnt matter what is said or how we say it
coincidentally
we all sound exactly the same
we all want to swindle kids out of their money
if youre still doing this because you believe in it
you are so fuckin lame

prechorus 1 celia euringer
yo supe que nadie iba a comprender tu musica  pero tú no me hicíste caso yo te dije no te vistas en color rosa

chorus jimmy
hey when the worlds overrun
with too many bands
whos it time for
mark chapman
hey when they all seem absurd
who will thin out that herd
ladies and gentlemen
mark chapman

now there is no heart
there is no fear
we all just cry the same old tear
dont look to me
i do not lead
im just in front and theyre following
you might also likesome other motherfucker without the balls and cojones to take hold of the reins and use em

verse 2 jimmy
why is something so obvious so elusive
there is nothing on the menu that wont turn abusive
i am part of the problem not the solution
im just a prisoner
in the same prison as you
we wait for all the shoes to fall into position
already obsolete
no one will miss us at all

prechorus 2 celia
jimmys mom yo te dije no debes de firmar con una compania de discos tan grande ellos no te aprecian ¡yo no creo en ti

chorus jimmy
hey when the worlds overrun
with too many bands
whos it time for
mark chapman
hey when they all seem absurd
who will thin out that herd
ladies and gentlemen
mark chapman

now there is no heart
there is no fear
we all just cry the same old tear
i cannot tell
is it just me
or do we all look just like
adolffuckinhitler with this swoopy emo boy dreamy haircut dangling in our faces
making us all indescribably indistinguishable from each other
or maybe im just another megalomaniac oohhoohoo
oohh
reginald release the hounds
run pooky
run to chapman run
