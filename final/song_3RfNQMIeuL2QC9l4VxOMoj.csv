youre in my bed uninvited
its fine cause im in the mood
hope you dont mind if i spike it
well drink it just me and you

prechorus miley cyrus
and you know were gonna be alright
well be sleeping on a redeye flight
keep up with me til the end of the night
and were just gettin started

chorus miley cyrus
always last to leave the party
drugs rule everything around me
wake up with new tattoos on my body
drugs rule everything around me
hit the goose raise a toast pop the molly
i can go toetotoe like im ali
were all tryna fill the lonely
drugs rule everything around me

postchorus miley cyrus

and were just gettin started

chorus miley cyrus
always last to leave the party

wake up with new tattoos on my body
drugs rule everything around me
hit the ghost raise a toast pop the molly
all the girls in my room look like dolly
were all tryna fill the lonely
drugs rule everything around me
