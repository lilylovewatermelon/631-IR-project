i am damaged far too damaged
but you’re not beyond repair
stick around here
make things better
‘cause you beat me fair and square
 
please stand back now
‘little further
don’t know what this thing will do
hope you’ll miss me
wish you’d kiss me
then you’d know i worship you
i’ll trade my life for yours

oh my god—
 
jd
and once i disappear
 
veronica
wait hold on—
 
jd
clean up the mess down here
 
veronica
not this way
 
jd
our love is god
our love is god
our love is god
our love is god
 
veronica
say hi to god
