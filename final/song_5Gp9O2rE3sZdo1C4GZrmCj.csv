when when i am down
i lay my hands upon this ground
for the thousandth time
i call him in his earth is mine

prechorus
before i make the offering
remember all the faces that ive seen
now all the marks have settled on my skin
from all the different places that ive been
that ive been

chorus
and i feel the light for the very first time
not anybody knows that i am lucky to be alive
and i feel the light for the very first time
not anybody knows that i am lucky to be alive

verse 2
war inside my mind
behind my eyes is coming down
and for the thousandth time
i feel too numb to even mind

prechorus
before i make the offering
remember all the faces that ive seen
