mighty long shifts are for working
heavy dreams are for toting around
lets pretend theres a place to go
where i can lay this hacksaw down
and ive been trying all my damnedest
to get where a kind woman lies
ten more hours to a twelve long shift
til these woods turn to her eyes
the timber cuts so cleanly
monday morning when the blades are sharp
i get a love song stuck in my head
and cut sequoia til its dark

chorus
if every hours fourteen dollars or a chance closer to her
then im not just a working mule im the finest of the herd
and i dont know who she is or if she might exist
but if she does i swear to love im destined for that kiss

verse 2
hows a man get so homesick
for a face hes never seen
i close my eyes while sweating
and think of boys i couldve been
but i know that it’s not over
cause i can feel her here somewhere
through these trees and melodies
that i’m belting to the air
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
if every hours fourteen dollars or a chance closer to it
the man i thought id be when i was just a kid
so ill just saw away and let them all fall to the ground
hope to heaven someone hears me
even though no ones around

verse 3
mighty long shifts are for working
quiet dreams are for toting around
lets pretend theres a place to go
where i can lay this hacksaw downembed"
