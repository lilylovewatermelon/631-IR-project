i remember when your heart depended on me
what was perfect for you was perfect for me
if something happened we could shake it off
like we were cut from the same cloth
and i remember when your heart depended on me

chorus
now you’re tellin’ everyone
you’ve made it on your own
oh but who’s the one who loved you when you couldn’t be loved
who took you higher than the moon above
oh i gave you everything that i could give and yet
how quickly you forget
oh yeah

verse 2
i recall all the time you took the credit
i thought you were god’s gift but i was only offended
maybe i was wrong and a little naive
to think you’d ever take advantage of me
i recall all the time you took the credit

chorus
now you’re tellin’ everyone
you’ve made it on your own
oh but who’s the one who loved you when you couldn’t be loved
who took you higher than the moon above
oh i gave you everything that i could give and yet
how quickly you forget
oh yeah
