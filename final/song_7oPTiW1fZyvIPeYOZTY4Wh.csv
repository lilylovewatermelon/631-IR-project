we could find a porch to hold us where we could all scream childers
drink the shit that kills us until we all remember
who it was when we were younger fore the world took our pride
when we were walkin’ in straight lines tryna find whos good to drive

verse 2
and ive had so many evenings the way i felt i can’t recall
was i jumpin from the rafters when my buddies broke my fall
by the end of the night wed be flying or cryin
talkin bout the times weve spent livin towards dyin’

chorus
so don’t stop runnin boy but don’t be naive
cause this world will burn and break you worse than hearts like ours believe
dont stop dancin girl ’til it feels right
cause well be flyig or cryin by the end of the night

verse 3
you always snuck up in my front seat with some reasons of your own
tryna get a plainsman drunk and all alone
but dont you go fallin for and dont you go believin
a boy with calloused hands with a mind set on leavin

verse 4
all the moments that weve been through all the memories weve made
i dont think godd be willin to come down here and save
some heathens from the flatlands who only bitch and moan
but if im goin down at least im not goin down alone
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
so dont stop running boy but dont be naive
cause this world will break and burn you worse than hearts like ours believe
dont stop dancig girl til it feels right
cause well be flyin or cryin by the end of the nightembed"
