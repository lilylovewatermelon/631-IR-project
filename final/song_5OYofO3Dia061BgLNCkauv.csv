sometimes this house feels like a prison
that i just cant leave behind
theres so many rules i gotta follow
because you cant let go

i dont wanna hear it
and i just cant believe it
all the stupid things you say

i wont take this anymore
one day

to do to do to do what i want to
and i wont have to run away
and you wont be there to say im not allowed to
one day
