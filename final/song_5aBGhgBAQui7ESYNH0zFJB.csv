theres nobody better than you
it took me a while till i knew
but you knew from the start it was us didnt you
it just took me a while till i knew

prechorus 1
now i lay as i study a blank wall
would you spare me your voice if i call
cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
you just grew a little smarter too

chorus
so i dont blame you if you want to
bury me in your memory im not the girl i ought to be but
maybe when you tell your friends you
can tell them what you saw in me and not how i turned out to be

verse 2
theres some kind of burning inside me
its kept me from falling apart
and im sure that youve seen what its done to my heart
but its kept me from falling apart

prechorus 2
now here i lay as i wonder about you
would you just tell me what im meant to do
cause ive waited and watered my heart till it grew
you can see how its blossomed for you
see mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
and i dont blame you if you want to
bury me in your memory im not the girl i ought to be but
maybe when you tell your friends you
can tell them what you saw in me and not the way i am

bridge
and i dont mean to make your heart blue
but could we be what were meant to be im just about to beg you please and
then when you tell your friends you can
tell them what you saw in me and not the way i used to be

outro
cause theres nobody better than you24embed"
