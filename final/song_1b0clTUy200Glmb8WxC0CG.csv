verse 1 chillinit
im lost in the safari with writers block
i light the pot still got chrome for the beef lad
fuck with the party youre microsoft
im firefox i mac your books on a beat lad argh
i space bars apart to try shift control alt delete that
on keyboards i blow em like c4
and i tell em i spit raw the whole crowd repeats that argh
catch that shit like a virus smokin a billy ray cyrus
im the osiris you dont wanna touch my style
its hench get clenched like pliers
ill race car drive ya back into 2016
one of my bars worth twenty sixteens
smoke fourtwooh with twentysix teens
fast forward four years thats twentysix gs
hahahaha fuckin bitches
while im puffin swishers with the bud rocks
double visions from the buds im hitting
keep a spliff of litty in my glovebox
everybody say they got the chronic
so we knockaknockin at the drug spots
we just wanna get a couple nuggets
if they blockablocka then we fucked off argh
still i kick goals like goodes
still i got stripes like woods
still i got a twopack rolled all night like suge
and i still get high through hoods
still im on the road like two white stripes
til i got a phone like two white nikes
still sip beers i flipped and switched gears
and i push em on a pedal but i dont ride bikes
dont tell lies bad bitch i like
tell a bad bitch i might
tell a bad bitch yeah i ride for my day ones
and i wake up and i blaze up high
im off chops like vegans do
im what seventy times six equals to
head for the head connect to get checked
then i head for the head like a beanie do
i pop bars rock stars like beatles do
got pot got pans like peter do
i was ready for the war ready for the war
the devils at the door ima leave with you argh
butt heads like beavis do she beef with you
i dont know why im leavin you
cause my girl i cant watch you cry ah
but i swear ill bleed for you bleed for you
switch it up where im from i learnt to keep it hunnid
when i buss it buss it for these upandcomers
you cant see me comin like you stevie wonder
this is oklahoma this is city thunder
brudda brudda brudda did i stutter stutter
this is gutter gutter for you motherfuckers
badabing and boom and i just does it does it woo
now you breddas love it
bit of weed that i get in dozens
press the buttons get me many brothers

verse 2 wombat
yeah
yeah
yeah im a fiend for the mic
bleed for the beats but it keep me alive
demons arise if youre weak in the mind
but you need a disguise i can see through the lies
wont go dull with the dreamers
i wonder why flows so cold i could freeze in the summertime
i said flows so cold i could freeze in the summertime
yeah wombat is a black sheep
couldnt give a fuck if i crash laidback in the back seat
think you lads couldnt match me
not by the gaps in my cracked teeth spaz on a trap beat
what theyre eager to test
they believe theyre a threat but theyre ten steps back
and theyre trapped cause were redbacks weavin a web
theyll regret that they penned tracks leave em a mess
i reside in the south im about the cunts back
drivin around theres an ounce of bud that
surrounds my nutsack hyped when im out
but if sirens asound then im out like fuck that
its evident got a vendetta pens venomous
avatar i can bend elements
were felonious theyre dreadin us
ten seconds and theyre dead
its just theyre jealous cause theyre delicate
gas up my engine travel dimensions
back in a flash like astral projection
smashin a set no lads in contention
theyre no match but they have to contest
you can try though but i dice flows with the mic closed
right flows on a tightrope in a cyclone
got my eyes wide open a psycho
when i hide from the fiveoh gotta lie low
sick of bringin us down well dont count on it
quick im not kiddin around ive grown out of the shit
been surrounded by pricks but im pickin em out
so in a minute im bound to go down with the ship
spinnin around thinkin about spittin it foul
figured out how to be soundin this sick
so the crowds gonna bounce in a fit
give it up give us the crown its no doubt were the kings
what it is what it is man i said it is what it is man
but i cant get a grip like im sinkin in quicksand
startin to think i aint shit but a dickhead
dancin with lucifer im goin all out
now its gettin nuclear we have to fall out
we have to fall out
yeah war like a shaolin talk of the town get around it
surrounded by thoughts you can drown in
fought for the crown never dwarf of the town
never formin about gotta bounce in
but i gotta fight this abyss like ill die in a blink
it was like an epiphany
lightin the spliff man this life is a mystery
gotta thrive til we ride for the victory
and im not social im unapproachable
dont think that ill choke cause im ropable
its no joke dont go get emotional
like why is everything we flow so quotable
most of all when i mention the top
better check when connectin the dots
when i stepped in the spot i shocked all the vets
im like lots of electrical watts let me stress
were the best of the flock
but im sick of these silly cunts shit
im the bitter one spit like a minigun
with a bit of luck like a bitch i be livin lush
got a mini buzz pick it up like a ciggie butt
kick it in the middle of a city that is in a rush
we dont fuss think i give a shit couldnt give a fuck
tick us up gotta get a mix of the sticky bud
so they wanna mimic us but the jig is up6embed"
