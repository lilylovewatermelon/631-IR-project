hold me closer one more time
say that you love me in your last goodbye
please forgive me for my sins
yes i swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
ive seen your face under every sky
over every border and on every line
you know my heart more than i do
we were the greatest me and you

prechorus
but we had time against us and miles between us
the heavens cried i know i left you speechless
but now the sky has cleared and its blue
and i see my future in you

chorus
ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
ill put my hands up
ill do everything different ill be better to you
ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
ill put my hands up
ill be somebody different ill be better to you

verse 2
let me stay here for just one more night
build your walls around me and pull me to the light
so i can tell you that i was wrong
i was a child then but now im willing to learn
