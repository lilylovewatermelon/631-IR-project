i never couldve seen this far
i never couldve seen this coming
seems like my world’s falling apart
yeah
why is everything so hard
i don’t think i can deal with the things you said
it just won’t go away

chorus
in a perfect world
this could never happen
in a perfect world
you’d still be here
and it makes no sense
i could just pick up the pieces
but to you
this means nothing
nothing at all

verse 2
i used to think that i was strong
until the day it all went wrong
i think i need a miracle to make it through
yeah
i wish that i could bring you back
i wish that i could turn back time
cause i can’t let go
i just can’t find my way
yeah
without you i just can’t find my way

you’d still be here
and it makes no sense
i could just pick up the pieces

i don’t know what i should do now
i don’t know where i should go
i’m still here waiting for you
i’m lost when you’re not around
i need to hold on to you
i just can’t let you go
yeah yeah

chorus
in a perfect world
this could never happen
in a perfect world

and it makes no sense
i could just pick up the pieces
but to you
