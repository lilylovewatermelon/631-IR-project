were all falling and
we need a place to hide
a safe place somewhere in the woods
we can start the fire
all we know is what would be
our home
we will stay
till the break of dawn

verse 2
the cold night takes us to a place to escape the chill
tucked up somewhere in the woods on a hill
wake up feeling the cold in between our toes
is there a way back nobody knows

bridge
and we leave it all behind
cant you see we need some time
and we all sit around the fire
we feel a little warmer now
and we all sit around the fire
we feel so much better now

chorus
and we all sit around the fire
we feel a little warmer now
and we all sit around the fire
we feel so much better now

and we all sit around the fire
we feel a little warmer now
and we all sit around the fire
we feel so much better now2embed"
