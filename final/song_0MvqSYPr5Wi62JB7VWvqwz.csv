yeah haha
my name buzzin aint no way you could ignore it
i did not come this far so they could ignore me
i am not the one to say ill do it in the mornin
id rather get it done dont focus on whats not important
they try to talk to me like they been nothin but supportive
appreciate the love but do not show up on my doorstep
if you aint about that real i suggest that you avoid me
if we aint on the same page thats the end of story agh
you are not a baller cause your closets full of jordans
you are not a rich man cause youre on the forbes list
first i drop the record then you know i gotta tour it
reals still the slogan only difference is theres more of us
the story of my life feels like its just beginnin now
i ask you a question i want answers not the runaround
you the one that brought it up but im the one to shut it down
if you aint got the album yet i brought you one im at your house
hey

if im bein honest last year i was in a bad place
wouldnt say im out of it but dont feel like i cant be agh
who you know droppin clean records but they nasty
i was made for this i could tell when mama had me
i hopped right off the table told my doctor i aint average
he asked me what does that mean
i told him get the pen and pad please
whod a known id write something that could change lives
i dont think yall fully understand the way you changed mine
i look at the future thats in front of me with both eyes
three records three years i dont like to waste time
