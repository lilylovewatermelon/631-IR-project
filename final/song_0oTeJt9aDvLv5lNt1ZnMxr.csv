verse 2
kick it on back kick it on back
kick it on back to what you know
give me some love give me some love
sugar on the hard rock radio
where they play tunes where they play tunes
where they play riffs with the hard rock beat
give me some love give me some love
sugar from the drop with the old school meet

chorus
