verse 1
the garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
we headed west for to find ourselves some truth ooh
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
we counted all our reasons excuses that we made
we found ourselves some treasure and threw it all away oh
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
what you waiting for

chorus
when i dance alone and the suns bleeding down
blame it on me
when i lose control and the veils overused
blame it on me
what you waiting for
what you waiting for

verse 2
caught in the tide of blossom caught in the carnival
your confidence forgotten i see the gypsies run
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
you might also likechorus
when i dance alone and the suns bleeding down
blame it on me
when i lose control and the veils overused
blame it on me
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
what you waiting for
what you waiting for

bridge
when i dance alone and the suns bleeding down
blame it on me
when i lose control and the veils overused
blame it on me
when i dance alone i know ill go
blame it on me ooh
when ill lose control i know ill go
blame it on me ooh
