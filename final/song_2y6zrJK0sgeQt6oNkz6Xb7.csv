he said son have you seen the world
well what would you say if i said that you could
just carry this gun youll even get paid
i said that sounds pretty good
black leather boots spitshined so bright
they cut off my hair but it looks alright
we marched and we sang we all became friends
as we learned how to fight

chorus 1
a hero of war
yeah thats what ill be
and when i come home
theyll be damn proud of me
ill carry this flag
to the grave if i must
cause its a flag that i love
and a flag that i trust

verse 2
i kicked in the door i yelled my commands
the children they cried but i got my man
we took him away a bag over his face
from his family and his friends
they took off his clothes they pissed in his hands
i told them to stop but then i joined in
we beat him with guns and batons not just once
but again and again

verse 3
she walked through bullets and haze
i asked her to stop i begged her to stay
but she pressed on so i lifted my gun
and i fired away
and the shells jumped through the smoke
and into the sand that the blood now had soaked
she collapsed with a flag in her hand
a flag white as snow

chorus 2
a hero of war
is that what they see
just medals and scars
so damn proud of me
and i brought home that flag
now it gathers dust
but its a flag that i love
its the only flag i trust
