i still remember miss bessie singing
black wrinkled fingers on ivory keys
just five years old my church shoes adangling
yeah shes long gone and im still chasing this song

chorus
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart but i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music

verse 2
no hope and squarely solitary
enough whiskey and coke boys to get me in a bind
amps juiced the whole damn block could hear me
even that cop car rolling past
by the time they hit the front door
i was out the back

chorus
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons is one  hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart and i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
white calloused fingers on bronze and nylon
these same old boots are still tapping time
not quite the buzz i used to tie on
but til im gone ill be chasing this song

chorus
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart and i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music
yeah im married to a dream with a mistress named music2embed"
