speak to me to me
youre walking closer and its hard to breathe to breathe
i should be running but the hearts naive
and i expect too much too much too much too much
you were good to me to me
i left a scar that no one else can see can see
and now youre back here
and reminding me that i lost way too much
too much too much too much

prechorus
and you know that night i almost said i loved you
loved you loved you loved you
and you almost said it back

chorus
are we gonna be more than a memory
no matter how lame my apology
i let go of you you let go of me
are we gonna be more than a memory
are you gonna just stand in front of me
pretending im not your destiny
im not over you are you over me
are we gonna be more than a memory

verse 2
say my name my name
cause no one else can say it quite the same the same
it takes me back to your september days
ive missed you way too much too much too much too much
if i was cruel to you
well just to hear it breaks my heart in two in two
if theres a way to make it up to you
i wanna change so much you know i do

prechorus
and know that night i almost said i loved you
loved you loved you loved you
and you almost said it back
