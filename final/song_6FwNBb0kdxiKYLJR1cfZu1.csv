she had a fire in her eyes a wildflower in her hair
like she been waiting outside all day for me to get there
she had on that yellow dress a jean jacket over her shoulder
and she spun around for me and the rest is history

chorus
she turned up the radio as soon as she climbed in
said i dont care where we go as long as were flyin
she looked over at me like shed never stop smiling
said whatever you do babe just dont stop drivin tonight

verse 2
she started paintin her toes right around tupelo
she asked are we gettin close
i said to where she said i dont know
she made me pull over for a kiss at sundown
she wanted our picture by the sign saying elvis hometown

chorus
she turned up the radio as soon as she climbed in
said i dont care where we go as long as were flyin
she looked over at me like shed never stop smiling
said whatever you do babe just dont stop drivin tonight
just dont stop drivin tonight
see thomas rhett liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likebridge
we drove straight through the night just like we stole that car
i wouldve gone a million miles cause she stole my heart man

chorus
well she turned up the radio as soon as she climbed in
said i dont care where we go as long as were flyin
she looked over at me like shed never stop smiling
said whatever you do babe just dont stop drivin tonight
said whatever you do baby just dont stop drivin tonight
just dont stop drivin tonight

outro
she wanted to run away with me and that was alright
and i just wanted to see the world through her eyesembed"
