no one really knows
whose house youre haunting
places that you go
are a mystery to me

every time you leave here
ill keep them quiet
i guess thats all you want from me

prechorus
cause if its all spinning round the ball
and if it your worlds feeling crowded and small
maybe you can be the big star in tonights show

chorus
but i shouldve took the high road
now its such a long way back
instead i took the low road
figured out its something you cant take back

shouldve took the high road
now my days have all turned black
instead i took the low road
figured out its something that we both lack

no one really knows
just what youre wanting
running round the bend
these things arent for free

thinking back at home
were waiting on you
weve got our own places to be

prechorus
but if its all spinning round the ball
and if it your worlds feeling crowded and small
maybe you can be the big star in tonights show

and if its too late to pick up the call
and if youre torn up and sick of it all
maybe you can only see far in the nights glow

chorus
but i shouldve took the high road
now its such a long way back
instead i took the low road
figured out its something you cant take back

shouldve took the high road
now my days have all turned black
instead i took the low road
figured out its something that we both lack1embed"
