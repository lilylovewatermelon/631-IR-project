yeah theres something bout a woman
thats a clear blue sky

shes like a fire on the mountain
like some kind of heaven thats pouring down on me
shes a child
shes a lady
shes got everything that i could ever need
yeah theres something bout a woman and me

yeah theres something bout a woman when she gets fixed up
slips a red dress on and her eyes light up
i love to watch her walking from across the room

and the way she moves me
she moves me
