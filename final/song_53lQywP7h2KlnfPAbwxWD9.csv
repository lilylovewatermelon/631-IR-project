make a wish when your childhood dies

hold your breath when a blackbird flies
count to seventeen and close your eyes
ill keep you safe inside

move your body when the sunlight dies
everybody hide your body from the scarecrow
everybody hide
move your body when the sunlight dies
everybody hide your body from the scarecrow

watch it grow where the tear stain dries
