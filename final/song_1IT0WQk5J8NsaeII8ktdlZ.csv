dare me to jump off of this jersey bridge
i bet you never had a friday night like this
keep it up keep it up lets raise our hands
i take a look up at the sky and i see red
red for the cancer red for the wealthy
red for the drink thats mixed with suicide
everything red
prechorus kellin quinn
please wont you push me for the last time
lets scream until theres nothing left
so sick of playing i dont want this anymore
the thought of yous no fuckin fun
you want a martyr ill be one
because enoughs enough were done

chorus vic fuentes
you told me think about it well i did
now i dont wanna feel a thing anymore
im tired of beggin for the things that i want
im over sleepin like a dog on the floor

the thing i think i love will surely bring me pain
intoxication paranoia and a lot of fame
three cheers for throwing up pubescent drama queen
you make me sick i make it worse by drinkin late

prechorus kellin quinn
scream scream scream scream
scream scream until theres nothing left
so sick of playing i dont want to anymore
the thought of yous no fuckin fun
you want a martyr ill be one
because enoughs enough were done

chorus vic fuentes  kellin quinn
you told me think about it well i did well i did
now i dont wanna feel a thing anymore
im tired of beggin for the things that i want
im over sleepin like a dog on the floor
imagine livin like a king someday
a single night without a ghost in the wallsand if the bass shakes the earth underground
well start a new revolution now
now

postchorus kellin quinn
alright here we go
bridge vic fuentes
hail mary forgive me
blood for blood hearts beating
come at me now this is war
fuck with this new beat oh

breakdown vic fuentes  kellin quinn
now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
i was just a product of the street youth rage
born in this world without a voice or say
caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
i know you well but this aint a game
blow the smoke in diamond shape
dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace

chorus vic fuentes  kellin quinn
you told me think about it well i did
now i dont wanna feel a thing anymore
im tired of beggin for the things that i want
im over sleepin like a dog on the floor
imagine livin like a king someday
a single night without a ghost in the walls
we are the shadows screamin take us now
wed rather die than live to rust on the ground
