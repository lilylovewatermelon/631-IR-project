well i get a thrill from down my spine
when i see you hittin me up
feelin so electrified
like the heat of a million suns
you know just one touch can keep me high
and i think ill never come down
til a couple days go by
and youre nowhere to be found

chorus
up all night
up all night
all the things that you said to me yesterday
playin over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reelin me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

verse 2
so i tried to shake you out my head
tried to dance with somebody new
plus you got those lips so red
and that smokey voice you do
so i know its pointless anyway
cause there aint nobody else
that could light me up so bright
and break this crazy spell

up all night
all the things that you said to me yesterday
playin over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reelin me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry

bridge
if i wait a little longer
then maybe youll come back around
wait a little longer
then maybe youll be ready now
cause i would wait forever
for you to fall back into my arms
so come on

chorus
up all night
up all night
all the things that you said to me yesterday
playin over in my mind
its a crime
its a crime
how youre reelin me in with the games you play
then you hang me out to dry
up all night

all the things that you said to me yesterday
playin over in my mind
