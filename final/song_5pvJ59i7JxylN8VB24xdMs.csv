if i had to i would put myself right beside you
so let me ask would you like that
would you like that
and i dont mind if you say this love is the last time
so now ill ask do you like that
do you like that
no

chorus
somethings getting in the way
somethings just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane
so tell me how it should be

verse 2
try to find out what makes you tick as i lie down
sore and sick
do you like that
do you like that
theres a fine line between love and hate
and i dont mind just let me say that i like that
i like that

chorus
somethings getting in the way
somеthings just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of janе
as i burn another page
as i look the other way
i still try to find my place in the diary of jane
so tell me how it should be
see breaking benjamin liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likebridge
desperate i will crawl
waiting for so long
no love there is no love
die for anyone
what have i become

chorus
somethings getting in the way
somethings just about to break
i will try to find my place in the diary of jane
as i burn another page
as i look the other way
i still try to find my place in the diary of janeembed"
