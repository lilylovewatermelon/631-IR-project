fall right down to the bottom
boy with a motto
stay but i oughta leave and trust me my heart bleeds
i feel everything i
drip drop drink out of the bottle
boy with a heart of gold get run over by heaven knows what
weary soldier i get older life gets colder

chorus
sometimes i get a little bit scared at night
i get a little preoccupied
the sirens in my mind the sirens in my mind
i just wanna be good again
i wanna make it to the end
the sirens in my mind the sirens in my mind

verse 2
autumn stuck in thе grotto
been tryin for the lottery but nevеr win
my heart bleeds i feel everything i
drop drop way down to the bottom
boy with a heart of gold get run over by heaven knows what
weary soldier i get older life gets colder

chorus
sometimes i get a little bit scared at night
i get a little preoccupied
the sirens in my mind the sirens in my mind
i just wanna be good again
i wanna make it to the end
the sirens in my mind the sirens in my mind
