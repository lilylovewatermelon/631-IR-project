im back

verse 1
so lets rewind back to the time
2005 i almost died
i overdosed i did not know
that id provoke this evil ghost

prechorus
disaster

chorus
magically i turn tragedy
into melodies over catchy beats
it comes so naturally so smooth and casually
thats why they call me king of the music scene

verse 2
i dug a hole ten miles wide
so i can throw all of you inside
youre such a dumb fuck you need to shut up
you bring a picture of me every time you get your hair cut

prechorus
impostor

magically i turn tragedy
into melodies over catchy beats
it comes so naturally so smooth and casually
thats why they call me king of the music scene

bridge
oh bruised and broken
my eyes are open
i wont lose focus
my eyes are open
can you see in the distance
can you see the resistance
we will march rise against them
from the start rise against them

chorus
magically i turn tragedy
into melodies over catchy beats
it comes so naturally so smooth and casually
thats why they call me king of the music scene
