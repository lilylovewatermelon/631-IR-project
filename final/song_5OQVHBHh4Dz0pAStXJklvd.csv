a saturday downpour carved out rivers in the sand
she said it was her first time to see the sea
helping to clime the jetty rocks
was the first time i touched her hand
and the rain and the way it felt never let up all week
by thursday i knew everything about her
and god the last day i didnt want to leave without her

chorus
the sidewalks and streets
were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should have seen her face
shining like that light house
through all the rain and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand times

verse 2
time was like the tide it came and went
that old pier ran clear out into the mist
and my mind plays that tuesday night again and again and again
i taste that old saltwater taffy on her lips
and wednesday morning snuck in through the window
and we just laid there and listened to the waves come and go
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
the sidewalks and streets
were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should have seen her face
shining like that light house
through all the rain and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand times

bridge
moments with her now there all a blur
except for every second
every word every drop of rain
every single grain of sand

chorus
the sidewalks and streets
were soaked and the sky was gray
but you should have seen her face
shining like that light house
through all the pouring rain and the way she called my name
ive lived those seven days a thousand times
those seven days a thousand timesembed"
