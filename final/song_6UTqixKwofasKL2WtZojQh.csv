verse 2 2pac
i met you and i stuttered in passion
though slightly blinded by that ass
it was hard to keep my dick in my pants every time you pass
got me checkin for you hardcore starin and watchin
me and you one on one picture countless options
was if prophecy clear as day visions on top of me
erotic psychotic when possess by bodies
far from a crush i wanna bust your guts
and touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
you got me sweatin like a fat girl goin for mine
just a skinny nigga fuckin like she stole my mind
back in time i recall how she used to be
i guess money and fame made you used to me
whats up in 96 find tricks in drag
fuck dre tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
back to you my prettyass caramel queen
got my hands on your thighs now let me inbetween as friends

verse 3 2pac
can you imagine me in player mode rush the tricks
i got her ready for a booty call i fucked your bitch
was it me or the fame my dick or the game
bet i screamed westside when i came westside
scream my name ‘cause baby its delicious
got a weak spot for pretty bitches
up and down similar to switches

make it fluid fluid in and out all around when a nigga do it
you got me high let me cum inside
i love it when you get on top baby let me ride
who wanna stop me am i top notch

rather see a nigga up in prison why you change
