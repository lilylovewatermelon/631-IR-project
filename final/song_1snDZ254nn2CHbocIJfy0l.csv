with a little luck this ol truck will get me home today

weatherman says wet weekend well he just might be right
but rain or shine youll be mine tonight

in a world where most things come and go
ill always have you to hold
and thats all i need to know

heaven knows i aint even close to bein gods gift to women
but in your arms i feel like i am
i dont know it all i sure cant solve the problems of the human race
but i know how to bring a smile to your face

in a world where most things come and go
ill always have you to hold
and thats all i need to know
