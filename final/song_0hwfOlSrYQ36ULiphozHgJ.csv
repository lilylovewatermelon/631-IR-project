ohh ohh
ohh ohoh
ahh

verse 1
i cant believe what you said to me
last night we were alone
you threw your hands up
baby you gave up you gave up
i cant believe how you looked at me
with your james dean glossy eyes
in your tight jeans with your long hair
and your cigarette stained lies

prechorus 1
could we fix you if you broke
and is your punch line just a joke

chorus
ill never talk again
oh boy youve left me speechless
youve left me speechless so speechless
and ill never love again
oh boy youve left me speechless
youve left me speechless so speechless
you might also likeverse 2
i cant believe how you slurred at me
with your half wired broken jaw
you popped my heart seams
on my bubble dreams bubble dreams
i cant believe how you looked at me
with your johnnie walker eyes
hes gonna get you and after hes through
theres gonna be no love left to rye

prechorus 2
and i know that its so complicated
but im a loser in love so baby
raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts
of all my wrecked up friends

chorus
ill never talk again
oh boy youve left me speechless
youve left me speechless so speechless
ill never love again
oh friend youve left me speechless
youve left me speechless so speechless

refrain
ohh ohh
ohh ohoh
ahh
bridge
and after all the drinks and bars that weve been to
would you give it all up could i give it all up for you
and after all the boys and the girls that weve been through
would you give it all up
could you give it all up if i promise boy to you
that ill never talk again
and ill never love again
ill never write a song
wont even sing along
ill never love again ahh

chorus 2
