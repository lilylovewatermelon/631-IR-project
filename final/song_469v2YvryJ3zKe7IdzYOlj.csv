verse 1
maybe its the pressure of knowing that im watching you perform
or maybe youre not used to someone who knows exactly what you want
i know the fires burning but baby theres no need to be alarmed
and you can be the rain thats falling girl and ill be the thunderstorm
you got no need to be nervous
because you are safe in my hands
im sure youll be needing my service
baby your wish will be my command

prechorus
cause ima touch you with my mind kiss you with my body
if you give me time i know you wont be sorry
this aint bump n grind ill show you what love is
if you let me lay you down

chorus
i promise you aint going nowhere nowhere nowhere
you aint going nowhere nowhere nowhere
you aint going nowhere
girl not until you let me lay you down in here
