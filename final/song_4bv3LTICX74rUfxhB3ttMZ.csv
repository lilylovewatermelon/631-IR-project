five years old skippin rocks across that cypress creek
mama said dont you forget you got church shoes on your feet
daddy smoked them salems up and wore them sideburns down
my world was on a big as that little blink and you miss it town

chorus
but we ride ride ride ride ride that river of time
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time
driftin on to where were goin
hangin on to whats left behind
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time

verse 2
muscle car and a letter jacket crusin the main street drag
cool as a can of copenhagen and a six pack in a bag
we were all about them college girls when they came home on break
thought those days would last forever and growin up would wait

chorus
but we ride ride ride ride ride that river of time
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time
driftin on to where were goin
hangin on to whats left behind
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time

now daddys in his easy chair mamas hairs turned grey
she laughs and says its all because of my young and wilder days
i found a girl that makes me smile ill never let her go
growin old dont scare me none i believe in streets of gold

chorus
but we ride ride ride ride ride that river of time
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time
driftin on to where were goin
hangin on to whats left behind
yeah we ride ride ride that river of time
yeah we ride ride ride ride ride that river of time
well we ride that river of timeembed"
