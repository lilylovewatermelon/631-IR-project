two two three four

verse 1
trouble falls in my home
troubled man troubled stone
turn a mountain of lies
turn a card for my life
man of steel man of heart
tame our ways if we start
to devise something more
something halfways

chorus 1
only a steel man came to recover
if he had run from gold carry over
we celebrate our sense of each other
we have a lot to give one another

verse 2
i took a bus to the lake
saw the monument face
yellow tides golden eyes
red and white red and wise
you might also likeraise the flag summer home
parted hair and part unknown
if i knew what i read
iâ€™ll send it halfways

chorus 2
only a real man can be a lover
if he had hands to lend us all over
we celebrate our sense on each other
we have a lot to give one another

verse 3
took my bags illinois
dreamt the lake took my boy
man of steel man of heart
turn your ear to my part

there are things you have said
raise the boat and raise the dead
if you take us away
still we can say

chorus 3
only a steel man can be a lover
if he had hands to tremble all over
we celebrate our sense of each other
we have a lot to give one another
only a steel man can be a lover
if he had hands to tremble all over
we celebrate our sense of each other
we have a lot to give one another3embed"
