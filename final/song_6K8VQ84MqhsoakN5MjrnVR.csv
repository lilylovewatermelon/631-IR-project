in my head
i play a supercut of us
all the magic we gave off
all the love we had and lost
and in my head
the visions never stop
these ribbons wrap me up
but when i reach for you
theres just a supercut

prechorus
in your car the radio up
in your car the radio up
we keep trying to talk about us
im someone you maybe might love
ill be your quiet afternoon crush
be your violent overnight rush
make you crazy over my touch

chorus
but its just a supercut of us
supercut of us
oh its just a supercut of us
supercut of us
you might also likeverse 2
so i fall
into continents and cars
all the stages and the stars
i turn all of it
to just a supercut

refrain
cause in my head in my head i do everything right
when you call when you call ill forgive and not fight
because ours are the moments i play in the dark
we were wild and fluorescent come home to my heart uh

prechorus
in your car the radio up
