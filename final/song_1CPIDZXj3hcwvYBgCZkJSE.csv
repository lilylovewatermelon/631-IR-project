puttin in that overtime and comin up with nothin
sure as hell aint for lack of tryin
there’s no use wastin time in fightin for somethin
when you see that white flag a flyin
can you hear that whistle blow

chorus
theres allday thinkin time
and all night drinkin time
and time to sing or time to find if
rhyme has a reason
time to pack it in and stay down
pack it up and walk away now
and give it one more day or call it a season
i can tell by the tears not in your eyes
it’s quittin time

verse 2
theres somethin to be said for sayin what needs sayin
a suitcase says it all to me
before the credits roll just know i always lovеd you
so we wrote that famous final scenе
where you turn and walk out on me

chorus
theres allday thinkin time
and all night drinkin time
and time to sing or time to find if
rhyme has a reason
time to pack it in and stay down
pack it up and walk away now
and give it one more day or call it a season
i can tell by the tears not in your eyes
it’s quittin time
its quittin time

every start has an end
every first has a last
every now has a then
every future has a past
and sometimes you want it back

chorus
theres allday thinkin time
and all night drinkin time
and time to sing or time to find if
rhyme has a reason
time to pack it in and stay down
pack it up and walk away now
and give it one more day or call it a season
i can tell by the tears not in your eyes
it’s quittin time
its quittin time1embed"
