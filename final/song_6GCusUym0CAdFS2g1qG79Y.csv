verse 1
pathetic benign accept it undermine
your opinion my justification
happy safe servant caged
malice utter weakness
no toleration invade
committed enraged admit it
dont condescend dont even disagree
desire decay disappoint delay
you suffered then now suffer unto me

prechorus
obsession take another look
remember every chance you took
decide either live with me
or give up any thought you had of being free

chorus
dont go i never wanted anybody more
than i wanted you
i know the only thing i ever really loved
was hate
