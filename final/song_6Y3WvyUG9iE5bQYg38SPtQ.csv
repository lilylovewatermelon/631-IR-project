chemistry was crazy from the getgo
neither one of us knew why
we didnt build nothing overnight
cuz a love like this takes some time

people swore it off as a phase

they see that we did that yes

its so true that yes
weve been through it yes
we got real shit yes
see baby we been

too strong for too long and i cant be without you baby
and ill be waiting up until you get home cuz i cant sleep without you baby
anybody whos ever loved ya know just what i feel
too hard to fake it nothing can replace it
call the radio if you just cant be without your baby
you might also likei got a question for ya
see i already know the answer
but still i wanna ask you
would you lie no

make me cry no
do somethin behind my back and then try to cover it up
well neither would i baby

ill be faithful yes

and with us youll always know the deal
weve been

too strong for too long and i cant be without you baby
and ill be waiting up until you get home cuz i cant sleep without you baby
anybody whos ever loved ya know just what i feel
too hard to fake it nothing can replace it
call the radio if you just cant be without your baby

see this is real talk
im always stay no matter what
good or bad thick and thin
right or wrong all day every day
now if youre down on love or dont believe
