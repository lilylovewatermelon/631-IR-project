section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up
whats happenin chi chi

verse 1
i told her to fly and she scared of the virus i sent her a private to get here
i made four hundred dollars off of each of these pounds i aint trippin its gon be a good year
solomon drivin while i got my hands on the chopper im keepin my eyes in the rearview
im from atlanta where they pay to triple cross niggas theyll dap you up then theyll kill you
these niggas fake and im real i dont feel em
my niggas takers aint worried bout em stealing
i run with apes and some baby gorillas
i know a few shh i can buy me a nigga
said i wouldnt change but my change a lil bigger
fourcarat ring leave a scar if i hit you
look like a spaceship got stars in my vehicle
these niggas fake and i dont wanna deal with em all

chorus
im social distancing
man these niggas cant touch me i cant get sick
good excuse for me to pour up medicine syrup
she say i aint got no heart and im devilsent
im on some savage shit ah
i got the drop on the opps switched the cars
i got a hundred inside of a drum
we pull up clapping a round of applause
we just gon say that they won the award

slide in the daytime then come back at night
we gon make sure that nobody play with us
they make me mad ima turn up
lets talk about money i swear i been savin up
im really sick with this shit got em throwin up
he hit a lick for a brick now he goin up
my niggas rapping you see us we blowin up
hit the bitch for a rack then ignore her
im so sick of these rats and these whores
i might marry my girl and just go away
eat her out if she rich got expensive taste
we aint got rush told the pilot to fuckin wait
aint no way i can go on no fuckin date
i dont know her and she dont know me
my lil boy dem turnt up at a young age
you can say that it run in my genes

chorus
im social distancing
man these niggas cant touch me i cant get sick
good excuse for me to pour up medicine syrup
she say i aint got no heart and im devilsent
