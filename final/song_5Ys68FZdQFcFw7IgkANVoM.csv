this is where i broke my wrist where i thought i could fly
thinking i was superman so you know you cant cry
because i wanted to be just like them and save my city from crime
i wanted to be just like them just like them just like them

remember watching mtv when there was still music for you
just a kid on cholla street from my city built in the sand
my father said youll be a man be a man be a man

chorus
i was born in 1994
i was born in 1994
and i was i was born in 1994

verse 2

now tell me what you wanna be because you grow up too fast
ill cut my hair and sag my jeans and never show up to class
get ready cause its time to leave so pack up your bags
and go be who you wanna be wanna be wanna be

chorus
i was born in 1994
i was born in 1994
and i was i was born in 1994
