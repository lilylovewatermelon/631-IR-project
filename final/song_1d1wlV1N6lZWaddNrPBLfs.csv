song 1 bones  shavemyheadchangemyname

verse
shave my head change my name and run away
anything that will take the attention away from me now whats that say
i dont give a fuck bout the fame
thats the last thing i wanted to gain
been a minute since we spoke still im turning to a ghost
i can feel it everyday
see the ash flow down like snow
in the ditch by the old backroad
i never had money to throw
never see me in the club with hoes
see the outside world is a backdrop
that youll never see bones in front of
rot let me rot let me rot away
cut the blinds kill the lights let me fade away
as i lie up on my back atop the comforter i say
things will never be the same
really

song 2 bones  whydontyoujustgivemethebag

intro
why dont you just give me the bag
give you the bag
sir would you mind telling me whats going on here
chrissy ill handle this
fellas you seem to want this bag pretty bad

verse
pink lemonade shoes roll raspberry blunts
while you out here getting stressed bet im home getting bucks
side up when we buck sesh never gave a fuck
holding out both hands but youll never get a buck
when your album gon flop they gon say its dumb luck
aint nobody wanna own up to the fact that shit suck
begone lil men begone lil boys
aint no place for wannabes this the level with the noise
sidewalk talk its the avenue thought
no crease in my jeans no wallet no watch
place in the trees breeze blowing to the east
inhale what i got then i disappear with ease
my legs get weak when the backwoods cheap
two hearts in my eyes smile cheek to fucking cheek
hook
fruits on the trees bag of flax seed
juice on the ground spitting pits in the weeds
fruits on the trees bag of flax seed
juice on the ground spitting pits in the weeds

outro
wait
what
wait
