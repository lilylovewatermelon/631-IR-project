wish i would have noticed sooner
all that crazy in your eyes
do you practice in the mirror
on that tempting crooked smile
like that serpent in the garden
you came crawling back to me
twice i ate that poisoned apple
made me sick of being evil

chorus
ill admit that i was wrong
you said i miss you
oh yes i do oh yes i do
honey i miss you being gone

verse 2
i saw that floozy youve been wooing
on your exbest buddyâ€™s arm
and i knew youd soon be sneaking back turning on the charm
yeah well cupid aint a boozer
in a tavern throwing darts
do you think i walk around
with a bullseye on my heart

chorus
well ill admit that i was wrong
you said i miss you
oh yes i do oh yes i do
sugar i miss you being gone
you might also likebridge
i miss you like
drama queens and cat fights and braces on prom night
i miss you like
boy bands and cheap cologne
our song as chaperones and all the other things that ive outgrown

verse 3
well you know youve got the mojo
but it aint working me no more
and i swear i wont be checking you out when you walk out my door

chorus
well ill admit that i was wrong
you said i miss you oh yes i do
and boy you got issues
honey i miss you being gone

outro
being gone
being gone
thank god youre goneembed"
