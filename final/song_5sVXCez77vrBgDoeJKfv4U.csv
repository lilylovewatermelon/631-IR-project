pretty please
where do i begin
oh i dont understand it either
and i dont think i can
fuzzybrain call it what you want
ive felt so distant lately as if i were not

chorus 1
theres rain outside steady winter
my heart feels like such a mixture
shapeless i stare at her picture
i dont know her but i miss her
why oh why such things

verse 2
write it down absent of the pen
the sun has been set for hours and shes rising again
scattered mind i call it a friend
i wish i thought a bit less and spoke up instead
in my head

chorus 2
theres rain inside my skeleton frame
a hurricane within my rib cage
i never left but i never stayed
im cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
time and time again
you might also likei never left but i never stayed
im cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
time and time again
oh its time and time again9embed"
