you say you wont begin again
capitulate and let me in
cause i am a fire and you are dry as bone
you are taking your time
you are killing me slow
and i know we instigate
go back and forth
lacerate
cause you can remember only when youre alone
i am granting you more than the debt that i owe

chorus
cause i look for scarlet and you look for ultraviolet
and we are exhausted by all this pretending
we just cant resist the violence
and you need a melody i only need the silence
but each time we battle
the blood and the fury takes us a little higher

verse 2
with all that you believe
you still refuse to shelter me
cause i am a danger and youre a long way from home
you are one among many but youre now on your own
and i hate the way you look at me when i am not understood
cause you can remember only when youre alone
i am granting you more than the debt that i owe

you wont begin again
you wont begin again
you wont begin again
you wont begin again

chorus
cause i look for scarlet and you look for ultraviolet
and we are exhausted by all this pretending
we just cant resist the violence
and you need a melody i only need the silence
but each time we battle
the blood and the fury takes us a little higher
