gone i couldnt murder your promise
right before my eyes
the revolutions of my psychosis
kept me outta the way

refrain
once inside all i hold is ash

verse 2
fall suppressing every feeling
im in so much pain
i have every fuckin right to hate you
i cant take it

prechorus
the hardest part was knowing
that i could never be you
now all i do is sit around
and wish i could forget you

chorus
my demise i took a life worth living
and made it worth a mockery
i deny i fold but they keep on coming
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me

who are you to me who am i to you
is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence
by default you are my only link to the outside
psychosomatic suicide
where were you when i was down
can you show me a way
to face every day with this face
goodbye

chorus
my demise i took a life worth living
and made it worth a mockery
i deny i fold but they keep on coming
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me

bridge
oh when i blur my eyes they make the whole world breathe
i see you fucking me
and i am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate
the one and only answer so much for memories
i wanna dress in your insecurities
and be the perfect you im through
im outstretched out for all to loathe
here we go the ultimate irony
yeah yeah yeah
chorus
my demise i took a life worth living
and made it worth a mockery
i deny i fold but they keep on coming
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me
stop im always ready to die
but youre killing me

outro
stop killing me
stop killing me
stop killing stop me
