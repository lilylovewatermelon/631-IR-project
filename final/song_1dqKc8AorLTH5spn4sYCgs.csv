lost it on the chesterfield
or maybe on a gambling wheel
lost it in a diamond mine
its dark as hell and hard to find
you can climb to the top of the highest tree
you can look around but you still wont see
what im looking for

chorus
where the good times gone
where the good times gone
all the stupid fun
and all that shit weve done
where the good times gone
well i still dont know

verse 2
out in the back in the old corn field
underneath the tractor wheel
thought id dig till id found it first
broke my back and died of thirst
you can bribe the devil you can pray to god
you can sell off everything you got
and you still wont know
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likechorus
where the good times gone
where the good times gone
all the stupid fun
and all that shit weve done
where the good times gone
well i still dont know

verse 3
saw it on the silver screen
preacher says dont know what it means
last page ad in a comic book
bought me a map showed me where to look
it aint carved of stone or made of wood
and if you paid for it then it aint no good
and you still wont know
what im looking for

chorus
oh where the good times gone
where the good times gone
all the stupid fun
and all that shit weve done
where the good times gone
oh yeah1embed"
