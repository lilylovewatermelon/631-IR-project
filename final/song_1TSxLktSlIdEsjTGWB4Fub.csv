i heard the news today that youre not mine to keep
dont struggle too much now while i kill you in your sleep
what is lust if its not being by yourself
i wont be gentle to the body on the shelf

chorus zyra
its only water its only fire its only love
its only slaughter were only liars its only blood
theyre only thoughts that im having thoughts safe within my head
youre only crying youre only dying youre only red

verse 2 zyra
i heard the news today that you werent mine to save
i hope that youre comfortable in the quiet lasting grave 
what is lust if its not being by yourself
i wont be gentle to the body on the shelf

its only slaughter were only liars its only blood
theyre only thoughts that im having thoughts safe within my head
youre only crying youre only dying youre only dead
