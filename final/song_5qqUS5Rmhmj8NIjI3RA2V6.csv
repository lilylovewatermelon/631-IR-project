he don’t know what to do
he just wants to look good for you
so he rushes in to tell you what he did today
but he can’t think of what to say
i think you listen anyway

he wants to have a good time just like everbody
he doesn’t want to fall apart

you watch him as he stutters over what to say
its just a little game you play
its no easier for you some days
you wish that you could tell him it’ll be okay
but you feel a little shy these days
cause everybody goes away

you just want to have a good time
just like everybody else
you don’t want to fall apart

i can look into your eyes and see the mess we’re in
well darling if its shit came out
then i suppose that its shit went in
even though i couldn’t say i been the places that you’ve been
you know he made my heart real strong
even if he made my head real thin
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likei want to have a good time
just like everybody else
i don’t want to fall apart this time
so would you please invite me in

so would you please invite me in
