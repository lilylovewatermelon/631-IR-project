tell me what the fuck you gonna tell a vet a boss
… yet you lost
you underestimated weak expectations
we superceeded all of that fat all in the map
with that ooh like we brand new
we schoolin freak it the whole game
feelin like a fool for speakin
but we aint tryna win any awards make fake friends
exploding below the streets earthquake
in this … shed networking and digging tunnels
invading the industry hijacking the channels
the hatchet and hard truth part proof that lives
among the mass contention the system gives
if you attackin back with axes gats and hatchets
bust n doing backflips by any means tactics
get it their head all in the way split it
always leave one alive so they can tell em you did it
and then we

hook
we break bread make bread take bread
they said that we couldnt do it
but we still here surviving the game
we ride and we grind survivin they try to
keep our voice quiet but we still here survivin the game
from killa county to the motor city rollin
we holdin em steady underground heaters
and we still here survivin the game
it aint nothing but a thing to us
it aint nothing but a thing to bust
we crush em
see insane clown posse liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likeverse 2 shaggy 2 dope
it aint nothing but a thing to spit fire
the real shit dont expire we at a high wire
pullin tricks n stunts we done only hit once
electrocute the industry every six months
we get on this bitch but we dont want it
keep the lotus low love dont flaunt it
another juggalo hit bitch im on it
and if i ever won a grammy id pawn it
you wanna know about this
well i doubt this you wanna diss
cause what you love aint about shit
we not only survive but thrive and blast
and never stop like “ah at last”
puttin in work selfmade experts
show this played out scene how the next works
ambition thats what got these hos dissin
thowin weak ass blows and all week missin

verse 3 paris
dough gotta cut let me introduce
to the juggalo nation aint no substitute
for the original hard truth soldier its on
i get the strap of the wreck and get yo motherfuckin back blown
the revolutionary pro hitter
spittin hard truth bricks over street slaps we get wit ya
with 4 million sold …
it aint a thing for me to post and reach across the motherfuckin nile
motor city get yo grib tight
n recognise the arcitect that sparked the light
crack the code show the whole world the power of truth
now motherfucker can you buy that too i guess ruthless
i see the bitch in them hos they get nervous
cause im nwa but with a purpose
in these days and times all fake raps and media traps keep it underground
guerilla attack

verse 4 paris
its like a blast fast massacre mass than blast faster
n slash your whole status youre staff cause yall have had it
i crash through with macmooze attack fools with the black tool
with the hard truth for the grass roots and greet yall with that whoop whoop
its mcin im seein em eatin them notice
its no supposing just quotable quotes i wrote em
fuck around in the arena im meaner supreme n leaner
i seen em slippin i rip em im set trippin n blitz in your system
juggalos know the best they recognise my essay
comin deep as essays im sa
the moral of the storys like maury i am the father
split your wig back bullshit raps dont even bother
take your motherfuckers back to battlin
im battlin known to make em scatter when spittin gangster chattering
all up in your gathering back im with that black on snatch
n crack your backbone bitch dont even act on
write a check n make your whole crew bounce
fake rappers wanna give me a pound
cant fuck around with that wannag wannabeeitus its like a virus
sign they ass into the clinic g shit i be the venom hit him up for sinnin
run protect yo women juggalettes know recognise the trues for jokes
let a soldier do his thing when im in yo scene
kiss the pinky ring now motherfucker im antibling
and i take bread n make bread what they said
and all that but stall that i never change the format
recall that when this drop i am hiphop
so fuck what you claimin hard truth dont stop
so before you fix your mouth and say that you aint heard
the ar after the p before the is served
no i put you up on gang cook aint have a skirt
from my mouth to your motherfuckin ears now thats my wordembed"
