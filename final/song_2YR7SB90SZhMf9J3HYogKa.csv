even the sparrow has a place to lay its head
so why would i let worries steal my breath
even the roses you have clothed in brilliant red
still im the one you love more than this

chorus
you give me everything
you give me everything
you give me everything i need

verse 2
even the oceans push and pull at your command
so you can still my heart with your hand
you tell the seasons when its time for them to turn
so i will trust you even when it hurts

chorus
you give me everything
you give me everything
you give me everything i need
you give me everything
you give me everything
you give me everything i need

when im weak you are mighty
