what a friend we have in jesus
all our sins and griefs to bear
what a privilege to carry
everything to god in prayer
o what peace we often forfeit
o what needless pain we bear
all because we do not carry
everything to god in prayer
have we trials and temptations
is there trouble anywhere
we should never be discouraged
take it to the lord in prayer
can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share
jesus knows our every weakness
take it to the lord in prayersee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also like1embed"
