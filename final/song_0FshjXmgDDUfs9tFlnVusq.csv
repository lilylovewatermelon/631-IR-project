oh shit i guess were starting
the mic is where my heart is
i know what my part is
i hear my own voice
i make my own choice
i guess were fuckin doing it
the horse is out the gates
its time to start the race
shoutout to kathy bates and also betty white
all the people if youre the type
i wanna say that youre equal on the mic
but nobodys equal to me
nobody is coming for my neck
i am looking for respect
im not looking for a check
unless it is for my friends
thats why were doing this
to make some pennies
and maybe make amends
sailors in the sea might get the bends
that is my fuckin dream
to go with james cameron in a submarine
to the bottom of the ocean
rocking forth with the motion
me and jimmy cameron sipping on some potion
sharing our emotion
daring you to fuck with us
at the sea at a deep water vent
but we dont got the bends were not bent
i think thats what im meant to do
me and my crew
gigantic looking to cross the sea
for the titanic
oh shit you mean they found it
already theyd abounded with treasure
man that doesnt give me pleasure
i dont know how to measure
how i feel about that shit
but that wont make me quit
in my quest to scour the deep sea
like you and me
searching for an angle mangled
the corpse in the bermuda triangle
maybe looking for amelia earharts plane
were like oh shit what remains
and
then we get to the bottom
amelia earharts like oh shit got em
you didnt know but i was an immortal
i just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal
shuffled off my fucking mortal coil
mortal kombat you know that im oil
all my fuckin blood but i got a loyal
and you know i am not gonna take a foil
to my head in a little tin cap shape
because you know im great
i popped the grape
but im not on some conspiracies
im just trying to see whats up in the seas
i believe that i will not cease and desist
you cannot resist
when im stepping through like gorillas in the mist
i am in manila in hong kong
in san francisco doing a disco
pop it hot like its crisco
but i gotta pace myself
if were gonna raise this wealth
thats why i flow at this tempo
hello i do kempo
in my mind thats a form of martial arts
but i take partial starts
and i just gave little partial farts
when im shitting on the mic
cause you know i got this heart
and you know i got the kmart
stateoftheart mind
but im not behind
no im way out in the front
rolling up a 30foot blunt
and you know im not gonna bunt
in a baseball game im gonna hit the dinger
because i am the rap ringer
i never make the wrong call
and you know chicks dig the long ball
i am like ah
they are like wow
watsky you cannot stop me
i got no paparazzi
im a fucking doorstep
im gonna take one more step
and then take another
word to ya mother word to ya fatha
here i am man fuckin camp granada
just keep rappin yada yada yada
hey shoutout to fuckin jerry seinfeld
me and him its like a fuckin mind meld
or maybe its more like larry david
because you know were not playing
shoutout to the jews the chosen people
you know that you cannot fuckin lose
but also shoutout to the christians
shoutout to the agnostics starting their own missions
you know you cannot stop it
also fuckin shoutout to the bahai faith
who know were gonna make way
for the jehovahs witnesses
they got their hit listesses
walking up to the different fuckin doors
saying would you like to love god a little more
but it kinda sucks just because of covid
they cant be making no bids
i heard theyre not doing that doorknockin
but you know were not stoppin
however you appraise em
no we are fuckin raising
on the mic im fuckin blazing
if the sun is blazing
i turn into a raisin
im bringing this whole craze
for almost two whole days
i dont think thats possible
i dont think thats wise
i dont think thats probable
that is what they say when they look in to my eyes
my momma was afraid for me
she busted in like the maître d
she said hello umm
i dont think you wanna sit here
i dont think you wanna get here
cause you might die
you know but then i was like i gotta try
i gotta try to do the right thing
shoutout to spike lee
im gonna try to get the ring
try to get the bling
try to be the king of the long raps
like i was the dude with the ass raps
doesnt matter
as long as the people fuckin clap
as long as we give a little joy
give em dat
then i will cut the crap
i guess i am a believer
and i dont care that i got seizures
i got my fuckin pills
im gonna take em right around midnight
so i can get right
i think thats what i gotta do
shout out to the medical commun
itty i just get gritty
i hope my rhymes are not shitty
umm mic check are you with me
shoutout bobby and whitney
but not shout out to the bad things he did
i dont know if im gonna have a kid
i dont know if im gonna raise a child
but it might be fun theyd be fuckin wild
they would make be fuckin smile
they got fuckin bile and some guts
everybody does
everybody got guts
everybody got nuts
or half the people maybe like 487
thats about how it went
i think that is the percentageish
of the gender fuckin separation
although we know in this nation
things are fuckin changin and you gotta be patient
if you dont understand
i got my fuckin rhymes on demand
i can run it back
but im not allowed to under the rules of guinness
if im trying to fuckin win this
i will not get winded i have not rescinded
anything that ive fucking said
by the end of this shit ill be fuckin dead
ill be seeing red like i said gotta take my meds
that is like right said fred
you just gotta relax
if you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
i dont get lyrical cataracts
so i can see clearly so i can be dearly
received ive got to achieve
whatever ive got up my sleeve
whatever ive got in my pouch
shoutout to pouch ouch
i pricked my finger that is not true
but on this mic i will linger for you

ive got to drop it hot for you
cause this is why im hot

shoutout to mims
shoutout to hims

but im like no im watsky
and santa said oh i was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude
but im like thats rude

and i got my whole butt out
hes like damn i guess ill put this knife away
cutout

john stamos
john stainsmost in his pants
but thats okay
we dont judge people who like to dance away the day
if they need a peptobismol
my throat is not abysmal
this all that i can do is just give this my not screwedup attempt
i will not repent
and i’m not demented
but i meant it
when i sent it
from my brain
im not plain
im not fuckin around
i’m not cluckin the ground
just right there it’s only two feet
that’s pretty cool man i eat
from that cup right there
the one that’s floatin up in the air
it’s got a fuckin strawber
ry smoothie
i flow very smoothly
but you cannot do me
do me do me like that
i got that roomie type rap
it’s mad philosophical
i just keep on droppin all
of the marbles in my brain
they’re comin out my nose
and then they just remain
on the ground
even the cat’s eye
that is my favorite fuckin marble that passed by
did you know at places
people on the internet watch marble races
i watched one
it was mad fun
i picked the fuckin blue marble
and my pick wasnt all garbled
it came down the shoot
it was going all fuckin cool
and then it fuckin scooted past the red one
that kid from the shining like redrum
meaning murder
worder
wordier
all my flows are so dirtier
than you could even fuckin guess
im not even fucking stressed
im so damn relaxy
shout out to a maxipad
for being so absorbent
thats a good fuckin fuction
my girls not in her head cause she knows it
put her hands in the air
maxi pads doing what they do down there
if you are shaved or if youve got hair
it doesnt matter if youve got a bush or are bare
do what you wanna
word to your mama
your dude cant tell you what you gotta do
gotta do what you wanna
make your own choice
with your body or your voice
if you are moist
i know some people dont like that word
palabra
but you know you gotta like what you like
there was this one time this dude named ike
ran to be prez
and he fuckin won
eisenhower thats what i said
is a powerrapper
yes i am
so fuckin dapper
the clapper
doesnt work on the lights on this green screen
man that would be a dream scene
if i could fuckin clap and things would fuckin do what they want
what i want damn
that would be no scam
i dont eat no spam
thats cause i am a soft boy
and i only eat bokchoy
cause im a little veggie human
and thats what i be doin
let me clarify
like clarified butter
again word to your mother
and also not to digress
but i gotta get it off of my chest
word to mark wahlberg
word to ballers
wait okay let me make my main point
as i rap over this joint
and that is that i dont only eat bokchoy
i also eat soy
i also as a jewish type dude not a goy
get lots of joy out of eatin carrots
out of eatin broccoli
out of eatin lots of trees
out of smokin lots of trees
that is true
that is not
i dont smoke a lot
but i do when i party
but during covid i party hardly
and i guess thats kinda sad
but ive had some calls with my dad
paul watsky
and claire watsky
its rare stop me
its not lots of sundays
i call my parentals
and i just steal out my fuckin mentals
but i dont pull out my dentals
i go sometimes i do in a dream
when i am on the scene
and the ghost come and make me scream
its like you are doing the most
and i gotta fuckin boast
shout out to the host to the boast the most roast
that is some shit if you take a gander
that was said by mr ned flanders
mr homer simpson
im the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
theyre like “watsky ill do everything for you
ill white knight for you and your fucking crew”
im like “dude dont be a simp
actually do be a simp
you could be pimp
you could be wimp
you could fucking walk with a limp
you can have a crimp in your dimple”
i just get the whole tent pole
up in the sky cause i meant
lots of people can come in
cause i got a big tent
so if you are a lame
fucking get bent
and by lame what i mean in this game
is the type of person who says that youre lame
is the type of person who judges
is the type of person who never budges
when they get stubborn
cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
 001804
word
i think i got this whole thing turned up
but that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin
some words are going to collide like trains
coming head to head but it remains
to be seen that i get back on the track
with the ratatat tat tat when they clap clap clap
with my fucking clapping gums
so dont judge me too much if what i say is dumb
sometimes
cause im not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
but it happens and i think that is the lesson
that you cannot achieve perfection
and its not even a worthy goal
you just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
more times than not
this is why im hot as i said
but you know mans not hot
although the truth is i kinda fuckin am
cause im goin kinda fuckin ham
on the microphoneo oh no
cant believe hes like apollo anton ohno

tremendous flow when i bend this dough
for the needs of my friends and the needs of yall

but it wasnt for me and i stopped
two times  three times man i dropped
some acid though out in venice
at the biennale with my dentist

that was better than some school man
i furrow my brow vexingly
no witches are hexxing me
i do it to the nth degree
i do it so specially
cardiac is my speciality
you got no space balls
i could just make all
of your dreams come true
give you a harpoon
and a damn balloon
to pop im in the navigator
with an alligator
they say see you later
they say meet me later at the pie spot
grab some pie and some coffee
all these people get off me
it’s just me watsky
but you know that im not gonna be pulled
to your dimensions and ambitions
did i mention that occasionally i get anxiety
i have no real piety
i don’t know why it’s me in this body but it is
so i try to be
an okay type of dude in my daily life
in my daily doings and maybe i
succeed from time to time and
do good from rhyme to rhyme
but i am keenly aware that when you see me you stare
cause youre like he looks like some dude who might make me cum
just by looking oh are you booking me with your eyes
are you cucking me why are you doing that
you could rap about yourself in a strange day
maybe you do every damn day
if so you should send me the link
and when i’m not rapping for 33 hours straight
i think i’d try to watch you
if you sneeze i would say “achoo”
if you fucking fall i gotchu
i try to get you up with my trust fall
i try to fucking say “fuck all my doubts
all the dark thoughts”
i try to danish those harlots
i’m out at a used car lot
singing some dope harmonics
singing some harmonies
the devil cant be harming me
i got this great fantasy
that im on the faculty at my old school
but the school is in high rule
i’m not quite squeamish
i’m just on the scene shit
munching and munching
on this flow i just jump in
all my hair is really bunchin’
and i’m eating my luncheon
snap back on this velcro
they all say say hell no
i all say “elmo
but i know my elbow is really close
but you still cant bite it
thats a russian proverb
you know i wont hide it
i wont hide it on my timeline
you know that im fine
im not dying on the vine
but i need to remind you
to rewind this like the time lapse
i might collapse
i might collate myself into notes
and then go late into that deep dark night
but not gently man i wont go
they meant me to go so fiercely
you know you cant pierce me
with your arrows and your slings
you know you cant bring me down
when you see this crown i will not be drowned

how hot my flows are heating up

man some people having no kids
because this changed our whole worlds

no little boys or girls
and maybe wait a bit
or dont
i dont know
thats your life
do whatever you want with your time
110706
because our lives are so bountiful
and we gotta just power through
live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars
or wonder where the fuck we are
in the universe
this is so true it hurts
but im not a salesman
im more a drink and an ale man
bringing the truth like a mailman
feeling like a maniac
flowing like a brainiac
because you know that the way i rap
is so goddamn loquacious
that im saying its gracious

when im on the mic i say shit
but otherwise i might not like to say
but i can’t just put this damn mic away

im in my cubby hole
hiding out
cause you know that my buddys roll
its a scout
if the teacher is coming
playin hidegoseek and you know that im drummin
on a melody
tell me
fucking makaveli
do you smell me
you know i get heli
coptered out of my own mind
the doctor proctored my test
but you need not remind me

that this life is cyclical
i’m putty in god’s hands man
my buddy

its fucking paramount
to get a golden parachute
this life is rare amount of time
but you know that we get the shoot
were gonna lose and dilute
and leave a weird residue
i dont know
who are you

all of these night critters
are giving me real jitters
in the morning i wont eat fritters

ill probably eat more smoothie
i wonder how much more there is
a lot
it doesnt have much fizz
although at some point i have to drink the redbully
and then you will have to pull me
up
on my ass from the couch
and i dont know if i doubt
myself
i just drop these lyrical thesis
theoretical theses
you know i make theses
flows
i got no place
bo
boop

and it doesnt make me mad
