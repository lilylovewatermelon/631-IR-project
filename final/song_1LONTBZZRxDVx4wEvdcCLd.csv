when a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
it always winds up feelin more like a job interview
my momma used to wonder if shed ever meet someone
who wouldnt find out about me and then turn around and run

verse 2
i met the man i call my dad when i was five years old
he took my mom out to a movie and for once i got to go
a few months later i remember lyin there in bed
i overheard him pop the question and prayed that shed say yes

chorus
and then all of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me
how we went from somethings missin to a family
lookin back all i can say about all the things he did for me
is i hope im at least half the dad that he didnt have to be

verse 3
i met the girl thats now my wife about three years ago
we had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin more
now here i stand surrounded by our family and friends
crowded round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

chorus
and now all of a sudden oh it seems so strange to me
how weve gone from somethings missin to a family
lookin through the glass i think about the man thats standin next to me
and i hope im at least half the dad that he didnt have to be

bridge
and lookin back all i can say about all the things he did for me
is i hope im at least half the dad that he didnt have to be

outro

because he didnt have to be
you know he didnt have to be2embed"
