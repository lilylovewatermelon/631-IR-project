youve been a part of my life for so very long
its hard for me to believe sometimes that youre really gone
i tuck your memory away in that special hiding place
hoping no one could tell by the look on my face
that youre still in my heart always on my mind
part of my everyday

verse 2
like just last night i went out for a bite
i tried to have fun with all of my might
but even the laughter it wasnt much of a break
cause right in the middle of my salad and steak
bobby joe walked in with a couple of friends
and said hey have you heard from her at all man like
wheres she been

chorus
and it struck a nerve
and it hit a vein
youd think from all the tears i cried
and this brokenhearted pain
i wouldnt have to carry you around with me
but it seems like everywhere i go
somebody wants to know where youve been
are you coming back again i swear
i cant take you anywhere

so i left all alone just headed back home
as i listened to the messages on my telephone
there was one from my sister
and one from an old friend
he said i drove by your house tonight dude but
you werent in
just checking up on you boy i hope youre doing alright
oh by the way man i seen her last night

chorus
and it struck a nerve
and it hit a vein
youd think from all the tears i cried
and this brokenhearted pain
i wouldnt have to carry you around with me
but it seems like everywhere i go
somebody wants to know where youve been
are you coming back again i swear
i cant take you anywhere

outro
i swear i cant take you
just cant take you
i cant take you anywhere
i cant take you anywhere
i cant take you anywhere
i cant take you anywhereembed"
