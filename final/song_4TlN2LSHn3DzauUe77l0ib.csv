verse 1 mac miller
i came for whoever is in charge here
suggest you go and get yourself a weapon and a guard here
they need some coffee everybody sleepin on me
goin round doortodoor settin off alarms beep beep beep
all that horse shit you shoulda left it at the barn
keep a stallion tell her gallop to the store and get cigars yeah
too many whips gotta get a new garage made thats the ball game
i might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
me and my bizarre ways lord have mercy
i moved up from a private to a sergeant you can see it from the scarface
hidden in a dark place swimmin in a shark tank
give a bitch a little bit of change she a game in a arcade
time crisis not a second to lose
im the motherfuckin bible thats forever the truth amen
and this is not another case of the celebrity blues
the devil wit me and he tell me to shoot boom

yeah man i wish you were here happy holidays
um i love ya
and i hope you have a good nightweekendi hope i talk to you soon
alright godspeed

verse mac miller
ah yeah
i thought id have it figured out by now
shit would be simple problems would be in the past by now
me and the homies would be sittin on millions
reminiscin on times when we were so broke and livin in oakland just chillin
i thought id have it in the bag by now
i thought that wed be kickin back by now
i know that life is a bitch
i know that life is a bitch i thought wed put her in a cab by now
but im stressin i cant relax
swallowin my pride and im hidin whats makin me mad
everybody sayin i need rehab
cause im speedin with a blindfold on
it wont be long until they watchin me crash
and they dont wanna see that
they dont want me to od and have to talk to my mother
tell her they coulda done more to help me
and shed just be cryin
sayin that shed do anything to have me back
all the nights im losin sleep
it was all a dream there was a time that i believed that
but white lines be numbin them dark times
the pills that im poppin i need to man up
admit its a problem i need to wake up
before one mornin i dont wake up
you make your mistakes your mistakes never make ya
im too obsessed with goin down as a great one
but if you wait too long they gon find someone to replace ya
so i guess this is a letter
to all my brothers most dope thats forever
i love you more than words could express
and this the part that q start cryin if he aint already yet
i did my best to be a leader you respect
at times i became weaker got defeated by regret
so tell my baby i love her
and if she give me the chance ill put a seed inside her make her a mother
just know that theres a place
where all my people worry free and erybody straight
every devil dont got horns every hero aint got capes
open up my eyes shit im finally awake good mornin
yeah good mornin
