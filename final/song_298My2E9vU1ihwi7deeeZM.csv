shit aint been the same since you left now
only thing going through my head is regret now
waiting for you i almost let my bread down
you got me stressed out
left me to get let down
but somehow im still wishin you all the best now
i think its better now
cause you really put my ego up in check now
and im upset now
ever since you let me down
and im upset now
