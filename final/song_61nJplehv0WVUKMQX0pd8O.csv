the other night i had a dream
it was a world full of kings and queens
but it was cold dark as the night
we were the fire under moonlit skies
we were divided we were the same
and we were free but we all wore chains
we couldnt see it but we created
a place between truth and overrated

refrain
if i could just see it all
just like a fly on the wall
would i be able to accept what i cant control
and would i share what i saw
or just sit back and ignore
like nothing never happened
havent seen you before

prechorus
im on the run from a thief i let into my head
i know i hold the keys so dont be scared
when i turn and shout

chorus
i dont think i need you anymore
take your words and your lies and just beat it
i dont think i need you anymore
take the hurt and the pain i dont need it
i wanna live i wanna be the change
we can all be kings and queens
if we can just learn to believe
if we can just learn to believe

we had a plan to build a wall
a great divide that would never fall
to separate us from all the pain
and keep our skeletons locked away
and brick by brick we built it so thick
that it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight
and one by one we all became numb
we were making the bullets to a broken gun

refrain
if i could just see it all
just like a fly on the wall
would i be able to accept what i cant control
and would i share what i saw
or just sit back and ignore
like nothing never happened
and i havent seen you before

prechorus
im on the run from a thief
i let into my head
i know i hold the keys so dont be scared
when i turn and shout

chorus
i dont think i need you anymore
take your words and your lies and just beat it
i dont think i need you anymore
take the hurt and the pain i dont need it
i wanna live i wanna be the change
we can all be kings and queens
if we can just learn to believe
if we can just learn to believe
i dont think i need you anymore
take your words and your lies and just beat it
i dont think i need you anymore
take the hurt and the pain i dont need it
i wanna live i wanna be the change
we can all be kings and queens
if we can just learn to believe
if we can just learn to believe12embed"
