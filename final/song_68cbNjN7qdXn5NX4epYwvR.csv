finish him

verse 1 tony with the tommy
percocets and the codeine got me floating
opiates i’m a junkie
fuck the money
3rd ward in the dope house keep a closed mouth
in the ghetto bitch i got clout
never seen droughts
hit the route where the felons lurk
tonys in the dirt findin work
got my twenty shirts tell the homie fuck your turf
triple six don’t make me manifest
bulletproof the vest
lucifer done made me promises and that’s an honest threat

verse 2 lord of loneliness
oozing feeling gucci when them pills slide down my throat
loosely take a couple feelin woozy how i cope
burning wax but aint no candles
i cant handle what i know
what i dont know i will try and probably use until i croak
i done fucked all of these bitches
i dont trust them so i dont fuck a ho
pussys just another hole that i crawl in and out of
slit my throat ill die inside of a bitch
i be that downward spirallooking motherfucker tryna aim a rifle
911 dont fucking dialsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like20embed"
