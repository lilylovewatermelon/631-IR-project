ohoh ohoh ohoh

verse 1
i eat my dinner in my bathtub then i go to sex clubs
watchin freaky people gettin it on
it doesnt make me nervous if anything im restless
yeah ive been around and ive seen it all
i get home i got the munchies binge on all my twinkies
throw up in the tub then i go to sleep
and i drank up all my money dazed and kinda lonely

chorus
youre gone and i gotta stay
high all the time to keep you off my mind
oohoohoohooh oohoohoohooh
high all the time to keep you off my mind
oohoohoohooh oohoohoohooh
spend my days locked in a haze
tryna forget you babe i fall back down
gotta stay high all my life to forget im missin you
oohoohoohooh oohoohoohooh

verse 2
pick up daddies at the playground how i spend my day time
loosen up their frown make em feel alive
i make it fast and greasy im numb and way too easy
