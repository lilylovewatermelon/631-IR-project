cole world
forreal

verse 1
look at me pathetic nigga this chain that i bought
you mix greed pain and fame this is heinous result
let these words be the colors im just paintin my heart
im kneedeep in the game and it aint what i thought
copped a range rover my girl got the mercedes
iced out crazy i wanna shine like baby
compared to that nigga i aint even got a bib yet
truth be told i aint even bought a crib yet
this is everything they told a nigga not to do
image is everything i see it got a lot to do
with the way people perceive and what they believe
money short so this jewelry is like a weave
meant to deceive and hear niggas say i see you
now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
and police wanna stop you frisk you wonder what he do
if a hater snatch your chain i bet it still wont free you
cause i be right back grinding til i cop another
i sit and think about all this shit i coulda copped my mother
my partner said thats just the game my nigga
swear i heard my jeweler say here go your chain my nigga

verse 2
ice on this white jesus seem a little unholy
the real strange thing about this iced out roley
its the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
well laugh on white man i aint paid as you
but i bet your rims aint the same age as you
and i aint got no investment portfolio
but my black and white diamonds shinin like a oreo
i know back home a nigga sick today
he rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
even back when i was broke i knew his shit was fake
hed probably sneeze too hard and his shit could break
but hey you know the sayin fake it til you make it
me i did the opposite made it then i faked it
and acted like i gave a fuck money i was savin up
to buy a crib thats gated to that hundred racks i gave it up
for what
chorus
