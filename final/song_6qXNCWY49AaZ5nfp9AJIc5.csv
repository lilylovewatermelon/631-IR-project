verse
i wish i had nine lives
i bet it feels real nice
sitting in the sun
letting the rays wash over me
no one watching over me
i do what i want
everybody wants to be a cat
its cool to be a cat
everything the light touches
its where i will roam
my roar would be so powerful
i would scare off everything

bridge
cool to be a cat meow meow meow meow
cool to be a cat meow meow meow meow
cool to be a cat meow meow meow meow
cool to be a cat
