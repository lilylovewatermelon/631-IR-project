are we awake
am i too old to be this stoned
was it your breasts from the start
they played a part
for goodness sake
i wasnt told youd be this cold
now its my time to depart
and i just had a change of heart

verse 2
ill quote on the road like a twat
and wind my way out of the city
finding a girl who is equally pretty wont be hard
oh i just had a change of heart

instrumental interlude

verse 3
you smashed a glass into pieces
and thats around the time i left
and you were coming across as clever
then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
you said im full of diseases
your eyes were full of regret
and then you took a picture of your salad
and put it on the internet
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likebridge
and she said ive been so worried about you lately
you look shit and you smell a bit
youre mad thinking you could ever save me
not looking like that

verse 4
you used to have a face straight out of a magazine
now you just look like anyone
i just had a change of heart
i feel as though i was deceived
i never found love in the city
i just sat in selfpity and cried in the car
oh i just had a change of heart

bridge
then she said ive been so worried bout you lately
you were fit but youre losing it
you played a part this is how it starts
oh i just had a change of heart
​
outro
i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart
oh i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart
i just had a change of heart47embed"
