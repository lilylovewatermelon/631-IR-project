can you see me
cause im right here
can you listen
cause ive been trying to make you notice
what it would mean to me
to feel like somebody
weve been on our way to nowhere
trying so hard to get there

and i say oh
were gonna let it show
were gonna just let go of everything
holding back our dreams
and try
and make it come alive
come on let it shine so they can see
we were meant to be
somebody
somebody yeah
somehow someday
someway somebody

of being invisible
but i feel it yeah
like a fire below the surface
trying to set me free
burning inside of me
cause were standing on the edge now
its a long way down

we will walk out of this darkness
feel the spotlight glowing
like a yellow sun

we fall together
til we get back up
and we will rise as one
