you’ve got the bullets
i got the gun
i got a hankerin for getting into somethin
i hit the bottle you hit the gas
i heard your 65 can really haul some ass

verse 1
i’m feelin frisky youre feelin good
i guess the whiskey is doin what it should
i got the cigarettes
you’ve got a lighter
and when the sun goes down we’ll start a little fire

chorus
ain’t no use in tryin to slow me down
‘cause you’re runnin with the fastest girl in town
ain’t ya baby
i like ‘em crazy

verse 2
my reputation follows me around
just makes me wanna give them more to talk about
let’s go to town for a little while
i’ll be wearing nothin but a tattoo and a smile
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
ain’t no use in tryin to slow me down
‘cause you’re runnin with the fastest girl in town
ain’t ya baby
youre kinda crazy

break
come on

verse 3
i see the blue lights we better run
throw out the bottle and i’ll hide the gun
if he pulls us over i’ll turn on the charm
you’ll be in the slammer and i’ll be on his arm

chorus
ain’t no use in tryin to slow me down
‘cause you’re runnin with the fastest girl in town
ain’t ya baby
well i told you i was crazy
no i ain’t nobody’s baby
hey

outro
he’s got the bullets he’s got a gun
i got the hankerin for gettin into somethin3embed"
