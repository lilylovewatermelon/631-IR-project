verse 3
see i done been to the pearly gates they sent me back
good die young i aint eligible for that
i shot niggas i been shot sold crack in the street
my attitude is gangsta so i stay in some beef
you wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
from threepoint range with a glock i shoot better than kobe
see a nigga standing next to me he probably my cod
see a bitch gettin in my whip she probably gon blow me
see the flow is like a 38 its special yall
a country boy tell ya im finna blow
im more like a pimp than a trick you know
you see im in this for the paper i dont love the hoes
niggas broke in the hood worryin about mines
grownass men wearing starter kit shines
you know them little pieces with the little stones
got little clientele fiends call your cell phone
when the gossipin start im always the topic
you too old for that shit dawg wont you stop it
shorty ive been watching you watching me
