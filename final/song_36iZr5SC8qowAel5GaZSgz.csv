ive got you deep in the heart of me
youre so deep in my heart that youre really a part of me
and ive got you under my skin

ive tried so not to give in
you know ive said to myself this affair aint gonna go so well
but why should i try to resist when baby i know so well
that ive got you way under my skin

i would sacrifice anything come what might
for the sake of having you near
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
and repeats in my ear

dont you know you fool you never can win
use your mentality step up to reality
but each time i do just the thought of you
makes me stop before i begin
cause ive got you youre under my skin

id sacrifice anything come what might
for the sake of having you near
in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
and repeats how it yells in these ears
you might also likedont you know you fool no chance to win
why not choose your mentality wake up step up to reality
but each time i do just the thought of you
makes me stop just before i begin
because ive got you under my skin
and i love you under my skinembed"
