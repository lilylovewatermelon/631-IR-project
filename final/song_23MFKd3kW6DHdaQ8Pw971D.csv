the traits and practice of vampirism

it was generally supposed that all suicides might after death become vampires and this was easily extended to those who met with any violent or sudden death mr lawson tells us that there persists a tradition in maina where the vendetta is still maintained that a man whose murder has not been avenged is liable to become a vrykolakas1 the mainotes who derive their name from the place maina near cape taenaron matapan even yet preserve many of the customs and characteristics of their ancestors and historically are known to be of a more pure greek descent than the inhabitants of any other district indeed the peninsula which thrusts into the sea the headland of taenaron has both social and religious customs of its own the population is distributed into small villages while here and there a white fortress will denote the residence of a chief a traveller writing in 1858 remarks the maina country is wild and beautiful singularly well cultivated considering the difficulties to be surmounted and producing crops that put to shade the rich plains of argos and arcadia whilst the interesting mountain people exercise the highland virtues of hospitality and independance to an extent unknown in the low countries it has been said that the last traveller who saw maina while retaining some remains of its primitive cateran glories was lord carnarvon who in 1839 explored the morea and has left us an extraordinarily interesting account of his journey

the population of this district continued the worship of the pagan deities for full five hundred years after the rest of the roman empire had embraced christianity and they were not finally converted until the reign of the vigorous emperor basil i 867886 gibbon described them as a domestic and perhaps original race who in some degree might derive their blood from the muchinjured helotes2 and even yet

p 141

they boast of their descent from the ancient spartans whilst the histories of leonidas and lycurgus who figure partly as saints and partly as gallant brigands are still retold round the winter fireside the whole district including kaka voulia the land of evil counsel is formed by the hummocks and escarpments of mount taygetos and with the exception of a long strip of coast line which the venetians called bassa maina it is steep and hilly and for the most part barren the conquest of the morea was completed by mahomet ii in 14561460 but maina could never be thoroughly subdued and its inhabitants remained as entirely independent as were the highlanders before culloden

as has been remarked ancient traditions still persevere and among these customs not the least obstinate is the vendetta a man who has been murdered is unable to rest in his grave until he has been avenged accordingly he issues forth as a vampire thirsting for the blood of his enemy in order to bring about his physical dissolution and to secure his repose it is necessary for the next of kin to slay the murderer or at least some near relative of the murderer unless this is done the man upon whom the duty of avenging blood devolves is banned by the curse of the dead and if so be that he is himself cut off before he can satify the desires of the deceased the curse will yet cling to him even in death and he too must become a vampire it should be remarked that this view of bloodguilt is found in the attic dramatists and is in fact the mainspring of the whole story of orestes in the tragedy of this name by euripides tyndareus the father of clytemnestra remonstrates very reasonably and indeed unanswerably with orestes but the hero replies and argues that if he has not avenged his father

had not his hates erinyes haunted me3

again in the choephoroe of aeschylus orestes pursues the same idea saying that unless he avenges his father a stern duty which has devolved upon him lie will be punished in turn by the avengers of his fathers wrongs it may be remarked that in maina today no recourse must be had to law for such cases nor must the injured person satisfy himself by calling upon the aid of the police to do this were incredibly base the subterfuge of a recreant and a craven even if it be a lifes whole work a man is expected either secretly

or by an open attack to slay the murderer of his relative and he is highly applauded when he has accomplished this pious deed it must be appreciated that he is regarded as herein directed and inspired by the dead man who returns from his grave as a vampire craving for blood even if no other motive or incentive prevailed in spite of natural shrinking and may be even cowardice a man would undoubtedly prefer to shed blood for blood especially when this might be done in secrecy or by craft rather than run the terrible risk of himself becoming a vampire finding no rest in the grave but returning to haunt and persecute even those who were most dear to him an unclean thing accursed of god a foul goblin of dread most hateful to man

so great is the horror which the act of suicide although considered admirable in the decadence of greece and rome inspires in every man of sane mind that it is not at all surprising it should be deemed that the unfortunate wretches who have destroyed themselves become vampires after death according to the zoroastrian creed suicide is a most fearful crime and is classed among the margarzan the abominable offences aristotle in his ethics v xv terms suicide a sin against the state and as cicero tells us pythagoras forbade men to depart from their guard or sentrygo in life without an order from their commandingofficer who is god uetatque pythagoras iniussu imperatoris id est dei de praesidio et statione uitae decedere de senectute xx 73 the highest pagan argument against suicide will be found in platos phaedo 61e62e but it is drowned in the mighty voice of the great saint of hippo which peals in no unwavering tones down the centuries for if it be not lawful for a private man to kill any man however guilty unless the law have granted a special allowance for it theft surely whosoever kills himself is guilty of homicide and so much the more guilty doth that killing of himself make himself by how much the more guiltless he was in that cause for which he killed himself for if the act of judas be worthily detested and yet the truth saith that by hanging of himself he did rather augment than expiate the guilt of his wicked treachery because his despair of gods mercy in his damnable repentance left no place in his soul for saving repentance how much more ought he to

p 143
forbear from being cause of his own death that hath no guilt in him worthy of such a punishment as death for judas in hanging himself hanged but a wicked man and died guilty not only of christs death but of his own also adding the wickedness of being his own death to that other wickedness of his for which he died de ciuitate dei i xvii

it may be well very briefly to present the teaching of the church concerning positive and direct suicide if done without gods permission this always constitutes a grave injustice towards him to destroy a thing is in effect to dispose of it as an absolute master and to act with regard to it as one who has full and independent dominion over it but god has reserved to himself dominion over life man cannot create life and he does not possess this full and absolute right over his own life consequently suicide must be reckoned as an attempt against the dominion and right of ownership of the author of life to this injustice is superadded a serious offence against the charity owed by man to himself since by selfmurder he deprives himself of the greatest good in his possession moreover this sin may be aggravated by other circumstances such as an offence against conjugal paternal or filial duty an offence against justice or charity if by taking his own life a man eludes existing obligations of justice or acts of charity which he could and should perform that suicide is unlawful is the general teaching of holy scripture which condemns the act as a most terrible crime and to arouse the horror of all against holy church denies the suicide the rites of christian burial again suicide is directly opposed to the most natural and powerful tendency of all created things and especially of intelligent man the preservation of life indeed very large numbers of physicians moralists and jurists lay it down as a general rule that suicide is always due to dementia so great is the horror which this atrocious deed inspires in every man of sane mind as a generalization this may be admitted to be true for it is impossible to think that those who have the calm and right use of their reason should deliberately destroy themselves and the conditions which are necessary to incur the full culpability of an act can only in exceptional instances be conceived of as being present in the case of a suicide sabetti inquires quaenam ad peccatum mortale

the christian middle ages were free from the terrible tendency of suicide but with the loss of faith it reappeared and masaryk in his study der selbstmord als sociale massenerscheinung der modernen civilisation vienna 1881 considered it to be the special evil of these later days sad to relate selfdestruction has fearfully increased since the great war but it may perhaps be mitigatingly advanced that the reason of the world tottered almost to eternal delirium during the chaos and welter of blood and the balance is not recovered yet

it is true that among certain nations there appears to be an indifference to human life nay a contempt of death itself which often takes the most extravagant and the most outrageous forms the goths the heathen vandals and norse savages not only approved but sought suicide and violent death it is of course only among the utterly benighted that it is possible for such abominable ideas to obtain for example there existed among a tribe of robbers in southern india customs of the utmost ferocity such practices as the following certainly prevailed during the eighteenth century but they have no doubt long since been happily suppressed if two persons had quarrelled sometimes for the most trifling reasons a man would kill himself merely in order to be revenged on his adversary he believed that

p 145

his ghost would be able to return and harry the surviver  or at least that some dire retribution must fall on the head of his enemy who drove him to such extreme measures6 again custom required that if a man committed suicide letting it be known that it was on this account the person with whom he had had the difference that led to this abominable act must immediately follow his example7

lord aveburys statement8 it is said that in china if a rich man is condemned to death he can sometimes purchase a willing substitute at a very small expense has been traversed and professor parker would not commit himself any further than by saying it is popularly stated that substitutes can be bought for taels fifty and most certainly this statement is more than true so far as the price of human life is concerned but it is quite another question whether the gaolers and judges can always be bribed9 dr w t a barber who had been a missionary in china relates that he had known very large numbers of persons who committed suicide out of spite against some one else the idea being first the trouble given by minions of the law to the survivor second that the dead would gain a vantage ground by becoming a ghost and thus able to plague his enemy in the flesh10

it is not surprising to learn that in ancient times before the advent of christianity among such savage people as the celts and the thracians suicide was not only common but treated with the most appalling lightness and even flippancy thus athenæus speaking of the banquets of the thracians quotes from seleueus as follows and seleueus says that some of the thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging and fix a round noose to some high place exactly beneath which they place a stone which is easily turned round when any one stands upon it and then they cast lots and he who draws the lot holding a sickle in his hand stands upon the stone and puts his neck into the halter and then another person comes and raises the stone and the man who is suspended when the stone moves from under him if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle is killed and the rest laugh thinking his death good sport11
upon the authority of the famous stoic philosopher posidonius athenæus tells us of similar brutalities which took place among the celts he writes but posidonius12 in the

p 146

third and also in the twentieth book of his histories says the celtæ sometimes have single combats at their entertainments for being collected in arms they go through the exercise and make feints at and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another and being irritated by this if the bystanders do not stop them they will proceed even to kill one another but in olden times he continues there was a custom that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table and the bravest man took it and if any one else laid claim to it then the two rose up to fight till one of them was slain and other men in the theatre having received some silver or gold money and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine having taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given and having distributed them among their nearest connexions have laid themselves down on doors with their faces upwards and then allowed some bystander to cut their throats with a sword

and euphorion the chalcidian in his historical memorials writes as follows but among the romans it is common for five minæ13 to be offered to any one who chooses to take it to allow his head to be cut off with an axe so that his heirs might receive the reward and very often many have returned their names as willingly so that there has been a regular contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to death14 these atrocious examples serve to show us something of the evil and the corruption of which christianity cleansed the pagan world although it is to be feared that the battle is not yet won since it is a notorious and deplorable fact that at the hour of such a crisis as the great war the respect due to human life became cheapened in mens eyes with the consequence that murder and deeds of violence once more broke out in every direction showing that savage instincts were dominated indeed but in many cases not wholly eradicated it does not require a keen perception to see the direct agency of the devil here and these atrocities which bred so callous and cruel a spirit are by no means altogether unconnected with the recrudescence of necromancy and black magic which foul arts once more grew green and were almost openly pursued on every side

the belief that a man has not complete dominion over his own life and that it is unlawful for him to take it is certainly a

p 147

feeling naturally implanted in the human breast and it was only when nations were entirely barbarian or had became decadent and corrupt that the notion of suicide was held up as noble and even heroic whatever certain among the later greeks may have practised and taught in earlier days as we have seen the act of suicide was regarded as a dark and presumptuous deed they truly felt that there was in it something of ἀσέβεια15 something of that ὕβρις which so surely stirred the wrath of heaven and inevitably called down righteous vengeance indeed the evil and malice of suicide did not end with death but continued beyond the grave the umbra of a man who had slain himself was dreaded and feared so in ancient athens it was the custom to cut off the hand of a suicide and to cremate it or at least to bury it far from his body the object of such mutilation being to prevent his ghost from attacking the living16

similar beliefs exist among native african tribes thus the wajagga of east africa dread the spectres of suicides when a man has hanged himself a certain complicated ceremonial becomes imperative they take the rope from his neck and suspend a goat in the noose after which the animal is swiftly slain the idea seems that hereby the phantom will be in some way appeased and he will not be so likely to tempt human beings to follow his evil example17

the baganda of central africa have an even greater horror of the ghosts of suicides and the most elaborate precautions are invariably taken to protect themselves against these dangerous visitors the body of a man who has destroyed himself is removed as far from all human habitation as possible to waste land or to a crossroad and there is utterly consumed with fire next the wood of the house in which the horrid deed has been done is burned to ashes and scattered to the winds whilst if the man has hanged himself upon a tree this is hewn to the ground and committed to the flames trunk roots branches and all even this is hardly deemed to be sufficient curiously enough there is a lurking idea that the ghost of a suicide may survive after the cremation of the body so horrible is this crime felt to be and so irradicated the taint that this terrible deed establishes this is extremely significant since the cases in which cremation a complete purgation and destruction by fire cannot obliterate guilt and

p 148

destroy the evil infection are indeed exceptional and it might be no easy task to find a parallel instance however the baganda when passing by the spot where the body of a suicide has been burned always take good care to pelt it with sticks and clods of earth to prevent the ghost from catching them although these places in particular are dangerous to the last degree there are other graves that may be haunted by phantoms which as they have no bodies are not strictly vampires but which certainly belong to the vampire family such are those remote places where persons who have been accused of black magic and who failed to satisfy the ritual ordeals have been burned to death as also those spots where persons of evil and atrocious life have been cremated or interred18 the maraves a tribe of south africa who also burned witches alive whenever they had occasion to pass the place of doom pelted it with stones and it is said that in some instances of spots considered particularly illomened a regular cairn or tumulus of loose stones has arisen in madagascar too certain solitary graves bear an exceedingly illrepute so that the chance traveller with averted face throws stones at them or large lumps of earth in order to prevent the ghost following in his tracks and seizing on him20 it must be remarked and this is very important that the sticks and stones or heavy clods of earth with which a grave is pelted are not meant merely as a symbolical insult and expression of righteous indignation but are actually missiles which will strike and hurt the being who haunts the spot of interment so since the haunter can be struck and injured by these very material objectsthe heavier they are the betterhe must himself possess a certain concrete substantiality and inasmuch as objects make an impression upon him he must exist under some kind of physical condition doubtless the exact idea is not very clearly defined in the minds of those who are so careful to pelt the grave yet if stones will not merely ward off an attack from the haunter but when in the course of time they become piled up into a small cairn they serve to keep the deceased in his place that is to say in the grave there must be some sort of material entity which can be so materially frustrated and obstructed here then we have the essential and complete vampire

it is recorded by a traveller about the middle of the last

p 149
century that when he was journeying in company with two mussulmans from sidon to tyre as he drew near the latter city he noticed a great pile of stones by the wayside whereupon his companions began to pick up all the loose pebbles that came to hand and discharged them violently at the heap at the same time uttering the most fearful imprecations when they had passed and were at some little distance they explained that a notorious brigand whose hands were stained with the hideous cruelties and innocent blood had been slain there and buried on the spot half a century before the stones they threw and their curses were directed against this villain it might be thought in this case that the missiles were a mark of loathing and contempt but it seems far more probable that they were intended to serve a very utilitarian purpose that is actually to keep off the wretch who would still be haunting the pit into which his body had been cast fifty years since21

it even appears that in many parts of syria when brigands are killed by the highway or vagrom murderers are dispatched in the open country side beyond the walls of a city the body is left to rot unburied where it lies and after a while it is merely covered over with a heap of stones moreover everyone who passes by is bound to quoit a stone or stick to add to the pile under the penalty of incurring some dreadful misfortune it is supposed that heaven will horribly curse the person who fails to throw his flinty tribute as he goes22

it is not only among rude african tribes and in the east that the graves of persons who have led cruel and antisocial lives particularly the spots where suicides have been buried are thus places of execration and fear but in pomerania and in west prussia not to instance many other districts the spots where persons who have wrought their own destruction happen to be interred are regarded as unlucky in the highest degree and there is no more malevolent and harmful spectre than the suicides ghost a man who has destroyed himself must not defile gods acre in no wise may he be buried in the churchyard but at the place where the desperate deed was done and everybody who passes by will cast a stone on the spot unless he wishes the ghost of the suicide to plague him nightly and to give him no rest until he is driven to the same dreadful fate it is said that as in africa piles of sticks

p 150

and stones accumulate to a great size so similar cairns rise upon these haunted spots in the more remote districts along the cold shores washed by the baltic sea

it is not surprising to find that in a country such as russia which through the ages has so often tottered to madness and of late years fallen into stark lunacy during the seventeenth century an epidemic of suicide raged it persisted indeed at spasmodic intervals throughout the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries but it was somewhat earlier than this that the troubles of that luckless nation blazed out in furious frenzy as when the year 1000 approached a fearful apocalyptic mania inflamed many parts of europe and men imagining that the world was about to come to an end that almost any hour any moment the angels clarion would blare heaven and earth shrivel like some parching scroll and the judge be set on his awful throne in their hundreds deserted cities and homes to wander abroad preaching fevered repentance and the most extravagent forms of penance or else in frantic despair abandoned themselves to debauchery and violence so in russia some mad visionary who proclaimed that the crack of doom was appointed for the year 166623 set the whole country aflame with terror in many parts men ceased to labour in the fields relinquished their businesses and all social intercourse barricaded themselves in their houses behind closed windows and fastbarred doors awaiting the end with the gloomiest forebodings as might have been expected great numbers completely lost their senses and scores of dangerous lunatics not only infested the highroad but even invaded villages and towns preaching that the only way to escape the wrath to come was to prevent the final day by selfdestruction they were moreover very willing and eager to help those who shrank from so severe a test and before long red murder was rife in every direction their services however were not required as frequently as might have been supposed for the delirium spread with such alarming rapidity that not merely households but whole communities eagerly devoted themselves to death if in some paroxysm of wild hysteria a man had declared his intention of becoming a martyr for so these poor wretches were deemed the pious duty devolved upon his friends and relations of seeing that he scrupulously fulfilled his vow should he

p 151

wish to change his mind or in any way seek to escape his fate he was pursued and saved in spite of himself by being put to death in the most atrocious torments a veritable reign of terror ensued and northern russia seemed wellnigh depopulated it were superfluous to enter into the horrible details but it may suffice to say that at first starvation was the usual method by which these maniacs committed suicide in the forest of vetlouga one fanatic at huge expense actually built a tower without doors and windows into the body of which persons were lowered through a trap in the roof but this was too long a process it gave space for reflection and with the pangs of hunger reason resumed her sway those within yelled to be released but all in vain to shouts and clamour succeeded groans and fainter lamentations until as the days passed all was still another remedy was found and presently the method which was preferred and which was officially prescribed as safer and more pleasing to god was immolation by fire accordingly the missionaries of this horrible impiety proclaimed safety through the flame as the prophet elias had ascended to heaven in a blazing chariot so the deluded wretches were taught they would ascend to a glorious and delightful eternity from the midst of the conflagration hundreds and even thousands perished in huge holocausts whole areas were strictly enclosed the candidates took their places therein and the compound having been previously drenched with pitch bitumen and inflammable oils torches were applied at many points if any overcome by agony escaped with scorched and blackened limbs they were caught and hurled back into the heart of the pyre these immolations generally took place during the dark winter season and from midnight until the faint streaks of dawn the red glow of these horrid furnaces could be seen in every direction for hundreds of verstas the land became a veritable tophet as the morning broke hordes of wolves attracted by the stench of roasting flesh assembled to pull trunks and limbs from the embers a dark cloud of suffocating smoke greasy with human fat that fouled both ground and houses hung low in the sky and ere many days were past the plague was stalking abroad with fatal voracity it was not until the most vigorous measures had been taken that these terrible practices could be checked and it seems that the

p 152

venom of the madness persisted long and late for as recently as 1860 fifteen persons in the district of olonetz committed suicide by fire whilst during the winter of 18961897 twentyfour religious fanatics buried themselves alive in a pit near tiraspol24 the monk falaley constantly preached that death was mans only means of salvation and that he must have done with this life of sin one night under his influence eightyfour persons congregated near the river perevozinka and began to pray many of them were already halfcrazed through excessive fasting and they almost covered themselves with brambles and brushwood to which fire was to be set at a given signal a woman taking alarm at the thought of so horrible a death escaped and informed the authorities when the police arrived the fanatics shrieked that antichrist was approaching and setting fire to the pile most perished in the flames a few who were rescued received sentences of imprisonment and deportation but a fanatic called souchkoff managed to escape and continued to preach the gospel of death maddened by his doctrine in one locality alone sixty families resolved to commit suicide at a certain moment and a peasant named petroff entering a neighbours house cut down his wife and children with a hatchet in a barn hard by a dozen men with their wives had assembled and amid hymns of triumph they laid their heads upon an improvised block to be hacked off by petroff in another hut a woman and three children were dispatched at their own earnest request at length when he was weary petroff himself kneeled down and was slain by souchkoff between 1860 and 1870 a maniac named chadkin proclaimed that antichrist was here and all most follow him to the forests and there die of hunger a large number assembled and his most devoted followers saw to it that nobody could escape after a few days the sufferings of the crowds were fearful and the place rang with their screams and groans nevertheless chadkin and his apostles did not waver when some poor creature frantic with agony managed to break away and informed the police the devotees at once began to kill all who had gathered together and by the time the authorities had arrived in the utmost haste there were found but three survivors

buddhist monks in china are often recorded to have

sought their nirvana through an act of self immolation by fire and it is said that every year among the lamaresais of tientai in the province of taichow some halfadozen bonzes thus devote themselves to death these unfortunate persons believe that their voluntary destruction crowns the monastery with honours and blessing they are aware that they will be worshipped after their suicide and they suppose that they will become the divinities of the district and possess the power to protect the whole neighbourhood to grant fair weather and lucky seasons a bounteous harvest and all prosperity such public incinerations are conducted with great ceremony and take place upon a major festival which is bound to attract crowds of pilgrims and reverent suppliants to the spot25 it is said that among the eskimo of bering strait a sorcerer has been known to burn himself alive fully believing that thus he will return to life as a shaman with much greater powers and a far fuller knowledge of magic than he had hitherto enjoyed26 it may be remembered that even such low motives as vanity and a craving for mere notoriety have proved an incentive sufficiently powerful to induce men to seek a dramatic if painful death by fire thus the charlatan peregrinus after a career of the most braggart ostentation courted undying fame by selfimmolation upon a pyre at the olympic festival which extraordinary performance attracted throngs not only of sensible persons who despised and mocked him but of encomiasts and apologists who regarded him as at the least a hero if not something nearly approaching to deity27 it can hardly be argued that higher motives inspired empedocles if the account preserved by diogenes laertius28 to which horace29 makes reference be true namely that hoping by a sudden disappearance he might be accounted a god the philosopher flung himself into the crater of mount aetna but that the suicide was revealed owing to the fact that the volcano almost immediately after threw up one of his sandals and thus betrayed the manner of his death

josephus states that the jews used not to bury the bodies of those who had destroyed themselves until after sunset in scotland it is still thought that the body of a suicide will not fall to dust until the time when he should have died in the order of nature30 and it is very generally held that a such

p 154

a one must be buried with the grave facing north and south this belief also existed in england and there are graves facing north and south to be seen at cowden kent and bergholt suffolk which are locally said to be those of persons who have destroyed themselves for it is almost universally declared that christian burial should be with the head in west looking eastward31 as is wellknown in england until the time of george iv it was the general practice to bury suicides at the crossroads where a stake was driven through the body in the year 1823 it was enacted that the body of a suicide should be buried privately between the hours of nine oclock and twelve at night with no religious ceremony in 1882 this law was altered and the body may now be committed to the earth at any time and with such rites or prayers those in charge of the funeral think fit or may be able to procure in certain country places it is still supposed that the spirit of the last person buried in a graveyard has to keep watch lest any suicide should be interred there one explanation of the reason why persons who had taken their own lives should be buried at the crossroads was that the ghosts of murdered persons were supposed to walk until the bodies had been recovered and committed to the churchyard with christian rites and since this was impossible in the case of suicides a stake was driven through them when deposited at the crossroads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad32 it is certain that the idea here is the same as that of driving a stake through the vampire for sometimes this precaution was taken in the case of persons who might perchance become vampires an operation performed not as an indignity but as a preventitive burchard of worms tells us cum aliquis femina parere debit et non potest in ipso dolore si mortem obierit in ipso sepulchro matrem cum infante palo in terram transfigunt and again fecisti quod quaedam mulieres instinctu diaboli facere solent cum aliquis infans sine baptismo mortuus fuerit tollunt cadauer paruuli et ponunt in aliquo secreto loco et palo corpusculum transfigunt dicentes si sic non fecissent quod infantulus surgeret et multos laedere posset the reason for the selected spot of the suicides grave being a crossroad is further explained by the belief that when the ghost or the body issues from the grave and finds that there

in wales it was said that witches slept by day under any boulder that might be at a crossroad and when dusk had fallen they crept forth to steal little children and feast upon their flesh the gallows was often erected at the crossroads and here the criminal hung in chains and nourished by his rotting flesh the mandrake grew many are the superstitions which cluster around the mandrake or mandragorathe semihuman as columella de re rustica x 19 calls it it was the plant of fertility the plant of magical virtue and occult power in germany it bears the name of the little gallows man and it was believed that when a murderer or

thief was hanged and his semen or urine fell to the ground there grew up the mandrake in england the same superstition prevailed and in his pasquil a character of an ugly woman or a hue and cry after beauty 1678 the duke of buckingham wrote imprimis as to her descent some heralds derive her pedigree from that of the scotch barnacles and say that she dropt from some teeming gallows or sprung up like mandrakes from the s of some gibbitid raggamuffian no one must dare uproot the mandrake for it moans and shrieks so fearfully that the digger will die with the yells ringing in his ears a dog is taken and round his tail is tied a string one end of which is attached to the plant a man whose ears are fast stopped with wax and wool tempts the dog away with some dainty as the animal tugs at the cord the mandrake will be pulled from the ground but the poor beast will fall dead at the horrid scream it gives but there has been secured a talisman nay more a familiar

even in the mythology of ceylon the crossroads play an ominous part thus in the yakkun nattanawa which is defined by its translator john callaway as a cingalese poem descriptive of the ceylon system of demonology it is said of the black shedevil thou female devil who acceptest the offerings at the place where three ways meet thou causest the people to be sick by looking upon them at the place where four ways join together the devil mahasohon watches to drink the blood of the elephant in the place where the two and three roads meet together mahasohon is the devil of the tombs therefore go not in the roads by night if you do so you must not expect to escape with your life another devil oddy stands where three ways meet watching and hot for mischief again the devil of the victim watches and looks upon the people and causes them to be sick at the place where three roads meet and where four ways meet

ralstan33 says that it is a common russian belief that at crossroads or in the neighbourhood of cemeteries an animated corpse often lurks watching for some unwary traveller whom it may be able to strangle and devour eagerly quaffing the warm blood from his veins in cornwall today crossroads are most carefully avoided after nightfall34 but this may be because it is commonly accepted that at the crossroads

witches from all the world over assemble for their sabbat it seems more likely that these particular spots are avoided because of the vampires for henry boguet tells us les sorciers tiennet leurs sabbats indifferemet en tons lieux35 bernhard ragner says that if you go to a crossroad between eleven oclock and midnight on christmas eve and listen you will hear what most concerns you for the coming year38 it may be pointed out that this is the one night throughout the year when strange wonders happen it is then that the thorn that sprang at glastonbury from the sacred crown which the holy old man s joseph of arimathea brought with him from palestine when avalon was still an island bourgeons into fragrant blossoms the cornish miners seem to hear the sound of singing choirs that arise from submerged churches by the shore and others said that bells beneath the ground where villages had been upon that eve yearly ring a glad peal at midnight the oxen the cattle and all the beasts kneel and adore as they adored in the stablecave at bethlehem no evil thing hath power and as the officer in hamlet37 tells us

in certain districts of east prussia on christmas eve candles are kept burning all night in the houses and no window is shuttered it is supposed that the spirits of the dead will return in friendlywise and the opportunity is given to them to warm themselves so that on future occasions when they haunt the villages with more malicious intent they may remember those who are kind to them christmas after christmas and spare those houses from molestation and injury38

not only are those who die excommunicate that is to say solemnly and officially cursed by the church liable to become vampires but more those who die under any kind of such ban especially if it be the malison of a parent or if it be a man who has perjured himself in a grave matter and called down upon his own head damnation and all manner of evil should

what he asseverate be untrue the belief in the fearful power of a curse especially the curse of a father or a mother which whether rightfully or wrongfully adjured works out its vengeance through the whole stock of kith and kin involving in misfortunes and destruction innocent and guilty alike finds supreme illustration in the masterpieces of greek tragedy it is the mighty theme of the trilogy of the oresteia for from the very outset of the agamemnon there is a brooding and oppressive sense of multitudinous crimes of sins done long years ago which have swelled and accumulated their guilt like some black cloud of transgressions about to burst over the doomed race in a welter of tragedy and blood the evil wrought by thyestes the crimes of his grandsire tantalus the atrocious banquet of atreus have yet to be expiated in misery in anguish and affliction when the weird trojan woman approaches the threshold she scents the carnage of the shambles and horrors manifold and as the pang of inspiration thrills her she shrieks aloud the furies are in this house bloodsurfeited but not assuaged they hold perpetual revel here it is the crime of atreus and of thyestes which they hunt and woe will follow woe

sophocles also no less fearfully shows us the tale of oedipus and his children the legend of the house of laius whose family was as equally famous among the greeks as the stock of atreus for its overwhelming disasters the bitter fruit of an undying curse which destroyed the whole race laius the son of labdacus had wrought a mighty evil lusting after the beauty of chrysippus the son of pelops with violence he raped the lad who belonged to another and thus had sinned the sin of ὕβρις since he both betrayed anothers love and used brute force in doing so39 for this crime his whole progeny was involved in destruction he married jocasta the sister of creon of thebes and the oracle warned him that his son should kill him when a boy was born to the royal pair they cruelly exposed their child a helpless infant to the

it has seemed worth while thus very briefly and inadequately to review these two great themes of greek tragedy since in both instances they set forth in detail the terrible and relentless working of a curse which it may be said has something of that divine vengeance that visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation and so something of this old greek doctrine was very true for who can foresee the end of the working of a curse even today there are places and there are properties in england which owing to deeds of blood and violence in their acquisition entail some dire misfortune upon all who seek to enjoy and possess them such a place is the ruined abbey of glastonbury and of many another housetintern newstead cowdray waverley barlings croxton durefordthe tale is true de male quaesita non gaudet tertius haeres says the old adage and it is well known that lands wrested from the church will not descend in due course owing to a failure of heirs such a case has come under my own observation and aubrey in his miscellanies cites hinton charterhouse

p 161

on mendip and butleigh near glastonbury as never having passed to the third generation so did cromwells generals and adherents transmit a troubled inheritance to their descendants fairfax house putney had its haunted chamber which was never used

it must be remembered that a solemn curse is not merely an expletive or an imprecatory exclamation perhaps quite meaningless but it is far more than this it is significant and operative the malediction is conceived as having a certain efficacious power and it may be noted that this force if rightly launched does not seem to exhaust itself no more terrible fate could be imagined than for a man to become a vampire and this was the inevitable consequence if he were not cleared of a merited malison the old proverb says

curses are like young chicken
and still come home to roost41

this adage is terribly exemplified in the vampire who is supposed when he returns from his grave first to attack those who on earth have been his nearest and dearest of all curses the parental malediction is most dreaded and curiously enough in macedonia mr abbott tells us that a godfather is regarded with even greater respect than the actual parents and his malediction is dreaded even more than that of a bishop42 at the present day in greece many of the usual imprecations definitely refer to the fact that the person so cursed will become a vampire after death such imprecations as the following are in common use may the earth not receive him νὰ μήν τον δεχτῃ᾽ ἡ γῆς may the ground not consume him νὰ μήν τον φάλῃ τὸ χῶμα may the earth not digest thee ἡ γῆ νὰ μή δε χυνέψῃ may the black earth spew thee up ἡ μαύρη γῆ νά σ᾽ ἀναξεράσῃ mayest thou remain incorrupt να μείνῃς ἄλωμτος may the earth not loose thee which is to say may the body not decompose νὰ μή σε λυώσῃ ἡ γἠ may the ground reject thee νά σε βλάλῃ τὸ χῶμα mayest thou a become in the grave like rigid wood κουτοῦκι νὰ βλῃ᾽ς may the ground reject him wholly τὸ χῶμα ᾽ξεράς᾽ τόνε which last phrase is the most terrible of all since it is nothing other than an unspeakably impious parody of the prayer which is uttered by the mourners at every greek funeral ὁθεὸς ᾽χωρές᾽ τόνε may god forgive him

p 162

since even the curse uttered by a man in moments of anger and impatience may have such terrible effects in greece it is necessary that there should be some expedient which may dissipate and dispel the forces to which these words have given an impetus capable of producing the most serious and horrible results accordingly at a greek deathbed there is carried out a certain ritual to attain this end a vessel of water is brought to the bedside and he throws into it a handful of salt and when this is dissolved the sick man sprinkles with the lymph all those who are present saying as this salt dissolves so may my curses dissolve ὡς λυώνει τ᾽ἀλάτι νὰ λυὡσουν ᾑ κατάραισ μου this ceremony absolves all persons whom he may have cursed in his lifetime from the evil of a ban which after death he would no longer be able to revoke the relations and friends then solemnly forgive the dying man for ought that he may have done against them and all present declare that they bear no grudge nor anger in their hearts it is said that if the passage be a difficult one it is supposed that somebody whom the sick man has injured has not forgiven him if it can be guessed who this may be he is if possible brought to the bedside to declare his forgiveness of any injury he may have suffered if however he be dead a portion of the cerements must be sought and burned to ashes in the bedchamber of the dying person who is fumigated with the smoke these elaborate precautions and the extraordinary care which is taken for it must often be a matter of very great difficulty either to secure the attendance of the living individual or to get hold of a portion of the necessary shroud serve to show what immense importance the modern greek attaches to the absolution from a curse and what horror the thought of a vampire inspires

it is obvious that those who die unbaptized or apostate will be liable to become vampires after death and throughout the south of europe there still persist large numbers of ceremonies and superstitions connected with a christening whose object it is to secure the child a long happy and healthy life

in england as in many other countries it is thought lucky to be born on one of the great church festivals especially if it be a sunday in certain districts of yorkshire even today it is commonly said that sunday children are secure from

p 163

the malice of evil spirits43 again a child born on a saturday although he may have to work hard for his living is considered to enjoy occult powers to have the faculty of second sight to be able to see ghosts and phantoms and indeed to be so attuned to the supernatural that he can never be harmed even by the vampire it is very probable that as saturday is the seventh day of the week those born upon this day are considered as akin to a seventh son who was so popularly believed to possess extraordinary powers of healing and the like the old english rhyme is well known and perhaps the following is one of the most usual forms

mondays child is fair of face
tuesdays child is full of grace
wednesdays child is sour and grum
thursdays child has welcome home
fridays child is free in giving
saturdays child works hard for his living
and the child that is born on christmas day
is great and good and fair and gay

although as we have said in england it is considered am omen of a happy life to be born upon some festival the exact opposite is the case in slav countries44 in greece particularly nothing could be more disastrous and of all seasons christmas day is the most unlucky in many districts it is accounted a terrible thing for any child to be born at any time between christmas and the epiphany such babies are called ἑορτοπιάσματα or feastblasted and after death they will assuredly become vampires even during life such a child is a callicantzaros

the callicantzaros is one of the most extraordinary and most horrible of all the creatures of popular superstition leone allacci says that they only appear and have power during the week from christmas to new years day45 but other authorities extend this time until twelfth night during the rest of the year it is vaguely supposed that they sojourn in some mysterious hades or underworld local traditions differ as to whether they are actually demons or whether they are human allacci who certainly inclines to the latter view says that children born in the octave of christmas are liable to be seized with a terrible mania that they rush to and fro with the most amazing speed that their nails grow to a

p 164

terrible length like the talons of a bird of prey whilst their hands become as crooked claws if they meet any person on the highway they seize him and put the question tow or lead if he answer tow he may escape unharmed but if he be inadvertent enough to reply lead they grip him with terrible force mangle him with their talons and often tear him to pieces devouring him wholemeal46 during the seventeenth century this belief so strongly prevailed that the most cruel precautions were taken in the case of children who might be suspected to be liable to become callicantzari since the soles of their feet were exposed to a fire until the nails were singed and so their claws clipped and even today in parts of greece these practices prevail in a highly modified form for among the ægean islanders it is said that the small callicantzari are particularly prone to attack and devour their own brothers and sisters which is another strong link with the tradition of the vampire who as we have noted before seeks the destruction of his own kin47

it is difficult to convey any idea of the popular notions concerning the appearance of a callicantzaros as almost every local account differs from others in almost every particular for the most part they are considered to be very gaunt48 and of enormous strength on the other hand there are some who are dwarfed and stunted the larger variety generally appear as ineffably hideous monsters with black distorted faces eyes glaring red like fire huge ears such as those of a donkey great gaping mouths furnished with a slobbering scarlet tongue and sharp gleaming teeth from which streams their fetid breath in horrid gusts again the pigmy callicantzaros may appear in the shape of a child but in this case it is usually deformed in some grotesque and painful manner on the other hand they are sometimes harmless hobgoblins full of mischief maybe but objects of laughter rather than fear though they may play many a naughty and tiresome trick not unlike the kobold and the leprechaun a hundred tales are told of their pranks but it is the more gruesome and the fiercer monsters with whom we are mainly concerned since it is from their ranks that the vampire is recruited for most of them become vampires after death a fact which seems to point to their human origin and not infrequently they are supposed to indulge their vampirish

p 165

fancies during life it will be noticed that in the various accounts of the callicantzari there exist many contradictions and we must bear in mind that such diversities are often due to the original conception of these creatures whether they are regarded as demons or monsters who are suffered to plague the countryside for a certain number of days during the christmas season or whether they are regarded as human beings afflicted with a terrible curse the victims of a most horrible possession doomed never to rest not even in the grave

near akin to the latter conception is the werewolf who may be regarded as a man or woman who either of his or her own will through black magic is able to change into the form of a wolf or who in classical times was believed to be so changed owing to the vengeance of the gods and in later days was believed to be so changed owing to the enchantment of a witch or some manner of diabolic possession moreover a werewolf may be a person who without any actual metamorphosis is obsessed with all the savage passions and ferocity of a wolf so that he will attack human beings in the same way as the actual wild animal

it may be asked is it possible that a person should be so transformed henry kramer and james sprenger the learned authors of the supremely authoritative malleus maleficarum in discussing the question distinctly answer no it is not possible they allow that by horrid charms and spells a certain subjective delusion or glamour may be caused so that by the evil art of a sorcerer a man may appear to himself and to all others who gaze upon him to be a wolf or indeed another kind of animal but there cannot be any actual physical change of a man into an animal this glamour or ocular illusion is sometimes known as sightshifting a convenient correlative to the accepted term shapeshifting which is conceived of as an objective fact moreover in his de ciuitate dei xviii 18 s augustine says nor can the devils create anything whatever shows of theirs produce these doubts but only cast a changed shape over that which god has made altering only in show nor do i think the devil can form any soul or body into bestial or brutal members and essences but they have an unspeakable way of transporting mans phantasy in a bodily shape unto other senses this though it be not corporal yet seems to carry itself in corporal

p 166

forms through all these things while the bodies of the men thus affected lie in another place being alive but yet in an ecstasy far more deep than any sleep now this phantasy may appear unto other senses in a bodily shape and a man may seem to himself to be such an one as he often thinks himself to be in his dream and to bear burdens which if they be true burdens indeed the devils bear them to delude mens eyes with the appearance of true burdens and false shapes we must bear in mind that these explanations come from the highest authority one of the greatest doctors of the church and will i think very fairly cover most of the cases of the werewolf

in early days it was recognized that a werewolf might be a person who was afflicted with a horrible mania and marcellus sidetes who lived in the reigns of hadrian and antoninus pius circa ad 117161 wrote περὶ λυκανθρώπου a long medical poem in greek hexameter verse consisting of fortytwo books of which only a couple of fragments remain he says that lycanthropy is a disease a kind of insanity or mania when the patient was afflicted with hideous appetites the ferocity and other qualities of a wolf he further tells us that men are attacked with this madness chiefly in the beginning of the year and become most furious in february retiring for the night to lone cemeteries and living precisely in the manner of ravening wolves

under lycanthropia burton49 notes as follows lycanthropia which avicenna calls cucubuth others lupinam insaniam or wolfmadness when men run howling about graves and fields in the night and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves or some such beasts aetius lib 6 cap 11 and paulus lib 3 cap 16 call it a kind of melancholy but i should rather refer it to madness as most do some make a doubt of it whether there be any such disease donat ab altomari cap 9 art med saith that he saw two of them in his time wierus de praestig daemonum 1 3 cap 21 tells a story of such a one at padua 1541 that would not believe to the contrary but that he was a wolf

he hath another instance of a spaniard who thought himself a bear forrestus obseruat lib 10 de morbis cerebri cap 15 confirms as much by many examples one amongst the rest of which he was an eyewitness at alcmaer in holland a poor

husbandman that still hunted about graves and kept in churchyards of a pale black ugly and fearful look    this malady saith avicenna troubleth men most in february and is nowadays frequent in bohemia and hungary according to heurnius cap de man schernitzius will have it common in livonia they lie hid most part all day and go abroad in the night barking howling at graves and deserts they have usually hollow eyes scabbed legs and thighs very dry and pale ulcerata crura sitis ipsis adest immodica pallidi lingua sicca saith altomarus cap 9 art hydrophobia he gives a reason there of all the symptoms and sets down a brief cure of them it is remarkable that most of these features are found in the vampire especially the unquenchable thirst sitis immodica which is emphasized by the famous physician antonio donato altomari who was one of the most learned authorities of his day it is also remarkable that the malady is reported as being very prevalent in bohemia hungary and livonia countries in which the vampire is most frequently found there is in fact a very close connexion between the werewolf and the vampire and the lycanthropist is liable to become a vampire when he dies

in parts of greece particularly in elis50 it is said that even those who eat the flesh of a sheep that has been killed by a wolf are apt to become vampires after their death and this serves to show how powerful the pollution of the werewolf was supposed to be in norse saga ingiald the son of king aunund was timid whilst a boy but after eating the heart of a wolf he gained strength and courage and became the boldest of heroes51 it might be thought that so far from inspiring a person with a thirst for blood the flesh of a sheep would homœopathically infuse qualities of gentleness and indeed the abipones of paraguay were most careful to avoid mutton lest it should make them slack and fearful in the fight52 but in this instance it will be seen that the characteristics of a sheep have been absorbed so to speak and infected by the ferocity of the wolf curiously enough in uganda the baganda greatly fear the ghosts of sheep which they believe would return and kill a man if they saw him give them the fatal blow hence when a sheep is to be killed one man occupies its attention in some way and another whose presence the animal must not suspect swiftly slaughters it before

p 168

a glimpse of him can be caught in this way the sheep is tricked because the ghost does not know whom to haunt and punish for its death moreover sheep give health and protection to cattle and a ram is almost invariably sent into the pastures with a herd of cows should a sheep die in a house nobody must dare openly to mention the fact which may only be alluded to in the most covert and circumlocutionary phrase for were anyone to say the sheep is dead its ghost sorely angered would assuredly afflict the unlucky speaker with some disease and possibly even kill him outright53 it is worth noting that among the ancient greeks it was thought that any garment made from the fleece of a sheep which had been worried or torn by a wolf would have a bad effect upon the wearer and set up some roseola and an intense irritation of the skin54 it is certainly curious to note the whole mass of tradition which as it would seem the wide world over is connected with the sheep and in particular when this animal has been attacked or slain by a wolf

even as some kind of vampirish infection was held to proceed from the wolf the vampire himself will even more strongly convey this taint and therefore unless the most drastic and immediate remedies are applied a person who is attacked by a vampire and whose blood has been sucked will become a vampire in turn imbued with a craving to pass on the horrible pollution this is perhaps and with good reason the most dreaded quality of the vampire and examples thereof occur again and again in legend and history

it is far more curious that it should be thought that those over whose dead bodies a cat or any other animal has passed should become vampires this belief widely exists amongst slavonic peoples and is to be found in some parts of greece it also prevails in china where a cat is never allowed to enter a room with a corpse for the body still contains the kuei the lower or inferior soul of yin original and by leaping over it the cat will impart something of its original savage or tigerish nature and the dead man may become a vampire55 it should be explained that it is a common belief among the chinese that there are two souls the higher soul which after death seeks the divine life the heavenly source of its being and the lower soul which is gross returning to the

p 169

earth and dwelling in the grave until the complete dissolution of the corpse

it is believed among slavonic nations as it was firmly believed throughout england and in many districts of france that witches turn themselves into cats and among the oraons or uraons a primitive hill tribe of bengal we have a vampire cat who is a chordewa a witch who is able to change her soul into a black cat and who then visits and frequents the houses where there are sick and dying people such a cat has a peculiar way of mewing quite differently from the noise of other cats and is easily recognized it steals quietly into a house almost like a shadow leaps lightly on the bed eats of the food that has been prepared for the sick man and gently licks his lips when it is able to accomplish this latter the invalid has no chance of recovering in which connexion we must remember as has been remarked before that the soul is supposed to take its departure from the mouth of a dying person even if this cat be seen it is extraordinarily difficult to catch it since it has a supernatural activity and will fight and scratch with the malice of a demon however they say that persons have sometimes succeeded and then the woman out of whom the cat her soul has come remains insensible in a state of coma as deep as death until the cat reenters her body any wound inflicted upon the cat is produced upon her for example if they cut it or break a leg or destroy its sight the woman will simultaneously suffer the same mutilation so great a horror had the oraons of these witches that formerly they used to burn any person that was suspected to be a chordewa56

it is a circumstance of very frequent occurrence in the witch trials of all countries that a witch who has appeared in the likeness of a cat a hare or any other animal and has met with an accident or been mutilated under that form is found to be marked with the same wound or to be suffering from the same harm in her human shape when this is resumed57

it is not difficult then to see why if some animal of illomenand the cat seems to be particularly unfortunateleaps over a corpse the dead person should be considered in danger of becoming a vampire in greece particularly in macedonia the most pious care is taken to prevent any such calamity the body is watched all night long by relatives and friends

p 170

and this is deemed a work of true charity by which they acquire great merit it brings a blessing upon their own souls ψυκικό if in spite of all their care some cat does jump across the body the dead man must be pierced through with two long sackneedles σακκορράφαισ in order to secure his rest and to guard against his return it is well to scatter mustard seed on the roof and on the threshold and the wise man will barricade his door with brambles and thorns should the vampire return he cannot fail to occupy himself with counting the seeds and it will be dawn when he must return to his grave long before he completes the tale should he endeavour to pass through the bushes he will inevitably be caught and held fast by the briars ralston tells us that the serbs and the bulgarians keep this vigil even more carefully than the greeks in some places the jumping of a boy over the corpse is considered as fatal as that of a cat the flight of a bird above the body may also be attended by the same terrible results and so mayin the ukrainethe mere breath of the wind from the steppe58 what is extremely curious is that this tradition still lingers in the north of england and if a cat or dog pass over a corpse the animal must be killed at once the reason for this has been entirely forgotten but the survival is very remarkable as showing that once there existed a dread of vampires in england which today is entirely forgotten thomas pennant says that in scotland no dog or cat must be allowed to leap over the corpse or enter the room it is reckoned so ominous their doing so that the poor animal is killed without mercy59 it is even still the custom that all animals shall be shut up till the funeral procession has left it is believed that a cat will not remain in the house with an unburied corpse and rooks we know will abandon the place till after the funeral if the rookery be near the mansion the explanation given by john jamieson60 that if a cat has leapt over a corpse the first person on to whose lap he may afterwards jump or who may take him up in his arms is stricken with blindness would seem to be a later invention a reason made up to explain the illomen when the vampire tradition had disappeared and so the real reason had been entirely forgotten

having investigated the various reasons why any person

p 171

should become a vampire and discussed the fatal accident which may bring about this terrible doom various points present themselves which invite some inquiry although the belief varies in different parts of the world and it is generally understood that vampires only operate by night as king david says61 non timebis a timore nocturno thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night yet it is also supposed that under certain conditions vampires may wander abroad during the day and that the vampire truly is daemonium meridianum the noonday devil therefore we may ask by what signs if any is a vampire to be recognized again how does a vampire leave his grave for we must remember that the vampire is tangible and can make his presence felt in a very unmistakable and terrible manner this difficulty has been very clearly stated by dom calmet who writes as follows how can a corpse which is covered with four or five feet of earth which has no room even to move or to stretch a limb which is wrapped in linen cerements enclosed in a coffin of wood how can it i say seek the upper air and return to the world walking upon the earth so as to cause those extraordinary effects which are attributed to it and after all that how can it go back again into the grave when it will be found fresh incorrupt full of blood exactly like a living body can it be maintained that these corpses pass through the earth without disturbing it just as water and the damps which penetrate the soil or which exhale therefrom without perceptibly dividing or cleaving the ground it were indeed to be wished that in the histories of the return of vampires which have been related a certain amount of attention had been given to this point and that the difficulty had been something elucidated

let us suppose that these corpses do not actually stir from their tombs that only the ghosts or spirits appear to the living wherefor do these phantoms present themselves and what is it that energizes them is it actually the soul of the dead man which has not yet departed to its final destination or is it a demon who causes them to be seen in an assumed and phantastical body and if there bodies are spectral how do they suck the blood of the living we are enmeshed in a sad dilemma when we ask if these apparitions are natural or miraculous

p 172

a priest who is recognized as possessing intellectual qualities far beyond the ordinary told me that some little time since when he was travelling in moravia mgr jeanin a canon of the cathedral of olmutz asked for his company to a village named liebava which the good canon was officially about to visit as commissary of the episcopal court to investigate the wellauthenticated reports concerning a vampire who had recently caused much trouble and disorder in the village liebava

they journeyed thither witnesses were cited and heard the ordinary canonical procedure was observed in every detail the witnesses gave evidence that a certain wellknown citizen who had formerly resided at liebava after his death had sorely tormented the whole district inasmuch as for a space of three or four years he had issued forth from the cemetery and had entered several houses it was true these visitations were now ceased because a certain hungarian who passed through the village at the time when the terror was at its height avowed that he could cope with the evil and lay the vampire to rest in order to fulfil his promise he mounted the clocktower of the church and watched for the moment when the vampire came out of his grave leaving behind him in the tomb his shroud and cerements before he made his way to the village to plague and terrify the inhabitants

when the hungarian from his coin of vantage had seen the vampire depart on his prowl he promptly descended from the tower possessed himself of the shroud and linen carrying them off with him back to the belfry the vampire in due course returned and not finding his sereclothes cried out mightily against the thief who from the top of the belfry was making signs to him that he should climb and recover his windingsheet if be wished to get it back again the vampire accordingly began to clamber up the steep stair which led to the summit of the tower but the hungarian suddenly gave him such a blow that he fell from top to bottom thereupon they were able to strike off his head with the sharp edge of a sextons spade and that made an end of the whole business

the priest who related this history to me himself saw nothing of these happenings neither was anything witnessed

p 173

by the right reverend canon who was acting as episcopal commissioner they only received the reports of the peasants of that district a folk who were very ignorant very credulous very superstitious and brimful of all kinds of wonderful stories concerning the aforesaid vampire

for my part i think the whole history vain and utterly without foundation and the more absurd and contradictory are the various tales which were told the more strongly am i confirmed in the opinion which i have formed

supposing indeed there were any truth in the accounts of these appearances of vampires are they to be attributed to the power of god to the angels to the souls of those who return in this way or to the devil if we adopt the last hypothesis it follows that the devil can endue these corpses with subtilty and bestow upon them the power of passing through the earth without any disturbances of the ground of gliding through the cracks and joints of a door of slipping through a keyhole of increasing of diminishing of becoming rarified as air or water to penetrate the earth in fine of enjoying the same properties as we believe will be possessed by the blessed after the resurrection and which distinguished the human body of our lord after the first easter day inasmuch as he appeared to those to whom he would show himself for jesus cometh the doors bein shut and stood in the midst and said peace be to you jesus uenit ianuis clausis s john xx 26

yet even if it be allowed that the devil can reenergize dead bodies and give them movement for a certain time can he also bestow these powers of increasing diminishing becoming rarified and so subtle that they can penetrate the earth doors windows we are not told that god allows him the exercise of any such power and it is hard to believe that a material body gross and substantial can be endowed with this subtility and spirituality without some destruction or alteration of the general structure and without damage to the configuration of the body but this would not be in accord with the intention of the devil for such a change would prevent this body from appearing from manifesting itself from motion and speech ay indeed from being eventually cut to pieces and burned as so often happens in the case of vampires in moravia poland and silesia63

p 174

these difficulties which dom calmet with little perception has raised can be very briefly answered and they are not only superficial but also smack of heterodoxy in the first place the story that he tells is far from satisfactory and even if it werewhat it may bemuch exaggerated one can hardly brush aside the vast vampire tradition because one instance proves to be overdrawn in any case the business of the watcher from the belfry and the demand that the vampire should regain his shroud by climbing the stairs to the top of the tower do not bear the mark of truth but what is certainly significant is that the vampire was decapitated and that then the hauntings ceased i conceive that the story of the cerements is mere elaboration but that the grave of the vampire was traced opened and that his head was severed from his body this eliminates some highly charged details whilst it does not touch the facts of the case so we see that the story when divested of these trappings offers nothing impossible that is to say nothing extraordinary or unusual in such histories

dom calmet asks are the appearances of vampires to be attributed to god or to the souls of those who return or to the devil i answer that for the hauntings of a vampire three things are necessary the vampire the devil and the permission of almighty god just as we know for we learn this from the malleus maleficarum that there are three necessary concomitants of witchcraft and these are the devil a witch and the permission of almighty god part 1 so are these three necessary concomitants of vampirism whether it be the demon who is energizing the corpse64 or whether it be the dead man himself who by some dispensation of divine providence has returned is a particular which must be decided severally for each case so much then for dom calmets question to whom are the appearances of vampires to be attributed

can the devil endow a body with these qualities of subtilty rarification increase and diminishing so that it may pass through doors and windows i answer that there is no doubt the demon can do this and to deny the proposition is hardly orthodox for s thomas says of the devil that just as he can from the air compose a body of any form and shape and assume it so as to appear in it visibly so in the same way

p 175

he can clothe any corporeal thing with any corporeal form so as to appear therein moreover almost any séance will be sufficient reply to dom calmets question in his modern spiritism 1904 mr t godfrey raupert says photographs or small drawingroom ornaments have thus been seen to change their places and articles kept in a room other than that occupied by the sensitive have been brought through closed doors and deposited at a spot previously indicatedin some instances placed into the hands of the person requesting the apport of the article many such remarkable instances of apport and of matter passing through matter have been observed under the strictest possible test conditions and will be found recorded in the late leipzig professor zoellners deeply interesting work transcendental physics the writer has himself observed one instance of this kind in a private house and in circumstances entirely precluding the possibility of deception there is perhaps no phenomenon which so distinctly exhibits the action of extraneous and independent intelligence as this one pp 3536 matter then can pass through matter and the séance answers dom calmet we may if we will adopt the ectoplasmic theory to explain the mode whereby the vampire issues from his grave but although this is very probably true in some instances at all events it is not necessarily the only solution of the problem according to catholic theologians evil spirits if permitted to materialize their invisible presence to build up a tangible and active body do not absolutely require the ectoplasm of some medium

not very dissimilar to the dilemma of dom calmet are the views hold by an eminent authority dr herbert mayo who was sometime senior surgeon of middlesex hospital professor of anatomy and physiology in kings college professor of comparative anatomy in the royal college of surgeons london in his wellknown work on the truths contained in popular superstitions he devotes his second letter or rather chapter to vampyrism concerning which he says the proper place of this subject falls in the midst of a philosophical disquisition but he adds for the benefit of the inquirer that it is a point on which in my time schoolboys much your juniors entertained decided opinions he continues to inform us that during the middle of the eighteenth

p 176

century vampyrism spread like a pestilence through servia and wallachia causing numerous deaths and disturbing all the land with fear of the mysterious visitation against which no one felt himself secure

here is something like a good solid practical popular delusion do i believe it to be sure i do the facts are matter of history the people died like rotten sheep and the cause and method of their dying was in their belief what has just been stated you suppose then they died frightened out of their lives as men have died whose pardon has been proclaimed when their necks were already on the block of the belief that they were going to die well if that were all the subject would still be worth examining but there is more in it than that he then gives an account in very full detail of a vampire at belgrade in the year 1732 he describes the circumstances in which the body was disinterred it leaned to one side the skin was fresh and ruddy the nails grown long and evilly crooked the mouth slobbered with blood from its last nights repast accordingly a stake was driven through the chest of the vampire who uttered a terrible screech whilst blood poured in quantities from the wound then it was burned to ashes moreover a number of other persons throughout the district had been infected with vampirism of the facts there can be no question whatsoever the documents are above suspicion and in particular the most important of these which was signed by three regimental surgeons and formally countersigned by a lieutenantcolonel and sublieutenant even dr mayo is obliged to allow no doubt can be entertained of its authenticity or of its general fidelity the less that it does not stand alone but is supported by a mass of evidence to the same effect it appears to establish beyond question that where the fear of vampyrism prevails and there occur several deaths in the popular belief connected with it the bodies when disinterred weeks after burial present the appearance of corpses from which life has only recently departed it is very instructive to note how the writer proceeds with the greatest subtility and no little cleverness to extract himself from logical consequences it might have seemed impossible to avoid and how he explains an exceptional circumstance by circumstances which are far more

p 177

amazing and difficult to believe with the utmost suavity and breadth of mind he continues what inference shall we draw from this factthat vampyrism is true in the popular senseand that these freshlooking and wellconditioned corpses had some mysterious source of preternatural nourishment that would be to adopt not to solve the superstition let us content ourselves with a notion not so monstrous but still startling enough that the bodies which were found in the socalled vampyr state instead of being in a new or mystical condition were simply alive in the common way or had been so for some time subsequently to their interment that in short they were the bodies of persons who had been buried alive and whose life where it yet lingered was finally extinguished through the ignorance and barbarity of those who disinterred them    we have thus succeeded in interpreting one of the unknown terms in the vampyrtheorem the suspicious character who had some dark way of nourishing himself in the grave turns out to be an unfortunate gentleman or lady whom his friends had buried under a mistake while he was still alive and who if they afterwards mercifully let him alone died sooner or later either naturally or of the premature intermentin either case it is to be hoped with no interval of restored consciousness i submit that dr mayo has not succeeded in solving any difficulty at all connected with vampirism no doubt as we have already considered in some detail cases of premature burial which were far more common than was generally supposed would have helped to swell the tradition but that they can have originated it is impossible and it is absurd to put forward the terrible accident of premature burial as an explanation to cover all the facts it is quite impossible that a person who had been interred when in a coma or trance should have survived in the grave

before we deal with the signs by which it is reputed a vampire may be recognized the method in which a vampire presumably leaves his grave and the way by which a vampire may be released or destroyed we will briefly inquire into dr mayos explanation of the actual visit of the vampire to a victim and the subsequent consequences the terrible anæmia and hæmoplegia which may result in death followed by the vampire infection and here we find that dr mayo

p 178

quite honestly and frankly confesses that he is completely at a loss to give any solution of the difficulty it is most instructive to read those inconclusive pleas which he is driven to put forward but which his own good sense cannot accept he writes the second element which we have yet to explain is the vampyr visit and its consequencesthe lapse of the party visited into deathtrance there are two ways of dealing with this knot one is to cut it the other to untie it

it may be cut by denying the supposed connexion between the vampyr visit and the supervention of deathtrance in the second party nor is the explanation thus obtained devoid of plausibility there is no reason why deathtrance should not in certain persons and places be epidemic then the persons most liable to it would be those of weak and irritable nervous systems again a first effect of the epidemic might be further to shake the nerves of weaker subjects these are exactly the persons who are likely to be infected with imaginary terrors and to dream or even to fancy they have seen mr or mrs such a one the last victim of the epidemic the dream or impression upon the senses might again recur and the sickening patient have already talked of it to his neighbours before he himself was seized with deathtrance on this supposition the vampyr visit would sink into the subordinate rank of a mere premonitory symptom

to myself i must confess this explanation the best i am yet in a position to offer appears barren and jejune and not at all to do justice to the force and frequency or as tradition represents the matter the universality of the vampyr visit as a precursor of the victims fate imagine how strong must have been the conviction of the reality of the apparition how common a feature it must have been to have led to the laying down of the unnatural and repulsive process customarily followed at the vampyrs grave as the regular and proper preventive of ulterior consequences dr mayo proposes therefore to try and untie this knot a result which he singularly fails to achieve he quite erroneously states in popular language it was the ghost of the vampyr that haunted its future victim this is exactly what the vampire is not as we have seen there is some divergence of view whether the vampire is the actual person energized with some horrible mystical life in death

p 179

who visits his victims and there can be no doubt at all that this is the true and proper vampire or whether it is a demon who animates and informs the body but in no circumstances whatsoever is the vampire a phantom or ghost save by a quite inadmissible extension of the term which then may practically be regarded as indeed it is often most mistakenly and reprehensively regarded as covering almost any malignant supernatural phenomenon so an explanation which confuses a vampire with a ghost is entirely impertinent

we will now proceed to inquire into those physical traits by which a vampire may be discerned

a vampire is generally described as being exceedingly gaunt and lean with a hideous countenance and eyes wherein are glinting the red fire of perdition when however he has satiated his lust for warm human blood his body becomes horribly puffed and bloated as though he were some great leech gorged and replete to bursting cold as ice or it may be fevered and burning as a hot coal the skin is deathly pale but the lips are very full and rich blub and red the teeth white and gleaming and the canine teeth wherewith he bites deep into the neck of his prey to suck thence the vital streams which reanimate his body and invigorate all his forces appear notably sharp and pointed often his mouth curls back in a vulpine snarl which bares these fangs a gaping mouth and gleaming teeth says leone allacci and so in many districts the harelipped are avoided as being certainly vampires in bulgaria it is thought that the vampire who returns from the tomb has only one nostril and in certain districts of poland he is supposed to have a sharp point at the end of his tongue like the sting of a bee it is said that the palms of a vampires hands are downy with hair65 and the nails are always curved and crooked often wellnigh the length of a great birds claw the quicks dirty and foul with clots and gouts of black blood his breath is unbearably fetid and rank with corruption the stench of the charnel dr henry more in his an antidote against atheism iii ix tells us that when johannes cuntius an alderman of pentsch in silesia and a witch returned as a vampire he much tormented the parson of the parish one evening when this theologer was sitting with his wife and children about him exercising himself in musick according

p 180

to his usual manner a most grievous stink arose suddenly which by degrees spread itself to every corner of the room here upon he commends himself and his family to god by prayer the smell nevertheless encreased and became above all measure pestilently noisom insomuch that he was forced to go up to his chamber he and his wife had not been in bed a quarter of an hour but they find the same stink in the bedchamber of which while they are complaining one to another out steps the spectre from the wall and creeping to his bedside breathes upon him an exceeding cold breath of so intolerable stinking and malignant a scent as is beyond all imagination and expression here upon the theologer good soul grew very ill and was fain to keep his bed his face belly and guts swelling as if he had been poysoned whence he was also troubled with a difficulty of breathing and with a putrid inflamation of his eyes so that he could not well use them of a long time after66 in the malleus maleficarum part ii qn 1 ch 11 the following is related in the territory of the black forest a witch was being lifted by a gaoler on to the pile of wood prepared for her burning and said i will pay you and blew into his face and he was at once afflicted with a horrible leprosy all over his body and did not survive many days boguet discours des sorciers gives as his rubric to chapter xxv si les sorciers tuent de leur souffle  haleine he tells us les sorciers tuent  endommagent de lour souffle  haleine en quoy clauda gaillard dicte la fribolette nous seruita de tesmoignage car ayant soufflé contre clauda perrier quelle rencontra en leglise debouchoux tout aussi test ceste femme tomba malade  fut rendue impotente  en fin mourut apres auoir trainé par lespace dvn an en toute pauurieté  langueur de mesme aussi comme marie perrier luy eut vne fois refusé laumosne elle luy souffla fort rudement contre de façon quo marie tomba par terre  sestant releuée ause peine elle demeura malade par quelques iours  iusques à tant que pierre perrier son neueu out menacé la sorciere

sinistrari in his demoniality 24 says that if we ask how it is possible that the demon who has no body yet can perform actual coitus with man or woman most authorities answer that the demon assumes or animates the corpse of another human being male or female as the case may be and delrio

some remoter country districts indeed are apt to regard any poor wretch who is sadly deformed as a vampire especially if the distortion be altogether unsightly prominent or grotesque it has even been known that a peasant whose face was deeply marked with winecoloured pigment owing it was thought to some accident which befell his mother during her late pregnancy67 was shunned and suspected of being a malignant vrykolakas chorea they say is a certain sign of vampirism and it may be remarked that in shoa this disorder is regarded as the result of demoniacal possession or due to the magic spell of an enemys shadow having fallen upon the sufferer68 an epileptic there is also often considered as being in the power of some devil and unless proper precautions are taken he will assuredly not rest in his grave the vampire is endowed with strength and agility more than human and he can run with excessive speed outstripping the wind

it is curious to find that in many countries persons with blue eyes are considered extremely liable to become vampires69 this is the case in some parts of greece but there does not seem to be preserved any oral tradition to explain the particular belief it may of course have arisen owing to the fact that persons with eyes of this colour would seldom if over have been met with and a stranger with blue eyes would be regarded with wonder and awe thus in ireland persons with bluishgrey eyes especially if there be a streak of black on the pupil which is common are accounted to have the power of seeing ghosts we cannot i think connect the greek idea with the homeric epithet for the goddess athene γλαυκῶπις which has been rendered brighteyed70 greyeyed or blueeyed an old interpretation that proves utterly erroneous since there can be no doubt that γλαυκῶπις means owlfaced γλαύξ and originally athene was a deity who was literally imagined and represented as having the face of an owl even if she did not as is most probable

p 182

actually appear in the shape of an owl among the australian aborigines the owl is regarded as a sex totem of women and is most jealously protected by them71 we find too that the owl is a sacred bird among the indians of northwest america and in their ritual dances a solemnity revealed to them as they suppose by their guardian spirits wherein they mime ancient story the masqueraders often personate by dress voice and gesture the owl the dukwally ie lokoala and other tamanawas72 performances are exhibitions intended to represent incidents connected with their mythological legends   an indian for instance who has been consulting with his guardian spirit which is done by going through the washing and fasting process before described will imagine or think he is called upon to represent the owl he arranges in his mind the style of dress the number of performers the songs and dances or other movements and having the plan perfected announces at a tamanawas meeting that he has had a revelation which he will impart to a select few these are then taught and drilled in strict secrecy and when they have perfected themselves will suddenly make their appearance and perform before the astonished tribe73 the owl gives mystic qualities for in northern india it is believed that a man who eats the eyes of an owl will be able to see even as that bird in the dark74 in nigeria the owl is regarded with great awe and the natives tremble even to pronounce its name on account of the ill omen preferring to speak of the bird that makes one afraid75 it may be remembered that vampires are credited with being able to see in the dark and that in many countries peasants dread to utter the word employing some elaborate and often not very intelligible periphrasis

those whose hair is red of a certain peculiar shade are unmistakably vampires it is significant that in ancient egypt as manetho tells us human sacrifices were offered at the grave of osiris and the victims were redhaired men who were burned their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowingfans it is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest redhair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn but these men were called typhonians and were representatives not of osiris but of his evil rival typhon whose hair

p 183

was red76 francesco redi says fra gli egizii era tradizione che tifone il genio della distruzione simile al arimane persiano al satano ebriaco fosse di pelo rosso forse per memoria di invasioni di barbari di pelo rosso e presso noi dura tutta via la tradizione guardati dal pelo rosso nè valse a toglierla la barba rossa del redentore77 red was the colour of the hair of judas iscariot78 and of cain and an old latin rhyme of the thirteenth century has

monet nos haec fabula rufos euitare
quos color et fama notat illis sociare

the italians say

capelli rossi
o tutto foco o tutto mosci

john wodroephe in the spared hours of a soldier in hie travels dort 1623 quotes garde toi bien des hommes rousseaux des femmes barbues et des ceux qui sont marqués an visage70 i have not met with the following tradition save orally but it is believed in serbia bulgaria and rumania that there are certain redpolled vampires who are called children of judas and that these the foulest of the foul kill their victim with one bite or kiss which drains the blood as it were at a single draught the poisoned flesh of the victim is wounded with the devils stigmata three hideous scars shaped thus xxx signifying the thirty pieces of silver the price of blood

it is curious to note that the ancient ideas of the physiognomy of amorous persons are not at all unlike the distinctive marks of the vampire the old belief has thus been summed up by g tourdes aphrodisie dictionnaire encyclopédique des sciences médicales the erotic temperament has been described as marked by a lean figure white and wellranged teeth a developed hairy system a characteristic voice air and expression and even a special odour

since the vampire bites his prey with sharp teeth and greedily sucks forth the blood it is not surprising to find that those who are born with teeth in their heads are considered to be already marked down as vampires even in countries where the vampire belief was lost this circumstance was considered of the unluckiest80 and in chapman and shirleys81

chabot admiral of france v 2 master advocate exposing the villainies of the chancellor declares he was born with teeth in his head by an affidavit of his midwife to note his devouring and hath one toe on his left foot crooked and in the form of an eagles talon to foretel his rapacity what shall i say branded marked and designed in his birth for shame and obloquy which appeareth further by a mole under his right ear with only three witchs hairs in it strange and ominious predictions of nature according to allacci those children who were thought likely to become callicantzari were taken to a fire which had been lighted in the marketsquare and here the soles of their feet were held to the flames until the nails were singed and the danger of their attacks averted the allusion in chabot to the toe on his left foot crooked and in the form of an eagles talon is particularly interesting in this connexion it is evident that the old physical characteristics which mark a creature of demoniacal propensities had been remembered as of illomen and horror when exactly what they portended and betrayed had been lost in the mists of ancient lore moreover it should be noted that persons and animals attack with the hands or the claws not generally with the feet to scratch and rend accordingly the custom in the days even of allacci was practised but not understood and it points to some belief reaching back to old greek mythology it is probably some link between the callicantzaros and the centaurs as lawson suggests in wellfounded detail

the vampire is as we have said generally believed to embrace his victim who has been thrown into a trancelike sleep and after greedily kissing the throat suddenly to bite deep into the jugular vein and absorb the warm crimson blood it has long since been recognized by medicopsychologists that there exists a definite connexion between the fascination of blood and sexual excitation owing to custom to inhibitions and education this emotion generally remains latent although a certain mental sadism is by no means a mark of degeneracy dr havelock ellis says it is probable that the motive of sexual murders is nearly always to shed blood and not to cause death82 an extremely significant fact since the vampire is generally held to seize the throat it is very striking that leppmann83 points out

p 185

that such murders are almost always produced by wounds in the neck or mutilation of the abdomen never by wounds of the head

paul denjoy defines the kiss as a bite and a suction84 and a high authority says the impulse to bite is also a part of the tactile element which lies at the origin of kissing85 the tactile kiss which doubtless is very primitive has developed into the olfactory and gustatory extending thence into many elaborations and variants under the stress of strong sexual emotion when love is closely knit with pain there is often an overwhelming tendency to bite the partner of the act and the lovebite is often referred to in latin literature thus plautus pseudolus i 1 ll 6266 speaks of amorous dalliance

many further passages from the older latin poets might be quoted and amongst the moderns joannes secundus86 and jean bonnefons87 have not neglected to celebrate the lovebite in their verses from the latter it will suffice to cite the elegant basium iv execratur dentes quibus inter osculandum papillas dominae laeserat which commences

o dens improbe dire ter sceleste
dens sacerrime dens inauspicate
tun tantum scelus ausus ut papillas
illas pancharidis meae papillas
quas uenus ueneratur et cupido
feris morsibus ipse uulnerares

of joannes secundus the basium vii in the basium liber is very celebrated

sic uellicare linguam

the supplementum lexicorum eroticorum linguae latinae paris 1911 has morsiunculaegallice suçons much oriental erotic literature gives attention to this subject the indian kama sutra of vatsyayana devotes no less than one chapter to the lovebite and there are many references to be found in such manual as the arabic perfumed garden of the sheik nefzaoui when it is borne in mind how markedly slavonic a tradition is the bite of the vampire it becomes extremely significant to know that biting in amorous embraces is very common among the southern slavs

the peasant women of sicily especially says alonzi88 in the districts where crimes of blood are prevalent often in their affection for their children kiss them violently even biting them and sucking their blood until the infant wails in pain if a child has done wrong they will not only strike it but also bite it fiercely on the face ears or arms till blood flows both men and women often use the threat i will drink

the case of fritz haarmann who was dubbed the hanover vampire was reported in some detail in the news of the world 21st december 1924 under the heading vampires victims haarmann was born in hanover 26th october 1879 the father olle harmann a locomotivestoker was wellknown as a rough crossgrained choleric man whom fritz his youngest son both hated and feared as a youth fritz haarmann was educated at a church school and then at a preparatory school for noncommissioned officers at new breisach it is significant that he was always dull and stupid unable to learn but it appears a good soldier when released from military service owing to illhealth he returned home only to be accused in a short while of offences against children being considered irresponsible for his actions the court sent him to an asylum at hildesheim whence however he managed to escape and took refuge in switzerland later he returned to hanover but the house became unbearable owing to the violent quarrels which were of daily occurrence between him and his father accordingly he enlisted and was

with regard to his demeanour at the trial the contemporary newspapers89 write throughout the long ordeal haarmann was utterly impassive and complacent   the details of the atrocious crimes for which haarmann will shortly pay with his life were extremely revolting all his victims were between 12 and 18 years of age90 and it was proved that accused actually sold the flesh for human consumption he once made sausages in his kitchen and together with the purchaser cooked and ate them   some alienists hold that even then the twentyfour murders cannot possibly exhaust the full toll of haarmanns atrocious crimes and estimate the total as high as fifty with the exception of a few counts the prisoner made minutely detailed confessions and for days the court listened to his grim narrative of how he cut up the bodies of his victims and disposed of the fragments in various ways he consistently repudiated the imputation of insanity but at the same time maintained unhesitatingly that all the murders were committed when he was in a state of trance and unaware of what he was doing this contention was specifically brushed aside by the bench which in its judgement pointed out that according to his own account of what happened it was necessary for him to hold down his victims by hand in a peculiar way before it was possible for him to inflict a fatal bite on their throats such action necessarily involved some degree of deliberation and conscious purpose another account91 says with regard to haarmann the killing of altogether twentyseven young men is laid at his door the horror of the deeds being magnified by the allegation that he sold to customers for consumption the flesh of those he did not himself eat   with haarmann in the dock appeared a younger man his friend hans grans first accused of assisting in the actual murders but now charged with inciting to commit them and with receiving stolen

this is probably one of the most extraordinary cases of vampirism known the violent eroticism the fatal bite in

p 193

the throat are typical of the vampire and it was perhaps something more than mere coincidence that the mode of execution should be the severing of the head from the body since this was one of the efficacious methods of destroying a vampire

certainly in the extended sense of the word as it is now so commonly used fritz haarmann was a vampire in every particular

to return to the more restricted connotation we find that as has been mentioned above dom calmet in his famous work more than once emphasized that his great difficulty in accepting the tradition of the vampire that is to say the vampire proper and not a mere malignant phantom lies in the fact that it is physically impossible for a dead body to leave its grave since he argues if it has corporeity it cannot have subtilty that is to say the power of passing through material objects

accordingly in the second volume of his great treatise he gives as the rubric to chapter lx impossibilité morale que les revenans sortent de leurs tombeaux92 he commences i have already raised a serious objection which is the impossibility that vampires should leave their graves and should return thither without any obvious disturbance of the ground either when they are passing forth or when they are finding their way back again nobody has ever met this difficulty and nobody ever will be able to meet it to maintain that the devil subtilizes and renders unsubstantial the body of the vampire is merely an assertion which is made without any foundation and which is unsustained and untrue

the fluidity of the blood the healthy red colour and the absence of rigidity in the case of vampires are not circumstances which need cause us the slightest wonder any more than the fact that the hair grows and the bodies remain without dissolution it is a matter of daily occurrence that bodies are found which do not crumble to dust and which for a very long time after death preserve the appearance of life this is not in the least surprising in the cases of those who die suddenly without any illness or indeed as the consequence of certain diseases which are wellknown to medical men sicknesses which do not affect the circulation of the blood or the elasticity of the body

p 194

with regard to the growth of hair this is quite a natural condition

one might even compare these facts with the flowers and in general with everything which depends upon the luxuriance of vegetation among the fauna and flora of nature

these objections thus stated may seem very weighty but perhaps if they are impartially examined it may be found that the good benedictine has been a little too dogmatic in his assertions the phenomenon that the soil of the grave was almost invariably undisturbed by the exit of the vampire who further could make his entry through doors and windows without opening or breaking them may yet admit of an explanation which will go far to solve the difficulty don calmet and many others have regarded as insurmountable in the first place it is hardly correct so sweepingly to assert that the ground is wholly undisturbed where careful investigation was made it was generally found that there were discovered four or five little holes or tunnels not much larger indeed than a mans finger which pierced through the earth to a very considerable depth and here perhaps in this one little detail we may find the clue to the whole mystery the wide spread growth of spiritualism has made even the ordinary public fairly familiar with the phenomena of a séance where materialization takes place and where physical forms are solidly built up and disintegrated again within an exceedingly short space of time this is done by some power or entity which awails itself of the body of the passive medium and utilizes the ectoplasm which it can draw thence professor ostwald writes certain human beings are capable of transforming their physiological store of energy which as we know is almost exclusively present in the form of chemical energy of transmitting it through space and of transforming it at prescribed points back into one of the known forms of energy it results from this that the mediums themselves are usually much exhausted ie that they use up their bodily energy a transformation into psychic energy seems also to be possible the extreme exhaustion of a medium after such investigation and the production of forms of organic matter is a matter of common knowledge of one of the most famous mediums eusapia paladino it is reported eusapia during the sittings fell into a deep hysterical somnambulism and was often in

p 195

slightly dazed condition after the close when the trance set in she turned pale and her head swerved to and fro and the eyes were turned upwards and inwards she was hypersensitive especially to the touch and also to light she had hallucinations delirium fits of laughter weeping or deep sleep and showed other typical hysterical convulsions digestive troubles also sometimes set in especially when she had eaten before the sitting in a sudden light or at a sudden rough touch she cried out and shuddered as she would under unexpected violent pain93 and again eusapia paladino used to be very exhausted after every successful sitting especially after she had been in a state of trance she sometimes slept until the next midday and was for the rest of the day apathetic peevish and monosyllabic her skin was usually cold after the sittings her pulse rapid 100° per minute and she had a strong feeling of fatigue her subsequent sleep was often restless and interrupted by vivid dreams94 speaking of another famous medium the same authority says in the case of eva c also where the number of negative sittings is very considerable she feels much exhausted according to the degree of her performances and after exhaustive positive sittings she usually needs from twentyeight to fortyfour hours to recover the deficit in her strength also she is often on the following day dazed and complains of headache and lack of appetite95 it is extremely significant and one might say even more significant that these are the very symptoms exhibited by those who have been attacked by a vampire

another fact which must be borne in mind is that the vampire was often a person who during life had read deeply in poetic lore and practised black magic for the connexion between spiritism and black magic one may refer to my history of witchcraft when the matter is very amply discussed and made plain96

with these pregnant and remarkable details in mind we may consider the explanation of vampirism given by z t pierart97 a wellknown french spiritualist and sometime editor of la revue spiritualiste he writes as follows as long as the astral form is not entirely liberated from the body there is a liability that it may be forced by magnetic attraction to reenter it sometimes it will be only halfway out when

p 196

the corpse which presents the appearance of death is buried in such cases the terrified astral soul reenters its casket and then one of two things happen the person buried either writhes in agony of suffocation or if he has been grossly material becomes a vampire the bicorporeal life then begins the ethereal form can go where it pleases and as long as it does not break the link connecting it with the body can wander visible or invisible and feed on its victims it then transmits the results of the suction by some mysterious invisible cord of connexion to the body thus aiding it to perpetuate the state of catalepsy duly discounting the peculiar phraseology of astral soul and ethereal form this comment seems to point towards a possible and correct explanation

there remain three hypotheses to be considered does the body of the vampire actually dematerialize and then reintegrate outside the grave or is another body built up by the vampire quite independently of the body which remains behind in the grave thirdly does the spirit of the vampire withdraw ectoplasmic material from his own body which enables him to form more permanent corporeity by drawing yet further material from his victims the second of these suggestions we may dismiss without much consideration since it is not borne out by any of the facts which have been investigated with regard to the subject and the truth seems to lie between the first and the third hypotheses partaking of both the body of the vampire under certain conditions acquires subtilty and therefore it is able to pass through material objects but in order to ensure not only its vitality but the permanence of this subtile quality it must draw this energy no doubt very often in an ectoplasmic form from its victim as well as what is necessary for its rejuvenescence the continual demand which a vampire makes both physically and spiritually upon its victims must speedily result in the death of these persons who being infected with the poison will in their turn visit others upon whom they will prey

it must always be remembered that the word vampire is used so loosely that there are traditions and legends which hardly require even one of these three hypotheses for their explanation and which one cannot too frequently repeat the caution refer to phantoms of the vampire family rather than to the vampire proper

p 197

it certainly seems a possibility and something more than a possibility that vampiric entities may be on the watch and active to avail themselves of the chances to use the ectoplasmic emanations of mediums at séances and this certainly constitutes a very formidable danger it is even a fact that if a person who consciously or unconsciously possesses the natural qualities of a materializing medium is placed in certain nocuous circumstances for example if he visits a house which is powerfully haunted by malefic influences especially if he be fatigued and languid so as to offer little or no resistance a vampirish entity may temporarily utilize his vitality to attempt a partial materialization this seems clear from the many instances of persons who for no obvious reason are in certain spots it may be a place a house or even a room overcome with a depression which if they do not shake off by an act of will or by leaving the particular locality may develop into actual debility and enervation a very striking example of an entity who in this way made an attempt at materialization is recorded by miss scatcherd in her contribution to survival a symposium which was published under the editorial care of sir james marchant miss scatcherd relates i saw ectoplasm in solid form for the first time when looking for rooms in the neighbourhood of russell square my friend many years older than myself was tired she wore a black velvet cloak and was sitting on a high chair so that her mantle hung in long folds to the ground while the light from the large windows fell full on her face suddenly i observed on her left side just above her waist a patch of cloudy white substance becoming bigger and denser as i watched its uncanny growth meanwhile i was discussing terms with the landlady a frail little woman when a look of terror came into her eyes she too was staring transfixed at the globular mass of white substance on my companions black mantle for out of it looked a living face normal in sizea mans face with rolling eyes and leering grin that made ones blood run cold when i mentally ordered him away he grinned defiance fearing to startle my friend i took the landlady aside and asked what was the matter she burst into tears

oh miss did you not see him he was my first he come like this several times and has never forgiven me for marrying again

p 198

what do you mean i asked again severely

oh she wailed you must have seen his wicked face glaring at us from your friends cloak and now you will not take the rooms98

in some traditions the vampire is said to float into the house in the form of a mist a belief which is found in countries so far separate as hungary and china in the latter empire willsothewisp are thought to be an unmistakable sign of a place where much blood has been shed such as an old battle field and all mists and gaseous marshlights are connected with the belief in vampires and spectres which convey disease since the effluvia the vapour and haze from a swamp or quaggy ground are notoriously unhealthy and malarial fevers result in delirium and anæmia it may be that in some legends the disease has been personified as a ghastly creature who rides on the infected air and sucks the life from his victims but all this is mere fancy and only deserves a passing mention as belonging to legend and story of the same nature is the notion that vampires can command destructive animals and vermin such as flies and in the east the mosquito whose bite may indeed convey some fever to the veins and whose long proboscis sucks the blood of animals and man we may remember that at accaron beelzebub was the lord of flies and these insects were often regarded as having something of a diabolical nature pausanias v14 tells us that the people of elis offered sacrifice to zeus averter of flies a ceremony which is also mentioned by clement of alexandria in his προτρεπτικὸς πρὸς ἔλληνας ii 38 ed potter p 33 pliny historia naturalis x 75 says the eleans invoke the flycatching god because the swarms of these insects breed pestilence and as soon as the sacrifice is made to the god the flies all perish pausanias viii 267 further notes that at aliphera in arcadia the festival of athene began with prayer and oblation to the flycatcher and after this rite the flies gave no more trouble aelian de animalium natura xi 8 tells us that at the festival of apollo in the island of leucas an ox was actually sacrificed to the flies who when glutted with the warm blood incontinently disappeared julius solinus in his collectanea rerum memorabilium i xi ed th mommsem berlin 1864 records that all flies were carefully excluded from the shrine of hercules

p 199

in the forum bovarium at rome because when hercules was handing the flesh to the priests he had prayed aloud to the flycatcher it may be noted that when the demon under whatsoever guise or name he might be adored had received those divine honours he ever covets and filches to himself by so woefully deceiving his worshippers he withdraws his emissaries the tormenting flies who are often his imps in the form of insect by their means he has striven to vex and molest the saintss bernard by excommunicating the flies that buzzed about him struck them all down dead upon the floor of the church

it now remains to inquire how the grave of a vampire may be recognized and in what way this terror may be checked and destroyed

in this connexion it will not be impertinent to give a letter dun fort honnête homme et fort instruit de ce qui regarde les revenants which is cited at length by dom calmet the letter is addressed to a near relative of the writer it is your wish my dear cousin that i should give you exact details of what has been happening in hungary with regard to certain apparitions who so often molest and slay people in that part of the world i am in a position to afford you this information for i have been living for some years in those very districts and i am naturally of an inquiring disposition from the time when i was a mere boy i have heard numbers of stories of ghosts and witches but not once in a thousand have i believed one of them it seems to me that it is almost impossible to be too careful in the investigation of matters where it is so easy to be mistakenor deliberately tricked however there are certain facts so well vouched for that one cannot but accept them as true as to the apparitions of hungary this is the usual account a person is attached by a great languor and weariness he loses all appetite he visibly wastes and grows thin and at the end of a week or ten days may be a fortnight he dies without any other symptom save anæmia and emaciation

in hungary they say that a vampire has attacked him and sucked his blood many of those who fall ill in this way declare that a white spectre is following them and cleaves to them as close as a shadow when we were in our kaloesabacs quarters in the county of temesvar99 two officers of

p 200

the regiment in which i was cornet died from this languor and several more were attacked and must have perished had not a corporal of our regiment put a stop to these maladies by resorting to the remedial ceremonies which are practised by the local people these are very unusual and although they are considered an infallible cure i cannot remember even to have seen these in any rituale

they select a young lad who is a pure maiden that is to say who as they believe had never performed the sexual act he is set upon a young stallion who has not yet mounted his first mare who has never stumbled and who must be coalblack without a speck of white the stud is ridden into the cemetery in and out among the graves and that grave over which the steed in spite of the blows they deal him pretty handsomely refuses to pass is where the vampire lies100 the tomb is opened and they find a sleek fat corpse as healthily coloured as though the man wore quietly and happily sleeping in calm repose with one single blow of a sharp spade they cut off the head whereupon there gush forth warm streams of blood in colour rich red and filling the whole grave it would assuredly be supposed that they had just decapitated a stalwart fine fellow of most sanguine habit and complexion when this business is done they refill the grave with earth and then the ravages of the disease immediately cease whilst those who are suffering from this marasmus gradually recover their strength just as convalescents recuperating after a long illness who have wasted and withered this is exactly what occurred in the case of our young officers who had sickened as the colonel of the regiment the captain and lieutenant wore all absent i happened to be in command just then and i was heartily vexed to find that the corporal had arranged the affair without my knowledge i was within an ace of ordering him a severe military punishment and these are common enough in the imperial service i would have given the world to have been present at the exhumation of the vampire but after all it is too late f or that now

it has already been remarked that in a cemetery there were often found to be a number of small passages of the size of a mans finger pierced through the earth and it was considered that the presence of such a soupirail in a grave was a certain

p 201

sign that if investigation were made a body with all the marks of vampirism would be descovered lying there

when the corpse is exhumed even though death has taken place long before there will be no decay no trace of corruption or decomposition but rather it will be found to be plump and of a clear complexion the face often ruddy the whole person composed as if in a profound sleep sometimes the eyes are closed more frequently open glazed fixed and glaring fiercely the lips which will be markedly full and red are drawn back from the teeth which gleam long sharp as razors and ivory white often the gaping mouth is stained and foul with great slab gouts of blood which trickles down from the corners on to the lawn shroudings and linen cerements the offal of the last nights feast in the case of an epidemic of vampirism it is recorded that whole graves have been discovered soaked and saturated with squelching blood which the horrid inhabitant has gorged until he is replete and vomited forth in great quantities like some swollen leech discharges when thrown into the brine in greece it is thought that the corpses skin becomes exceedingly tough and distended so that the joints can hardly be bent the human pelt has stretched like the vellum tegument of a drum and when struck returns the same sound whence the greek vrykolakas has received the name τυμπανιαῖος drumlike101 it was not infrequently seen that the dead person in his grave had devoured all about him grinding them with his teeth and as it was supposed uttering a low raucous noise like the grunting of a pig who roots among garbage in his work de masticatione mortuorum in tumulis leipzig 1728 michael ranft treats at some length of this matter he says that it is very certain that some corpses have devoured their cerements and even gnaw their own flesh it has been suggested that this is the original reason why the jaws of the dead were tightly bound with linen bands ranft instances the case of a bohemian woman who when disinterred in 1355 had devoured the greater part of her shroud in another instance during the sixteenth century both a man and a woman seemed to have torn out their intestines and were actually ravening upon their entrails in moravia a corpse was exhumed which had devoured the graveclothes of a woman buried not far from his tomb

the authors of the malleus maleficarum part i question xv under the rubric it is shown that on account of the sins of witches the innocent are often bewitched yea sometimes even for their own sins relate an instance which came under their own observation they say

also the sin of one is passed on to another in the way of desert as when the sins of wicked subjects are passed on to a bad governor because the sins of the subjects deserve a bad governor see job he makes hypocrites to reign on account of the sins of the people

sin and consequently punishment can also be passed on through some consent or dissimulation for when those in authority neglect to reprove sin then very often the good are punished with the wicked as s augustine says in the first book de ciuitate dei an example was brought to our notice as inquisitors a town once was rendered almost destitute by the death of its citizens and there was a rumour that a certain buried woman was gradually eating the shroud in which she had been buried and that the plague could not cease until she had eaten the whole shroud and absorbed it into her stomach a council was held and the podesta with the governor of the city dug up the grave and found half the shroud absorbed through the mouth and throat into the stomach and consumed in horror at this sight the podesta drew his sword and cut off her head and threw it out of the grave and at once the plague ceased now the sins of that old woman were by divine permission visited upon the innocent on account of the dissimulation of what had happened before for when an inquisition was held it was found that during a long time of her life she had been a sorceress and enchantress

if it were suspected that a man might return as a vampire or that his ghost would prove troublesome precautions were taken to prevent this in the first place the grave must be dug twice as deep as usual indeed in oldenburg the chances are that if the grave be shallow any ghost may walk102 the chuwashé a tribe in finland actually nail the corpse to the coffin103 the burmese tie together the two big toes and usually also the two thumbs of the corpse104 the arabs fasten the feet in voigtland it is considered sufficient to secure the hands105 the californians106 and damasas107 break the dead mans spine in his travels into dalmatia english

translation london 1778 alberto fortis says when a man dies suspected of becoming a vampire or vukodlak as they call it they cut his hams and prick his whole body with pins pretending that after this operation he cannot walk about these are even instances of morlacchi who imagining that they may possibly thirst for childrens blood after death intreat their heirs and sometimes oblige them to promise to treat them as vampires when they die

when the vampire was tracked to his lair one of the most approved methods to render him harmless was to transfix the corpse through the region of the heart with a stake which may be of aspen or maple as in russia or more usually of hawthorn or whitethorn the aspen tree is held to be particularly sacred as according to one account of this was the wood of the cross in her woodwalk mrs felicia hemans says the aspentree shivers mystically in sympathy with the horror of that mothertree in palestine which was compelled to furnish materials for the cross108 with regard to hawthorn de la charbonelais chesnil tells us cet arbre est regardé comme le privilegié des fées qui se rassemblant diton sous ses rameaux embaumées en normandie on croit aussi que la foudre ne le frappe jamais parcequon suppose mais sans aucun fondement quil servit à former la couronne de christ109 and again dans plusiers contrées ce vegetal mepsilus pyraneatha est lobjet dune sorte de vénération parcequon croit que cest dans un buisson de cette espèce qui dieu apparut à moïse et que cest pour cette raison que ses feuilles demeurent toujours vertes et que ses fruits ne se detachent point de larbre durant lhiver of whitethorn sir john mandeville says110 then was our lord yled into a gardyn and there the jewes scorned hym and maden him a crown of the branches of the albiespyne that is whitethorn that grew in the same gardyn and setten yt upon his heved and therefore hath the whitethorn many virtues for he that beareth a branch on hym thereof no thundre ne no maner of tempest may dere him ne in the house that is ynne may non evil ghost enter the ancient greeks believed that branches of whitethorn or buckthorn rhamnus fastened to a door or outside a window prevented the entry of witches and guarded the house against the evil spells of sorcerers111 hence they suspended branches of it above their lintels when sacrifices

in dalmatia and albania for the wooden stake is sometimes substituted a consecrated dagger a poniard which has been laid upon the altar and ritually blessed by the priest with due sacring of holy orison of frankincense and lustral asperges

it is highly important that the body of the vampire should be transfixed by a single blow for two blows or three would restore it to life this curious idea is almost universally found in tradition and folklore116 in the thousand and one nights burton vol vii p 361 we have the story of sayfalmuluk and badion al jamal where the hero cuts the ghoul in half by a single stroke through the waist the ghost yells at him oman an thou desire to slay me strike me a second stroke the youth is just about to give the second slash with his scimitar when a certain old blind beggar whom he has befriended warns him smite not a second time for then will he not die but will live and destroy us he accordingly stays his hand and the ghoul expires

among gallands manuscripts was a tale of the three sons of the sultan of samarcand in the course of various adventures the third son badialzaman engages in a contest with the djin morhagean the youngest daughter of the

when the stake has pierced the vampire he will utter the most terrible shrieks and blood will jet forth in every direction from his convulsed and writhing limbs as he impotently threshes the air with his quivering hands there is a tradition that when he has been dead for many years and his mysterious life in death is thus ended the corpse has been known immediately to crumble into dust

in some countries this operation usually takes place soon after dawn as the vampire may only leave his grave with the dusk and must return at cockcrow so he will be caught when he has come back torpid and heavy from his nights banquet of blood but as we have mentioned in another place this belief that his ravages are confined to the dark hours is by no means universal for paul lucas in his voyage au levant speaking of corfu says des personnes qui paroissent avoir le bon sons parlent dun fait assez singulier qui arrive souvent en ce pays aussi bien que dans lisle santeriny des gens morts disentils reviennent se font voir en plein jour  vont même chez eux ce qui cause de grandes frayeurs à ceux qui les voyent117accordingly the vampire may walk in full daylight yet he may not so they hold in epirus in crete and among the wallachians leave his tomb on a saturday many believe that even in the daytime it is only once a week on the saturday that he is allowed to occupy his burialplace when it is discovered that such a vurvúlukas is about the people go on a saturday and open his tomb when they always find his body just as it was buried and entirely undecomposed118 tozer researches in the highlands of turkey ii p 91 writes saturday is the day of the week on which the exorcism ought by right to take place because the spirit then rests in this tomb and if he is out on his rambles when the ceremony takes place it is unavailing in most parts of the country as the vampire is regarded as only a nightwanderer he has to be caught during the night between friday and saturday but in some places when he is believed to roam abroad by day as well the whole of saturday is allotted to him for repose and consequently is suitable for his capture

when the stake has been thrust with one drive through the vampires heart his head should be cut off and this is to be done with the sharp edge of a sextons spade rather than with a sword ralston119 tells us that to transfix the vampire with a pile is not always considered effectual a strigon or istrian vampire who was transfixed with a sharp thorn cudgel near laibach in 1672 pulled it out of his body and flung it back contemptuously110 the only certain methods of destroying a vampire appear to be either to consume him by fire or to chop off his head with a gravediggers shovel the wends say that if a vampire is hit over the back of the head with an implement of that kind he will squeal like a pig it may be noted that the heads of murderers or warlocks were often struck off and destroyed or else set between the legs or directly underneath the body121

to burn the body of the vampire is generally acknowledged to be by far the supremely efficacious method of ridding a district of this demoniacal pest and it is the common practice all over the world the bodies of all those whom he may have infected with the vampirish poison by sucking their blood are also for security sake cremated leone allacci writes quare ciues cum uident homines nulla grassante infirmitate in tanta copia emori suspicati quod est sepulchra in quibus recens defunctus sepultus est aperiunt aliquando statim aliquando etiam tardius cadauer nondum corruptum inflatumque comperiunt quod e sepulchro extractum precibusque effusis a sacerdotibus in rogum ardentem coniiciunt et nondum completa supplicatione cadaueris iuncturae sensim dissoluuntur et reliqua exusta in cineres conuertuntur122 any animals which may come forth from the fireworms snakes lice beetles birds of horrible and deformed shapemust be driven back into the flames for it may be the vampire embodied in one of these seeking to escape so that he can renew his foul parasitism of death the ashes of the pyre should be scattered to the winds or cast into a river swiftly flowing to the sea

ceremony which took place when a vampire had been tracked he writes123 i was creditably informed of a case of this description occurring not long ago at alistrati one of the principal villages between serres and drama someone was suspected of having turned into a vampire the corpse was taken out of the grave was scalded with boiling oil and was pierced through the navel with a long nail then the tomb was covered in and millet was scattered over it that if the vampire came out again he might waste his time in picking up the grains of millet and be thus overtaken by dawn for the usual period of their wanderings is from about two hours before midnight till the first crowing of the morning cock at the sound of which fearful summons the vrykolakas like the gaelic sithehe or fairy vanishes into his subterranean abode

the turks on occasion have had recourse to the remedy of burning to put to rest a greek vampire for crusius in his turcograecia relates124 in sabbato pentecostes turcae combusserunt graecum biennio ante defunctum quod uulgo crederetur noctu sepulcro egredi hominesque occidere alii autem ueram causam perhibent quod quindecim pluresue homines spectrum eius uidentes mortui sint sepulcro extractus consumpta carne cutem ossibus adhaerentem integram habuit

william of newbury speaking of the vampires which infested england in the twelfth century says that similar molestations had often happened and there were on record very many famous cases the only way in which a district could be completely secured and an end put once and for all to these hideous visitations was by exhuming the body and burning the vampire to ashes125

the following form of exorcism is described as having been employed in rhodes on a woman who returned as a vrykolakas the priest of the village laid on the ground one of the dead womans shifts over the neck of which he walked held up by two men for fear the vampire should seize him while in this position he read verses from the new testament till the shift swelled up and split when this rent takes place the evil spirit is supposed to escape through the opening126

the first precaution taken by the wallachians to prevent the vampire from ravaging is to drive a long nail through the

skull and to lay the thorny stem of a wild rose bush upon the body so that its winding sheet may become entangled with it should there be any attempt to rise127

in bulgaria there is yet another method of abolishing a vampirethat of bottling him there are certain persons who make a profession of this and their mode of procedure is as follows the sorcerer armed with a picture of some saint lies in ambush until he sees the vampire pass when he pursues him with his eikon the poor obour takes refuge in a tree or on the roof of a house but his persecutor follows him up with the talisman driving him away from all shelter in the direction of a bottle specially prepared in which is placed some of the vampires favourite food having no other resource he enters this prison and is immediately fastened down with a cork on the interior of which is a fragment of the eikon the bottle is then thrown into the fire and the vampire disappears for ever

with reference to this enclosing of the vampire in a bottle it may be remembered that it was once a common practice of sorcery to imprison familiar spirits in a vial among the articles put forth by don alfonso manriquez who on 10 september 1523 succeeded as grand inquisiter adrian bishop of tortosa128 was the following which a man in duty bound must reveal to the holy office should he become aware of any such offence if any person made or caused to be made mirrors rings phials of glass or other vessels therein to contain some spirit who should reply to his inquiries and aid his projects129

newton in his travels and discoveries in the levant vol i p 213 says that in mitylene the bodies of those who will not lie quiet in their graves are transported to a small adjacent island a mere eyot without inhabitants where they are reinterred this is an effectual bar to any future molestation for the vampire cannot cross salt water running water too he can only pass at the slack or the flood of the tide

as all other demoniacal monsters the vampire fears and shrinks from holy things holy water burns him as some biting acid he flies from the sign of the cross from the crucifix from relics and above all from the host the body of god all these and other hallowed objects render him powerless he is conquered by the fragrance of incense p 209 certain trees and herbs are hateful to him the whitethorn or buckthorn as we have seen and particularly garlic often when the vampire is decapitated his mouth is stuffed full with garlic garlic is scattered in and all over the coffin by handfuls and he can do no harm in china and among the malays to wet a childs forehead with garlic is a sure protection against vampires the west indian negroes today smear themselves with garlic to neutralize the evil charms of witches and obeah men it may be noted that the battas or bataks of sumatra ascribe pining and wasting away sickness terror and death to the absence of the soul tendi from the body and the soul must be lured back to his tenement one of the most powerful soulcompelling herbs which is used by them in their mystic rites on these occasions is garlic 130 at the s john midsummer festival of fire on the vigil of the major solemnity of that saint 23rd june at dragingnan var the people roasted pods of garlic by the bonfires these pods were afterwards distributed to every family and were believed to bring good luck131

in countries which are nonchristian the practices are naturally somewhat different although it should be remarked that burning the body of the vampire is universal in china corpses suspected of potential vampirism were allowed to decay in the open air before burial or when buried were exhumed as in other countries and cremated in the absence of the corpse from its grave the lid of the coffin was removed since it was thought that the circulation of fresh air would prevent the vampire from returning to it rice red peas and scraps of iron were also scattered round the grave these formed a mystical barrier the dead man could not surmount he fell to the ground stiff and stark and then could be taken up and burned to ashes132

in some slavonic countries it is thought that a vampire if prowling out of his tomb at night may be shot and killed with a silver bullet that has been blessed by a priest but care must be taken that his body is not laid in the rays of the moon especially if the moon be at her full for in this case he will revive with redoubled vigour and malevolence

it should perhaps be mentioned that the macedonians believe in the existence of a vrykolakas of sheep and cattle as well as the more formidable vrykolakas who drains human

p 210

blood the vrykolakas of animals rides upon their shoulders and as the ordinary vampire sucks a vein killing the unfortunate beasts and leaving them a mere fibrous mash of skin and bone vagrant mohammedan dervishes profess to have the power of exterminating these inferior vampires whence they are often saluted as vampirekillers and they tramp the countryside ostentatiously exhibiting an iron rod which ends in a sharp point shish to pierce through and destroy the pest or a long lancelike stick furnished at the top with a small axe to strike him down138 but here we have descended to mere quackery although as we have seen there are many methods and many variants it is certain that an effectual remedy against the vampire is to transfix his heart with a stake driven through with one single blow to strike off his head with a sextons spade and perhaps best of all to burn him to ashes and purge the earth of his pollutions by the incineration of fireembed"
