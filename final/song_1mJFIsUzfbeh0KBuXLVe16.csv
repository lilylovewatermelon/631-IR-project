drink a little beer play a little music
and have a big time tonight

verse 1 thomas rhett
got a tennessee girl a rocky top breeze
and a big ol yellow moon
a new set of strings on my 69
and a yeti full of iceddown booze
everybody round this sleepy little town
heading down pinetucky road
gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
right there by the old fence post

chorus thomas rhett  rhett akins
yeah were gonna drink a little beer play a little music
and have a big time tonight
a bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
life can be an ol briar patch
gotta dance your way through it sometimes
so were gonna drink a little beer play a little music
and have a big time tonight

verse 2 rhett akins
got a pig in the ground stars in the sky
and a jar full of lightning juice
got a wornout path to the river bank
everybody coming out of them boots
gonna pick a few songs all night long
ones that we grew up on
some fishing in the dark some copperhead road
everybody just sing along
