no dont try to apologize
dont insist as if its just a game
excuses already existed before you came up with them
no dont look at me like you used to
dont speak in plural
rhetoric is your most lethal weapon

prechorus
im going to ask you not to come back
i feel that you still hurt here inside
and at your age you should know well how it is
to break someones heart like this

chorus
you cant live with so much poison
the hope that your love gives me
no one else has given it to me
i swear im not lying
you cant live with so much poison
you cant dedicatе your soul to accumulating attempts
rage weighs morе than cement

verse 2
i hope you dont expect me to wait for you
after being 26 my patience has gone to my feet
and im plucking daisies
and looking without looking
to see if this way youll get annoyed and leave

im going to ask you not to come back
i feel that you still hurt here inside
and at your age you should know well how it is
to break someones heart like this

chorus
you cant live with so much poison
the hope that your love gives me
no one else has given it to me
i swear im not lying
you cant live with so much poison
you cant dedicate your soul to accumulating attempts
rage weighs more than cement
