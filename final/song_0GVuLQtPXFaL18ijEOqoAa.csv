some people long for a life that is simple and planned
tied with a ribbon
some people wont sail the sea cause theyre safer on land
to follow whats written
but id follow you to the great unknown
off to a world we call our own

chorus
hand in my hand
and we promised to never let go
were walkin a tightrope
high in the sky
we can see the whole world down below
were walkin a tightrope
never sure never know how far we could fall
but its all an adventure
that comes with a breathtakin view
walkin a tightrope

postchorus
with you ooh ooh ooh ooh
with you ooh ooh ooh ooh
with you

verse 2
mountains and valleys and all that will come in between
desert and ocean
you pulled me in and together were lost in a dream
always in motion
so i risk it all just to be with you
and i risk it all for this life we choose
you might also likechorus
hand in my hand
and you promised to never let go
were walkin a tightrope
high in the sky
we can see the whole world down below
were walkin a tightrope
never sure will you catch me if i should fall
well its all an adventure
that comes with a breathtakin view
walkin a tightrope

postchorus
with you ooh ooh ooh ooh
with you ooh ooh ooh ooh
with you
with you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
with you ooh
with you20embed"
