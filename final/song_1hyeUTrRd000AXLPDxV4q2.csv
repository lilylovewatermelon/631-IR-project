oohoohoohooh

verse 1
what if i told you that it was all in vain
would it still hurt you
would you still feel the same
said its impossible possible
so impossible

chorus
but youre still waiting on the moment
breath is bated
i wish i could hold you i cant take it
tell you all my secrets
im too faded
praying that tomorrow ill be braver
maybe i can tell you maybe we can do this
kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
love you like the rain it falls much faster
living in a piece of ever after
forever after
living in the piece of ever after
ever after ever after

verse 2
if you will have me
ill make you happy
need someone to whom i can belong
heres my confession
saving it special
hoped it would be you all along
all along
all along
all along

but youre still waiting on the moment
breath is bated
i wish i could hold you i cant take it
tell you all my secrets
im too faded
praying that tomorrow ill be braver
maybe i can tell you maybe we can do this
kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
love you like the rain it falls much faster
living in a piece of ever after
forever after
living in the piece of ever after
ever after ever after19embed"
