lets get all the years where i was her friend
look at all the mirrors at the bottom of the well
i thought i lost my heartbeat i wanna tell you
this is a piece of cake working with my hands
this one is a page where i used too many colors
sixteen mirrors at the bottom of the well
roll it in a mirror all my work will be discovered
this is a piece of cake working with my hands
