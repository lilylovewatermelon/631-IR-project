i want to help you
but i dont know how
i want to soothe you
but i cant speak out

i have many memories of pain
i have always been a little shy
so ill turn and look the other way

chorus
other way other way
i will turn and look the other way

verse 2
i want to hold you
but i am afraid
i want to touch you
but im not that way

i have always hurt the one that i love
so ill turn and look the other way
