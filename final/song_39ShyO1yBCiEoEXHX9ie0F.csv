this sinking feeling sets
it feels just like a hole inside your chest
i know youre thinking
no no no no it is easier said than done
but please let me attest
i know its hard
youre feeling like youre trapped
but thats how you react
when you cannot see the light
but try and see the light
im telling you
no no no no youre the only one
standing in your way
just take a breath relax and tell me
chorus
why please tell me why do we worry
why why do we worry at all
why just tell me why do we worry
when worrys never helping tell me why why worry at all

verse 2
why do we insist
on crossing bridges that do not exist
lets take these issues
step by step by step to work it out
day by day by day were falling down
but life goes on
ive got some questions
are you sick of feeling sorry uh huh
and people saying not to worry uh huh
sick of hearing this hakuna matata motto
from people who won the lotto
were not that lucky
have you noticed that youre breathing uh huh
look around and count your blessings uh huh
so when youre sick of all this stressing and guessing
im suggesting you turn this up and let them hear you sing it

chorus
why please tell me why do we worry
why why do we worry at all
