ive been wearin the same damn clothes for three damn days
lincoln nebraskas got me in a haze
the thing about men like you is you got a lot to say
but will you stay

prechorus
you say you got my name on your tattoo
opening up doors pulling out chairs look at you
you talk to god like i do i think you know
the same secrets that i do im talkin bout

chorus
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander all those who wander
all those who wander are lost
its just wanderlust

verse 2
the thing about bein on the road
is theres too much time to think
about seasons of old
as you pour yourself a drink
cause every time i said no
it wasnt quite what i meaned
if you know what i mean
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeprechorus
you said you got my name as your tattoo
pulling out chairs opening doors look at you
you talk to people like i do i think you know
the same things that i do

chorus
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander all those who wander
all those who wander are lost
its just wanderlust

bridge
look at me look at you
look at what you made me do
look at me look at you
bible on your tattoo
look at me look at you
look at what you made me do
look at me look at you

chorus
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander are lost
not all those who wander all those who wander
all those who wander are lost
its just wanderlust23embed"
