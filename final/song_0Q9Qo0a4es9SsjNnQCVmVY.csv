just give me the chance
i will win it all

relax your lips
long blonde hair
i dont know if
youre even there
put out the fire

put out the fire
i let the flames grow
dont call it quits
cold hard stare
i wont go if
youre standing there
put out the fire
i never let go
put out the fire
i let the flames

up in flames
