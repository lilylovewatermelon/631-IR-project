outro
picking all the pieces of my life up off the floor
searching for an open window or an exit door
this boulder on my shoulders it got heavier and colder
til the day that i got sober now its slowly rolling over
to all the people ive done wrong now i apologize
to all the girls hearts i broke to the tears i made em cry
i know its been a while and you have traveled many miles
to get away its not my style but i wrote this song to make you smile
picking all the pieces of my life up off the floor
searching for an open window or an exit door
this boulder on my shoulders it got heavier and colder
til the day that i got sober now its slowly rolling over
to all the people ive done wrong now i apologize
to all the girls hearts i broke to the tears i made em cry
