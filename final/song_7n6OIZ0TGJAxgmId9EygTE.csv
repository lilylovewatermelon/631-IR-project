i think once i took my first vicodin it was just like this feeling of ahh
you know like everything was not only mellow but didnt feel any pain
it just didnt– it just kind of numbed things
i dont know at what point exactly it started to be a problem
i just remember likin it more and more
people tried to tell me that i had a problem
i would say get that fuckin person out of here i cant believe they said that shit to me they know nothin about my fuckin life are they out of their fuckin mind
im not out there shootin heroin im not out there fuckin you know puttin coke up my nosе im not smokin crack
youre struggling with the argument of do you havе a problem or do you not have a problem can you control it or can you not
and i literally thought i could control it
youre taking things that people are giving you that you dont even know what the fuck they are
they look like a pill and they look– theyre shaped like something that you take so you take it you know
xanax valium tomatotomato
you know what i mean its ththe same thing its all in the same family fuck it take it
had i had got to the hospital about two hours later i wouldve died
my organs were shutting down my liver kidneys everything
they were gonna have to put me on dialysis they didnt think i was gonna make it
my bottom was gonna be death within a month i had relapsed
and shot right back up to the same amount of pills that i was taking
i remember just walking around my house and thinking every single day like im gonna fucking die like imim looking at my kids and i need to be here for this
coming off of everything i literally was up twentyfour hours a day for three weeks straight
and i mean not sleeping not even nodding off for a fucking minute
like i was literally just up like looking at the tv
i had to regain motor skills i had to regain talking skills
its been aa learning process like its been im growing
i just couldnt believe that anybody could ever be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something
so i would say that tto anybody that iit does get better you know it just– it doesyou might also like20embed"
