hand me a towel im dirty dancing
by myself gone off tabs of that acid
form me a circle watch my jagger
might lose my jacket and hit a solo one time
we too loud in public them police turned down the function
now we outside and the timings perfect
forgot to tell you
gotta tell you how much i vibe with you
and we dont gotta be solo
now stay away from highways
my eyes like them red lights
right now i prefer yellow
redbone so mellow
fuck round be cutting you
think we were better off solo
i got that act right in the windy city that night
no trees to blow through but blow me and i owe you
two grams when the sun rise
smoking good rolling solo
solo solo solo solo
ssolo solo ssolo solo

chorus
its hell on earth and the citys on fire
inhale in hell theres heaven
theres a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale in hell theres heaven
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

im skipping showers and switching socks sleeping good and long
bones feeling dense as fuck wish a nigga would cross
and catch a solo on time
white leaf on my boxers green leaf turn to vapors for the low
and that mean cheap cause aint shit free and i know it
even love aint cause this nut cost that clinic killed my soul
but you gotta hit the pussy raw though
now your baby mama aint so vicious
all she want is her picket fence
and you protest and you picket sign
but them courts wont side with you
wont let you fly solo yeah
i wanted that act right in colorado that night
i brought trees to blow through but its just me and no you
stayed up til my phone died
smoking big rolling solo

chorus
its hell on earth and the citys on fire
inhale in hell theres heaven
theres a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale in hell theres heaven
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
