you’re the fighter
you’ve got the fire
the spirit of a warrior
the champion’s heart
you fight for your life
because the fighter never quits
you make the most of the hand you’re dealt
because the quitter never wins
no

verse 2
you were born to box in a city that’s seen their share
mello ryan carney
among them your photo proudly hangs there
above the bar in the gaelic club
they tell the story of a throwback
with the heart of a lion
they salute your glory

prechorus
it’s another murderous night
another left hook from hell
a bloody war on the boardwalk
and the kid from lowell rises to the bell
