the most depressed ive ever been
literally feeling like id probably be happier if i was just dead
i got a number one on billboard my song is massive right now
like i may never have a song this big again
my tour i think every date sold out except one date
so i literally had everything that i had always dreamed of happening yeah
and i felt i didnt feel happy at all
and so i think what happened was i spiraled really bad
cause i was like im here and if this is it
theres gotta be more for me
cause if this is it like its not gonna worksee nf liveget tickets as low as 654embed"
