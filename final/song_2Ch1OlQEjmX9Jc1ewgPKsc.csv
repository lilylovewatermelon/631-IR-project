shes driving me down to the river
shell watch over me in the tears in her eyes
couldnt dig my own grave any deeper
shes pushing me blindfolded down to my knees
but her finger still shakes on the trigger
shes untying my hands though i gave her the rope
this is so much harder to leave her leave her leave her

when youre forgiving but you cant forget
feels like youre drownin but you still got breath
and weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest
oh but there aint no getting out of this mess
no there aint no getting out
there aint no getting out
there aint no getting out of this mess

now shes showing me mercy as much as she can
shes letting me live with my demons
see her washing her hands as shes walking away
oh but still she looks back she looks back
but shes leaving shes leaving

when youre forgiving but you cant forget
feels like youre drownin but you still got breath
and weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest
oh but there aint no getting out of this mess
no there aint no getting out
there aint no getting out
there aint no getting out of this mess
no there aint no getting out
no there aint no getting out of this mess

whats done is done
cant resurrect the setting sun
whats done is done
no you cant reverse the bullet from a gun

when youre forgiving but you cant forget
feels like youre drownin but you still got breath
and weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest
oh but there aint no getting out of this mess
when youre forgiving but you cant forget
feels like youre drownin but you still got breath
and weve been tryna lay this ghost to rest
oh but there aint no getting
there aint no getting out of this mess
