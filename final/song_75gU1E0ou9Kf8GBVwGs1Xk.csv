faded were fadin
we aint breathin lately
no tomorrow not for you and i
hate it i hate it
cant believe im sayin it
call my friends and tell em we had died

prechorus
our love our love our love
it is gone now
our love our love our love
took everything we had
our love our love our love
was real i felt that
but it aint comin back
no it aint comin back

chorus
i wish you everything youve ever wanted in your life
this tastes so bittersweet its like im goin under
burn all the letters all of my secrets things only you know
bury my heart six feet under throw us a funeral
i wish you everything youve ever wanted in your life

verse 2
faded get faded
only thing that makes sense
anything to take the pain away
