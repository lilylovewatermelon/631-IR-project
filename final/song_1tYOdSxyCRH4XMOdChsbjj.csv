you slowly melting
wake up then fall back asleep
youre quickly fading

hey man youll have to wait your turn
i can see that youre jonesing
taste no flavors on my tongue
theyve evaporated youve disintegrated

why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me
bring me down

karma comes around two times
so you better be good
watch out for the unfamiliar signs
when youre going the wrong way

look back to the devious minds
they keep pushing and pulling
baby jesus never sleeps
when youre being a sinner
yeah hell eat you for dinner

why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me down down
why you gotta bring me down
bring me down
you gotta bring me down
you gotta bring me down down
bring me
you might also likemake no promises to me
you slowly melting
baby jesus never sleeps
when youre being a sinner

hey man youll have to wait your turn
i can see that youre jonesing
taste no flavors on my tongue
theyve evaporated youve disintegrated

why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me down down
why you gotta bring me

so dont bring me downembed"
