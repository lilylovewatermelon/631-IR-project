verse 1
i’m so tangy people call me mathangi
goddess of word bitches i’mma keep it banging
truth is like a rotten tooth you gotta spit it out
let the bottom two let my wisdom work it out
big on the underground can’t knock me down
vicki leekx bitches back by dope demand
i sleep on my talent and i stand by it too
i can say lots with a little words or few like
like adam had em yeh me the madame
yeah i’ll introduce you to the dooms do dooms
come let we go do you like my perfumes
made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
oil and water are two extremes
we like fucking carpets you fucking brooms
why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing
i got many designs theyre downloading on bing
my cousin got his gcses decorating
he’s handy you might need him when i finish what i’m saying
lets be frank you my stan im your stan
i don’t care what you smoke what you fucking drank
im allowed to be pissed at mates who are yanks
cause it’s not me and you its the fucking banks
see mia liveget tickets as low as 146you might also likechorus

verse 2
truth is like a rotten tooth you gotta spit it out
i left the bottom two let my wisdom work it out
the world is ours send your soldier powers
these words i announce hope you heard em like cows
alpha kenny buddy roger charlie and rich
bitch my swag bitches but you can’t touch this
so click click click please get off my dick
just ‘cause i know more don’t make me thick
im a overweight heavyweight female slick rick
if you need the trees then my shits got stick
i got bug spray bucket stick
tons of the fun stuff tons and tons of it

verse 3
my nan was a stan for imported liquor brands
72 bottles at her birthday got drank
i must say people i got her to freaking thank
im a party fucking animal if you aint scram
my uncle jumped a boat it took him to iran
what started as a life now it got him banned
so i came in a hurry not a white van
learnt that sam ram chan are the same man
corrugated iron wooden shacks
gated mansions next to xx
boys on motor bikes next to maybachs
we got backpacks next to cats from kyzack
exconvicts and diplomats
rapper and russians who dont pay tax
these cards are stacked and this is out crack
rewind pull it and bring it all back

chorus
bring the noise when we run upon them
bring the noise when we run upon them
bring the noise when we run upon them
bring the noise when we run upon them
