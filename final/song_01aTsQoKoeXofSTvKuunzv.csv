verse 1
do you recall not long ago
we would walk on the sidewalk
innocent remember
all we did was care for each other
but the night was warm
we were bold and young
all around the wind blows
we would only hold on to let go
chorus
blow a kiss fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss fire a gun
all we need is somebody to lean on
blow a kiss fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss fire a gun
aaall we need is somebody to lean on

what will we do when we get old
will we walk down the same road
will you be there by my side
standin strong as the waves roll over
when the nights are long
longing for you to come home
all around the wind blows
we would only hold on to let go
chorus
blow a kiss fire a gun
we need someone to lean on
blow a kiss fire a gun
all we need is somebody to lean on hey
blow a kiss fire a gun
