i look up from the ground
to see your sad and teary eyes
you look away from me
and i see theres something youre trying to hide
and i reach for your hand but its cold
you pull away again
and i wonder whats on your mind
and then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
you start to tremble and your voice begins to break
you say the cigarettes on the counter werent your friends
they were my mates
and i feel the colour draining from my face

chorus
and my friend said
i know you love her but its over mate
it doesnt matter put the phone away
its never easy to walk away let her go
itll be alright

verse 2
so i still look back at all the messages youd sent
and i know it wasnt right but it was fucking with my head
and everything deleted like the past yeah it was gone
and when i touched your face i could tell youre moving on
but its not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
its the feeling of betrayal that i just cant seem to shake
and everything i know tells me that i should walk away
but i just wanna stay

and my friend said
i know you love her but its over mate
it doesnt matter put the phone away
its never easy to walk away let her go
itll be okay
its gonna hurt for a bit of time
so bottoms up lets forget tonight
youll find another and youll be just fine
let her go

bridge
but nothing heals the past like time
and they cant steal
the love youre born to find
but nothing heals the past like time
and they cant steal
the love youre born to find

chorus
i know you love her but its over mate
it doesnt matter put the phone away
its never easy to walk away let her go
itll be okay
its gonna hurt for a bit of time
so bottoms up lets forget tonight
youll find another and youll be just fine
let her go
outro
itll be alright
itll be alright
itll be alright
itll be alright
