i wish that i could hold my tongue
cause even when im right im wrong

the summer days are so long
its hard to hide in the light
so afraid of what youll see
on the other side of the light the light

verse 4
i guess i used to love this place
you see all this talk about finding yourself 
im feeling and i know its fake
you lost yourself
why is new york city
but god says 
so far so far from santa barbara
you could travel to the end of the earth 
barbara
but you can always come back home

and theres no one no one like you
