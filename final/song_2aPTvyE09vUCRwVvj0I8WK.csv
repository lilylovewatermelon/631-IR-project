tokyo trips shoppin sprees full of gifts

back when you used to be’s with that crip
gotta give a little to get
a little bit in return now tables turn now
and you heard ’bout me and my bitch
im just tryna chill
’cause lately ive been thinkin bout you and rebuildin’
walking round like you lost feelings
i can tell he not fulfilling

they say only if looks could kill for real
you walk around town with that guy
when you pass by ahah
