i hear the waves
sun beating down on my shoulders
its a nearperfect day
wishing i wouldnt get any older
they say that its gone before you know it now

chorus
quiet your mind
soak it all in
its a game you cant win
enjoy the ride

verse 2
i feel the change
going on all around me
its strange
how im taken and guided
where i end up right where im needed to be

chorus
quiet your mind
soak it all in
its a game you cant win
enjoy the ride

at the end of the water
a red sun is rising
and the stars are all going away
and if youre too busy talking
youre not busy listening
to hear what the land has to say

chorus
quiet your mind

verse 1
