do you know
i count your heartbeats before you sleep
i bite my fingernails to bone
and now i crawl back under the stairwell
to a place i call my home
i really hope you enjoy the show
because for me its just a bad day
you need people like me to feel

chorus
maybe were just having too much fun
maybe you cant handle yourself
staring at me with your lips and tongue

verse 2
youll never know
i dont know where im going to sleep tonight
she said hotels are cheap and theres one down the street
but oh dont you threaten me with a good time
murder the moment my god im the serpent
im sorry i cant see that you truly loved me

chorus
maybe were just having too much fun
maybe you cant handle yourself
staring at me with your lips and tongue
ive been having this dream that we can fly
so maybe if we never wake up we can see the sky
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likenylon guitar solo
bridge
please dont take this out on me
cause youre the only thing thats keeping me alive
and i dont want to wait for the downset date
cause i would rather end it all tonight
and if i mean anything to you
im sorry but ive made up my mind

chorus
maybe were just having too much fun
maybe you cant handle yourself
staring at me with your lips and tongue
ive been having this dream that we can fly
so darling close your eyes

outro
cause youre about to miss everything
about to miss everything
about to miss everything
about to miss everything67embed"
