lights go down wheels go round
im taking you home
hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now

is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
and the only thing i wanna do is find a spot
stop this car and throw it in park and just

slow dance with you
spinning you around by the walmart sign
and moving our feet over the painted white lines
getting close to you
making the most of whatever we got
even if its just a slow dance in a parking lot
slow dance in a parking lot

a rentacops rolling a security car
its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
to the radio singing a little garth brooks

and i dont care what song comes next
im falling right here dont want a safety net in a
