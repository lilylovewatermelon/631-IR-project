all i am is the bones you made for me
so garishly clean
white as the horses
that carry me away

verse 2
all my demons you said
come and go with the days
a minds will to play
i grow old in my ways just like you do

chorus
oh there aint no diamonds in the bottom
no there aint no darkness that i fear
oh there aint no way to say i love you more no
so be clear be clear
so be clear just to be clear

verse 3
all i am is the bones you made for me
just driftwood for the sea
heavy as the horses
that carry me away
that carry me away
