she turns every head coming down the sidewalk
in that red sundress that she just bought
causing a traffic jam on a green light
a string of pearls showing off her suntan
and all those curls dancing ‘round her raybans
if you think that’s something to see

chorus
you ought to see her when she’s on
that front porch in those cutoff jeans
and that texas longhorns tshirt hair drying in the breeze
humming along to some old haggard song
you ought to see her when she’s on

verse 2
down at the office in those high heels
looking like a million closing big deals
she’ll remind the boys eyes are way up here
yeah that’ll make you smile ear to ear

chorus
you ought to see her when she’s on
that leather couch reading that fairy tale
to a sleepyeyed little girl in pajamas and ponytails
saying one day your prince charming will come along
you ought to see her when she’s on
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
oh you ought to see her when she’s on
that front porch in those old cutoff jeans
and that texas longhorns tshirt smiling back at me
when you see her dressed to kill
and it drops your jaw

outro
you ought to see her when she’s
on that leather couch reading that fairy tale
that’s when she’s on
that’s when she’s on that front porch
in those old cutoff jeans
that’s when she’s on
oh when she’s on
that’s when she’s onembed"
