chorus
uh tuned up copped a bmw new deposit i picked up another bag
like fuck it ima count while im in it
i hear planes flyin crowds screamin money counters chains clangin
shit i guess thats how it sound when you winnin
i aint jokin do it sound like im kiddin
i been makin like two thousand a minute
so high up through the clouds i was swimmin
im probably gon drown when im in it
i bet she gon get loud when im in it
and we might have a child when im finished

verse 1
uh i wont love a ho after we fuck she cant get near me
only bitch i give a conversation to is siri
my pants amiri yes im winnin clearly
im the chosen one seen my potential so they fear me
lately ive been prayin god i wonder can you hear me
thinkin bout the old me i swear i miss you dearly
stay down til you come up ive been stickin to that theory
every day a battle im exhausted and im weary
make sure i smile in public when alone my eyes teary
i fought through it all but that shit hurt me severely
ive been gettin high to hide behind my insecurities
takin different pills but i know it aint gon—

verse 2
they say im pac rebirth never put out a weak verse
homicides when we lurk ima step til my feet hurt
been puttin them streets first
white tees turned burgundy tshirts
lookin for somethin real he stuck in a deep search
anxiety killin me i just want to leave earth
when they ask if im okay it just make everything seem worse
try and explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
lookin so deep into your eyes i can read your thoughts so
shut the fuck— i mean please dont talk
i done been through too much and i dont need another loss
put that on every war scar for every battle i fought
