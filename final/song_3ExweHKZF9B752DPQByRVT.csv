well its a sad picture the final blow hits ya
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it’s all the same another time and place
repeatin history and youre gettin’ sick of it

prechorus
but i believe in whatever you do
and ill do anything to see it through

chorus
because these things will change can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come for us to finally win
and well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
oh oh

verse 2
so weve been outnumbered raidеd and now cornered
its hard to fight when thе fight aint fair
were getting stronger now find things they never found
they might be bigger but we’re faster and never scared

prechorus
you can walk away say we don’t need this
but theres somethin’ in your eyes says we can beat this

bridge
tonight we’ll stand and get off our knees
fight for what weve worked for all these years
and the battle was long its the fight of our lives
but well stand up champions tonight

chorus
it was the night things changed can you see it now
when the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
its a revolution throw your hands up cause we never gave in
and well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah oh
