frozen moments in time stopped hourglass
they predicate what you will know
dispositions lie within
and so do we
dont want to run dont want to hide
renounce the prayers for inspiration
if you dictate what i will be
then smash my face upon the concrete im weary
i feel the stares piercing
so sorry to soil your precious eyes
reflections spoonfeed you
the bitterness and disgust that is me

refrain
if you choose to reach out to lend to me
ill chew off your hand

chorus 1
im not beggin for your fuckin change
im not beggin for your fuckin change
im in touch with myself
all alone within myself

postchorus
all one alone
all one alone
all one alone
all one alone

do what you will make it the whole of your law
burn down the faith that shadows life
and take a deeper look inside of what makes you
pull down the shades internal light can be blinding brilliance

chorus 2
im not begging for your fuckin change
im just begging for a fuckin change
complacence quenched of me
lineage is ending

bridge
i am that once was me
rising upward guts wrenching
sculpted cold blistering
break the mold sever me
cut your throat be the martyr
bitter pills that we swallow
take me chase me
swallow with me

know now
know now
inside of truth coming to
close to me ground consumes and embraces me
born again im repositioning
self inside to self nondimensional
lost to being ive recognized the cause
existence to come alive now forever
born again im repositioning
self inside to self nondimensional
lost to being ive recognized the cause
existence to come alive now forever

i am once was i am once was
i am once was i am once was
that is me
i am once was i am once was
i am once was
that is me

im broken altered vacillating force
round square corners circles dance around wet figures
prisoner of time im no more
insight will guide us through the majesty of nothing
its like im touched with love by angel girl
let bastards rot in time for all their evil
let bastards rot in time for all their evil
let bastards rot in time

chorus 3
im not beggin for your fuckin change
im not beggin for your fuckin change
i found my own place
tame within my own space
outro
