i found the truth beneath your lies
and true love never has to hide

ive seen your scars and kissed your crime oh

they say true loves the greatest weapon
to win the war caused by pain pain
but every diamond has imperfections
but my loves too pure to watch it chip away
boy nothing real can be threatened
true love breathes salvation back into me
with every tear came redemption
and my torturer became my remedy
prechorus
so many people i know that theyre just tryna touch ya
kiss up and rub up and feel up
kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
give you some time to prove that i can trust you again
im gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

chorus
all night long
love all night long
sweet love all night long
sweet love all night long

we together i remember
