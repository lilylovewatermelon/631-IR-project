whats the time
well its gotta be close to midnight
my bodys talking to me
it says time for danger
it says i wanna commit a crime
wanna be the cause of a fight
i wanna put on a tight skirt
and flirt with a stranger

prechorus 1
ive had a knack from way back
at breaking the rules once i learn the game
get up lifes too quick i know someplace sick
where this chickll dance in the flames
we dont need any money i always get in for free
you can get in too if you get in with me

chorus 1
let’s go out tonight
i have to go out tonight
you wanna play let’s run away
we won’t be back before it’s new year’s day
take me out tonight meow

prechorus 2
mmm
when i get a wink from the doorman
do you know how lucky youil be
that youre on line with the feline of avenue b
you might also likechorus 2
lets go out tonight
i have to go out tonight
you wanna prowl be my night owl
well take my hand were gonna howl out tonight

bridge
in the evening i’ve got to roam
can’t sleep in the city of neon and chrome
feels too damn much like home
when the spanish babies cry
so let’s find a bar
so dark we forget who we are
where all the scars
from the nevers and maybes die

chorus 3
lets go out tonight
i have to go out tonight
you’re sweet wanna hit the street
wanna wail at the moon like a cat in heat
just take me out tonight

outro
please take me out tonight
don’t forsake me out tonight
i’ll let you make me out tonight
tonight tonight tonightembed"
