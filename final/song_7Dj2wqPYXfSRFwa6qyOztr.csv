this could never work is what we said at first
but whatever this is its working
but were in two different worlds and yeah
im not your husband nah you aint my girlfriend
all i know is that what
when im with you im a different person yeah
and i aint never met a chick as perfect
girl youre a ten so here i am yeah
laying here with her again
thinking bout you
shes asleep youre texting me around two
crying face emoji you say this is me without you
were sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
sex in the car then ill text you tomorrow
do i question it nah no objection at all
cause both of us are still involved so
as im peelin off all im thinking bout is

chorus
im not happy here nah with her
rather have you yeah rather have me too
cause youre not happy there youre not happy there with him
rather have me i know but we’re just in too deep

verse 2
youre laying there with him thinking bout me
hes asleep you say lets meet around three
you went to leave the house he caught you sneaking out now hes freaking out
you thought he was sleepin soundly woah
you say youre going for a drive you dont question him
when he stumbles in like where the fuck youve been
then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
tell him you love him yeah wipe each others tears
but its been a couple years since we been doin dirt
you or my girl dont wanna see either of you get hurt
but now the lines are getting super blurred
cant tell if im cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
but really nobodys at fault cant help who you love
hope they dont overhear us talk
cause we both are getting sloppy
probably subconsciously part of mes hoping we get caught cause

im not happy here nah with her
rather have you yeah rather have me too
cause youre not happy there youre not happy there with him
rather have me i know but we’re just in too deep

verse 3
were laying here with them thinking bout us
cause now when we get home we get jealous
of each other being someone elses
call us long john silvers cause we selfish
but i just wanna see ya
dont care if its at the ritz or motel 6
if im there with ya rich or poor
when im laying here with ya it could be the kitchen floor
i could stay in bed with ya starin at ya til the morn
i just wanna be your secret lover yeah
id rather share ya than to not have you at all
so once a year or twice a month im here if you want it
yeah im open season
and im always game so i keep it a hundred dear haha
cause we could never be each others everythings you got a wedding ring
so its him instead of me but ill be your second string now and forever because
