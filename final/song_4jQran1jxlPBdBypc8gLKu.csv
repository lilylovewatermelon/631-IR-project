yung germ

verse
in the field is you gonna hold it down or is you gonna squeal
told my bigger brother fuck with me and we gon touch a mill
blood ties you gon get with this well see whos really real
my doggy is you really gonna bleed for me
ima ride up front nobody lead for me
dayones been tryna switch their motherfuckin team on me
shotty to his head i got his dreams on me
little reggie died up in that action he was leaned on me
now i dont do apologies we gon get you back
turn your town to white tees and coffin cadillacs
spin your block in broad day at night we spin it back
kill me before i call in the gunship

chorus
i make shit to raise the citys crime rates
631 we get it done thats just how crime pays
i get drugs and flip em at a high rate
631 dog gang until my die day
i make shit to raise the citys crime rates
631 we get it done thats just how crime pays
i get drugs and flip em at a high rate
631 dog gang until my die dayyou might also like3embed"
