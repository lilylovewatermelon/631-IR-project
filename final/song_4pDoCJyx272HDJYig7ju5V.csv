oh oh uh uh

verse 1
i turn around again and suddenly your gone
i wanna get to know you but i dont know who you are
youre the kind of girl who makes me stop and lose my mind
i wanna get together but youre oh so hard to find
i see you when im at the starbucks as your walkin out the door
i see you when im rentin movies when your leaving the store
i need an opportunity
theres something i wanna ask
i never seem to ever get the chance

chorus
whats your name
whats your name
oh i really wanna know
you got me going crazy
and i want you more and more
oh hey this could be something real
i gotta let you know the way i feel
whats your name
