the test begins now

verse 1
i thought i was smart i thought i was right
i thought it better not to fight
i thought there was a virtue in always being cool
so when it came time to fight
i thought ill just step aside
and that the time would prove you wrong
and that you would be the fool

chorus
i dont know where the sun beams end and the starlights begin
its all a mystery

verse 2
oh to fight is to defend
if its not now then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
for to lose i could accept
but to surrender i just wept and regretted this moment
oh that i i was the fool

chorus 2
i dont know where the sun beams end and the starlights begin
its all a mystery
and i dont know how a man decides whats right for his own life
its all a mystery
see the flaming lips liveget tickets as low as 87you might also likeverse 3
cause im a man not a boy
and there are things you cant avoid
you have to face them when youre not prepared to face them
if i could i would
but youre with him now itd do no good
i should have fought him
but instead i let him
i let him take you

chorus 2
i dont know where the sun beams end and the starlights begin
its all a mystery
and i dont know how a man decides whats right for his own life
its all a mystery

chorus 2
i dont know where the sun beams end and the starlights begin
its all a mystery
and i dont know how a man decides whats right for his own life
its all a mystery
i dont know where the sun beams end and the starlights begin
its all a mystery
a mystery
