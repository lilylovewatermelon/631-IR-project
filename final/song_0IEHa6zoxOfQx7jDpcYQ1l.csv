you dont like the sound of the truth
coming from my mouth
you say that i lack the proof
well baby that might be so
i might get to the end of my life
find out everyone was lying
i dont think that im afraid anymore say that i would rather die trying

chorus
wohoh
swing me way down south
sing me something brave from your mouth
and ill bring you
pearls of water on my hips
and the love in my lips
all the love from my lips

verse 2
this time when he swung the bat
and i found myself laying flat i wondered
what a way to spend a dime
what a way to use the time aint it baby
i looked at my reflection in the window walking past
and i saw a stranger
just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
why the worlds dangerous
you might also likechorus
wohoh
swing me way down south
sing me something brave from your mouth
and ill bring you
pearls of water on my hips
and the love in my lips
all the love from my lips

verse 3
you dont like the sound of the truth
coming from my mouth
you say that i lack the proof
well baby that might be so
tell me whats wrong with having a little faith
in what youre feeling in your heart
why must we be so afraid
and always so far apart

chorus
wohoh
swing me way down south
sing me something brave from your mouth
and ill bring you
pearls of water on my hips
and the love in my lips
all the love from my lipsembed"
