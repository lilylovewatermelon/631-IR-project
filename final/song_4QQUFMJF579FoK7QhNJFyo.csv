oh please dont go i need you
ill please you not mislead you
if you would be my only one
together we move slowly
ill never leave you lonely
if you would be my only one

chorus
if you believe
we were meant to be
whyd you leave me alone

verse 2
what happened to forever
ill try to make things better
if you would be my only one
now six days since weve spoken
ill fix you when youre broken
if you would be my only one

chorus
if you believe
we were meant to be
whyd you leave me alone
if you believe
we were meant to be
whyd you leave me alone

if you love me too
can i call you
my only one
if you say no
i wont let go
my only one

chorus
if you believe
we were meant to be
whyd you leave me alone
if you believe
we were meant to be
whyd you leave me aloneembed"
