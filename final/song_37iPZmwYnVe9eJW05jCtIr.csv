hello little darling
aint no need to worry
feels right in my arms now
why go home be all alone
but if the sun shines know thats because of you
just know thats true

chorus kyle
when all your moneys gone
where will you be
if your love is strong
thats all you need

verse 2 glove
one time you know i love you
with your funky ass style
i love you twice a month since you had our first child
our love runs deep like the blood in my veins
i love you always and always the same
love remains
love your every change
love your every phase
the passing of the day plus when your away
oh darling darling if you stay my love will never change
feel the power when our two hearts will combine
the power is yours and the power is mine
when lovers part you know the sky must cry
write you love letters till my pen runs dry
if you stay good lovin make me wanna fly
if you go rise and fall dip and dive
you who im with so i shine so bright
i love you darling till the day that i die
you might also likerefrain kyle
darling darling said now whered you go
i said ill never know the way you come and go

chorus
when all your moneys gone
where will you be
if your love is strong
thats all you need

verse 3 kyle
call a 911 and its emergency
but even in the 912 do you feel the urgency
to people all around the world who never heard of me
just leave another message please
lord please guide and protect me
i got the love in my heart
i got fire in my soul
this no type of fire that nobody can control
but when im up on the mic
i got the mind overload
they never test me just because they dont rock and roll
im singing oh my god lord have mercy
thought fools were gettin bad
but now theyre even gettin worse see
some things cant be healed up by no doctors or no nurses
its time to stop the fussin and the fightin and the cursin
this world is hopeless but i love it anyway
thats why they givin all the good love awayfor free
and if u need love with your lovin are you brave
come on and give a little good love to me
thats what they want
refrain kyle
darling darling said now whered you go
i said ill never know the way you come and go

chorus
when all your moneys gone
where will you be
if your love is strong
thats all you need

outro kyle
its a long long way from home but hold on
its a long its a long long way but hold on
its a long its a long long way but hold on
its a long its a long long way but hold on

fading out
call a 911 and its emergency
lord please guide and protect me
call a 911 and its emergency
lord please guide and protect me2embed"
