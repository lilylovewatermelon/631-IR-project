that is my greatest fear
that if if i lost control
or did not have control things would just you know
i would be fatal

verse 1
im writing this letter to let you know im really leaving
and no im not keeping your shit
heard you got some new homies got some new hobbies
even a new ho too
maybe she can come help you
maybe she can come lick you
after were done whats done is done
i dont want nothing else to do with it
let me tell you a secret
ive been secretly banging your homeboy
why you in vegas all up on valentines day
why am i so easy to forget like that
it cant be that easy for you to get like that
oh no she didnt ooh yes i did
oh no she didnt ill do it again

chorus
leave me lonely for prettier women
you know i need too much attention for shit like that
you know you wrong for shit like that
i could be your supermodel if you believe
if you see it in me see it in me see it in me
i dont see myself
why i cant stay alone just by myself
wish i was comfortable just with myself
but i need you but i need you but i need you

chorus
leave me lonely for prettier women
you know i need too much attention for shit like that
you know you wrong for shit like that

if you see it in me see it in me see it in me
i dont see myself
