the watcher

verse 1 jayz
things just aint the same for gangstas
but im a lil too famous to shoot these pranksters
all of these rap singers claiming they bangers
doing all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers
disrespectin the game no home training or manners
i was doing this shit when you was shitting in pampers
i was moving them grams fore you knew what a handtohand was
ducking the vans radars and scanners
before you knew what hard white or tan was
i was hitting the turnpike aight with the bammers
i was nice with my hands cause im hype with them hammers
i was pricking my finger fore you knew what a fam was
i had it laid out fore you knew what a plan was
three hundred mil later—now you understand us
yall aint see us coming through vegas
you ever seen so much cham bust in one night
grand fucked up one fight
i was on the peter pan bus
you was putting peter pan up in your room
yall fuckin with whom allow me to retort
you cowards is just now learnin the shit that we taught
you niggas aint know about a robb report
bout a highspeed porsche
ie you niggas aint know how to floss
til i came through the door like eric b for prez
respect me in this bitch
you cant disrespect us ‘cause you got a little check cut
you was sucking em so long fucking your lil neck up
now you too big for your britches you got a few little bitches
you think you hugh hef but you just ridiculous
i blew breath for you midgets i gave life to the game
its only right i got the right to be king
niggas that got life really like what i sing
‘cause they know its really like niggas feel my pain
know the shit i dont write
be the illest shit thats ever been recited in the game
word to the hyphen in my name
jay dash hoffa
the past present nigga the future proper
the holy trinity in hiphop is us
we give dre his props but thats where it stops
its the roc
you might also likebridge truth hurts
i know
you got your eyes on me
i feel you watching me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try
but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you better off not looking at all

chorus terri
everywhere that i go
aint the same as before
people i used to know
just dont know me no more
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low
verse 2 dr dre
im still on top of the game
still droppin flames still cock and aim
still at the top had to rock for the fame
over setbacks theres been a lot since i came
you seen it all how i got how i gained
the momentum when it dropped how i got through the pain
when i roll and shock they watched me reclaim
the streets they made a special spot for my name
dre haters want a stop to my reign
but the music lives in me every drop in my veins
the pride and the pain
all the way back from the rise of my name
see the world clear through the eyes of the man
see the world cheer for the rhymes that i gave
when the beat bangs itll drive em insane the odds that i played
the best to emerge in the game its the watcher
bridge truth hurts
i know
you got your eyes on me
i feel you watching me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try
but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you better off not looking at all

chorus terri
everywhere that i go
aint the same as before
people i used to know
just dont know me no more
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low

verse 3 rakim
im rated r my brain contains graphic things
it turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends
its like watching a movie through a panoramic screen
which means i can see the whole planet in the scene
cash is the topic—the object a fatter pocket
some take the crack and chop it but those that havent got it
take away to add a profit its catastrophic
i take the gat and cock it and ill sit back and watch it
these new york streets is ugly i keep it gully
the world is mine and cant nobody keep it from me
yo my neighborhood is never sunny
in the place where the number one cause of death is money
you can try coping
i seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken
im still alive and scoping
be another hundred years til my skies close in
and ima die with my eyes open—the watcher
bridge truth hurts
i know
you got your eyes on me
i feel you watching me
but it aint hard to see that you cant see me
you try
but what you think you saw
aint what you thought you saw
you better off not looking at all

chorus terri
everywhere that i go
aint the same as before
people i used to know
just dont know me no more
but everywhere that i go
i got people i know
who got people they know
so i suggest you lay low
