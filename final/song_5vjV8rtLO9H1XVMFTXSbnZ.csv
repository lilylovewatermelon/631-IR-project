baby sometimes i feel so naive
thinking you would come back to me
say i fucked up id have to agree
but second chances i do believe in
just give me one reason
we fight make up then fuck
girl thats the sequence
ive been dreaming about the most recent
i dont lie no i dont pretend
and your guard up thats defense
let it down girl i swear i wont let you down
i aint 2pac dont get around
was clueless at first but i get it now i get it now
you know all of my secrets and
you know all of my weaknesses
i cant give that to someone else none of these weak bitches
gotta tell them hoes keep distance
miss how you whisper go deep in it
please dont do that with no one else
just me is that too much

chorus
is that too much yeah
is that too much oh yeah yeah
am i asking for too much
say this shit once say this shit two times
i wont stop til i get back whats mine
i know i fucked up one too many times
is that too much

truth be told i know that somebody
somebody as real as me someone as sincere as me

dont you dare give him the same love
cause what that man do girl i can do it
hold up one time baby girl i can prove it
but this right here so time consuming
and this right here got my mind confusing
what now what now one day one day youll come around

i know i fucked up one too many times13embed"
