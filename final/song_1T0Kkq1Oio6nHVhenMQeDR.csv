no walls can keep me protected
no sleep nothing in between me and the rain
and you cant save me now
im in the grip of a hurricane
im going to blow myself away

chorus
im going out im going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd i see you with someone else
i brace myself because i know its going to hurt
but i like to think at least things cant get any worse

verse 2
no home i dont want shelter
no calm nothing to keep me from the storm
and you cant hold me down
because i belong to the hurricane
its going to blow this all away

chorus
im going out im going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd i see you with someone else
i brace myself because i know its going to hurt
but i like to think at least things cant get any worse
you might also likebridge
i hope that you see me because im staring at you
but when you look over you look right through
then you lean and kiss her on the head
and i never felt so alive and so dead

chorus
im going out im going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd i see you with someone else
i brace myself because i know its going to hurt
im going out
im going out im going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd i see you with someone else
i brace myself because i know its going to hurt
im going out
im going out
im going out
im going out
im going out3embed"
