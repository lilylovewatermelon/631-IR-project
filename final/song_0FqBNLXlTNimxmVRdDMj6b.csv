you know you can make it
but you cant make it alone
you know you can make it
but you cant make it alone

verse
ive been writing letters on the wall
i hope one day youll see them all
and that youre not alone
ive been playing memories in my mind
wishing you were there like all the time
so im not alone

refrain
and im tired of this madness
tired of being stranded
i dont wanna be alone

chorus
you know you can make it
but you cant make it alone

refrain
and im tired of this madness
tired of being stranded
i dont wanna be aloneyou might also like7embed"
