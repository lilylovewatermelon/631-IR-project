ive heard dependence is weak
that i shouldnt need anybody else

can conquer the world if shes by herself

my roots run deep oh
and my heart and souls with them
and im flyin higher than ive ever been cause

where the light always stays on
thats where i feel strong oh
thats where i feel strong oh

into your hands forever
and its beatin louder than ever
