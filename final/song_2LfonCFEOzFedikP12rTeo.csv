sleep and dream of this
death angels kiss
brings final bliss
completely

prechorus
empty they say
death wont you let me stay
empty they say
death hear me call your name
ooh call your name

suicide ive already died
youre just the funeral ive been waiting for
cyanide living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore

verse 2
wait wait patiently
your deathblack wings
unfolding sleep
spreading oer me

prechorus
empty they say
death wont you let me stay
empty they say
death hear me call your name

verse 3
say is that rain or are they tears
that stained your concrete face for years
the crying weeping shedding strife
year after year life after life
an air of freshly broken ground
a concrete angel laid right down
upon the grave which swallows fast
its peace at last
oh peace at last

prechorus
empty they say
death wont you let me stay
empty they say
death hear me call your name
call your name

chorus
suicide ive already died
youre just the funeral ive been waiting for
cyanide living dead inside
break this empty shell forevermore
outro
forevermore
forevermore
its just the funeral ive been waiting for13embed"
