we were born to die we were born to die
we were born to die we were born to die
we were born to die we were born to die
we were born to die we were born to die
we were born to die we were born to die
we were—

verse 1 anthony mars
straight out the mud sippin blood with them demons mane
nobody fucks with me and cous cause we evil mane
i need a buzz need them drugs cause im fiending mane
dont show no love only slugs leave you leaking mane
triple six killer walking round like im percy miller
you bought the issue but i promise that my pistols bigger
heart of a sinner drug dealer something of that mixture
uicide til i die know that they wont miss us

verse 2 lil lonely
it looks like another dark night heart like a shark bite
missing pieces feeling like a different season
mark my words ill be in the dirt flirtin with the worms
all this pain that i exert i got a curse that just gets worse
i know i hate myself
destruction is my seduction sucks when you press my buttons
buzzing on the robitussin chuggin dozens with my cousin
got a couple cuts now i dont feel nothing
