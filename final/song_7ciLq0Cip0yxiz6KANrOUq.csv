baby you dont have to rush
you can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
we dont need to keep it hush
you could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

verse 1
stuck in a limbo halfhypnotized
each time i let you stay the night stay the night ahwoo
up in the mornin uh tangled in sheets
we play the moment on repeat on repeat ahwoo

prechorus
when youre standing there in your underwear
and my tshirt from the night before
with your messedup hair and your feet still bare
would you mind closing the bedroom door ahwoo

chorus
baby you dont have to rush
you can leave a toothbrush at my place at my place
we dont need to keep it hush
you could leave a toothbrush at my place at my place

postchorus

give me somethin ive never known ahwoo
so baby you dont have to rush
you could leave a toothbrush at my place come on at my place
