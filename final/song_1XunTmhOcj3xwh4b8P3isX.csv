its now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow
will be too late
its now or never
my love wont wait

verse 1
when i first saw you
with your smile so tender
my heart was captured
my soul surrendered
i spent a lifetime
waiting for the right time
now that youre near
the time is here at last

chorus
its now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow
will be too late
its now or never
my love wont wait

just like a willow
we would cry an ocean
if we lost true love
and sweet devotion
your lips excite me
let your arms invite me
for who knows when
well meet again this way

its now or never
come hold me tight
kiss me my darling
be mine tonight
tomorrow
will be too late
its now or never
my love wont wait

outro
its now or never
my love wont wait
its now or never
my love wont wait
its now or never
my love wont wait
its now or never
my love wont wait1embed"
