happiness hit her like a train on a track
coming towards her stuck still no turning back
she hid around corners and she hid under beds
she killed it with kisses and from it she fled
with every bubble she sank with a drink
and washed it away down the kitchen sink

prechorus
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
the horses are coming
so you better run

chorus
run fast for your mother run fast for your father
run for your children for your sisters and brothers
leave all your love and your longing behind
you cant carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
cause here they come

bridge
and i never wanted anything from you
except everything you had
and what was left after that too oh
you might also likeverse 2
happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
struck from a great height
by someone who should know better than that

prechorus
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
cause here they come

chorus
run fast for your mother run fast for your father
run for your children for your sisters and brothers
leave all your love and your longing behind
you cant carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses
cause here they come

outro
the dog days are over
the dog days are done here they come
the horses are coming
so you better run here they come
the dog days are over
the dog days are done here they come
the horses are coming
so you better run62embed"
