i think ive had enough
i might get a little drunk
i say whats on my mind
i might do a little time
cause all of my kindness
is taken for weakness

chorus rihanna
now im four five seconds from wildin
and we got three more days til friday
im just tryna make it back home by monday mornin
i swear i wish somebody would tell me
ooh thats all i want
verse 2 kanye west  paul mccartney
woke up an optimist

and we got three more days til friday

and i know that youre up tonight

verse 3 kanye west with rihanna
if i go to jail tonight
promise youll pay my bail
see they want to buy my pride
but that just aint up for sale
