tight squeeze cool breeze
this is something that will never let us down
were about to embark on a lifelong journey
foundation set all in bet
so fire off those pistons a thousand people listening
to the message we convey convey convey convey

dont remind me just blind me
from how far we may fall
weve got to make sure not to stand too tall
too tall too tall too tall too tall
