we took our trousers off the socialists asleep
we talked and talked for hours it was really deep
youre a kind of angel dancing by the table
i was doing fine then i met you

verse 2

lets go start a life somewhere in the weeds
i am usually able but your effect is fatal
i was doing fine then i met you

i was doing fine but then i met yousee matt maltese liveget tickets as low as 41you might also like1embed"
