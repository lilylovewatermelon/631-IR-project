soon as you came in
all the beasts went away
they noticed that youre warm
wait until you leave
then come back for more

prechorus
the ropes hang to keep us all awake
and i should have known

verse 2
as soon as you came in
the agony it went away
i noticed what you wore
to everything
we spoke and more

prechorus
the ropes hang to keep us all awake
and i should have known

chorus
it only takes one break of your pose to get off
to save our place home with you
still the same song

as soon as you came in
is when i believe we both crashed course

chorus
the ropes hang to keep us all awake
and i should have known
it only takes one break of a pose to get off
and to save our place home with you all
thats all it takes
well i should have known
its still the same song5embed"
