hey

verse 1
i met him at the bookstore
he said hed like to get to know me just a little more
asked me to dinner
i said id bring my girlfriend
he said thats cool cause he was gonna bring his best friend
but something happened that i wasnt expecting
his best friend all night had my attention

chorus
knew it was wrong
i couldnt help it
and i dont care
im being selfish
know what i want and i want your best friend
aint gonna front uhhuhh i want your best friend
hey boy i think i like your best friend
would you mind if i dined with your best friend
switch

verse 2
and you can take my girlfriend
i hardly know you so there is no attachment
you take my chair ill sit right there
well see how that feels
and dont be mean and make a scene
it aint a big deal
cause something happened that i wasnt expecting
his best friend all night had my attention

he probably wouldve got the phone call

dont make no sense to leave with the wrong guy
when your best friend could be the love of my life
