fuck steve harvey

verse 1 domo genesis
this life is a game if you wanna play counting all your old mistakes
living it with no delay so fast im getting growing pains
father didnt show me my instincts to take the open lane
i go insane all these problems comin with my growing age
blowing haze tryna clear the doubt thats sitting on my brain
i dont complain but the kid inside mes feeling so restrained
gotta stay gold and let desire rekindle the flame
searching for the fountain of youth when im freein my brain

chorus tyler the creator
bring in the horns you hear that fucking brass
thats little boy nigga with the trumpets
marching with the bandwagon looking for his heart
no sleeve but his hand carry muskets
lurking in the meadows oblivion
motherfuck geppetto hes a leader not a puppet
some professors nuttier than klumps dick
so think before you blink and ayeaye make assumptions
refrain
niggas
your left your left your left right left
niggas is coming
your left your left your left right left
niggas
your left your left your left right left
niggas is coming
your left your left your left right left

they want a story a story i write the shit that i find
very amusing cause all of they fucking stories are boring
its really awkward to know that a bunch of kids do adore me
its like i fathered these fuckers so you wont find me on maury
im still a kid in my heart so i have a problem maturing
but it will come from experiences and shit i see touring
im like a bird when im soaring really high
and im really horny from watching this porn nope but

chorus tyler the creator
bring in the horns you hear that fucking brass
thats little boy nigga with the trumpets
marching with the bandwagon looking for his heart
no sleeve but his hand carry muskets
lurking in the meadows oblivion
motherfuck geppetto hes a leader not a puppet
some professors nuttier than klumps dick
so think before you blink and ayeaye make assumptions

verse 3 tyler the creator
bottom of the countdown shit aint been the same
since i found out hodgy beats ghost wrote for bow wow
now iâ€™m the loud shock value style foulmouth fucker
that your teenage kid likes to bow down
riding around town in seattle
with the same shotgun that kurt used to clickclack boompow
still suicidal but some assume that im cool now
cause i got a fucking award and my own room now
nope but i can flip shit like a couch pillow
and have my death silent like a loose vowel
the bandwagon turned into caboose so
so dont let that little nigga trumpet lose sound
just let him play38embed"
