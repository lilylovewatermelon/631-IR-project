love letters on wet paper
forgivers no takers
an angel who never got wings
you find jesus and its too late
hes already closed the front gate
and the signs flashing no vacancy

verse 1
youve broken my heart for the last time
you promise the truth and you told lies
youve really made me believe
that love was supposed to be free

chorus
love letters on wet paper
forgivers no takers
an angel who never got wings
you find jesus and its too late
hes already closed the front gate
and the signs flashing no vacancy

verse 2
ill never forget how he used to be
but im better off living with memories
i know that its gonna hurt
but i dont think it gets any worse
