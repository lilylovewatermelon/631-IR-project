this boats sinking down to the ocean floor
i’m still drinking drinking from the night before
i’m wishing im wishing right now i was fishing
i’m thinking i’m thinking but my mind’s not listening
i never felt so far away
i never lived before today
it’s been a while since i’ve seen your face
it’s been a while time to turn the page

chorus
i wanna go home i want to go home
i want to feel the way i did
i want to go home i want to go home
back back to the way it was

verse 2
i got a feeling and this feeling won’t go away
i’m not leaving i’m waiting for a brighter day
and i believe it that good things are coming our way
so keep dreaming i’m feeling like i’m dreaming always
it never felt so strange to me
my guitar is all all i need
it’s been a while since i’ve been down this road
and it’s been a while good things come and go

if the sun is getting closer
then why does it feel cold
and in the eyes of the world i’m older
i can’t take it much longer

just a little bit longer
the music making us stronger
just a little bit longer
the music making us stronger
just a little bit longer
the music making us stronger
just a little bit longer
in the eyes of the world2embed"
