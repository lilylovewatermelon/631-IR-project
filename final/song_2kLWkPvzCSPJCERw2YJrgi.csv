i spend all of my money on celery
guarantee theres no stopping me
when the plate i see contains broccoli
like i told you before im hardcore
all the food that i score goes in the vegetable drawer
some people bring soda to your house and share it
but the party dont start til i show up with my carrot

call dr phil and warn oprah
im gonna eat up all of the okra
im notorious im nefarious
i dont spare one spear of asparagus
you think youre tough you think youre hard
im gonna eat the chard right out your yard
my enemies cower when they feel the power
that i gain when i devour a cauliflower

i i like vegetables
i i like vegetables oh
i i like vegetables
i i like vegetables i can eat a billion turnips

let me hear you shout let me hear you shout
im gonna get crazy on a brussel sprout
were gonna get crazy on a brussel sprout
were gonna get crazy on a brussel sprout yeah
