tell me why when you look me in the eye
do i feel like i want to die
ive been at work all day in the pouring rain
just to give you something youll forget

prechorus
and i would never hate you but youre hard to love
and i would never leave you but youre hard to love

chorus
youre hard to love youre hard to love
youre hard to love youre hard to love
but youre hard to love

verse 2
and i dont know why after all this time
every single song i sing is about you
and you walk away you just walk away
but i still make your bed and you still leave me for dead

prechorus
and i would never hate you but youre hard to love
and i would never leave you but youre hard to love

chorus
youre hard to love youre hard to love
youre hard to love youre hard to love
but youre hard to love
