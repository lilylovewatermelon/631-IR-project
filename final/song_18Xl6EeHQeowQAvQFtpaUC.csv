and im still gon have my way i aint ever gon see no problem
yeah you could be a million miles away im still gon climb that mountain
yeah this money just keep on gettin in my way this shit too hypnotizing
these niggas keep on tryna ride my wave they must be suicidal
everything i do like way too big i gotta supersize it
my bitch ass like way too fucking fat its like she supersized it
my lil neck like way too fucking cold i got too many diamonds
rockstar bitch i call her alice glass we in a crystal castle
