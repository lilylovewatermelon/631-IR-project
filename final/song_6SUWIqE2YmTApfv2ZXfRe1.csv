to a lullaby in ragtime
sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock
play a lullaby in ragtime
you can tell the sandman is on his way
by the way that they play
as still as the trill of a thrush in a twilight hush

so you can hear the rhythm of the ripples
on the side of the boat
as you sail away to dreamland
high above the moon you hear a silvery note
as the sandman takes your hand
so rockaby my baby
dont you cry my baby
sleepytime is nigh
wont you rock me to a ragtime lullaby

wont you play the music so the cradle can rock goodnight
to a lullaby in ragtime time to call it a day
sleepy hands are creeping to the end of the clock sleep tight
play a lullaby in ragtime drеam your troubles away
you can tell the sandman is on his way goodnight
by thе way that they play in spite of any sorrows
as still as the trill of a thrush in a twilight hush
theres a brand new day on its way tomorrow
you might also likeso you can hear the rhythm of the ripples some day
on the side of the boat
as you sail away to dreamland  all your dreams will come true
high above the moon you hear a silvery note some way
as the sandman takes your hand for me and you
so rockaby my baby so close your eyes
dont you cry my baby
sleepytime is nigh and dream of me my darling
wont you rock me to a ragtime lullaby
til then goodnight
goodnight sleep tightembed"
