a little sleep a little slumber
a little folding of the hands
left you weak left you hungry
when theres supply you still demand
youre beginning to drag the ones you love down
will this phase ever end
a thousand arms to hold you
but you wont reach for any hands cause
​
prechorus
i dont feel like im getting through to you
let me paint this clear
life is short my dear
see your mother here
her last painful year
i wish you only knew
she stuck around for you
she stuck around for you
​
chorus
maybe you should just fall
and leave the world and lose it all
and if thats what you need to finally see
ill be with you through it all​
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeverse 2
bring on the pills roll the dollar bill
medicating will never heal
relapse rehab repeat
always thinking about the me me me
selfdestruct spiral down
until your want becomes your need
please get up like i know you can
or forever love the fall cause

prechorus

let me paint this wheel
life is short my dear

and leave the world and lose it all leave the world and lose it all
and if thats what you need to finally see

i cant stand to see you down
strung out off the wagon and unwound
but steady steady oh god jenny jenny
i cant bear to hear the sound
of your body body hitting the ground
i cant stand to see you down
strung out off the wagon and unwound
but steady steady oh god jenny jenny
i cant bear to hear the sound
of your body body hitting the ground
oh jenny jenny jenny she stuck around for you
she stuck around for you she stuck around for you
​

leave the world and lose it all

maybe you should just fall leave the world and lose it all
all if thats what you need to finally see
she loved you through it all​
