if i gave you the truth would it keep you alive
though im closer to wrong im no further from right
and now im convinced on the inside somethings wrong with me
convinced on the inside youre so much more than me yeah

verse 2
no theres nothing you say that can salvage the lie
but im tryin to keep my intentions disguised
and now im deprived of my conscience and somethings got to give
deprived of my conscience this all belongs to me yeah

beaten down again ive failed you
im weaker now my friend i belong to them
beaten down again ive failed you

verse 3
the deception you show is your own parasite
just a word of advice you can heed if you like
and now im convinced on the inside somethings wrong with me
convinced on the inside youre so much more than me yeah
