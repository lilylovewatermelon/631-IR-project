well its midnight damn right were wound up too tight
ive got a fist full of whiskey the bottle just bit me
oh
that shit makes me bat shit crazy
weve got no fear no doubt all in balls out

chorus
were going out tonight hey
to kick out every light hey
take anything we want hey
drink everything in sight hey
were going till the world stops turning
while we burn it to the ground tonight
ooh
ooh

verse 2
were screaming like demons swinging from the ceiling
i got a fist full of fifties tequila just hit me
oh
we got no class no taste no shirt and shit faced
we got it lined up shot down firing back straight crown

chorus
were going out tonight hey
to kick out every light hey
take anything we want hey
drink everything in sight hey
were going till the world stops turning
while we burn it to the ground tonight
ooh

to kick out every light hey
