you stumble through your days
got your head hung low your skys a shade of gray
like a zombie in a maze
youre asleep inside but you can shake awake

prechorus hugh jackman
cause youre just a dead man walkin
thinkin thats your only option
but you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
sun is up and the colors blindin
take the world and redefine it
leave behind your narrow mind youll never be the same

chorus hugh jackman
come alive come alive
go and light your light let it burn so bright
reachin up to the sky
and its open wide youre electrified
and the world becomes a fantasy
and youre more than you could ever be
cause youre dreamin with your eyes wide open
and you know you cant go back again
to the world that you were livin in
cause youre dreamin with your eyes wide open
so come alive

i see it in your eyes
you believe that lie that you need to hide your face
afraid to step outside
so you lock the door but dont you stay that way

prechorus keala settle daniel everidge ensemble hugh jackman
no more livin in those shadows

cause once you see it oh youll never never be the same
little bit of lightnin strikin
bottled up to keep on shinin
you can prove theres more to you you cannot be afraid
