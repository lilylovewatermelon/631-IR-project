were spendin too much time alone
spendin too much time alone
and i just ran outta trojans
horses gallop to her throne
were behaving like teenagers
yes were behaving like teenagers
making less than minimum wage
still inside our parents homes
no i dont live in denver
no i dont live in denver
i grew up in sierra leone
and her pink skies will keep me warm

chorus
sierra leone
sierra leone
tid bits of intuition that i be gettin abandon mission
sierra leone
abandon mission you must be kiddin this shit feelin different
shit feelin too good to me
glistening shimmerin underneath the sunlight the sunlight
sierra leone

verse 2
and a new day will bring about the dawn
and a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
girl now
our daughters reaching for your nipple cause its time for her to eat reaching for ya
tonight ill lay her in the cradle if its time to go to sleep oh go to sleep oh oh
ill sing a lennon lullaby she can have a pretty dream
baby girl if you knew what i know knew what i know
