in the valley of the dolls we sleep
we sleep
got a hole inside of me
of me

prechorus
born with a void
hard to destroy with love or hope
built with a heart broken from the start
and now i die slow

chorus
in the valley of the dolls we sleep
got a hole inside of me
living with identities
that do not belong to me
in my life i got this far
now i’m ready for the last hoorah
dying like a shooting star
in the valley
in the valley
in the valley

chorus
in the valley of the dolls we sleep
got a hole inside of me
living with identities
that do not belong to me
in my life i got this far
now i’m ready for the last hoorah
dying like a shooting star
in the valley
in the valley
in the valley

bridge
back to zero here we go again again
racing down into oblivion
back to zero here we go
i can feel it coming to the end the end

chorus
in the valley of the dolls we sleep
got a hole inside of me
living with identities
that do not belong to me
in my life i got this far
now i’m ready for the last hoorah
dying like a shooting star
in the valley
in the valley
in the valley
outro
in the valley
