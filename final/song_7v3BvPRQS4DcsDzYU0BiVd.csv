i had big plans for our future
said id give you the whole world somehow
i tried makin good on that promise
thought id be so much further by now
never could build you a castle
even though youre the queen of my heart
but ive had the best of intentions from the start

verse 2
now some people think im a loser
cause i seldom get things right
but you make me feel like a winner
when you wrap me in your arms so tight
please tell me you will remember
no matter how much i do wrong
that i had the best of intentions all along

chorus
id gave you a ring and i promised you things
i always thought wed do
but my bestlaid plans slipped right through my hands
to show my love for you
and if you could read my heart
then youd know without exception
it was all with the best of intentions

outro
so here i am asking forgiveness
and praying that youll understand
dont think i take you for granted
girl i know just how lucky i am
though you deserve so much better
you wont find devotion more true
cause ive had the best of intentions
girl ive had the best of intentions
yes ive had the best of intentions
loving you1embed"
