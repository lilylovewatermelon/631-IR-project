old gray fence tarchip road
martins creek almost home
whitetail buck by a one lane bridge
around the bend up on the ridge
theres thompsons barn leaning just a little
miss myras store smell the barbecue
make you stop for gas when you dont need to
at least 20 miles to the nearest town
hills and hollers all around
and thats me right there in the middle

chorus
in the middle of what matters most
fathers sons and the holy ghost
open hearts and unlocked doors
a way of life worth dying fighting for
if you wonderin where ill be
take out a map of tennessee
and youll find me than right there in the middle

verse 2
rick of wood stacked by the porch
black lab pup scratching at the door
two little boys sayin daddys back
next thing i know its a wrestling match
and thats me yeah thats me

outro
in middle of nowhere no where id rather be
the good lord up above and his earth beneath my feet
surrounded by folks who love meembed"
