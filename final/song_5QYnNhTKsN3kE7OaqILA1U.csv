i thought itd feel different playin wembley
eighty thousand singin with me
its what ive been chasin cause this is the dream
when it was all over i cleared out the room
grabbed a couple beers just me and you
then we started talking the way that we do

prechorus
aint it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
little moments that pass us by
oh but i remember

chorus
the first kiss the first night the first song that made you cry
the first drink red wine on a step in brooklyn
i still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
and i cant wait to make a million more first times
mmm mmm

verse 2
the greatest thing that i have achieved
was four little words down on one knee
you said darling are you jokin and i just said please

prechorus
aint it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
little moments that pass us by
oh but i remember

the first kiss the first night the first song that made you cry
the first look in your eyes when i said i love you
i can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
i cant wait to make a million more first times
mmm mmm

prechorus
aint it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
little moments that pass us by
oh but i remember

chorus
the first kiss first night first song that made you cry
first dance in moonlight in your parents garden
i cant wait to see everything thats yet to be
our first child and then a million more first times11embed"
