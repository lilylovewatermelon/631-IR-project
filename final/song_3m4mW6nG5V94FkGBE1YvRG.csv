new to town with a madeup name
in the angels city chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
so overnight you look like a sixties queen

prechorus 1
another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky

chorus 1
and they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
but can you tell me now you’re the lucky one
oh oh oh

verse 2
now it’s big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you’re lucky but you’re so confused
cause you don’t feel pretty you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place

another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you’ll make it out alive

chorus 1
and they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
but can you tell me now you’re the lucky one
oh oh oh

verse 3
it was a few years later i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time but i understand it now

prechorus 3
cause now my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right

chorus 2
let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
let me tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
and they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
and they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh32embed"
