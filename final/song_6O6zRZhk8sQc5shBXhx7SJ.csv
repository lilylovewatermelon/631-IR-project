yyo ohoh ohoh ohoh oh

verse 1
padded by locks the door knob singed
a rusty close to a door knob hinge
remembering the sounds
we used to know

but when those sounds sang from our halls
the backstop pressed against bleached walls
do you remember the sound
of snow

prechorus 1
and these flames
boil in reclaim on the way down

chorus
i can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh

on the way down
you might also likei can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh

postchorus 1
behind the road
you wait for
love

verse 2
so i said follow me down this time
i wrote the rules but youve got the time
so can you help me
ive got to break free

prechorus 2
from these chains
oh from these chains on the way down

chorus
i can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh
on the way down

i can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh

postchorus 2
yyo ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
yyo ohoh ohoh oh oh

bridge
your eyes are closed before us
your sighs are all around
inside the walls have fallen
and now youre all alone

chorus
i can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh

on the way down

i can follow you
your heart beats just like i wanted it to
and you want it too
ohwhoa ohoh oh
postchorus 1
behind the road
you wait for
love
