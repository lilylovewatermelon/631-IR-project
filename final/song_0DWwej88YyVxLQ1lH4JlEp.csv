i wish i could back up and start all over
cause now id know better the best way to love her
the words i would tell her the time i would give her
i wish i could back up and start all over

time takes you places you never knew youd be going
it softens the edges of memories youre towing
it changes the reasons you wanted to hold her
i wish i could back up and start all over

verse 2
i wish i could back up and start all over
id make the first time feel like forever
not to be younger maybe just to be smarter
i wish i could back up and start all over

chorus
time takes you places you never knew youd be going
it softens the edges of memories youre towing
it changes the reasons you wanted to hold her
i wish i could back up and start all over

verse 3
i wish i could back up and start all over
and days i would take back nights id wanna make longer
moments id never just throw over my shoulder
i wish i could back up and start all over

but its never too late to wanna do better
for loves never easy changes just like the weather
some days its raining some are sunny and blue
and theres never perfect but theres faithful and true

chorus
time takes you places you never knew youd be going
it softens the edges of memories youre towing
it changes the reasons you wanted to hold her
i wish i could back up and start all over
