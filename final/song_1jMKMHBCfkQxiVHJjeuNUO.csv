its not the end of the world
in fact its not even the end of the summer
but thank god the tv is on
cause theres no way we could know
anything thats going down
or how were supposed to be feeling about it
i cant tell you how much i wish we could shut up and smile yeah

chorus
sail around the world and tell them all to keep singing it
la la la la la
all we needs a harmony and well convince the world to sing
la la la la la
throw your arms around someone
throw your arms around someone
maybe spread a little love
i know it sounds a little dumb
or maybe im a little drunk
but all we need is some ice cream and a hug

verse 2
take a good look around
does life really suck are we just complaining
i hope that this mic is on testing 1 2 cause im on a roll here
i hope this is making some sense
i hope that youll throw up your hands and sing it
and tell all the haters that they should just shut up and smile yeah

sail around the world and tell them all to keep singing it
la la la la la
all we needs a harmony and well convince the world to sing
la la la la la
throw your arms around someone
throw your arms around someone
maybe spread a little love
i know it sounds a little dumb
or maybe im a little drunk
but all we need is some ice cream

bridge
all we need is love and beer
and old school metal and holiday cheer
to be happy like ben and jerry
all you need is someone near to hold you close and pretend that they care
can we all just get along now
we found something that we all have in common now
we can hold hands do keg stands
water skiing sounds great to me now

chorus
sail around the world and tell them all to keep singing it
la la la la la
all we needs a harmony and well convince the world to sing
la la la la la
throw your arms around someone
throw your arms around someone
maybe spread a little love
i know it sounds a little dumb
or maybe im a little drunk
but all we need is some ice cream and a hug
outro
all we need is some ice cream and a hug
all we need is some ice cream and a hug
all we need is some ice cream and a hug
all we need is love and beer
all we need is love and beer
all we need is love and beer
all we need is love and beer1embed"
