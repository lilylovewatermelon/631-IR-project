let us pause in lifes pleasures and count its many tears
while we all sup sorrow with the poor
theres a song that will linger forever in our ears
oh hard times come again no more

chorus
it’s the song the sign of the weary
hard times hard times come again no more
many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
oh hard times come again no more

verse 2
while we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
there are frail forms fainting at the door
though their voices are silent their pleading looks will say
oh hard times come again no more

chorus

verse 3
theres a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
with a worn heart whose better days are oer
though her voice it would be merry its sighing all the day
oh hard times come again no more
