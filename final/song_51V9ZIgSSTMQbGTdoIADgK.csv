i keep falling out of line
i was drained and left behind
all will fade and petrify
feed the hate and starve the lies

prechorus
falling in between
i am caught beneath

chorus
light the way and let me go
suffocate inside
i will break and watch you crawl
bury me alive

verse 2
i keep falling out of time
i was blamed and cauterized
all will change and calcify
feed the hate and starve the lies

falling in between
i am caught beneath
