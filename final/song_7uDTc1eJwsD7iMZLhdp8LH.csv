verse 1
i got 2020 vision when i see her
pulled up in the lamb shouldve pulled up in the bm
rippers in my denim cause a young nigga was flexin
and if we end it early baby girl then it was destined
i even had to stop answerin your calls
a nigga had you trappin with the scammers and the dawgs
drivin over border with the hammers in the car
when the cops pulled me over wouldve hand it to my dawgs
i mean who needs love with these hammers in my fists
and she gon fuck me over give a damn about a bitch
debit credit cards on me slammin in this bitch
dont wanna take her back she did the damage in this bitch
tell me who needs love

i said i was doin wrong back when you was livin right
cool a couple milli sittin with me on the flight ayy
tryna get me back and fuckin niggas out of spite
and you sittin on that nigga dick when it dont sit right with ya
had to tell her look here though
you could fuck a thousand niggas only thing thats finna be hurt is your pussy ho
and if i get at it baby girl you know im superstar status
dont you ever try to play me like a rookie though
big big dreams got you sittin in a mansion
laid up in my covers while you thinkin bout expansion
cant believe you even fucked that nigga he a random
had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
shawty i aint worried bout no nigga drip im drippin the best
the cullinan seats orange cause its drippin hermès
no matter what she tellin you fuck i dicked her the best
fuck the drama i put dick in her chest yes
