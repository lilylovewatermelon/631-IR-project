you know the story
you read the books
boy meets girl
then they fall forever in love
but i know better
so here goes a tale
of the realest of the real
listen
now once upon a time in a small world
it was everything that i dreamed of
he was my gem and i was his pearl
nothing could come between us
a prince charming to call my own
until the day that he broke my heart
and left me wonderin all alone
pickin my mind and soul apart

chorus
used to believe in love i used to believe in love
used to believe in fairy tales in fairy tales
since my hearts been crushed its been crushed
dont believe in much i need help no no no no no
dont know which way to turn
figure it out for myself
ive just started to learn la da da dee oh
theres no such thing as fairy tales

is a good story supposed to end
unhappily ever after
just as wonderful as it begins
and carry on for a few chapters
baby how come each time i open up
i cant seem to get past page one
i guess its time for me to close up
and go back on the shelf because im done

chorus
used to believe in love i used to believe in love
used to believe in fairy tales in fairy tales
since my hearts been crushed since my hearts been crushed
dont believe in much i need help
dont know which way to turn i dont know which way to turn
figure it out for myself
ive just started to learn la da da dee oh
theres no such thing as fairy tales

bridge
twinkle twinkle little star
why do my dreams seem so far why they seem so far
up above the world so high
wont somebody tell me why can you help me
can you help me out
can you tell me what love is all about
cause i never known it for myself dont believe in fairy tales
thats why i dont believe in fairy tales no more
chorus
used to believe in love no more
used to believe in fairy tales i used to believe i used to believe i used to believe
since my hearts been crushed
dont believe in much i need help i dont believe in much
dont know which way to turn
figure it out for myself oh no no no no no
ive just started to learn just started to learn
theres no such thing as fairy tales theres no such thing as fairy tales
used to believe in love
used to believe fairy tales la da da da
since my hearts been crushed
dont believe in much i need help
dont know which way to turn i dont know which way
figure it out for myself
ive just started to learn
theres no such thing as fairy talesembed"
