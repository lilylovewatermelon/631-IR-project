to see what i could see
my black shroud
holding down my feelings
a pillar for my enemies
i should have wrote a letter
and grieve what i happen to grieve
my black shroud
i never trust my feelings
i waited for the remedy
when i was three three maybe four
she left us at that video store
oh be my rest be my fantasy
oh be my rest be my fantasy
i’m light as a feather
i’m bright as the oregon breeze
my black shroud
frightened by my feelings
i only wanna be a relief
no i’m not a gogetter
the demon had a spell on me
my black shroud
captain of my feelings
the only thing i wanna believe
you might also likewhen i was three and free to explore
i saw her face on the back of the door
oh be my rest be my fantasy
oh be my rest be my fantasy
i should have known better
nothing can be changed
the past is still the past
the bridge to nowhere
i should have wrote a letter
explaining what i feel that empty feeling
don’t back down concentrate on seeing
the breakers in the bar the neighbor’s greeting
my brother had a daughter
the beauty that she brings illumination
don’t back down there is nothing left
the breakers in the bar no reason to live
i’m a fool in the fetter fool in the fetter
rose of aaron’s beard where you can reach me

don’t back down nothing can be changed
cantilever bridge the drunken sailor
my brother had a daughter brother had a daughter
the beauty that she brings illumination illumination
