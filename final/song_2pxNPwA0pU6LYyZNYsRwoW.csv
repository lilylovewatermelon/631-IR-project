ever since the day you went away
and left me lonely and cold
my life just hasnt been the same
oh baby no
when i looked into your eyes
the moment that i let you go i just broke down

baby if i ever get the chance to be with you again
i would sacrafice
cause the feelin that i feel within no other man would ever make me feel so right
its nice to smile when i get your phone call at night
but i rather have you here with me
right next to me
and i miss the way you hold me tight

ive got to let you know i feel so weak without your touch
i never thought that i could ever love a man so much
ive gotta let you know i think that we are destiny
for you id cross the world for you
id do anything

thats right baby
im goin crazy
i need to be your lady
i been thinkin lately
that you and me yes we can make it
just ride with me roll with me
im in love with you baby

im goin crazy
i need to be your lady
i been thinkin lately
that you and me yes we can make it
just ride with me roll with me
im in love with you baby

break it down then ill tell you what i feel
from the moment that i met you its been so damn real
my heart seems to skip another beat every time we speak
cant belive i feel so weak
tell me that you really need me

and you want me
and you miss me

and you love me
im your lady
ill be around waitin for you
put it down be the woman for you
im fallin so deep for you

callin out to you
what am i gonna do
its true no frontin
its u aint no other
i can no longer go on without you
i just break down down
ive got to let you know i feel so weak without your touch
i never thought that i could ever love a man so much
ive gotta let you know i think that we are destiny
for you id cross the world for you
id do anything

thats right baby
im goin crazy

i been thinkin lately
that you and me yes we can make it
