verse
i was on my way to the show and it finally hit me
i dont wanna be here no more lord come and get me
no i aint ready to die like im biggie
just wanna jump in my car fill it with gas and go far and not look back
i walk in the mall with ten thousand on me yeah
i dont see nothing i want yeah yeah
it dont excite me no more this shit just aint like me no more
i think its safe to say i finally understand my big brother
or why he left his family and why he kept on runnin
that shit can cause insanity when problems keep on comin
plus we come from out the struggle nobody gave us nothing
but its a different story for me
it seems i got everything that i ever dreamed yeah
but i cant find no peace
say he got everything he wanted
cars clothes and money but nobody i can trust in
lord i got a question is heaven real
if so then why you kept us here
