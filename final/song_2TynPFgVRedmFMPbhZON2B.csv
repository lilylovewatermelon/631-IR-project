verse 1
you seen her walkin through
hartsfield international
on her way to see me
shes far from the girl that you used to know
flossin keys to your phantom and you know that shes my girl
still you try to get at her
but she put the brakes on that shit like skkrt
and i dont blame you cause god the girl look good
she said she couldnt even if she could

hook
she needs my love
she said im like the air and without me shell die
if it aint my love
you better have a doctor on standby
