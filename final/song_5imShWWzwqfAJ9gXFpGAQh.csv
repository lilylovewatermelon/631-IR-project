verse 1
me and all my friends
were all misunderstood
they say we stand for nothing and
theres no way we ever could
now we see everything thats going wrong
with the world and those who lead it
we just feel like we dont have the means
to rise above and beat it

chorus
so we keep waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
its hard to beat the system
when were standing at a distance
so we keep waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change

verse 2
now if we had the power
to bring our neighbors home from war
they would have never missed a christmas
no more ribbons on their door
and when you trust your television
what you get is what you got
cause when they own the information oh
they can bend it all they want

thats why were waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
its not that we dont care
we just know that the fight aint fair
so we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change

guitar solo

chorus
and were still waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
one day our generation
is gonna rule the population
so we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change

outro
now we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting waiting
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
