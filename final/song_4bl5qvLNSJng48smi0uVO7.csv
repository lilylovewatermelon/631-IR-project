why dont we kill the lights
im no good at hiding underneath a sea of tears
flood pouring through my eyes
i cant even close em i cant even see you clear

prechorus
and when youre looking in the mirror
demons may be closer than they may appear
you can either cry and sit and stare
or try to run away im tryna run away

chorus
im staring at a ghost
im staring at a ghost

verse 2
why dont we take a walk
everybody knows a hand to hold is all we need
quiet shh lets not even talk
every word i say to you you only just repeat

prechorus
and when youre looking in the mirror
demons may be closer than they may appear
you can either cry and sit and stare
or try to run away im tryna run away

im staring at a ghost

bridge
blood is on our hands we never understand
living just to die another day
powder on our face carries us away
reaching for a dream that always fades
madness in a smile
wont you stay a while

chorus
im staring at a ghost
im staring at a ghost
im staring at a ghost5embed"
