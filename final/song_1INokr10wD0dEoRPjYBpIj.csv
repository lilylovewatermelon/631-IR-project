when the wind blew across the wild moor
when mary came wandering home with her child
til she came to her own fathers door

father dear father she cried
come down and open the door
or the child in my arms will perish and die
from the winds that blow across the wild moor

but her father was deaf to her cry
not a sound of a voice did he hear
so the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
and the wind blew across the wild moor

oh how the old man must have felt
when he came to the door the next morn
and he found mary dead but the child still alive
closely grasping his dead mothers arm

in grief the old man passed away
and the child to its mother went soon
and no one they say lives there to this day
and the cottage to ruin has gone

but the villagers point out the spot
where the willows grew over the door
saying there mary died once the gay village bride
from the wind that blew across the wild mooryou might also likeembed"
