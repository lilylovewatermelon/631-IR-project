i aint going nowhere baby
rest your worries somewhere else
high up on a self now baby
next to all your other doubts
things have been real crazy lately
but i aint going nowhere baby

verse 2
if you need to cry girl heres a shoulder
sometimes i feel like crying too
every day im getting older
but that dont change this thing ive got for you
youre the only thing that saves me
so i aint going nowhere baby

chorus
the radios full of them good love songs
cant hold a candle to a love this strong
it goes on and on keeps getting stronger
yeah every time you lie next to me
i still feel like im seventeen
nothing turns me on the way you turn me on

verse 3
i aint going nowhere baby
i cancelled all your plans today
we both need some healing baby
yeah take my hand and ill lead the way
lets lock the door and love like crazy
cause i aint going nowhere baby
