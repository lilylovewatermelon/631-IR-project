my mistress

verse 1
i stand on the brink of your mind
living inside a nightmare from which
i just cannot awaken
stand on the edge of your life
just give me another moment
from which i will never awaken

chorus
stand on the brink of my own demise
fallen again for another
mistress of burden
to idolize
hoping that one of them will decide
to let me in

bridge
my mistress

verse 2
to stand on the edge of the knife
cutting through the nightmare from which
i just cannot awaken
stand on the edge of the night
living inside a moment
from which i will never awaken

stand on the brink of my own demise
fallen again for another
mistress of burden
to idolize
hoping that one of them will decide
to let me in

bridge
look at what youve done to me
youve become my enemy
poisoning the world for me
take away my everything
weakened as i am

never awaken

chorus
stand on the brink of my own demise
fallen again for another
mistress of burden
to idolize
hoping that one of them will decide
to let me in

outro
my mistress
decide to let me in
my mistress
decide to let me inembed"
