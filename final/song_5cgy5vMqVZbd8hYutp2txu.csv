wrong but it feels so right

show me your legs up high
i don’t wanna kiss all night kiss all night

verse 1
if you want me say you want me
treadin softly on my body while you tell me
that you’re takin it slow but you’re pullin me close
if i bow to the throne is it better than us
give me comfort give me warnin
when i wake you’rе always missin in the mornin
but you don’t need to run if you’re looking for love
said it’s only a touch is it bеtter than us to you

can’t talk with your tongue in my mouth
i was thinkin bout us when you’re runnin about
saw another one’s car at the front of the house
knew i never meant much but it’s killin me now
mmm mmm
tell me all the things i wanna hear so come here
beautiful anyone will do

if it’s only a touch was it better than us to you
