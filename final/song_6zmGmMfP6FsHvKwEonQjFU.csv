we dissolve everything
scratch follicles so they dont grow
expose your shame for all to see
sell your bones as ivory

chorus
perfume in my blood
nails grow through the glove
bruise my embryo
lay them down lay them down in rows

verse 2
i sleep for you when youre exhausted
your first born will be accosted
fill their lungs with tar and sage
make the stem cells act their age

chorus
perfume in my blood
nails grow through the glove
bruise my embryo
lay them down lay them down in rows

outro
perfume in perfume in my bloodyou might also like3embed"
