real friends how many of us
how many of us how many jealous real friends
its not many of us we smile at each other
but how many honest trust issues
switched up the number i cant be bothered
i cannot blame you for havin an angle
i aint got no issues im just doin my thing
hope youre doin your thing too
im a deadbeat cousin i hate family reunions
fuck the church up by drinkin at the communion
spillin free wine now my tux is ruined
in town for a day what the fuck we doin
who your real friends we all came from the bottom
im always blamin you but whats sad you not the problem
