to my mother to my father
its your son or its your daughter
are my screams loud enough for
you to hear me should i turn this up for you
chorus
i sit here locked inside my head
remembering everything you said
the silence gets us nowhere
gets us nowhere way too fast

verse 2
the silence is what kills me
i need someone here to help me
but you dont know how to listen
and let me make my decisions

chorus
i sit here locked inside my head
remembering everything you said
the silence gets us nowhere
gets us nowhere way too fast

verse 3
all your insults and your curses
make me feel like im not a person
and i feel like i am nothing
but you made me so do something
cause im fucked up because you all
need attention attention you couldnt give
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
cause i sit here locked inside my head
remembering everything you said
the silence gets us nowhere
gets us nowhere way too fast
i sit here locked inside my head
remembering everything you said
the silence gets us nowhere
gets us nowhere way too fast2embed"
