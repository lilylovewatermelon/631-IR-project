three little birds sat on my window
and they told me i dont need to worry
summer came like cinnamon so sweet
little girls doubledutch on the concrete

prechorus
maybe sometimes
weve got it wrong but its alright
the more things seem to change
the more they stay the same
ooh dont you hesitate

chorus
girl put your records on
tell me your favorite song
you go ahead let your hair down
sapphire and faded jeans
i hope you get your dreams
just go ahead let your hair down

postchorus
youre gonna find yourself somewhere somehow

verse 2
blue as the sky sunburnt and lonely
sipping tea in a bar by the roadside just relax just relax
dont you let those other boys fool you
got to love that afro hairdo

maybe sometimes
we feel afraid but its alright
the more you stay the same
the more they seem to change

chorus

twas more than i could take
pity for pitys sake
some nights kept me awake
i thought that i was stronger
when you gonna realize
that you dont even have to try any longer
do what you want to
