that there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a king called shahrimánfn220 who was lord of many troops and guards and officers and who reigned over certain islands known as the khálidán islandsfn221 on the borders of the land of the persians but he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted without having been blessed with a son albeit he had four wives daughters of kings and threescore concubines with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turnfn222 this preyed upon his mind and disquieted him so that he complained thereof to one of his wazirs saying verily i fear lest my kingdom be lost when i die for that i have no son to succeed me the minister answered o king peradventure allah shall yet bring something to pass so rely upon the almighty and be instant in prayer it is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy and let them eat of thy food and supplicate the lord to vouchsafe thee a son for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance and thereby thou shalt win thy wish so the king rose made the lesser ablution and prayed a twobow prayerfn223 then he cried upon allah with pure intention after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright by grace of god she conceived and when her months were accomplished she bore a male child like the moon on the night of fulness the king named him kamar alzamánfn224 and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour so they decorated the streets seven days whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight until he reached the age of fifteen he grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night one day he complained to a certain of his ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child saying o thou the wazir of a truth i fear for my son kamar alzaman the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would i marry him in my lifetime answered the wazir o king know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime ere thou make him sultan on this quoth the king hither with my son kamar alzaman so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire o kamar al zaman said king shahriman of a truth i desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime replied he o my father know that i have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women for that concerning their craft and perfidy i have read many books and heard much talk even as saith the poet

now an of women ask ye i reply—
             in their affairs im versed a doctor rare
when mans head grizzles and his money dwindles 
             in their affections he hath naught for share

and another said—

rebel against women and so shalt thou serve allah the more 
             the youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to
             soar
theyll baulk him when seeking the strange device excelsior 
             tho waste he a thousand of years in the study of science
             and lore 

and when he had ended his verses he continued o my father wedlock is a thing whereto i will never consent no not though i drink the cup of death when sultan shahriman heard these words from his son light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king shahriman heard these words from his son the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his sons lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage yet for the great love he bore him he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection all this and kamar alzaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace and the king bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit all men were ravished with his charms and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing for he was honeysweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways his shape was as the willowwand or the rattan cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone he was in fine the pink of perfection even as the poet hath said of him

he came and cried they now be allah blest 
             praise him that clad that soul in so fair vest
hes king of beauty where the beauteous be 
             all are his ryotsfn225 all obey his hest
his lipdews sweeter than the virgin honey 
             his teeth are pearls in double row close press
all charms are congregate in him alone 
             and deals his loveliness to man unrest
beauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see 
             i testify there is none good but hefn226
when the year came to an end the king called his son to him and said o my son wilt thou not hearken to me whereupon kamar alzaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied o my father how should i not hearken to thee seeing that allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gainsay thee rejoined king shahriman o my son know that i desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet i live and make thee king over my realm before my death when the prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile then raised it and said o my father this is a thing which i will never do no not though i drink the cup of death i know of a surety that the almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion but allah upon thee press me not in this matter of marriage nor fancy that i will ever marry my life long for that i have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices and how excellent is the saying of the poet

he whom the randy motts entrap 
             shall never see deliverance
though build he forts a thousandfold 
             whose mighty strength leadplates enhancefn227
their force shall be of no avail 
             these fortresses have not a chance
women aye deal in treachery 
             to far and near oer earths expanse
with fingers dipt in hennablood 
             and locks in braids that mad the glance
and eyelids painted oer with kohl 
          they gar us drink of dire mischance

and how excellently saith another

women for all the chastity they claim 
             are offal cast by kites whereer they list
this night their talk and secret charms are shine 
             that night another joyeth calf and wrist
like inn whence after night thou farst at dawn 
             and lodges other wight thou hast not wistfn228

now when king shahriman heard these his sons words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations he made no answer of his excessive love for him but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him he at once broke up the audience and as soon as the seance was over he summoned his minister and taking him apart said to him o thou the wazir tell me how i shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay
when it was the one hundred and seventysecond night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the king summoned his minister and taking him apart said to him o thou the wazir tell me what i shall do with my son in the matter of marriage of a truth i took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him before making him king i have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me so do thou o wazir forthright advise me what to do answered the minister o king wait another year and if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage speak not to him privily but address him on a day of state when all the emirs and wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee and when all are in crowd then send for thy son kamar alzaman and summon him and when he cometh broach to him the matter of marriage before the wazirs and grandees and officers of state and captains for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will now when king shahriman heard his wazirs words he rejoiced with exceeding joy seeing success in the project and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour then he took patience with his son another year whilst with every day that passed over him kamar alzaman increased in beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace till he was nigh twenty years old indeed allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion his eyeglance was more bewitching than hárút and marútfn229 and the play of his luring looks more misleading than tághútfn230 and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosyred and his eyelashes stormed the keenedged blade the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night and his waist was more slender than the gossamerfn231 and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier making a babel of the heart with their softness but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins and his charms ravished all mankind even as one of the poets saith in these couplets
by his eyelash tendril curled by his slender waist i swear
by the dart his witchery feathers fatal hurtling through the
           air
by the just roundness of his shape by his glances bright and
           keen
by the swart limping of his locks and his fair forehead shining
            sheen
by his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should
            sleep
which now commanding now forbidding oer me high dominion keep
by the roses of his cheek his face as fresh as myrtle wreath
his tulip lips and those pure pearls that hold the places of his
             teeth
by his noble form which rises featly turned in even swell
to where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to
           dwell
by his supple moving hips his taper waist the silky skin
by all he robbed perfection of and holds enchained his form
             within
by his tongue of steadfastness his nature true and excellent
by the greatness of his rank his noble birth and high descent
musk from my love her savour steals who musk exhales from every
             limb
and all the airs ambergris breathes are but the zephyrs blow
             oer him
the sun methinks the broad bright sun as low before my love
             should quail
as would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his
             nailfn232
so king shahriman having accepted the counsel of his wazir waited for another year and a great festival—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that shahriman having accepted the counsel of his wazir waited for another year and a great festival a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his emirs and wazirs and grandees of his reign and officers of state and captains of might and main thereupon he sent for his son kamar alzaman who came and kissing the ground before him three times stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the leftfn233 then said the king to him know o my son that i have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that i may lay a commandment on thee wherein do thou not disobey me and my commandment is that thou marry for i am minded to wed thee to a kings daughter and rejoice in thee ere i die when the prince heard this much from his royal sire he bowed his head groundwards awhile then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance replied but for myself i will never marry no not though i drink the cup of death as for thee thou art great in age and small of wit hast thou not twice ere this day and before this occasion questioned me of the matter of marriage and i refused my consent indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep so saying kamar alzaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father being in a fit of fury moreover he added many words to his sire knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits the king was confounded and ashamed for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldierofficers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion but presently the majesty of kingship took him and he cried out at his son and made him tremble then he called to the guards standing before him and said seize him so they came forward and laid hands on him and binding him brought him before his sire who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence and the prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat and shame and confusion troubled him sorely thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried woe to thee thou son of adultery and nursling of abominationfn234 how durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers but hitherto none hath chastised thee—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


when it was the one hundred and seventyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king shahriman cried out to his son kamar alzaman how durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers but hitherto none hath chastised thee knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects and the king commanded his mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel so they took the prince and thrust him into an old tower wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well after having first swept it and cleansed its floorflags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress a leathern rug and a cushion and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle for that place was dark even by day and lastly the mamelukes led kamar alzaman thither and stationed an eunuch at the door and when all this was done the prince threw himself on the couch sadspirited and heavy hearted blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father whenas repentance availed him naught and saying allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women the traitresses all would i had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife had i so done it had been better for me than this jail this is how it fared with him but as regards king shahri man he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown then he took the minister apart and said to him know thou o wazir that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise and so what dost thou counsel me to do now answered he o king leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir said to king shahriman leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again the king accepted the wazirs opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this and it was his wont every night not to sleep save after placing his arm under his sons neck so he passed that night in trouble and unease on the prince s account tossing from side to side as he were laid on coals of artemisiawoodfn235 for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating 

while slanderers slumber longsome is my night 
             suffice thee a heart so sad in partingplight
i say while night in care slow moments by 
             what no return for thee fair morning light

and the saying of another

when saw i pleiadstars his glance escape 
             and pole star draught of sleep upon him pour
and the bierdaughtersfn236 wend in mourning dight 
             i knew that morning was for him no more

such was the case with king shahriman but as regards kamar al zaman when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the waxcandle placed it in the candlestick then brought him somewhat of food the prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father saying to himself o my soul knowest thou not that a son of adam is the hostage of his tongue and that a mans tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done from anguished vitals and aching heart repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating

fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue 
             stumble of foot works not mans life such wrong
the slip of lip shall oft smite off the head 
             while slip of foot shall never harm one long

now when he had made an end of eating he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food he arose and made the wuzuablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall conjoining them in one after which he sat down—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the hundred and seventysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the prince kamar alzaman had prayed conjoining them in one the prayers of sundown and nightfall he sat down on the well and began reciting the koran and he repeated the cow the house of imrán and y s the compassionate blessed be the king unity and the two talismansfn237 and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying i seek refuge with allah from satan the stonedfn238 then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al maadin town the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of irak and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrichdown and when ready for sleep he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bagtrousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax and he donned a headkerchief of azure marázifn239 cloth and at such time and on this guise kamar alzaman was like the fullorbed moon when it riseth on its fourteenth night then drawing over his head a coverlet of silk he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the waxcandle over his head and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the future and what the omniscient had decreed for him now as fate and fortune would have it both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted and there was therein a roman well inhabited by a jinniyah of the seed of iblisfn240 the accursed by name maymúnah daughter of al dimiryát a renowned king of the jánn—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the name of the jinniyah in question was maymunah daughter of aldimiryat a renowned king of the jann and as kamar alzaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night maymunah came up out of the roman well and made for the firmament thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels but when she reached the mouth of the well she saw a light shining in the tower contrary to custom and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like she said to herself never have i witnessed aught like this and marvelling much at the matter determined that there must be some cause therefor so she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door and inside she saw a couch spread whereon was a human form with the waxcandle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and drawing back the coverlid discovered kamar alzamans face she was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle his face beamed like a pearl with light his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliantfn241 his cheeks were rosy red his eyebrows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk even as saith of him the poet

i kissed him darker grew those pupilsfn242 which 
             seduce my soul and cheeks flushed rosier hue
o heart if slanderers dare to deem there be 
             his like in chasms say bring him hither you 

now when maymunah saw him she pronounced the formula of praisefn243 and said blessed be allah the best of creators for she was of the truebelieving jinn and she stood awhile gazing on his face exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness and she said in herself by allah i will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him nay from all of evil will i ransom him for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the lord yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where if one of our márids came upon him at this hour he would assuredly slay him then the ifritah maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air flew upwards and after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world the lowest of the heavens and behold she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and directing herself by the sound she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an ifrit called dahnash so she swooped down on him like a sparrowhawk and when he was aware of her and knew her to be maymunah the daughter of the king of the jinn he feared her and his sidemuscles quivered and he implored her forbearance saying i conjure thee by the most great and august name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the sealring of solomon entreat me kindly and harm me not when she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said verily thou conjurest me o accursed with a mighty conjuration nevertheless i will not let thee go till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour he replied o princess know that i come from the uttermost end of chinaland and from among the islands and i will tell thee of a wonderful thing i have seen this night if thou kind my words true let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that i am thy freedman so none of the jinnhosts whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters do me let or hindrance rejoined maymunah and what is it thou hast seen this night o liar o accursed tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses for i swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the sealring of solomon david son on both of whom be peace except thy speech be true i will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones quoth the ifrit dahnash son of shamhúrishfn244 the flyer i accept o my lady these conditions—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventyeight night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that dahnash spoke thus to maymunah i accept o my lady these conditions then he resumed know o my mistress that i come tonight from the islands of the inland sea in the parts of china which are the realms of king ghayúr lord of the islands and the seas and the seven palaces there i saw a daughter of his than whom allah hath made none fairer in her time i cannot picture her to thee for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise but i will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation and right well hath the poet said when picturing her

she dispread the locks from her head one night 
             showing four fold nights into one night run
and she turned her visage towards the moon 
             and two moons showed at moment one

she hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones bloodred her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine its taste would quench hells fiery pain her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee her breast is a seduction to all that see it glory be to him who fashioned it and finished it and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded even as saith of her the poet alwalahánfn245

she hath wrists which did her bangles not contain 
             would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain

she hath breasts like two globes of ivory from whose brightness the moons borrow light and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest egyptian linen made by the copts with creases like folded scrolls ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand that force her to sit when she would fief stand and awaken her when she fain would sleep even as saith of her and describeth her the poet


she hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist 
             hips that oer me and her too tyrannise
my thoughts they daze wheneer i think of them 
             and weigh her down wheneer she would uprisefn246

and those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl and all this reposeth upon two feet narrow slender and pointed like spearbladesfn247 the handiwork of the protector and requiter i wonder how of their littleness they can sustain what is above them but i cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest i be tedious—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and seventyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the ifrit dahnash bin shamhurish said to the ifritah maymunah of a truth i cut short my praises fearing lest i be tedious now when maymunah heard the description of that princess and her beauty and loveliness she stood silent in astonishment whereupon dahnash resumed the father of this fair maiden is a mighty king a fierce knight immersed night and day in fray and fight for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible lord of troops and armies and continents and islands and cities and villages and his name is king ghayur lord of the islands and of the seas and of the seven palaces now he loveth his daughter the young maiden whom i have described to thee with dearest love and for affection of her he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces each of a different fashion the first of crystal the second of marble the third of china steel the fourth of precious stones and gems of price the fifth of porcelain and manyhued onyxes and ring bezels the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold and he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year and her name is the princess budurfn248 now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage and he consulted her on the matter but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said o my father i have no mind to marry no not at all for i am a sovereign lady and a queen suzerain ruling over men and i have no desire for a man who shall rule over me and the more suits she refused the more her suitors eagerness increased and all the royalties of the inner islands of china sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage so he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals but she ever opposed to him refusals till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried o my father if thou name matrimony to me once more i will go into my chamber and take a sword and fixing its hilt in the ground will set its point to my waist then will i press upon it till it come forth from my back and so slay myself now when the king heard these her words the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire because he feared lest she should kill herself and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors so he said to her if thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her and forbade her to go forth to the seven palaces moreover he made it appear that he was incensed against her and sent letters to all the kings giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the jinns and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded then continued the ifrit dahnash addressing the ifritah maymunah and i o my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and i kiss her between the eyes yet of my love to her i do her no hurt neither mount her for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her i conjure thee therefore o my lady to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion and after if thou wilt chastise me or enslave me and win to thy will for it is shine to bid and to forbid so saying the ifrit dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward but maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered what is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making waterfn249 faugh faugh by allah o accursed i thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me how would it be if thou were to sight my beloved verily this night i have seen a young man whom if thou saw though but in a dream thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth asked the ifrit and who and what is this youth and she answered know o dahnash that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress for his father pressed him again and again to marry but he refused till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where i dwell and i came up tonight and saw him said dahnash o my lady shew me this youth that i may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress the princess budur or not for i cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age rejoined maymunah thou liest o accursed o most illomened of marids and vilest of satansfn250 sure am i that the like of my beloved is not in this world—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the ifritah maymunah spake thus to the ifrit dahnash sure am i that the like of my beloved is not in this world art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved he said allah upon thee o my lady go back with me and look upon my mistress and after i will with thee and look upon thy beloved she answered it must needs be so o accursed for thou art a knavish devil but i will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me save upon condition of a wager which is this if the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely prove handsomer than mine whom i mentioned and whom i love and of whom i boast the bet shall be shine against me but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee quoth dahnash the ifrit o my lady i accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat so come with me to the islands quoth maymunah no for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine here it is under us so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress i hear and i obey said dahnash so they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained then maymunah stationed dahnash beside the bed and putting out her hand drew back the silken coverlet from kamar alzamans face when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun she gazed at him for a moment then turning sharply round upon dahnash said look o accursed and be not the basest of madmen i am a maid yet my heart he hath waylaid so dahnash looked at the prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then shaking his head said to maymunah by allah o my lady thou art excusable but there is yet another thing to be considered and this is that the estate female differeth from the male by allahs might this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead now when maymunah heard these words the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as wellnigh made an end of him then quoth she to him i conjure thee by the light of his glorious countenance go at once o accursed and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two except thou obey me this very moment o accursed i will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee yea in pieces i will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be quoth dahnash o my lady i will do thy behests for i know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter so saying the if rit flew away and maymunah flew with him to guard him they were absent awhile and presently returned bearing the young lady who was clad in a shift of fine venetian silk with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves

three matters hinder her from visiting us in fear 
            of hatefull slandering envier and his hired spies
the shining light of brow the trinkets tinkling voice 
            and scent of essences that tell wheneer she tries
gien that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve and leave 
             at home her trinketry how shall her scent
             disguisefn251

and dahnash and maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth kamar alzaman—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the ifrit dahnash and the ifritah maymunah stinted not bearing princess budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside kamar al zaman then they uncovered both their faces and they were the likest of all folk each to other as they were twins or an only brother and sister and indeed they were a seduction to the pious even as saith of them the poet almubín

o heart be not thy love confined to one 
lest thou by doting or disdain be undone
love all the fair and thou shalt find with them 
if this be lost to thee that shall be won

and quoth another

mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground 
            both had i loved if on these eyne they lay

so dahnash and maymunah gazed on them awhile and he said by allah o my lady it is good my mistress is assuredly the fairer she replied not so my beloved is the fairer woe to thee o dahnash art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart wilt thou hide the truth dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry out on thee hear what i purpose to say in praise of my beloved and if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love do thou the like for her thou lovest then she kissed kamar alzaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode

how is this why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride
what shall console my heart for thee that art but slender bough

a nature kohldfn252 eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide
from pure platonic lovefn253 of it deliverance none i trow

those glances fell as plundering turk to heart such havoc deal
as never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve

on me thou layest load of love the heaviest while i feel
so feeble grown that under weight of chemisette i swerve

my love for thee as wottest well is habit and my lowe
is nature to all others false is all the love i tender

now were my heart but like to shine i never would say no
only my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender

out on him who in beautys robe for moon like charms hath fame
and who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe

of man what manner may he be ask they who flyte and blame
for whom thy heart is so distressed i only cry describe

oh stoneentempered heart of him learn of his yielding grace
and bending form to show me grace and yielding to consent
oh my prince beautiful thou hast an overseer in placefn254
who irketh me and eke a groom whose wrong cloth neer relent

indeed he lieth who hath said that all of loveliness
was pent in joseph in thy charms theres many and many a joe

the genii dread me when i stand and face to face address
but meeting thee my fluttering heart its shame and terror show

i take aversion semblance and i turn from thee in fright
but more aversion i assume more love from me dost claim

that hair of jetty black that brow eer raying radiant light those eyne wherein white jostles blackfn255 that dearling dainty frame

when dahnash heard the poesy which maymunah spake in praise of her beloved he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the ifrit dahnash heard the poesy which maymunah spake in praise of her beloved he shook for exceeding joy and said thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest and there is no help for it but that i also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress and recite somewhat in her honour then the ifrit went up to the lady budur and kissing her between the eyes looked at maymunah and at his beloved princess and recited the following verses albeit he had no skill in poesy

love for my fair they chide in angry way 
             unjust for ignorance yea unjustest they
ah lavish favours on the love mad whom 
             taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay
in sooth for love im wet with railing tears 
             that rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say
no marvel what i bear for love tis marvel 
             that any know my me while thourt away
unlawful were our union did i doubt 
             thy love or heart incline to other may

and eke these words—

i feed eyes on their stead by the valleys side 
             and im slain and my slaverfn256 aside hath tried
griefwine have i drunken and down my cheeks 
             dance tears to the song of the camelguide
for unionblessing i strive though sure 
             in budur and suad all my bliss shall bidefn257
wot i not which of three gave me most to plain 
             so hear them numbered ere thou decide
those sworders her eyne that lancer her fig 
             ure or ringmaild locks which her forehead hide
quoth she and i ask of her what so wights 
             or abide in towns or in desert ridefn258 
to me in thy heart i dwell look there 
             quoth i wheres my heart ah where ah where

when maymunah heard these lines from the ifrit she said thou hast done well o dahnash but say thou which of the two is the handsomer and he answered my mistress budur is handsomer than thy beloved cried maymunah thou liest o accursed nay my beloved is more beautiful than shine but dahnash persisted mine is the fairer and they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each others words till maymunah cried out at dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him but he humbled himself to her and softening his speech said let not the truth be a grief to thee and cease we this talk for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer and by his sentence we will abide i agree to this answered she and smote the earth with her foot whereupon there came out of it an ifrit blind of an eye humpbacked and scurvyskinned with eyeorbits slit up and down his facefn259 on his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels his hands were pitchforklike and his legs mastlike and he had nails as the claws of a lion and feet as the hoofs of the wild assfn260 when that if rit rose out of the earth and sighted maymunah he kissed the ground before her and standing with his hands clasped behind him said what is thy will o my mistress o daughter of my kingfn261 she replied o kashkash i would have thee judge between me and this accursed dahnash and she made known to him the matter from first to last whereupon the ifrit kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl and saw them lying asleep embraced each with an arm under the others neck alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness the marid gazed long upon them marvelling at their seemlihead and after carefully observing the twain he turned to maymunah and dahnash and reseated these couplets

go visit her thou lovest and regard not
the words detractors utter envious churls
can never favour love oh sure the merciful
neer made a thing more fair to look upon
than two fond lovers in each others arms
speaking their passion in a mute embrace
when heart has turned to heart the fools would part them
strike idly on cold steel so when thoust found
one purely wholly shine accept her true heart
and live for her alone oh thou that blamest
the lovestruck for their love give oer thy talk
how canst thou minister to a mind diseasedfn262

then he turned again to maymunah and dahnash and said to them by allah if you will have the truth i tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness nor can i make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman but i have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn without the knowledge of the other and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness quoth maymunah right is this recking and quoth dahnash i consent to this then dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit kamar alzaman whereupon he started from sleep in a fright—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightythird night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit kamar alzaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part his neck and scratched it hard because of the smart then turning sideways he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl or a shining sun or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall for she was five feet tall with a shape like the letter aliffn263 bosomed high and rosy checked even as saith of her the poet

four things which neer conjoin unless it be 
             to storm my vitals and to shed my blood
brow white as day and tresses black as night 
             cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles oerflood

and also quoth another

a moon she rises willow wand she waves 
             breathes ambergris and gazes a gazelle
meseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins 
             and when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell

and when kamar alzaman saw the lady budur daughter of king ghayur and her beauty and comeliness she was sleeping clad in a shift of venetian silk without her petticoattrousers and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls of size unique past the competence of any king when he saw this his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself whatso allah willeth that shall be and what he willeth not shall never be so saying he put out his hand and turning her over loosed the collar of her chemise then arose before his sight her bosom with its breasts like double globes of ivory whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire he would have awakened her but she would not awake for dahnash had made her sleep heavy so he shook her and moved her saying o my beloved awake and look on me i am kamar alzaman but she awoke not neither moved her head whereupon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself if i guess aright this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past i have refused her but inshallah—god willing—as soon as it is dawn i will say to him marry me to her that i may enjoy her—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman said to himself by allah when i see dawn i will say to my sire marry me to her that i may enjoy her nor will i let half the day pass ere i possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness then he bent over budur to buss her whereat the jinniyah maymunah trembled and was abashed and dahnash the ifrit was like to fly for joy but as kamar al zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth he was ashamed before allah and turned away his head and averted his face saying to his heart have patience then he took thought awhile and said i will be patient haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when i would arouse her and may have said to her whatever thing kamar alzaman do to thee make me ware thereof or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence being himself unseen he can see all i do with this young lady and to morrow he will scold me and cry how cometh it that thou sayest i have no mind to marry and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel so i will withhold myself lest i be ashamed before my sire and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present nor even to look upon her except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her that some sign endure between me and her then kamar alzaman raised the young ladys hand and took from her little finger a sealring worth an immense amount of money for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets

count not that i your promises forgot 
             despite the length of your delinquencies
be generous o my lord to me inclining 
             haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss
by allah neer will i relinquish you 
             albe you will transgress loves boundaries

then kamar alzaman took the sealring from the little finger of queen budur and set it on his own then turning his back to her went to sleepfn264 when maymunah the jinniyah saw this she was glad and said to dahnash and kashkash saw ye how my beloved kamar alzaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady verily this was of the perfection of his good gifts for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her but turned his back and slept answered they even so thereupon maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of budur the loved of dahnash crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and reaching a place some four caratsfn265 below her navel there bit her thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep the loveliest of almighty allahs creatures with eyes that put to shame the fairest houris of heaven and a mouth like solomons seal whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack and lips the colour of coralstone and cheeks like the blood red anemone even as saith one describing him in these couplets

my minds withdrawn from zaynab and nawárfn266 
             by rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear
i love a fawn a tunicvested boy 
             and leave the love of braceletwearing fair
my mate in hall and closet is unlike 
             her that i play with as at home we pair
oh thou who blamst my flight from hind and zaynab 
             the cause is clear as dawn uplighting air
wouldst have me farefn267 a slave the thrall of thrall 
             cribbed pent confined behind the bar and wall

now when princess budur saw him she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and lovelonging—and shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when princess budur saw kamar alzaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing and she said to herself alas my shame this is a strange youth and i know him not how cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed then she looked at him a second time and noting his beauty and loveliness said by allah he is indeed a comely youth and my heartfn268 is wellnigh torn in sunder with longing for him but alas how am i shamed by him by the almighty had i known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father i had not rejected him but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness then she gazed in his face and said o my lord and light of mine eyes awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace and she moved him with her hand but maymunah the jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that kamar alzaman awoke not then princess budur shook him with her hands and said my life on thee hearken to me awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day allah upon thee o my lord sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not still kamar alzaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep continued she alas alas thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks but if thou art handsome so am i handsome what then is this thou dost have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father the wretched old fellowfn269 made thee swear not to speak to me tonight but kamar alzaman opened not his mouth neither awoke whereat her passion for him redoubled and allah inflamed her heart with love of him she stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs her heart fluttered and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered and she said to kamar alzaman talk to me o my lord speak to me o my friend answer me o my beloved and tell me thy name for indeed thou hast ravished my wit and during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word and princess budur sighed and said alas alas why art thou so proud and self satisfied then she shook him and turning his hand over saw her sealring on his little finger whereat she cried a loud cry and followed it with a sigh of passion and said alack alack by allah thou art my beloved and thou lovest me yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry for all o my darling thou camest to me whilst i was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me and tookest my sealring and yet i will not pull it off thy finger so saying she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him seeking somewhat that she might take as a token but found nothing then she thrust her hand into his breast and because of the smoothness of his body it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of menfn270 and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness then she plucked his sealring from his finger and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken and bussed his inner lips and hands nor did she leave any part of him unkissed after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his armpit nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and eightysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when princess budur fell asleep by the side of kamar alzaman after doing that which she did quoth maymunah to dahnash night thou o accursed how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling there can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine nevertheless i pardon thee then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to kashkash and said go help dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it i hear and i obey answered kashkash so the two ifrits went forward to princess budur and upraising her flew away with her then bearing her back to her own place they laid her on her bed whilst maymunah abode alone with kamar alzaman gazing upon him as he slept till the night was all but spent when she went her way as soon as morning morrowed the prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind what is this business it is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door saying woe to thee o damned one arise at once so the eunuch rose bemused with sleep and brought him basin and ewer whereupon kamar alzaman entered the water closet and did his needfn271 then coming out made the wuzuablution and prayed the dawnprayer after which he sat telling on his beads the ninetyandnine names of almighty allah then he looked up and seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him said out on thee o sawáb who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and i still sleeping asked the eunuch o my lord what manner of young lady the young lady who lay with me last night replied kamar alzaman the eunuch was startled at his words and said to him by allah there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other how should young lady have come in to thee when i was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked by allah o my lord neither male nor female hath come in to thee exclaimed the prince thou liest o pestilent slave is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away replied the eunuch and he was affrighted at him by allah o my lord i have seen neither young lady nor young lord his words only angered kamar alzaman the more and he said to him o accursed one my father hath indeed taught thee deceit come hither so the eunuch came up to him and the prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground whereupon he let fly a loud fartfn272 and kamar alzaman kneeling upon him kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away then he dragged him forth and tied him to the wellrope and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water then drew him up and lowered him down again now it was hard winter weather and kamar alzaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help and the prince kept on saying by allah o damned one i will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst i slept—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one and eightyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman said to the eunuch by allah i will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst i slept answered the eunuch after he had seen death staring him in the face o my lord let me go and i will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale so kamar alzaman pulled him up out of the well all but dead for suffering what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing drubbing and dread of drowning he shook like cane in hurricane his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well briefly he was in a sad pickle now when kamar alzaman saw him in this sorry plight he was concerned for him but as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor he said to him o my lord let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry and don others after which i will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter answered the prince o rascal slave hadst thou not seen death face to face never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word but go now and do thy will and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth thereupon the eunuch went out hardly crediting his escape and ceased not running stumbling and rising in his haste till he came in to king shahriman whom he found sitting at talk with his wazir of kamar alzamans case the king was saying to the minister i slept not last night for anxiety concerning my son kamar alzaman and indeed i fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower what good was there in imprisoning him answered the wazir have no care for him by allah no harm will befal him none at all leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses as the two spoke behold up rushed the eunuch in the aforesaid plight making to the king who was troubled at sight of him and he cried o our lord the sultan verily thy sons wits are fled and he hath gone mad he hath dealt with me thus and thus so that i am become as thou seest me and he kept saying a young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst i slept where is she and he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away but i have seen neither girl nor boy the door was locked all through the night for i slept before it with the key under my head and i opened to him in the morning with my own hand when king shahriman heard this he cried out saying alas my son and he was enraged with sore rage against the wazir who had been the cause of all this case and said to him go up bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind so the wazir rose and stumbling over his long skirts in his fear of the kings wrath hastened with the slave to the tower now the sun had risen and when the minister came in to kamar alzaman he found him sitting on the couch reciting the koran so he saluted him and seated himself by his side and said to him o my lord this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the king asked kamar alzaman and what hath he told you of me to trouble my father in good sooth he hath troubled none but me answered the wazir he came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which heaven forfend and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence and forbid to come from thee aught of offense quoth the prince o wazir and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me the minister replied he told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end but when kamar alzaman heard these words he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the wazir tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say

when it was the one hundred and eightyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman heard the words of the wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night but thou o wazir art cleverer than the eunuch so do thou tell me without stay or delay whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn but when i awoke i found her not so where is she now said the wazir o my lord kamar alzaman allahs name encompass thee about by the almighty we sent none to thee last night but thou layest alone with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it nor did there come to thee young lady or any other regain thy reason o my lord and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities rejoined kamar alzaman who was incensed at his words o wazir the young lady in question is my beloved the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks whom i held in my arms all last night so the minister wondered at his words and asked him didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep answered kamar alzaman o ill omened old man dost thou fancy i saw her with my ears indeed i saw her with my very eyes and awake and i touched her with my hand and i watched by her full half the night feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks but you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me so she feigned sleep and i lay by her side till dawn when i awoke and found her gone rejoined the wazir o my lord kamar al zaman haply thou sawest this in thy sleep it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food or a suggestion of the accursed devils cried the prince o pestilent old man wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams when that eunuch confessed to the young lady saying at once i will return to thee and tell thee all about her with these words he sprang up and rushed at the wazir and gripped hold of his beard which was longfn273 and after gripping it he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch threw him on the floor it seemed to the minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard and kamar alzaman ceased not kicking the wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had wellnigh beaten him to death then said the old man in his mind just as the eunuchslave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie thus it is even fitter that i do likewise else he will destroy me so now for my lie to save myself he being mad beyond a doubt then he turned to kamar alzaman and said o my lord pardon me for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady but now i am weak and weary and wounded with funding for i am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows have therefore a little patience with me and i will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman when the prince heard this he left off drubbing him and said wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows rise now unlucky old man that thou art and tell me her story quoth the wazir say dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form quoth kamar alzaman even so tell me o wazir who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side and who was it that took her away from me by night and let me know forthright whither she is gone that i myself may go to her at once if my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl with a view to our marriage i consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble for he did all these dealings with me only because i refused wedlock but now i consent and i say again i consent to matrimony so tell this to my father o wazir and advise him to marry me to that young lady for i will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour rejoined the wazir tis well and went forth from him hardly believing himself out of his hands then he set off from the tower walking and tripping up as he went for excess of fright and agitation and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to king shahriman—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the wazir fared forth from the tower and ceased not running till he came in to king shahriman who said to him as he sighted him o thou wazir what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief how happeneth it that i see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded replied the wazir o king i bring thee good news and what is it quoth shahriman and quoth the wazir know that thy son kamar al zamans wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad now when the king heard these words of the minister light became darkness in his sight and he said o wazir make clear to me the nature of his madness answered the wazir o my lord i hear and i obey then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done whereupon the king said to him hear o wazir the good tidings which i give thee in return for this thy fair news of my sons insanity and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour o most illomened of wazirs and foulest of emirs for i feel that thou hast caused my sons disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last by allah if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son i will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death then he sprang up and taking the wazir with him fared straight for the tower and entered it and when kamar alzaman saw the two he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him and thus remained for a full hour then he raised his head towards his sire the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating

forgive the sin neath which my limbs are trembling
for the slave seeks for mercy from his master
ive done a fault which calls for free confession
where shall it call for mercy and forgivenessfn274

when the king heard this he arose and embraced his son and kissing him between the eyes made him sit by his side on the couch then he turned to the wazir and looking on him with eyes of wrath said o dog of wazirs how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him then he turned to the prince and said o my son what is today called he answered o my father this day is the sabbath and to morrow is first day then come second day third fourth fifth day and lastly fridayfn275 exclaimed the king o my son o kamar alzaman praised be allah for the preservation of thy reason what is the present month called in our arabic zúl kaadah answered kamar alzaman and it is followed by zúl hijjah then cometh muharram then safar then rabía the first and rabía the second the two jamádás rajab shaaban ramazán and shawwál at this the king rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the wazirs face saying o wicked old man how canst thou say that my son is mad and now none is mad but thou hereupon the minister shook his head and would have spoken but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal then the king said to his child o my son what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the wazir declaring i was sleeping with a fair damsel this nightfn276 what damsel is this of whom thou speakest then kamar alzaman laughed at his fathers words and replied o my father know that i can bear no more jesting so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me and know o my father with assured knowledge that i consent to marry but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night for i am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me rejoined the king the name of allah encompass thee about o my son and be thy wit preserved from witlessness—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that quoth king shahriman to his son kamar alzaman the name of allah encompass thee about o my son and be thy wit preserved from witlessness what thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest i sent to thee last night and then again that i sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn by the lord o my son i know nothing of this affair and allah upon thee tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition for verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it allah damn marriage and the hour when i spake of it and curse him who counselled it and without doubt or diffidence i can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake but all this o my son is but an imbroglio of dreams replied kamar alzaman leave this talk and swear to me by allah the all creator the omniscient the humbler of the tyrant caesars and the destroyer of the chosroes that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woningplace quoth the king by the might of allah almighty the god of moses and abraham i know naught of all this and never even heard of it it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep then the prince replied to his sire i will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zamar said to his sire i will give thee a selfevident proof that this happened to me when on wake now let me ask thee did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a swordblade besmeared with blood answered the king no by allah o my son this hath never been rejoined kamar alzaman i will tell thee what happened to me and it was this meseemed i awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine i embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal ring which i put on my finger and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers then i went to sleep by her side but refrained from her for shame of thee deeming that thou hadst sent her to me intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what i did with her and i was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account thinking over this temptation to wedlock and when i awoke at point of day i found no trace of her nor could i come at any news of her and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the wazir how then can this case have been a dream and a delusion when the ring is a reality save for her ring on my finger i should indeed have deemed it a dream but here is the ring on my little finger look at it o king and see what is its worth so saying he handed the ring to his father who examined it and turned it over then looked to his son and said verily there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret what befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack and i know not how intruded upon us this intruder none is the cause of all this posher save the wazir but allah upon thee o my son take patience so haply the lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief as quoth one of the poets

haply shall fortune draw her rein and bring 
             fair chance for she is changeful jealous vain
still i may woo my want and wishes win 
           and see on heels of care unfair the fain

and now o my son i am certified at this hour that thou art not mad but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the almighty cried the prince by allah o my father deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me else i shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know then he betrayed the ardour of his passion and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets

if your promise of personal call prove untrue 
             deign in vision to grant me an interview
quoth they how can phantomfn277 appear to the sight 
             of a youth whose sight is fordone perdue

then after ending his poetry kamar alzaman again turned to his father with submission and despondency and shedding tears in flood began repeating these lines—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman had repeated to his father these verses he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart and added these lines

beware that eye glance which hath magic might 
            wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight
nor be deceived by low sweet voice that breeds 
            a fever festering in the heart and sprite
so soft that silky skin were rose to touch it 
             shed cry and teardrops rain for pain and fright
did zephyr een in sleep pass oer her land 
             scented hed choose to dwell in scented site
her necklets vie with tinkling of her belt 
             her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite
when would her bangles buss those rings in ear 
             upon the lovers eyne high mysteries light
im blamed for love of her nor pardon claim 
             eyes are not profiting which lack foresight
heaven strip thee blamer mine unjust art thou 
             before this fawn must every eye low bowfn278

after which he said by allah o my father i cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour the king smote hand upon hand and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great no cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace where kamar alzaman lay down on the bed of languor and the king sat at his head weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not night or day till at last the wazir came in to him and said o king of the age and the time how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops haply the order of thy realm may be deranged by reason of shine absence from thy grandees and officers of state it behoveth the man of understanding if he have various wounds in his body to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea and shut thyself up with him there setting apart in every week two days thursday and monday for state receptions and progresses and reviews on these days let shine emirs and wazirs and chamberlains and viceroys and high officials and grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid and the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son kamar alzaman and cease not thus doing till allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain think not o king that thou art safe from the shifts of time and the strokes of change which come like a traveller in the night for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet

thou deemedst well of time when days went well 
             and fearedst not what ills might bring thee fate
the nights so fair and restful cozened thee 
             for peaceful nights bring woes of heavy weight
oh children of mankind whom time befriends 
             beware of times deceits or soon or latefn279

when the sultan heard his wazirs words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide it had windows on all sides commanding an ocean view its floor was paved with particoloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapislazuli they furnished it for kamar alzaman with splendid upholstery embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price in the midst they set him a couch of juniperfn280wood inlaid with pearls and jewels and kamar alzaman sat down thereon but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness his father seated himself at his head grieving for him with the deepest grief and every monday and thursday he gave his wazirs and emirs and chamberlains and viceroys and lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion so they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day when they went their ways and the king returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights such was the case with kamar alzaman son of king shahriman but as regards princess budur daughter of king ghayur lord of the isles and the seven palaces when the two jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed she slept till daybreak when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom at this her vitals fluttered her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas they flocked in to her and the chief of them came forward and asked what aileth thee o my lady answered the princess o wretched old woman where is my beloved the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom tell me whither he is gone now when the duenna heard this the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright and said to her o my lady budur what unseemly words are these cried the princess woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art i ask thee again where is my beloved the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows who lay with me last night from suppertide until near daybreak she rejoined by allah o my lady i have seen no young man nor any other i conjure thee carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives for perhaps the joke may come to thy fathers ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the duenna bespake the lady budur in these words allah upon thee o my lady carry not this unseemly jest too far for perhaps it may come to thy fathers ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand the princess rejoined in very sooth a youth lay with me last night one of the fairestfaced of men exclaimed the duenna heaven preserve thy reason indeed no one lay with thee last night thereupon the princess looked at her hand and finding kamar alzamans sealring on her finger in stead of her own said to her woe to thee thou accursed thou traitress wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the lord replied the duenna by allah i do not lie to thee nor have i sworn falsely then the princess was incensed by her words and drawing a sword she had by her she smote the old woman with it and slew herfn281 whereupon the eunuch and the waitingwomen and the concubines cried out at her and ran to her father and without stay or delay acquainted him with her case so the king went to her and asked her o my daughter what aileth thee and she answered o my father where is the youth who lay with me last night then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt when her sire saw this he bade the women lay hands on her so they seized her and manacled her then putting a chain of iron about her neck made her fast to one of the palacewindows and there left herfn282 thus far concerning princess budur but as regards her father king ghayur the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him so he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman writing and said to them whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath i will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not i will strike off his head and hang it over her palacegate accordingly all who went in to her but failed to heal her he beheaded and hung their heads over the palacegates till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers wherefor the general held aloof from her all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters and as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets

my fondness o my moon for thee my foeman is 
             and to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel
in gloom i bide with fire that flames below my ribs 
             whose lowe i make comparison with heat of hell
im plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy 
             nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel

then she sighed and repeated these also

salams fro me to friends in every stead 
             indeed to all dear friends do i incline
salams but not salams that bid adieu 
             salams that growth of good for you design
i love you dear indeed nor less your land 
             but bide i far from every need of mine

and when the lady budur ceased repeating her poetry she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue and in this condition she continued three years now she had a fosterbrother by name marzawánfn283 who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time he loved her with an exceeding love passing the love of brothers so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister the princess budur she answered him o my son thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her when marzawan heard these words he said i must needs go in to her peradventure i may discover what she hath and be able to medicine her and his mother replied needs must thou visit her but wait till to morrow that i may contrive some thing to suit thy case then she went afoot to the palace of the lady budur and accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates made him a present and said to him i have a daughter who was brought up with thy mistress and since then i married her and when that befel the princess which befel her she became troubled and sore concerned and i desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her and then return whence she came so shall none know of it quoth the eunuch this may not be except by night after the king hath visited his child and gone away then come thou and thy daughter so she kissed the eunuchs hand and returning home waited till the morrow at nightfall and when it was time she arose and sought her son marzawan and attired him in womans apparel then taking his hand in hers led him towards the palace and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the sultan had ended his visit to the princess now when the eunuch saw her he rose to her and said enter but do not prolong thy stay so they went in and when marzawan beheld the lady budur in the aforesaid plight he saluted her after his mother had doffed his womans garb then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him and lighting a wax candle he began to recite certain conjurations thereupon the princess looked at him and recognising him said o my brother thou hast been absent on thy travels and thy news have been cut off from us he replied true but allah hath brought me back safe and sound i am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news i hear of thee wherefore my heart burned for thee and i came to thee so haply i may free thee of thy malady she rejoined o my brother thinkest thou it is madness aileth me yes answered he and she said not so by allah tis even as saith the poet

quoth they thou ravst on him thou lovst quoth i 
             the sweets of love are only for th insane
love never maketh time his friend befriend 
             only the jinnstruck wight such boon can gain
well yes im mad bring him who madded me 
             and if he cure m madness blame restrain

then she let marzawan know that she was lovedaft and he said tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of da and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that marzawar thus addressed princess budur tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee haply allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee quoth she o my brother hear my story which is this one night i awoke from sleep in the last third of the nightfn284 and sitting up saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be and tongue faileth to describe him for he was as a willowwand or an indian rattancane so methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock when the kings sought me of him to wife and i had refused it was this though withheld me from arousing him for i feared that if i did aught of embraced him he would peradventure inform my father of m doings but in the morning i found on my finger his sealring in place of my own which he had taken and o my brother m heart was seized with love of him at first sight and for the violence of my passion and longing i have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day and this o my brother is my story and the cause of my madness then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets

now love hast banished all that bred delight 
             with that heartnibbling fawn my joys took flight
lightest of trifles lovers blood to him 
             who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight
for him im jealous of my sight and thought 
             my heart acts spy upon my thought and sight
those longlashed eyelids rain on me their shafts 
             guileful destroying hearts whereer they light
now while my portion in the world endures 
             shall i behold him ere i quit worldsite
what bear i for his sake id hide but tears 
             betray my feelings to the spys despight
when near our union seemeth ever far 
             when far my thoughts to him aye nearest are

and presently she continued see then o my brother how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction so marzawan bowed his head groundwards awhile wondering and not knowing what to do then he raised it and said to her all thou hast spoken to me i hold to be true though the case of the young man pass my understanding but i will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee haply allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand meanwhile take patience and be not disquieted thereupon marzawan farewelled her praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets

thine image ever companies my sprite 
            for all thourt distant from the pilgrims sight
but my heartwishes eer attract thee near 
            what is the lightnings speed to thoughts swift flight
then go not thou my very light of eyes 
             which when thourt gone lack all the kohl of light

then marzawan returned to his mothers house where he passed the night and when the morrow dawned having equipped himself for his journey he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month till he came to a town named altayrabfn285 here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk so haply he might light on a cure for the princesss malady for in every capital he entered or passed by it was reported that queen budur daughter of king ghayur had lost her wits but arriving at altayrab city he heard that kamar alzaman son of king shahriman was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness so marzawan asked the name of the princes capital and they said to him it is on the islands of khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole months journey by sea but by land it is six months march so he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the khalidan isles and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month till they came in sight of the capital and there remained for them but to make the land when behold there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized with all on board—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the ship capsized with all on board each sought his own safety and as for marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the kings palace wherein was kamar alzaman and by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which king shahriman gave audience to his grandees and high officers and he was sitting with his sons head on his lap whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies and the prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days and he was grown thinner than a spindlefn286 now the wazir was standing respectfully afoot near the latticed window giving on the sea and raising his eyes saw marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him so he drew near to the king and moving his head towards him said i crave thy leave o king to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the watergate that i may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance peradventure on this account allah may free thy son from what he hath the king replied o thou wazir enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account haply if thou rescue this drowning man he will come to know our affairs and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me but i swear by allah that if this halfdrowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any i will assuredly strike off thy head before his for thou o my minister art the cause of all that hath betided us first and last now do as thou wilt thereupon the wazir sprang up and opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea descended to the causeway then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw marzawan nigh unto death so he put out his hand to him and catching him by his hair drew him ashore in a state of insensibility with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head the wazir waited till he came to himself when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit covering his head with one of his servants turbands after which he said to him know that i have been the means of saving thee from drowning do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine ownäand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the wazir did to marzawan what he did he thus addressed him know that i have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own asked marzawan and how so and the wazir answered thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among emirs and wazirs all of them silent and none speaking because of kamar alzaman the son of the sultan now when marzawan heard the name of kamar alzaman he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search but he feigned ignorance and asked the wazir and who is kamar alzaman answered the minister he is the son of sultan shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying beware lest thou look too long on him or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet else thou art a lost man and i also he replied allah upon thee o wazir i implore thee of thy favour acquaint me touching this youth thou describest what is the cause of the condition in which he is the wazir replied i know none save that three years ago his father required him to wed but he refused whereat the king was wroth and imprisoned him and when he awoke on the morrow he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness whose charms tongue can never express and he assured us that he had plucked off her sealring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise but we know not the secret of all this business so by allah o my son when thou comest up with me into the palace look not on the prince but go thy way for the sultans heart is full of wrath against me so said marzawan to himself by allah this is the one i sought then he followed the wazir up to the palace where the minister seated himself at the princes feet but marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to kamar alzaman and stand before him at gaze upon this the wazir died of affright in his skin and kept looking at marzawan and signalling him to wend his way but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon kamar al zaman till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when marzawan looked upon kamar alzaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking he cried exalted be allah who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek upon this kamar alzaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech and when marzawan saw him inclining to hear he repeated these coupletsfn287

i see thee full of song and plaint and loves own ecstasy
delighting in describing all the charms of loveliness

art smit by stroke of love or hath shaftshot wounded thee
none save the wounded ever show such signals of distress
ho thou crown the wine cup and sing me singular
praises to sulaymá alrabáb tanoum addrestfn288

go round the grapevine sunfn289 which for mansion hath a jar
whose east the cup boy is and here my mouth that opes for west

im jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll
when she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace

i envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll
when she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissingplace

but deem not by the keenedged scymitar im slain—
the hurts and harms i dree are from arrows of her eyes

i found her finger tips as i met her once again
deepreddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyesfn290

and cried thy palms thou stainedst when far away was i
and this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine

quoth she enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high
speaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign

by thy life this is no dye used for dyeing so forbear
thy blame nor in charging me with falsing love persist

but when upon our partingday i saw thee haste to fare

the while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist

i shed a flood of bloodred tears and with fingers brushed away hence bloodreddened were the tips and still bloodred they remain

had i wept before she wept to my longinglove a prey
before repentance came i had quit my soul of pain

but she wept before i wept and i wept to see her care
and i said all the merit to precedentfn291

blame me not for loving her now on self of love i swear
for her sake for her only these pains my soul torment

she hath all the lere of lukmánfn292 and yúsufs beauty lief
sweet singer davids voice and maryams chastity

while ive all jacobs mourning and jonahs prisongrief
and the sufferings of job and old adams history

yet kill her not albeit of my love for her i die
but ask her why my blood to her was lawful ask her why

when marzawan recited this ode the words fell upon kamar al zamans heart as freshness after fever and returning health and he sighed and turning his tongue in his mouth said to his sire o my father let this youth come and sit by my side—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman said to his sire o my father allow this youth to come and sit by my side now when the king heard these words from his son he rejoiced with exceeding joy though at the first his heart had been set against marzawan and he had determined that the strangers head needs must be stricken off but when he heard kamar alzaman speak his anger left him and he arose and drawing marzawan to him seated him by his son and turning to him said praised be allah for thy safety he replied allah preserve thee and preserve thy son to thee and called down blessings on the king then the king asked from what country art thou and he answered from the islands of the inland sea the kingdom of king ghayur lord of the isles and the seas and the seven palaces quoth king shahriman maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him quoth marzawan inshallah naught shall be save what shall be well then turning to kamar alzaman he said to him in his ear unheard of the king and his court o my lord be of good cheer and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus ask not of her case on shine account but thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad so she is now in prison with an iron chain about her neck in most piteous plight but allah willing the healing of both of you shall come from my hand now when kamar alzaman heard these words his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up and the king was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up presently of his fear for his son he shook the kerchief of dismissalfn293 and all the emirs and wazirs withdrew then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city saying to marzawan by allah o my son of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed and he made as much of him as he might and called for food and when they brought it marzawan came up to the prince and said rise eat with me so he obeyed him and ate with him and all the while the king invoked blessings on marzawan and said how auspicious is thy coming o my son and when the father saw his boy eat his joy and gladness redoubled and he went out and told the princes mother and all the household then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the princes recovery and the king commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival marzawan passed that night with kamar alzaman and the king also slept with them in joy and delight for his sons recovery—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the one hundred and ninetyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that king shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his sons recovery and when the next morning dawned and the king had gone away and the two young men were left alone kamar alzaman told his story from beginning to end to marzawan who said in very sooth i know her with whom thou didst foregather her name is the princess budur and she is daughter to king ghayur then he related to him all that had passed with the princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him saying all that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers and thou art without doubt her beloved even as she is shine so brace up thy resolution and take heart for i will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet

albe to lover adverse be his love 
             and show aversion howso may he care
yet will i manage that their personsfn294 meet 
             een as the pivot of a scissor pair

and he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage kamar al zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case and marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the hammamfn295 so marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath where they washed their bodies and made them clean—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundredth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman son of king shahriman went to the hammam his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large almgifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days then quoth marzawan to kamar alzaman know o my lord that i came not from the lady budur save for this purpose and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee so it is my counsel that tomorrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting then do thou take with thee a pair of saddlebags full of money and mount a swift steed and lead a spare horse and i will do the like and say to thy sire i have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night suffer not any servant to follow us for as soon as we reach the open country we will go our ways kamar al zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried it is good then he stiffened his back and going in to his father sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught and the king consented to his going forth ahunting and said o my son blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health i will not gainsay thee in this but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee and indeed i can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadstfn296 because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet

albe by me i had through day and night 
             solomons carpet and the chosroes might
both were in value less than wing of gnat 
             unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sightfn297

then the king equipped his son kamar alzaman and marzawan for the excursion bidding make ready for them four horses together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber and kamar alzaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him his father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him saying i ask thee in the name of allah be not absent from me more than one night wherein sleep will be unlawful to me for i am even as saith the poet

thou present in the heaven of heavens i dwell 
             bearing shine absence is of hells my hell
pledged be for thee my soul if love for thee 
             be crime my crime is of the fellest fell
does lovelowe burn thy heart as burns it mine 
             doomed night and day gehennafire to smell

answered kamar alzaman o my father inshallah i will lie abroad but one night then he took leave of him and he and marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual turned their faces towards the open country—and shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and first night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman and marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket they alighted in it and marzawan taking the camel and one of the horses slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones then he doffed from kamar alzaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horses blood and he took the princes coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore and he cast them down in the fork of the road then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again and when kamar al zaman asked why this was done and said what is this o my brother and how shall it profit us marzawan replied know that thy father when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave and yet we return not will mount and follow in our track till he come hither and when he happeneth upon this blood which i have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gorefouled he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wildbeasts so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city and by this device we shall win our wishes quoth kamar alzaman by allah this be indeed a rare device thou hast done right wellfn298 then the two fared on days and nights and all that while kamar alzaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end when he rejoiced and repeated these verses

wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each
             hour  and after showing lovedesire betray indifference
may i forfeit every favour if in love i falsed thee 
             if thee i left abandon me by way of recompense
but ive been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve 
             and if i aught offended thee i bring my penitence
of fortunes wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me 
             but fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments

when he had made an end of his verses marzawan said to him look these be king ghayurs islands whereat kamar alzaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and second night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when marzawan said look these be the islands of king ghayur kamar alzaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom and after reaching the islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare after which marzawan carried kamar alzaman to the bath and clothing him in merchants gear provided him with a geomantic tablet of goldfn299 with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver plated with gold then he said to him arise o my lord and take thy stand under the walls of the kings palace and cry out i am the ready reckoner i am the scrivener i am he who weeteth the sought and the seeker i am the finished man of science i am the astrologer accomplished in experience where then is he that seeketh as soon as the king heareth this he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the princess budur thy lover but when about going in to her do thou say to him grant me three days delay and if she recover give her to me to wife and if not deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me he will assuredly agree to this so as soon as thou art alone with her discover thyself to her and when she seeth thee she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night then do thou give her to eat and drink and her father rejoicing in her recovery will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee now when kamar alzaman heard these words he exclaimed may i never lack thy benefits and taking the set of instruments aforesaid sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order he walked on till he stood under the walls of king ghayurs palace where he began to cry out saying i am the scribe i am the ready reckoner i am he who knoweth the sought and the seeker i am he who openeth the volume and summeth up the sumsfn300 who dreams can expound whereby the sought is found where then is the seeker now when the city people heard this they flocked to him for it was long since they had seen scribe or astrologer and they stood round him and looking upon him they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance and they marvelled at his loveliness and his fine stature and symmetry presently one of them accosted him and said allah upon thee o thou fair and young with the eloquent tongue incur not this affray nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the princess budur only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture yet kamar alzaman paid no heed to them but cried out at the top of his voice saying i am the doctor the scrivener i am the astrologer the calculator and all the townsfolk forbade him from this but he regarded them not at all saying in his mind none knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it then he began again to cry his loudest shouting i am the scrivener i am the astrologer—and shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and third night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens but continued to cry out i am the calculator i am the astrologer thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him thou art nothing but an imbecile silly selfwilled lad have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness but he cried all the more i am the astrologer i am the calculator is there any one that seeketh as he was thus crying and the people forbidding him behold king ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his wazir go down and bring me yon astrologer so the wazir went down in haste and taking kamar alzaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the king and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying

eight glories meet all all conjoined in thee 
             whereby may fortune aye thy servant be
lere lordliness grace generosity 
             plain words deep meaning honour victory

when the king looked upon him he seated him by his side and said to him by allah o my son an thou be not an astrologer venture not thy life nor comply with my condition for i have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her i will strike off his head but whoso healeth her him i will marry to her so let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee for by allah and again by allah if thou cure her not i will assuredly cut off thy head and kamar alzaman replied this is thy right and i consent for i wot of this ere came i hither then king ghayur took the kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch saying carry this one to the lady budur so the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage but kamar alzaman outstripped him and pushed on before whilst the eunuch ran after him saying woe to thee hasten not to shine own ruin never yet saw i astrologer so eager for his proper destruction but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee thereupon kamar alzaman turned away his face from the eunuch—and shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the eunuch thus addressed kamar alzaman patience and no indecent hurry the prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets

a sage i feel a fool before thy charms 
             distraught i wot not what the words i say
if say i sun away thou dost not pass 
             from eyes of me while suns go down with day
thou hast completed beauty in whose praise 
             speechmakers fail and talkers lose their way

then the eunuch stationed kamar alzaman behind the curtain of the princesss door and the prince said to him which of the two ways will please thee more treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain the eunuch marvelled at his words and answered an thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill upon this kamar alzaman sat down behind the curtain and taking out ink case pen and paper wrote the following this is the writ of one whom passion swayeth and whom longing waylayeth  and wakeful misery slayeth  one who despaireth of living  and looketh for naught but dying  with whose mourning heart  nor comforter nor helper taketh part  one whose sleepless eyes  none succoureth from anxieties  whose day is passed in fire  and his night in torturing desire  whose body is wasted for much emaciation  and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation and after this he indited the following couplets

i write with heart devoted to thy thought 
             and eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled
and body clad by loving pine and pain 
             in shirt of leanness and worn down to thread
to thee complain i of loves tormentry 
             which ousted hapless patience from her stead
a toi show favour and some mercy deign 
             for passions cruel hands my vitals shred

and beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences the hearts pain is removed  by union with the beloved  and whomso his lover paineth  only allah assaineth  if we or you have wrought deceit  may the deceiver win defeat  there is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith  with the beloved who works him scathe then by way of subscription he wrote from the distracted and despairing man  whom love and longing trepan  from the lover under passions ban  the prisoner of transport and distraction  from this kamar alzaman  son of shahriman  to the peerless one  of the fair houris the pearlunion  to the lady budur  daughter of king al ghayur  know thou that by night i am sleepless  and by day in distress  consumed with increasing wasting and pain  and longing and love unfain  abounding in sighs  with tear flooded eyes  by passion captive taen  of desire the slain  with heart seared by the parting of us twain  the debtor of longing bane of sickness cupcompanion  i am the sleepless one who never closeth eye  the slave of love whose tears run never dry  for the fire of my heart is still burning  and never hidden is the flame of my yearning then on the margin kamar alzaman wrote this admired verse

salem from graces hoarded by my lord 
             to her who holds my heart and soul in hoard

and also these

prayee grant me some words from your lips belike 
           such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne
from the stress of my love and my pine for you 
             i make light of what makes me despised indign
allah guard a folk whose abode was far 
             and whose secret i kept in the holiest shrine
now fortune in kindness hath favoured me 
             thrown on threshold dust of this love o mine
by me bedded i looked on budúr whose sun 
             the moon of my fortunes hath made to shine

then having affixed his sealring to the missive he wrote these couplets in the place of address

ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole 
             and hear my tale of misery from this scroll
my hand is writing while my tears down flow 
             and to the paper plains my longing soul
my tears cease not to roll upon this sheet 
             and if they stopped id cause bloodgouts to roll

and at the end he added this other verse

ive sent the ring from off thy finger bore 
           i when we met now deign my ring restore

then kamar alzaman set the lady budurs ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman after setting the sealring inside the epistle gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress and when the lady budur opened it she found therein her own very ring then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved and that he in person stood behind the curtain her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high and she repeated these couplets

long long have i bewailed the sevrance of our loves 
             with tears that from my lids streamed down like burning
             rain
and vowed that if the days deign reunite us two 
            my lips should never speak of severance again
joy hath oerwhelmed me so that for the very stress 
             of that which gladdens me to weeping i am fain
tears are become to you a habit o my eyes 
             so that ye weep as well for gladness as for painfn301

and having finished her verse the lady budur stood up forthwith and firmly setting her feet to the wall strained with all her might upon the collar of iron till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on kamar alzaman and kissed him on the mouth like a pigeon feeding its youngfn302 and she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him o my lord do i wake or sleep and hath the almighty indeed vouchsafe us reunion after disunion laud be to allah who hath our loves repaired even after we despaired now when the eunuch saw her in this case he went off running to king ghayur and kissing the ground before him said o my lord know that this astrologer is indeed the shaykh of all astrologers who are fools to him all of them for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her quoth the king look well to it is this news true answered the eunuch o my lord rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the astrologer kissing and embracing him thereupon the king arose and went in to his daughter who when she saw him stood up in haste and covered her headfn303 and recited these two couplets

the toothstick love i not for when i say 
             siwákfn304 i miss thee for it sounds siwáka
the capertree i love for when i say 
             arákfn305 it sounds i look on thee aráka

thereupon the king was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes for he loved her with dearest love then turning to kamar alzaman he asked him who he was and said what countryman art thou so the prince told him his name and rank and informed him that he was the son of king shahriman and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the lady budur and how he had taken her sealring from her finger and had placed it on his own whereat ghayur marvelled and said verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled and when you are dead and gone age after age be read then he summoned kazis and witnesses forthright and married the lady budur to prince kamar alzaman after which he bade decorate the city seven days long so they spread the tables with all manner of meats whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings and all the troops donned their richest clothes and they illuminated the city and held high festival then kamar alzaman went in to the lady budur and the king rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage and praised allah for that he had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of kings so they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and loveallurement then kamar alzaman lay with her that night and took his will of her whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace and they slept in each others arms till the morning on the morrow the king made a weddingfeast to which he gathered all comers from the islands of the inner and outer seas and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month now when kamar alzaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire and whenas he had tarried awhile with the princess budur he bethought him of his father king shahriman and saw him in a dream saying o my son is it thus thou dealest with me and recited in the vision these two couplets

indeed to watch the darknessmoon he blighted me 
             and to stargaze through longsome night he plighted me
easy my heart for haply hell unite with thee 
             and patience sprite with whatso ills he dight to thee

now after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches kamar alzaman awoke in the morning afflicted and troubled whereupon the lady budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and sixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman acquainted the lady budur with what he had seen in his dream she and he went in to her sire and telling him what had passed besought his leave to travel he gave the prince the permission he sought but the princess said o my father i cannot bear to be parted from him quoth ghayur her sire then go thou with him and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once so she kissed his hand and kamar alzaman did the like thereupon king ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand blooddromedariesfn306 which can journey ten days without water and prepared a litter for his daughter besides loading mules and camels with victual moreover he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear and on the day of departure when king ghayur took leave of kamar alzaman he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price together with ten riding horses and ten shecamels and a treasury of moneyfn307 and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the lady budur then the king accompanied them to the farthest limits of his islands where going in to his daughter budur in the litter he kissed her and strained her to his bosom weeping and repeating

o thou who wooest severance easy fare 
             for loveembrace belongs to loverfriend
fare softly fortunes nature falsehood is 
             and parting shall loves every meeting end

then leaving his daughter he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him after which he parted from them and giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops the prince and princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign abounding in pasturage where they pitched their tents and they ate and drank and rested and the princess budur lay down to sleep presently kamar alzaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricotcoloured silk that showed all and everything and on her head was a coif of goldcloth embroidered with pearls and jewels the breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin ointmentfn308 at this sight his love and longing redoubled and he began reating

an were it asked me when by hellfire burnt 
             when flames of heart my vitals hold and hem
which wouldst thou chose say wouldst thou rather them 
             or drink sweet cooling draught id answer them 

then he put his hand to the band of her petticoattrousers and drew it and loosed it for his soul lusted after her when he saw a jewel red as dyewood made fast to the band he untied it and examined it and seeing two lines of writing graven thereon in a character not to be read marvelled and said in his mind were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousersband nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person that she might not be parted from it would i knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it so saying he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and seventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light the while he was holding it behold a bird swooped down on him and snatching the same from his hand flew off with it and then lighted on the ground thereupon kamar alzaman fearing to lose the jewel ran after the bird but it flew on before him keeping just out of his reach and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill till the night starkened and the firmament darkened when it roosted on a high tree so kamar alzaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue and giving himself up for lost would have turned back but knew not the way whereby he came for that darkness had overtaken him then he exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and laying him down under the tree whereon was the bird slept till the morning when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away he arose and walked after it and it flew on little by little before him after the measure of his faring at which he smiled and said by allah a strange thing yesterday this bird flew before me as fast as i could run and today knowing that i have awoke tired and cannot run he flieth after the measure of my faring by allah this is wonderful but i must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life and i will go wherever it goeth for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited landfn309 so he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters at the end of this time he came in sight of an inhabited city whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and entering the town disappeared from kamar alzaman who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone so he marvelled at this and exclaimed praise be to allah who hath brought me in safety to this city then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile and recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains

pain had i hid thy handwork but it showed 
             changed sleep for wake and wake with me abode
when thou didst spurn my heart i cried aloud 
             pate hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad
                          in dole and danger aye my sprite i spy
an but the lord of love were just to me 
             sleep fro my eyelids neer were forced to flee
pity my lady one for love o thee 
             prom his tribes darling brought to low degree
                          love came and doomed wealth beggardeath to die
the railers chide at thee i neer gainsay 
             but stop my ears and dumbly sign them nay
thou lovst a slender may say they i say 
             ive picked her out and cast the rest away
                          enough when fate descends she blinds mans
                          eyefn310

and as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest he rose and walked on little by little till he entered the city—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and eighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that as soon as kamar alzaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest he arose and entered the citygatefn311 not knowing whither he should wend he crossed the city from end to end entering by the landgate and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea gate for the city stood on the seashore yet he met not a single one of its citizens and after issuing from the landgate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place and passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door whereupon the keeper came out to him and saluted him the prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome saying praised be allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city quick come into the garth ere any of the townfolk see thee thereupon kamar alzaman entered that garden wondering in mind and asked the keeper what may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be the other answered know that the people of this city are all magians but allah upon thee tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital accordingly kamar alzaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said know o my son that the cities of alislam lie far from us and between us and them is a four months voyage by sea and a whole twelve months journey by land we have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest moslem country and which entereth the seas of the ebony islands and thence maketh the khalidan islands the dominions of king shahriman thereupon kamar al zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant receiving for pay one fourth of the produce so he said to him wilt thou take me into thy service to help thee in this garden answered the gardener to hear is to consent and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees so kamar alzaman abode with him watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees and he wept floods of tears for he had no rest day or night by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved amongst others the following couplets


ye promised us and will ye not keep plight 
             ye said a say and shall not deed be dight
we wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep 
             watchers and wakers claim not equal right
we vowed to keep our loves in secrecy 
             but spake the meddler and you spoke forthright
o friend in pain and pleasure joy and grief 
             in all case you you only claim my sprite
mid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart 
             would he but show some ruth for me to sight
not every eye like mine is wounded sore 
             not every heart like mine lovepipings blight
ye wronged me saying love is wrongous aye 
             yea ye were right events have proved that quite
forget they one lovethralled whose faith the world 
             robs not though burn the fires in heart alight
if an my foeman shall become my judge 
             whom shall i sue to remedy his despight
had not i need of love nor love had sought 
             my heart forsure were not thus lovedistraught

such was the case with kamar alzaman but as regards his wife the lady budur when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not then she saw her petticoattrousers undone for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost whereupon she said to herself by allah this is strange where is my husband it would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away knowing not the secret which is in it would to heaven i knew whither can he have wended but it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away for he cannot brook to leave me a moment allah curse the stone and damn its hour then she considered awhile and said in her mind if i go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me there is no help for it but that i use stratagem so she rose and donned some of her husbands clothes and riding boots and a turband like his drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouthveilfn312 then setting a slavegirl in her litter she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her kamar alzamans steed and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march so they bound on the burdens and departed and she concealed her trick none doubting but she was kamar alzaman for she favoured him in face and form nor did she cease journeying she and her suite days and nights till they came in sight of a city overlooking the salt sea where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest the princess asked the name of the town and was told it is called the city of ebony its king is named armanús and he hath a daughter hayát alnufúsfn313 hight—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and ninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the lady budur halted within sight of the ebony city to take her rest king armanus sent a messenger to learn what king it was who had encamped without his capital so the messenger coming to the tents made inquiry anent their king and was told that she was a kings son who had lost the way being bound for the khalidan islands whereupon he returned to king armanus with the tidings and when the king heard them he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival as he drew near the tents the lady budur came to meet him on foot whereupon the king alighted and they saluted each other then he took her to the city and bringing her up to the palace bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house so they abode there three days at the end of which time the king came in to the lady budur now she had that day gone to the hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind and armanus found her clad in a suit of silk embroidered with gold and jewels so he said to her o my son know that i am a very old man decrepit withal and allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter who resembleth thee in beauty and grace and i am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state she is shine o my son and if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here i will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest when princess budur heard this she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame and she said to herself how shall i do and i a woman if i refuse and depart from him i cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me and if i consent belike i shall be put to shame i have lost my beloved kamar alzaman and know not what is become of him nor can i escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here till allah bring about what is to be so she raised her head and made submission to king armanus saying hearkening and obedience whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the ebony islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses then he assembled his chamberlains and nabobs and emirs and wazirs and his officers of state and the kazis of the city and formally abdicating his sultanate endowed budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty the emirs and grandees went in to her and did her homage nothing doubting but that she was a young man and all who looked on her bepissed their bagtrousers for the excess of her beauty and loveliness then after the lady budur had been made sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event and she had been ceremoniously enthroned king armanus proceeded to equip his daughter hayat alnufus for marriage and in a few days they brought the lady budur in to her when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction so they entered the bridalchamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them after the attendants had lighted the waxcandles and spread for them the carpetbed when budur found herself alone with the princess hayat alnufus she called to mind her beloved kamar alzaman and grief was sore upon her so she wept for his absence and estrangement and she began repeating

o ye who fled and left my heart in pain low lien 
             no breath of life if found within this frame of mine
i have an eye which eer complains of wake but lo 
             tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne
after ye marched forth the lover bode behind 
             question of him what pains your absence could design
but for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain 
             my fires would flame on high and every land calcine
to allah make i moan of loved ones lost for aye 
             who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine
i never wronged them save that over love i nurst 
             but love departs us lovers into blest and curst

and when she had finished her repeating the lady budur sat down beside the princess hayat alnufus and kissed her on the mouth after which rising abruptly she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions nor did she leave praying till hayat alnufus fell asleep when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning and when day had broke the king and queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did whereupon she told them what she had seen and repeated to them the verses she had heard thus far concerning hayat alnufus and her father but as regards queen budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the emirs and captains and officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her and she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign doubting not but that she was a man and she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience bidding and forbidding dispensing justice releasing prisoners and remitting the customsdues till nightfall when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her here she found hayat alnufus seated so she sat down by her side and clapping her on the back coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes and fell to versifying in these couplets

what secret kept i these my tears have told 
             and my waste body must my love unfold
though hid my pine my plight on parting day 
             to every envious eye my secret sold
o ye who broke up camp youve left behind 
            my spirit wearied and my heart acold
in my hearts core ye dwell and now these eyne 
             roll blooddrops with the tears they whilome rolled
the absent will i ransom with my soul 
             all can my yearning for their sight behold
i have an eye whose babefn314 for love of thee 
             rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled
the foeman bids me patient bear his loss 
             neer may mine ears accept the ruth he doled
i tricks their deme of me and won my wish 
             of kamar alzamans joys manifold
he joins all perfect gifts like none before 
             boasted such might and main no king of old
seeing his gifts bin záidahsfn315 largesse 
             forget we and muáwiyah mildestsouldfn316
were verse not feeble and oer short the time 
             i had in laud of him used all of rhyme

then queen budur stood up and wiped away her tears and making the lesser ablutionfn317 applied her to pray nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the lady hayat al nufus and she slept whereupon the lady budur came and lay by her till the morning at daybreak she arose and prayed the dawn prayer and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice this is how it fared with her but as regards king armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which queen budur had recited adding o my father never saw i one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh he answered o my daughter have patience with him yet this third night and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country and on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and tenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on queen budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace entered the apartment prepared for her there she found the waxcandles lighted and the princess hayat alnufus seated and awaiting her whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan and began improvising these couplets

news of my love fill all the land i swear 
             as suns on ghazáfn318wold rain heat and glare
speaketh his geste but hard its sense to say 
             thus never cease to grow my cark and care
i hate fair patience since i loved thee 
             eer sawest lover hate for love to bear
a glance that dealt lovesickness dealt me death 
             glances are deadliest things with torments rare
he shook his love locks down and bared his chin 
             whereby i spied his beauties dark and fair
my care my cure are in his hands and he 
             who caused their dolour can their dole repair
his belt went daft for softness of his waist 
             his hips for envy to uprise forbear
his brow curldiademed is murky night 
             unveil t and lo bright morn shows brightest light

when she had finished her versifying she would have risen to pray but lo and behold hayat alnufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying o my lord art thou not ashamed before my father after all his favour to neglect me at such a time as this when queen budur heard her words she sat down in the same place and said o my beloved what is this thou sayest she replied what i say is that i never saw any so proud of himself as thou is every fair one so disdainful i say not this to incline thee to me i say it only of my fear for thee from king armanus because he purposeth unless thou go in unto me this very night and do away my maidenhead to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee but i o my lord have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning and it is thy right to reckfn319 now when queen budur heard her speak these words she bowed her head groundwards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself if i refuse im lost and if i obey im shamed but i am now queen of all the ebony islands and they are under my rule nor shall i ever again meet my kamar al zaman save in this place for there is no way for him to his native land but through the ebony islands verily i know not what to do in my present case but i commit my care to allah who directeth all for the best for i am no man that i should arise and open this virgin girl then quoth queen budur to hayat al nufus o my beloved that i have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite and she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her saying i conjure thee by allah to keep my counsel for i have concealed my case only that allah may reunite me with my beloved kamar al zaman and then come what may—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and eleventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the lady budur acquainted hayat alnufus with her history and bade her keep it secret the princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed allah to reunite her with her beloved saying fear nothing o my sister but have patience till allah bring to pass that which must come to pass and she began repeating

none but the men of worth a secret keep
with worthy men a secrets hidden deep
as in a room so secrets lie with me
whose door is sealed lock shot and lost the keyfn320

and when hayat alnufus had ended her verses she said o my sister verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave and i will not discover shine then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the muezzins call to dawn prayer when hayat alnufus arose and took a pigeonpoultfn321 and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood then she pulled off her petticoattrousers and cried aloud whereupon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening whilst the lady budur arose with the dawn and repaired to the bath and after washing herself pure proceeded to the hall of audience where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk now when king armanus heard the loud cries of joy he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughters marriage whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriagefeast whereof the merrymaking lasted a long time such was their case but as regards king shahriman it was on this wise after his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by marzawan as before related he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him his restlessness was excessive his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon but he came not whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for kamar alzaman and he cried alas my son and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears and repeated with a beating heart


loves votaries i ceased not to oppose 
             till doomed to taste loves bitter and loves sweet
i drained his rigourcup to very dregs 
             self humbled at its slaves and freemens feet
fortune had sworn to part the loves of us 
             she kept her word how truly well i weet

and when he ended his verse he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition so they all mounted and set forth headed by the sultan whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son kamar alzaman and they advanced by forced marches now the king divided his host into six divisions a right wing and a left wing a vanguard and a rear guardfn322 and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the crossroads accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met but they knew not which the prince followed till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides now when king shahriman saw this he cried from his heartcore a loud cry saying alas my son and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment doubting not but his son was dead then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing and the troops also wept for his weeping all being assured that prince kamar alzaman had perished they threw dust on their heads and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die then the king with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets

chide not the mourner for bemourning woe 
             enough is yearning every ill to show
he weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain 
             and these to thee best evidence his lowe
happyfn323 of whom love sickness swore that neer 
             should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow
he mourns the loss of fairest fullest moon 
             shining oer all his peers in glorious glow
but death made drink a brimming cup what day 
             he fared from natal country fain to go
his home left he and went from us to grief 
             nor to his brethren could he say adieu
yea his loss wounded me with parting pangs 
             and separation cost me many a throe
he fared farewelling as he fared our eyes 
            whenas his lord vouchsafed him paradise

and when king shahriman had ended his verses he returned with the troops to his capital—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twelfth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king shahriman had ended his verses he returned with the troops to his capital giving up his son for lost and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces and made proclamation that all in the khalidan islands should don black in mourning for him moreover he built in his memory a pavilion naming it house of lamentations and on mondays and thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the house of lamentations mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac versesfn324 of which the following are some—

my day of bliss is that when thou appearest 
             my day of balefn325 is that whereon thou farest
though through the night i quake in dread of death 
            union wi thee is of all bliss the dearest

and again he said

my soul be sacrifice for one whose going 
             afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread
let joy her widowed termfn326 fulfil for i 
             divorced joy with the divorce thricesaidfn327

such was the case with king shahriman but as regards queen budur daughter of king ghayur she abode as ruler in the ebony islands whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers and say yonder is the soninlaw of king armanus and every night she lay with hayat alnufus to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband kamar alzaman weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream and at times she would repeat

well allah wots that since my severance from thee 
             i wept till forced to borrow tears at usury
patience my blamer cried heartsease right soon shalt see 
             quoth i say blamer where may home of patience be

this is how it fared with queen budur but as regards kamar al zaman he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the moslems at the end of the year and in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this but the gardener came in to him and said o my son give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees for it is a festival day whereon folk visit one another so take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden whilst i go look after the ship for thee for yet but a little while and i send thee to the land of the moslems upon this he went forth from the garden leaving to himself kamar alzaman who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes so he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and when he recovered he rose and walked about the garden pondering what time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved as he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought his foot stumbled and he fell on his face his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears then he rose and wiping away the blood dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie presently he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head wherewith it flew away whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before kamar alzaman as it lay behold two great birds swooped down upon it alighting one at the head and the other at the tail and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and extending their necks towards it wept kamar alzaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate and called to mind his wife and father and shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while but presently they returned with the murthererbird and alighting on the grave of the murthered stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails poured the blood on the grave of the slainfn328 moreover they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and pulling out the rest of the bowels scattered them hither and thither all this while kamar alzaman was watching them wonderingly but presently chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third he saw therein something gleaming so he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife but when he saw it and knew it he fell to the ground afainting for joy and when he revived he said praised be allah this is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyesfn329 after which he bound it to his forearm rejoicing in coming weal and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardeners return and when he came not he lay down and slept in his wonted place at daybreak he rose to his work and girding his middle with a cord of palm fibre took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden till he came to a carobtree and struck the axe into its roots the blow rang and resounded so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trapdoor and raised it—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fourteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when kamar alzaman raised the trapdoor he found a winding stair which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of ad and thamúdfn330 hewn out of the rock round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oiljar which he found full of gleaming red gold whereupon he said to himself verily sorrow is gone and solace is come then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and replacing the trapdoor as it was before busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day when the gardener came back and said to him o my son rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days time will set sail for the city of ebony which is the first of the cities of the moslems and after making it thou must travel by land a six months march till thou come to the islands of khalidan the dominions of king shahriman at this kamar alzaman rejoiced and began repeating

part not from one whose wont is not to part from you 
             nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify
another so long parted had taen heart from you 
             and had his whole condition changed—but not so i

then he kissed the gardeners hand and said o my father even as thou hast brought me glad tidings so i also have great good news for thee and told him anent his discovery of the vault whereat the gardener rejoiced and said o my son fourscore years have i dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou who hast not sojourned with me a year hast discovered this thing wherefore it is heavens gift to thee which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest quoth kamar alzaman there is no help but it must be shared between me and thee then he carried him to the undergroundchamber and showed him the gold which was in twenty jars he took ten and the gardener ten and the old man said to him o my son fill thyself leather bottlesfn331 with the sparrowolivesfn332 which grow in this garden for they are not found except in our land and the merchants carry them to all parts lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship so kamar alzaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman then sat he down to talk with the gardener confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself when i come to the ebony islands i will journey thence to my fathers country and enquire for my beloved budur would to heaven i knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my fathers country or whether there befel her any accident by the way and he began versifying

love in my breast they lit and fared away 
           and far the land wherein my love is pent
far lies the camp and those who camp therein 
            par is her tentshrine where i neer shall tent
patience far deaf me when from me they fled 
             sleep failed mine eyes endurance was forspent
they left and with them left my every joy 
             wending with them nor find i peace that went
they made these eyes roll down love tears in flood 
             and lacking them these eyne with tears are drent
when my taste spins once again would see them 
             when pine and expectation but augment
in my hearts core their counterfeits i trace 
             with love and yearning to behold their grace

then while he awaited the end of the term of days he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them whereat the hearer wondered and they both lay down and slept till the morning the gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days but on the third day his sickness increased on him till they despaired of his life and kamar alzaman grieved with sore grief for him meanwhile behold the master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener and when kamar alzaman told them that he was sick they asked where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the ebony islands he is your servent and he standeth before you answered the prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship so they transported them saying make haste thou for the wind is fair and he replied i hear and obey then he carried his provaunt on board and returning to bid the gardener farewell found him in the agonies of death so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes and his soul departed his body whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of allah almighty then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight so he went back to whence he came heavyhearted with whirling head and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and fifteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the ship sped on her course kamar alzaman returned to the garden in cark and care but anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees moreover he repaired the trapdoor and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him above all for the loss of the princess budurs talisman and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses such was his case but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the ebony islands now by decree of destiny queen budur was sitting at a latticewindow overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand at this sight her heart throbbed and she took horse with the chamberlains and nabobs and riding down to the shore halted by the ship whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him he answered o king i have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of yemen leather not to be borne of mule or camel and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes civet and ambergris and camphor and sumatra aloeswood and tamerindsfn333 and sparrowolives to boot such as are rare to find in this country when she heard talk of sparrow olives her heart longed for them and she said to the shipmaster how much of olives hast thou he replied fifty bottles full but their owner is not with us so the king shall take what he will of them quoth she bring them ashore that i may see them thereupon he called to the sailors who brought her the fifty bottles and she opened one and looking at the olives said to the captain i will take the whole fifty and pay you their value whatso it be he answered by allah o my lord they have no value in our country moreover their shipper tarried behind us and he is a poor man asked she and what are they worth here and he answered a thousand dirhams i will take them at a thousand she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace when it was night she called for a bottle of olives and opened it there being none in the room but herself and the princess hayat alnufus then placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold and she said to the lady hayat alnufus this is naught but gold so she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar moreover she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman which she took and examined and behold it was that which kamar al zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and sixteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon and when she recovered she said to herself verily this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved kamar alzaman but now it is an omen of good then she showed it to hayat alnufus and said to her this was the cause of disunion and now please allah it shall be the cause of reunion as soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the shipmaster who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her quoth she where didst thou leave the owner of these olives quoth he o king of the age we left him in the land of the magians and he is a gardener there she rejoined except thou bring him to me thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and i have a claim upon him for debt and unless ye bring him to me i will without fail do you all die and seize your goods so they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship if he would go and return a second time saying deliver us from this masterful tyrant accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and allah decreed him a prosperous voyage till he came to the island of the magians and landing by night went up to the garden now the night was long upon kamar alzaman and he sat bethinking him of his beloved and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying

a night whose stars refused to run their course 
             a night of those which never seem outworn
like resurrectionday of longsome lengthfn334 
             to him that watched and waited for the morn

now at this moment the captain knocked at the gardengate and kamar alzaman opened and went out to him whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright and they ceased not voyaging days and nights whilst kamar alzaman knew not why they dealt thus with him but when he questioned them they replied thou hast offended against the lord of the ebony islands the soninlaw of king armanus and thou hast stolen his monies miserable that thou art said he by allah i never entered that country nor do i know where it is however they fared on with him till they made the ebony islands and landing carried him up to the lady budur who knew him at sight and said leave him with the eunuchs that they may take him to the bath then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold and after returning to the palace she went in that night to the princess hayat alnufus and told her what had passed saying keep thou my counsel till i accomplish my purpose and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by kings and commoners after we be dead and gone and when she gave orders that they bear kamar alzaman to the bath they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that when he came forth he resembled a willowbough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser lightfn335 and its glow and his life and soul returned to his frame then he repaired to the palace and went in to the princess budur and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience till she should have accomplished her purpose and she bestowed on him mamelukes and eunuchs camels and mules moreover she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity till she made him lord high treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the emirs with his rank and dignity and all loved him for queen budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances as for kamar alzaman he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth and he devoted himself to the service of king armanus so that the king and all the emirs and people great and small adored him and were wont to swear by his life nevertheless he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by queen budur and said to himself by allah there needs must be a reason for this affection peradventure this king favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and therefore there is no help but that i crave leave of him to depart his realm so he went in to queen budur and said to her o king thou hast overwhelmed me with favours but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me and permit me to depart she smiled and asked what maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity answered kamar al zaman o king verily this favour if there be no reason for it is indeed a wonder of wonders more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience albeit i am as it were a young child and queen budur rejoined the reason is that i love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body i will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse and i will make thee wazir for all thy tender age even as the folk made me sultan over them and i no older than thou so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by allah he was a gifted man who said

it seems as though of lots tribe were our days 
             and crave with love to advance the young in yearsfn336

when kamar alzaman heard these words he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed aflame and he said i need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin i will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour quoth she i am not to be duped by thy scruples arising from prudery and coquettish ways and allah bless him who saith

to him i spake of coupling but he said to me 
            how long this noyous long persistency
but when gold piece i showed him he cried 
           who from the almighty sovereign eer shall flee

now when kamar alzaman heard these words and understood her verses and their import he said o king i have not the habit of these doings nor have i strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than i have proved unable then how will it be with my tender age but she smiled at his speech and retorted indeed it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of mans intendiment since thou art a boy why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof verily thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition so henceforward cease from denial and coyness for the commandment of allah is a decree foreordainedfn337 indeed i have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled and well inspired was he who said

my prickle is big and the little one said 
             thrust boldly in vitals with lionlike stroke
then i  tis a sin and he no sin to me 
           so i had him at once with a counterfeit pokefn338

when kamar alzaman heard these words the light became darkness in his sight and he said o king thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves who have not their like in this age shall not these suffice thee without me do thy will with them and let me go she replied thou sayest sooth but it is not with them that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment and can abate his fever for when tastes and inclinations are corrupted by vice they hear and obey other than good advice so leave arguing and listen to what the poet saith

when kamar alzaman heard her quote this poetry and was certified that there was no escaping compliance with what willed she he said o king of the age if thou must needs have it so make covenant with me that thou wilt do this thing with me but once though it avail not to correct thy depraved appetite and that thou wilt never again require this thing of me to the end of time so perchance shall allah purge me of the sin she replied i promise thee this thing hoping that allah of his favour will relent towards us and blot out our mortal offence for the girdle of heavens forgiveness is not indeed so strait but it may compass us around and absolve us of the excess of our heinous sins and bring us to the light of salvation out of the darkness of error and indeed excellently well saith the poet

of evil thing the folk suspect us twain 
             and to this thought their hearts and souls are bent
come dear lets justify and free their souls 
             that wrong us one good bout and then—repentfn347

thereupon she made him an agreement and a covenant and swore a solemn oath by him who is selfexistent that this thing should befal betwixt them but once and never again for all time and that the desire of him was driving her to death and perdition so he rose up with her on this condition and went with her to her own boudoir that she might quench the lowe of her lust saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this is the fated decree of the all powerful the allwise and he doffed his bagtrousers shamefull and abashed with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her said to him after this night thou shalt see naught that will offend thee then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf and said to him put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration he wept and cried i am not good at aught of this but she said by my life an thou do as i bid thee it shall profit thee so he put out his hand with vitals afire for confusion and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk the touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts and said in himself perhaps this king is a hermaphroditefn348 neither man nor woman quite so he said to her o king i cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men what then moved thee to do this deed then loudly laughed queen budur till she fell on her backfn349 and said o my dearling how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together then she made herself known to him and he knew her for his wife the lady budur daughter of king alghayur lord of the isles and the seas so he embraced her and she embraced him and he kissed her and she kissed him then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous repeating the words of the poet

when his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace 
             which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine
and shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart 
             he yielded though at first he was minded to decline
and dreading lest the railers eye should light upon his form 
             came armoured with caution to baffle his design
his waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet 
             like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel lien
girt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood 
             and clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest
             shine
his fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh 
             and to him like a bird uncaged i flew in straightest line
i spread my cheek upon his path beneath his sandalshoon 
             and lo the stibiumfn350 of their dust healed all my hurt
             of eyne
with one embrace again i bound the banner of our lovesfn351 
            and loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds
            malign
then bade i make high festival and straight came flocking in 
             pure joys that know not grizzled agefn352 nor aught of
             pain and pine
the full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth 
             that dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine
so in the prayerniche of their joys i yielded me to what 
             would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign
i swear by all the signsfn353 of those glories in his face 
             ill neer forget the chapter entituled alikhlasfn354

then queen budur told kamar alzaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise after which he began to upbraid her saying what moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night she replied pardon me for i did this by way of jest and that pleasure and gladness might be increased and when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone she sent to king armanus sire of the lady hayat alnufus and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to kamar alzaman moreover she told him their tale and the cause of their separation and how his daughter was a virgin pure as when she was born he marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold then he turned to kamar alzaman and said o kings son art thou minded to become my soninlaw by marrying my daughter replied he i must consult the queen budur as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint and when he took counsel with her she said right is thy recking marry her and i will be her handmaid for i am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices and obligations manifold especially as we are here in her place and as the king her father hath whelmed us with benefitsfn355 now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of hayat alnufus he agreed with her upon this matter—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and seventeenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar al zaman agreed with his wife queen budur upon this matter and told king armanus what she had said whereat he rejoiced with great joy then he went out and seating himself upon his chair of estate assembled all the wazirs emirs chamberlains and grandees to whom he related the whole story of kamar alzaman and his wife queen budur from first to last and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter hayat alnufus to the prince and make him king in the stead of queen budur whereupon said they all since he is the husband of queen budur who hath been our king till now whilst we deemed her soninlaw to king armanus we are all content to have him to sultan over us and we will be his servants nor will we swerve from his allegiance so armanus rejoiced hereat and summoning kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state bade draw up the contract of marriage between kamar alzaman and his daughter the princess hayat alnufus then he held high festival giving sumptuous marriagefeasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the emirs and captains of the host moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners the whole world rejoiced in the coming of kamar alzaman to the throne blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity renown and felicity and as soon as he became king he remitted the customsdues and released all men who remained in gaol thus he abode a long while ordering himself worthily towards his lieges and he lived with his two wives in peace happiness constancy and content lying the night with each of them in turn he ceased not after this fashion during many years for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father king shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him after a while almighty allah blessed him with two boy children as they were two shining moons through his two wives the elder whose name was prince amjadfn356 by queen budur and the younger whose name was prince asad by queen hayat alnufus and this one was comelier than his brother they were reared in splendour and tender affection in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness both men and women being ravished by their charms they grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed nor ever parting at any time or tide wherefore all the people envied them now when they came to mans estate and were endowed with every perfection their father was wont as often as he went on a journey to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement and each did justice among the folk one day at a time but it came to pass by confirmed fate and determined lot that love for asad son of queen hayat alnufus rose in the heart of queen budur and that affection for amjad son of queen budur rose in the heart of queen hayat alnufusfn357 hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sisterwife kissing him and straining him to her bosom whilst each mother thought that the others behaviour arose but from maternal affection on this wise passion got the mastery of the two womens hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths so that when the others son came in to either of them she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her till at last when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep presently the king fared forth to course and chase bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead each one day in turn as was their wont—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and eighteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the king fared forth to sport and hunt bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead each one day by turn as was their wont now prince amjad sat in judgement the first day bidding and forbidding appointing and deposing giving and refusing and queen hayat alnufus mother of asad wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him so she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences from the love deranged  the sorrowful and estranged  whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee  were i to recount to thee the extent of my care  and what of sadness i bear  the passion which my heart cloth tear  and all that i endure for weeping and unrest  and the rending of my sorrowful breast  my unremitting grief  and my woe without relief  and all my suffering for severance of thee  and sadness and loves ardency  no letter could contain it nor calculation could compass it  indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait and i have no hope and no trust but what from thee i await  upon death i am come nigh  and the horrors of dissolution i aby  burning upon me is sore  with parting pangs and estrangement galore  were i to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more  no scrolls would suffice to hold such store  and of the excess of my pain and pine i have made the following lines 

were i to dwell on heartconsuming heat 
             unease and transports in my spins meet
nothing were left of ink and reeden pen 
             nor aught of paper no not een a sheet

then queen hayat alnufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris and folded it up with her silken hairstringsfn358 whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to prince amjad—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and nineteenth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to prince amjad and that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him for the omniscient ordereth events even as he willeth and going in to the prince kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter on receiving the kerchief he opened it and reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his fathers wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband king kamar alzaman so he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works saying allah curse women the traitresses the imperfect in reason and religionfn359 then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch out on thee thou wicked slave dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lords wife by allah there is no good in thee o black of hue and heart o foul of face and natures forming so he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body then folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed reviling and reproaching her and saying each one of you is viler than the other and by allah the great and glorious did i not fear illmanneredly to transgress against the rights of my father kamar alzaman and my brother prince asad i would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head even as i cut off that of her eunuch then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage and when the news reached queen hayat alnufus of what he had done with her eunuch she abused himfn360 and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him he passed the night sick with rage wrath and concern nor found he pleasure in meat drink or sleep and when the next morning dawned prince asad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his fathers stead whilst his mother hayat alnufus awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from prince amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch so prince asad sat in the audiencechamber that day judging and administering justice appointing and deposing bidding and forbidding giving and bestowing and he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoonprayer when queen budur sent for a crafty old woman and discovering to her what was in her heart wrote a letter to prince asad complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines from her who perisheth for passion and loveforlorn  to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born  to him who is conceited of his own loveliness  and glories in his amorous grace  who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face  and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base  him who is cruel and of disdainful mood  from the lover despairing of good  to prince asad  with passing beauty endowed  and of excelling grace proud  of the face moon bright  and the brow flowerwhite  and dazzling splendid light  this is my letter to him whose love melteth my body  and rendeth my skin and bones  know that my patience faileth me quite  and i am perplexed in my plight  longing and restlessness weary me  and sleep and patience deny themselves to me  but mourning and watching stick fast to me  and desire and passion torment me  and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me  yet may my life be a ransom for thee  albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee  and allah prolong the life of thee  and preserve thee from all infirmity and after these cadences she wrote these couplets

fate hath commanded i become thy fere 
             o shining like full moon when clearest clear
all beauty dost embrace all eloquence 
             brighter than aught within our worldly sphere
content am i my torturer thou be 
             haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer
happy her death who dieth for thy love 
             no good in her who holdeth thee unclear

and also the following couplets

unto thee asad i of passionpangs complain 
             have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain
how long i ask shall hands of love disport with me 
             with longings dolour sleepliness and bale and bane
anon i plain of sea in heart anon of fire 
             in vitals o strange case dear wish my fairest fain
o blamer cease thy blame and seek thyself to fly 
             from love which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain
how oft i cry for absence and desire ah grief 
             but all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain
thy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear 
             thou art my only leach assain me an thou deign
o chider chide me not in caution for i doubt 
             that plaguey love to thee shall also deal a bout

then queen budur perfumed the letterpaper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and winding it in her hairstrings which were of iraki silk with pendants of oblong emeralds set with pearls and stones of price delivered it to the old woman bidding her carry it to prince asadfn361 she did so in order to pleasure her and going in to the prince straightway and without stay found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer when asad had read the paper and knew its purport he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosompocket then for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate thereupon he went in to his mother queen hayat alnufus whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case for that which had betided her with prince amjad and railed at her and cursed her after which he left her and foregathered with his brother to whom he related all that had befallen him with queen budur adding by allah o my brother but that i was ashamed before thee i had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders replied prince amjad by allah o my brother yesterday when i was sitting upon the seat of judgement the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport and he told him all that had passed adding by allah o my brother naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as i dealt with the eunuch they passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind and agreed to keep the matter secret lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction and when the morrow dawned the king returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate after which he sent the emirs about their business and went up to his palace where he found his two wives lying abed and both exceeding sick and weak now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance when kamar alzaman saw them on this wise he said to them what aileth you whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered perverting the case and saying know o king that thy two sons who have been reared in thy bounty have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives now when he heard this the light became darkness in his sight and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled then said he to them explain me this matter replied queen budur o king of the age know that these many days past thy son asad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while i still forbade him from this but he would not be forbidden and when thou wentest forth to hunt he rushed in on me drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand and smiting my eunuch slew him then he mounted on my breast still holding the sword and i feared lest he should slay me if i gainsaid him even as he had slain my eunuch so he took his wicked will of me by force and now if thou do me not justice on him o king i will slay myself with my own hand for i have no need of life in the world after this foul deed and queen hayat alnufus choking with tears told him respecting prince amjad a story like that of her sisterwife—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that queen hayat alnufus told her husband king kamar alzaman a story like that of her sister in wedlock budur and quoth she the same thing befel me with thy son amjad after which she took to weeping and wailing and said except thou do me justice on him i will tell my father king armanus then both women wept with sore weeping before king kamar alzaman who when he saw their tears and heard their words concluded that their story was true and waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death on his way he met his father inlaw king armanus who hearing of his return from the chase had come to salute him at that very hour and seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils for excess of rage asked what ailed him so kamar alzaman told him all that his sons amjad and asad had done and added and here i am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples quoth king armanus and indeed he too was wroth with them thou dost well o my son and may allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their fathers honour but o my son the sayer of the old saw saith whoso looketh not to the end hath not fortune to friend in any case they are thy sons and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand lest thou drink of their deathagonyfn362 and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught rather do thou send them with one of thy mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight for as saith the adage out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanterfn363 and when kamar alzaman heard his fatherinlaws words he knew them to be just so he sheathed his sword and turning back sat down upon the throne of his realm there he summoned his treasurer a very old man versed in affairs and in fortunes vicissitudes to whom he said go in to my sons amjad and asad bind their hands behind them with strong bonds lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste replied the treasurer i hear and i obey and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the princes and on his road he met them coming out of the palacevestibule for they had donned their best clothes and their richest and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt now when he saw them he laid hands on them saying omy sons know ye that i am but a slave commanded and that your father hath laid a commandment on me will ye obey his commandment they said yes whereupon he went up to them and after pinioning their arms laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city and he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon when he halted in a waste and desolate place and dismounting from his mare let down the two chests from the mules back then he opened them and took out amjad and asad and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness then drawing his sword he said to them by allah o my lords indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you but i am to be excused in this matter being but a slave commanded for that your father king kamar alzaman hath bidden me strike off your heads they replied o emir do the kings bidding for we bear with patience that which allah to whom be honour might and glory hath decreed to us and thou art quit of our blood then they embraced and bade each other farewell and asad said to the treasurer allah upon thee o uncle spare me the sight of my brothers deathagony and make me not drink of his anguish but kill me first for that were the easier for me and amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before asad saying my brother is younger than i so make me not taste of his anguish and they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the treasurer wept for their weeping then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other all this cometh of the malice of those traitresses my mother and thy mother and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother but there is no might and there is no majesty save in allah the glorious the great verily we are allahs and unto him we are returningfn364 and asad em braced his brother sobbing and repeating these couplets

o thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain 
           o ever ready whatso cometh to sustain
the sole resource for me is at thy door to knock 
           at whose door knock an thou to open wilt not deign
o thou whose grace is treasured in the one word befn365 
            favour me i beseech in thee all weals contain

now when amjad heard his brothers weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets

o thou whose boons to me are more than one 
             whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound
no stroke of all fates strokes eer fell on me 
             but thee to take me by the hand i found
then said amjad to the treasurer i conjure thee by the one omnipotent the lord of mercy the beneficent slay me before my brother asad so haply shall the fire be quencht in my hearts core and in this life burn no more but asad wept and exclaimed not so i will die first whereupon quoth amjad it were best that i embrace thee and thou embrace me so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke thereupon they embraced face to face and clung to each other straitly whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords weeping the while then he drew his blade and said to them by allah o my lords it is indeed hard to me to slay you but have ye no last wishes that i may fulfil or charges which i may carry out or message which i may deliver replied amjad we have no wish and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him that the blow may fall on me first and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the king and he asketh thee what heardest thou from them before their death do thou answer verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case then do thou repeat to him these two couplets

women are satans made for woe o men 
             i fly to allah from their devilish scathe
source of whatever bale befel our kind 
            in wordly matters and in things of faith

continued amjad we desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was ad the two hundred and twentysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that amjad added speaking to the treasurer we desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard and i conjure thee by allah to have patience with us whilst i cite to my brother this other pair of couplets then he wept with sore weeping and began

the kings who fared before us showed 
            of instances full many a show
of great and small and high and low 
             how many this one road have trod

now when the treasurer heard these words from amjad he wept till his beard was wet whilst asads eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets

fate frights us when the thing is past and gone 
           weeping is not for form or face alonefn366
what ails the nightsfn367 allah blot out our sin 
            and be the nights by other hand undone
ere this zubayrsonfn368 felt their spiteful hate 
             who fled for refuge to the house and stone
would that when khárijah was for amru slainfn369 
             they had ransomed ali with all men they own

then with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses

in sooth the nights and days are charactered 
            by traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie
the desertreekfn370 recalls their teeth that shine 
            all horrid blackness is their k of eye
my sin anent the world which i abhor 
            is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie

then his sobs waxed louder and he said

o thou who woost a worldfn371 unworthy learn 
            tis house of evils tis perditions net
a house where whoso laughs this day shall weep 
            the next then perish house of fume and fret
endless its frays and forays and its thralls 
            are neer redeemed while endless risks beset
how many gloried in its pomps and pride 
            till proud and pompous did all bounds forget
then showing back of shield she made them swillfn372 
            full draught and claimed all her vengeance debt
for know her strokes fall swift and sure altho 
             long bide she and forslow the course of fate
so look thou to thy days lest life go by 
             idly and meet thou more than thou hast met
and cut all chains of worldlove and desire 
           and save thy soul and rise to secrets higher

now when asad made an end of these verses he strained his brother amjad in his arms till they twain were one body and the treasurer drawing his sword was about to strike them when behold his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand and breaking its tether fled into the desert now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money so the treasurer threw down his sword and ran after his beast—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when his horse ran away the treasurer ran after it in huge concern and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket he followed it whilst it dashed through the wood smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dustcloud which towered high in air and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might hideous to sight with eyes sparkling light his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into mans sprite presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him so he said in himself there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of amjad and asad and indeed this journey was unblest from the first meanwhile the two princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour but none came to their relief and they said would to heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain but we know not whither the horse hath fled that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned if he would but come back and do us die it were easier to us than this torture to aby said asad o my brother be patient and the relief of allah extolled and exalted be he shall assuredly come to us for the horse started not away save of his favour towards us and naught irketh us but this thirst upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left till he burst his pinionbonds then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the emirs sword said by allah we will not go hence till we look after him and learn what is become of him then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other of a surety the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood quoth asad stay thou here whilst i enter the thicket and search it and amjad replied i will not let thee go in alone nor will we enter it but together so if we escape we shall escape together and if we perish we shall perish together accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer who lay like a sparrow in his grip calling upon allah for aid and signing with his hands to heaven now when amjad saw this he took the sword and rushing upon the lion smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground the emir sprang up marvelling at this escape and seeing amjad and asad his masters sons standing there cast himself at their feet and exclaimed by allah o my lords it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death may the man never be who would kill you indeed with my very life i will ransom you—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that quoth the treasurer to amjad and asad with my life will i ransom you both then he hastily rose and at once embracing them enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him so he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket and when they were in the open country they said to him o uncle do our fathers bidding he replied allah forbid that i should draw near to you with hurt but know ye that i mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine then will i fill two vials with the lions blood and go back to the king and tell him i have out vou to death but as for you two fare ye forth into the lands for allahs earth is wide and know o my lords that it paineth me to part from you at this they all fell aweeping then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own moreover he made two parcels of their dress and filling two vials with the lions blood set the parcels before him on his horses back presently he took leave of them and making his way to the city ceased not faring till he went in to king kamar alzaman and kissed the ground between his hands the king saw him changed in face and troubled which arose from his adventure with the lion and deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons rejoiced and said to him hast thou done the work yes o our lord replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood asked the king what didst thou observe in them and did they give thee any charge answered the treasurer i found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me verily our father is excusable bear him our salutation and say to him thou art quit of our killing but we charge thee repeat to him these couplets

verily women are devils created for us we seek refuge with god from the artifice of the devils they are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religionfn373

when the king heard these words of the treasurer he bowed his head earthwards a long while and knew his sons words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons clothes and weeping—and shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when king kamar lazaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons clothes and weeping it so came to pass that he found in the pocket of his son asads raiment a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the prince had been falsely accused and wrongously then he searched amjads parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of queen hayat alnufus enclosing also her hairstrings so he opened and read it and knew that amjad too had been wronged whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great i have slain my sons unjustly and he buffeted his face crying out alas my sons alas my long grief then he bade them build two tombs in one house which he styled house of lamentations and had graved thereon his sons names and he threw himself on amjads tomb weeping and groaning and lamenting and improvised these couplets

o moon for ever set this earth below 
             whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky
o wand which broken neer with bend and wave 
            shall fascinate the ravisht gazers eye
these eyne for jealousy i reft of thee 
            nor shall they till next life thy sight descry
im drowned in sea of tears for insomny 
            wherefore indeed in sáhirahsteadfn374 i lie
then he threw himself on asads tomb groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets
indeed i longed to share unweal with thee 
            but allah than my will willed otherwise
my grief all blackens twixt mine eyes and space 
             yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyesfn375
of tears they weep these eyne run never dry 
             and ulcerous flow in vitals never dries
right sore it irks me seeing thee in steadfn376 
             where slave with sovran for once levelled lies

and his weeping and wailing redoubled and after he had ended his lamentations and his verse he forsook his friends and intimates and denying himself to his women and his family cut himself off from the world in the house of lamentations where he passed his time in weeping for his sons such was his case but as regards amjad and asad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flintfn377 whose further end was unknown and here the road forked one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head they took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewherefn378 at last despairing of coming to the last of the road they retraced their steps and taking the other that led over the midway heights—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentysixth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that princes amjad and asad returned from the path leading to the mountain head and took that which ran along the midway heights and walked through all that day till nightfall when asad weary with much travel said to amjad o my brother i can walk no farther for i am exceeding weak replied amjad o my brother take courage may be allah will send us relief so they walked on part of the night till the darkness closed in upon them when asad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out o my brother i am worn out and spent with walking and threw himself upon the ground and wept amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day when they came to the mountaintop and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranatetree and a prayernichefn379 they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it but sitting down by that spring drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granadotree after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise when they washed and bathed in the spring and eating of the pomegranates slept again till the time of midafternoon prayer then they thought to continue their journey but asad could not walk for both his feet were swollen so they abode there three days till they were rested after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights tortured by and like to die of thirst till they sighted a city gleaming afar off at which they rejoiced and made towards it when they drew near it they thanked allah be his name exalted and amjad said to asad o my brother sit here whilst i go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in allahs wide world that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain whose skirts had we followed we had not reached this city in a whole year so praised be allah for safety replied asad by allah o my brother none shall go down into that city save myself and may i be thy ransom if thou leave me alone be it only for an hour i shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account for i cannot brook shine absence from me amjad rejoined go then and tarry not so asad took some gold pieces and leaving his brother to await him descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city as he threaded the streets he was met by an old man agedecrepit whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twainfn380 he bore a walkingstaff in his hand and was richly clad with a great red turband on his head when asad saw him he wondered at his dress and his mien nevertheless he went up to him and saluting him said where be the way to the market o my master hearing these words the shaykh smiled in his face and replied o my son meseemeth thou art a stranger asad rejoined yes i am a stranger—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyseventh night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the shaykh who met asad smiled in his face and said to him o my son meseemeth thou art a stranger and asad replied yes i am a stranger then rejoined the old man verily thou gladdenest our country with thy presence o my son and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence what wantest thou of the market quoth asad o uncle i have a brother with whom i have come from a far land and with whom i have journeyed these three months and when we sighted this city i left him who is my elder brother upon the mountain and came hither purposing to buy victual and what else and return therewith to him that we might feed thereon said the old man rejoice in all good o my son and know thou that today i give a marriagefeast to which i have bidden many guests and i have made ready plenty of meats the best and most delicious that heart can desire so if thou wilt come with me to my place i will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else moreover i will teach thee the ways of this city and praised be allah o my son that i and none other have happened upon thee as thou wilt answered asad do as thou art disposed but make haste for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me the old man took asad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane smiling in his face and saying glory be to him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city and he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house wherein was a saloon and behold in the middle of it were forty old men well stricken in years collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselvesfn381 when asad saw this he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were and the shaykh said to them o elders of the fire how blessed is this day then he called aloud saying hello ghazbán whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect grimvisaged and flat nosed as an ape who when the old man made a sign to him bent asads arms behind his back and pinioned them after which the shaykh said to him let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl suchanone torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the blue sea and the mountain of fire whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice so the black carried him out at another door and raising a flag in the floor discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamberfn382 under the earth into which he descended with him and laying his feet in irons gave him over to the slave girl and went away meanwhile the old men said to one another when the day of the festival of the fire cometh we will sacrifice him on the mountain as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the fire presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him in the middle of the night he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating so he wept bitter tears and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity lordship and dominion and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyeighth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when asad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets

stand by the ruined stead and ask of us 
             nor deem we dwell there as was state of us
the world that parter hath departed us 
             yet soothes not hatefull hearts the fate of us
with whips a cursed slave girl scourges us 
             and teems her breast with rancorous hate of us
allah shall haply deign to unpart our lives 
             chastise our foes and end this strait of us

and when asad had spoken his poetry he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock just enough to keep life in him and drank a little water but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugsfn383 and lice as soon as it was day the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes which were drenched with blood and stuck to him so that his skin came off with the shirt wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried alas and said o my god if this be thy pleasure increase it upon me o lord verily thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me do thou then avenge me upon him and he groaned and repeated the following verses


patient o allah to thy destiny 
             i bow suffice me what thou deign decree
patient to bear thy will o lord of me 
             patient to burn on coals of ghazátree
they wrong me visit me with hurt and harm 
             haply thy grace from them shall set me free
far bes o lord from thee to spare the wronger 
             o lord of destiny my hopes in thee

and what another saith

bethink thee not of worldly state 
             leave everything to course of fate
for oft a thing that irketh thee 
             shall in content eventuate
and oft what strait is shall expand 
             and what expanded is wax strait
allah will do what wills his will 
             so be not thou importunate
but joy the view of coming weal 
            shall make forget past bale and bate

and when he had ended his verse the slavegirl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again and throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water went away and left him sad and lonely bound in chains of iron with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved so he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and twentyninth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that asad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets

easy o fate how long this wrong this injury 
           robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro me
ist not time now thou deem this length sufficiency 
           of woes and o thou heart of rock show clemency
my friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy 
            mock and exult me for thy wrongs thy tyranny
my foemans heart is solaced by the things he saw 
           in me of strangerhood and lonely misery
suffice thee not what came upon my head of dole 
           friends lost for evermore eyes wan and pale of blee
but must in prison cast so narrow there is naught 
            save hand to bite with bitten hand for company
and tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud 
           and longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety
regretful yearnings singulfs and unceasing sighs 
           repine remembrance and pains very ecstacy
desire i suffer sore and melancholy deep 
           and i must bide a prey to endless phrenesy
i find me neer a friend who looks with piteous eye 
          and seeks my presence to allay my misery
say liveth any intimate with trusty love 
           who for mine ills will groan my sleepless malady
to whom moan i can make and peradventure he 
             shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see
the flea and bug suck up my blood as wight that drinks 
             wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity
amid the lice my body aye remindeth me 
             of orphans good in kázis claw of villainy
my homes a sepulchre that measures cubits three 
             where pass i morn and eve in chained agony
my wines are tears my clank of chains takes musics stead 
             cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed

and when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother thus far concerning him but as regards his brother amjad he awaited asad till midday yet he returned not to him whereupon amjads vitals fluttered the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtieth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when amjad awaited his brother asad till midday and he returned not to him amjads vitals fluttered the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears exclaiming alas my brother alas my friend alas my grief how i feared me we should be separated then he descended from the mountaintop with the tears running down his cheeks and entering the city ceased not walking till he made the market he asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said this is called the city of the magians and its citizens are mostly given to fireworshipping in lieu of the omnipotent king then he enquired of the city of ebony and they answered of a truth it is a years journey thither by land and six months by sea it was governed erst by a king called armanus but he took to son inlaw and made king in his stead a prince called kamar alzaman distinguished for justice and munificence equity and benevolence when amjad heard tell of his father he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go however he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat but recalling his brother he fell a weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together and that against his will then he rose and walked about the city seeking news of his brother till he saw a moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story whereupon quoth the tailor if he have fallen into the hands of the magians thou shalt hardly see him again yet it may be allah will reunite you twain but thou o my brother he continued wilt thou lodge with me amjad answered yes and the tailor rejoiced at this so he abode with him many days what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring till he became expert in the craft now one day he went forth to the seashore and washed his clothes after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment then he walked about the city to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness without peer for grace and comeliness when she saw him she raised her faceveil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances and versified these couplets

i drooped my glance when seen thee on the way 
            as though o slimwaist felled by sols hot ray
thou art the fairest fair that eer appeared 
             fairer today than fair of yesterdayfn384
were beauty parted a fifth part of it 
             with joseph or a part of fifth would stay
the rest would fly to thee shine ownest own 
             be every soul thy sacrifice i pray

when amjad heard these her words they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets

above the rose of cheek is thorn of lancefn385 
             who dareth pluck it rashest chevisance
stretch not thy hand towards it for night long 
             those lances marred because we snatched a glance
say her who tyrant is and tempter too 
             though justice might her tempting power enhance—
thy face would add to errors were it veiled 
             unveiled i see its guard hath best of chance
eye cannot look upon sols naked face 
             but can when mistcloud dims his countenance
the honeyhive is held by honeybeefn386 
             ask the tribeguards what wants their vigilance
an they would slay me let them end their ire 
             rancorous and grant us freely to advance
theyre not more murderous an charge the whole 
             than charging glance of her who wears the mole

and hearing these lines from amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and signing to him again repeated these couplets

tis thou hast trodden coyness path not i 
             grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh
o thou who makest morn with light of brow 
             and with loosed browlocks night in lift to stye
thine idolaspect made of me thy slave 
             tempting as temptedst me in days gone by
tis just my liver fry with hottest love 
             who worship fire for god must fire aby
thou sellest like of me for worthless price 
             if thou must sell ask high of those who buy
when amjad heard these her words he said to her wilt thou come to my lodging or shall i go with thee to shine so she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of him whose name be exalted men shall have the preeminence above women because of those advantages wherein allah hath caused the one of them to excel the otherfn387 upon this amjad took the hint—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtyfirst night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that amjad took the womans hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host the tailor so he walked on and she walked after him and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place till she was tired and said to him o my lord where is thy house answered he before us a little way then he turned aside into a handsome bystreet followed by the young woman and walked on till he came to the end when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great then raising his eyes he saw at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches but it was locked so amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other and she said to him o my lord wherefore waitest thou he bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered i am awaiting my mameluke who hath the key for i bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers to deck the wineservice against my return from the bath but he said to himself haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business leaving me here when i will wend my own way however as soon as she was weary of long waiting she said o my lord thy mameluke delayeth and here are we sitting in the street and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock said amjad be not in haste but have patience till the servant come however she hearkened not to him but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half whereupon the door opened quoth he what possessed thee to do this deed quoth she pooh pooh my lord what matter it is not the house thy house and thy place he said there was no need to break the bolt then the damsel entered to the confusion of amjad who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house but she said to him why dost thou not enter o light of mine eyes and core of my heart replied he i hear and obey but my servant tarrieth long and i know not if he have done aught of what i bade him and specially enjoined upon him or not hereupon he entered sore in fear of the people of the house and found himself in a handsome saloon with four daisd recesses each facing other and containing closets and raised seats all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gemencrusted dishes full of fruits and sweet scented flowers hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single waxcandle therein and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies gold and silver the floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owners fortune when amjad saw all this he was confounded at his case and said to himself i am a lost man verily we are allahs and to allah we are returning as for the damsel when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed and said to him by allah o my lord thy servant hath not failed of his duty for see he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit and indeed i come at the best of times but he paid no heed to her his heart being taken up with fear of the house folk and she said fie o my lord o my heart what aileth thee to stand thus then she sighed and giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut said o my lord an thou have made an appointment with other than with me i will gird my middle and serve her and thee amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down panting and saying to himself alack mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing whilst amjad sat careful and frowning thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself assuredly the master of the house cannot but come and then what shall i say to him he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly presently she rose and tucking up her sleeves took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before amjad and began to eat saying eat o my lord so he came forward and ate but the food was not pleasant to him on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door till the damsel had eaten her fill when she took away the tray of the meats and setting on the dessert fell to eating of the dried fruits then she brought the wine service and opening the jar filled a cup and handed it to amjad who took it from her hand saying to him self  ah ah and well away when the master of the house cometh and seeth me and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold even with cup in hand while he was in this case lo in came the master of the house who was a white slave one of the chief men of the city being master of the horsefn388 to the king he had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him now the name of this slave was bahádurfn389 and he was open of hand generous munificent and fain of almsgiving and charitable works—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it wad the two hundred and thirtysecond night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when bahadur the master of the horse and the owner of the house came to the door of the saloon and found it open he entered slowly and softly and looking in with head advanced and out stretched neck saw amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the winejar in front of them now amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door and when his glance met bahadurs eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his sidemuscles quivered so seeing his trouble bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips as much as to say be silent and come hither to me whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried whither away he shook his head and signing to her that he wished to make water went out into the passage barefoot now when he saw bahadur he knew him for the master of the house so he hastened to him and kissing his hands said to him allah upon thee o my lord ere thou do me a hurt hear what i have to say then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state and how he had not entered his house of his free will but that it was the girl who had broken the lockbolt and done all thisfn390 when bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a kings son he felt for him and taking compassion on him said hearken to me o amjad and do what i bid thee and i will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest but if thou cross me i will kill thee amjad replied command me as thou wilt i will not gainsay thee in aught no never for i am the freedman of thy bounty rejoined bahadur then go back forthwith into the saloon sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease i will presently come in to thee and when thou seest me remember my name is bahadur do thou revile me and rail at me saying what made thee tarry till so late and accept no excuse from me nay so far from it rise and beat me and if thou spare me i will do away thy life enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time i will bring thee forthwith and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way this i do in honour of thy strangerhood for i love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir so amjad kissed his hand and returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red at once said to the damsel o my mistress thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night quoth the girl verily i see a wonderful change in thee that thou now welcomest me so cordially so amjad answered by allah o my lady methought my servant bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels worth ten thousand diners each however when i went out but now in concern for this i sought for them and found them in their place i know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must i punish him for it she was satisfied with his answer and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown when bahadur came in to them having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes such as are worn of mamelukes he saluted and kissed the ground then held his hands behind him and stood with his head hanging down as one who confesseth to a fault so amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked why hast thou tarried till now o most pestilent of slaves answered bahadur o my lord i was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here for our appointed time was nightfall and not daytide but amjad cried out at him saying thou liest o vilest of slaves by allah i must needs beat thee so he rose and throwing bahadur prone on the ground took a stick and beat him gently but the damsel sprang up and snatching the stick from his hand came down upon bahadur so lustily that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour whilst amjad cried out to the girl dont and she cried out let me satisfy my anger upon him till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away so bahadur rose and wiping away his tears from his cheeks waited upon them the while after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps but as often as he went in and out the lady abused him and cursed him till amjad was wroth with her and said for almighty allahs sake leave my mameluke he is not used to this then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking and bahadur waiting upon them till midnight when being weary with service and beating he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted whereupon the damsel who was drunken with wine said to amjad arise take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slaves head and if thou do it not i will be the death of thee what possesseth thee to slay my slave asked amjad and she answered our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death if thou wilt not kill him i will do it myself quoth amjad by allahs rights to thee do not this thing quoth she it must perforce be and taking down the sword drew it and made at bahadur to kill him but amjad said in his mind this man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave shall we requite him by slaughtering him this shall never be then he said to the woman if my mameluke must be killed better i should kill him than thou so saying he took the sword from her and raising his hand smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body it fell upon bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes when he saw amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood and the damsel lying dead he enquired what had passed and amjad told him all she had said adding nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee and this is her reward then bahadur rose and kissing the princes hand said to him would to heaven thou hadst spared her but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay before the daybreak then he girded his loins and took the body wrapped it in an abácloak and laying it in a large basket of palmleaves he shouldered it saying thou art a stranger here and knowest no one so sit thou in this place and await my return till daybreak if i come back to thee i will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother but if by sunrise i return not know that all is over with me and peace be on thee and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket and threading the streets he made for the salt sea thinking to throw it therein but as he drew near the shore he turned and saw that the chief of police and his officers had ranged themselves around him and on recognising him they wondered and opened the basket wherein they found the slain woman so they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning when they carried him and the basket as it was to the king and reported the case the king was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to bahadur woe to thee thou art always so doing thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods how many murders hast thou done ere this thereupon bahadur hung his head—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtythird night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the king who cried out at him saying woe to thee who killed this girl he replied o my lord i killed her and there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the greatfn391 so the king in his anger commanded to hang him and the hangman went down with him by the kings commandment and the chief of police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of bahadur the kings master of the horse and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the marketstreets this is how it fared with bahadur but as regards amjad he awaited his hosts return till the day broke and the sun rose and when he saw that he came not he exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great would i knew what is become of him and as he sat musing behold he heard the crier proclaiming bahadurs sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday whereat he wept and exclaimed verily we are allahs and to him we are returning he meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake when i it was who slew her by allah this shall never be then he went from the saloon and shutting the door after him hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook bahadur when he stood before the chief of police and said to him o my lord put not bahadur to death for he is innocent by allah none killed her but i now when the captain of police heard these words he took them both and carrying them before the king acquainted him with what amjad had said whereupon he looked at the prince and asked him didst thou kill the damsel he answered yes and the king said tell me why thou killedst her and speak the truth replied amjad o king it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me were it graven with needles on the eyecorners it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother first and last whereat the king was much startled and surprised and said to him know that now i find thee to be excusable but list o youth wilt thou be my wazír hearkening and obedience answered amjad whereupon the king bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and bahadur and gave him a handsome house with eunuchs and officers and all things needful appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother asad so amjad sat down in the seat of the wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave moreover he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and marketstreets but heard no news of asad nor happened on any trace of him such was his case but as regards his brother the magi ceased not to torture asad night and day and eve and morn for a whole years space till their festival drew near when the old man bahramfn392 made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtyfourth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that bahram the magian having fitted out a ship for the voyage took asad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board now it so came to pass that at the very time of shipping it amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast then mounting with a company of his officers he rode down to the seaside and halted before the magians ship which he commended his men to board and search they did his bidding and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part but found nothing so they returned and told amjad who mounted again and rode back but he felt troubled in mind and when he reached his place and entered his palace he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets

my friends if ye are banisht from mine eyes 
             from heart and mind ye neer go wandering
but ye have left me in my woe and rob 
             rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering

and seeing them amjad thought of his brother and wept such was his case but as for bahram the magian he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste so they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights and every other day bahram took out asad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water till they drew near the mountain of fire then there came out on them a stormwind and the sea rose against them so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters and at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore with a castle whose windows overlooked the main now the ruler of this city was a queen called marjánah and the captain said to bahram o my lord we have strayed from our course and come to the island of queen marjanah who is a devout moslemah and if she know that we are magians she will take our ship and slay us to the last man yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit quoth bahram right is thy recking and whatso thou seest fit that will i do said the ship master if the queen summon us and question us how shall we answer her and bahram replied let us clothe this moslem we have with us in a mamelukes habit and carry him ashore with us so that when the queen sees him she will suppose and say this is a slave as for me i will tell her that i am a slavedealerfn393 who buys and sells white slaves and that i had with me many but have sold all save this one whom i retained to keep my accounts for he can read and write and the captain said this device should serve presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors and the ship lay still when behold queen marjanah came down to them attended by her guards and halting before the vessel called out to the captain who landed and kissed the ground before her quoth she what is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee quoth he o queen of the age i have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves and she said hither with him to me whereupon bahram came ashore to her with asad walking behind him in a slaves habit and kissed the earth before her she asked what is thy condition and he answered i am a dealer in chattels then she looked at asad and taking him for a mameluke asked him what is thy name o youth he answered dost thou ask my present or my former name hast thou then two names enquired she and he replied and indeed his voice was choked with tears yes my name aforetime was alasad the most happy but now it is al mutarr—miserrimus her heart inclined to him and she said canst thou write yes answered he and she gave him ink case and reedpen and paper and said to him write somewhat that i may see it so he wrote these two couplets

what can the slave do when pursued by fate 
             o justest judge whatever be his statefn394
whom god throws hand bound in the depths and says 
             beware lest water should thy body wetfn395

now when she read these lines she had ruth upon him and said to bahram sell me this slave he replied o my lady i cannot sell him for i have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he quoth the queen i must need have him of thee either by sale or way of gift but quoth bahram i will neither sell him nor give him whereat she was wroth and taking asad by the hand carried him up to the castle and sent to bahram saying except thou set sail and depart our city this very night i will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship now when the message reached the magian he grieved with sore grief and cried verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage saying to the sailors provide yourselves with your things and fill your waterskins that we may set sail at the last of the night so the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness such was their case but as regards queen marjanah when she had brought asad into the castle she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food they set food before asad and herself and both ate after which the queen called for wine—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

when it was the two hundred and thirtyfifth night

she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when queen marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her she fell to drinking with asad now allah be he extolled and exalted filled her heart with love for the prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature as he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers and sitting down under a tree he did his occasion then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face after which he would have risen to go away but the air smote him and he fell back with his clothes undone and slept and night overcame him thus so far concerning him but as concerns bahram the night being come he cried out to his crew saying set sail and let us away and the answered we hear and obey but wait till we fill our water skins and then we will set sail so they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle and found nothing but gardenwalls whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet which led them to the fountain and there they found asad lying on his back they knew him and were glad to find him and after filling their waterskins they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to bahram to whom they said hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes for thy prisoner whom queen marjanah took from thee by force we have found and brought back to thee and they threw asad down before him when bahram saw him his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste so they sailed forthright intending to make the mountain of fire and stayed not their course till the morning this is how it fared with them but as regards queen marjanah she abode awhile after asad went down from her awaiting his return in vain for he came not thereupon she rose and sought him yet found no trace of him then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him whilst she went forth in person and seeing the garden door open knew that he had gone thither so she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain searched the place in every part but came upon no sign of him and yet she gave not over the search till morning then she enquired for the ship and they told her the vessel set sail in the first watch of the night wherefor she knew that they had taken asad with them and this was grievous to her and she was sore anangered she bade equip ten great ships forthwith and making ready for fight embarked in one of the ten with her mamelukes and slavewomen and menatarms all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war they spread the sails and she said to the captains if you overtake the magians ship ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money but if you fail so to do i will slay you to the last man whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till on the fourth they sighted the ship of bahram the magian and before evening fell the queens squadron had surrounded it on all sides just as bahram had taken asad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him whilst the prince cried out for help and deliverance but found neither helper nor deliverer and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him now while so occupied bahram chanced to look up and seeing himself encompassed by the queens ships as the white of the eye encompasseth the black he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said woe to thee o asad this is all out of thy head then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried by allah i will slay thee before i die myself so they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank but allah be he extolled and exalted willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred so he caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet till the almighty gave him relief and sent him deliverance and the waves bore him far from the magians ship and threw him ashore he landed scarce crediting his escape and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers and captivity and stranger hood and presently he repeated these two couplets

allah my patience fails i have no ward 
             my breast is straitened and clean cut my cord
to whom shall wretched slave of case complain 
             save to his lord o thou of lords the lord
