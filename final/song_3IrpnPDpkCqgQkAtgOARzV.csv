walking through the traffic on a monday
in the town i grew up
shelter from the rain in every doorway
its dark and everyones numb
kids are making faces in the bus lane
but nobody looks up
everyones life the same as yesterday
just like the ticking of clocks

chorus
and im craving craving craving something i can feel
where do i go what do i need is it ecstasy or is it fear
am i on my own am i even close
coz im craving still craving something i can feel

verse 2
never thought the night could get so lonely
til she called me up
never thought these streets couldve outgrown me
i guess it wasnt enough
so i put my faith in everyone around me
then she sold all my stuff
sheer and wild abandon thats all i need
and someone i can trust

lead me out in the night
dont show me the way back home
