hes never gonna treat you right im sure
hes never gonna kiss you like he should
hes never gonna tuck you in at night
youve always been afraid to settle down
i dont even blame you cause look how
these boys are now

chorus
promise that ill make you feel
like were on a ferris wheel
were always young and innocent
i promise you when things get hard
our love will be strong enough
i know well last im confident

verse 2
i dont mean to speak in fairy tales
but we have had some heaven and some hell
and i can only speak for myself
and im speechless
youve always been afraid to claim this town
and i dont even blame you cause look how
these boys are now

chorus
promise that ill make you feel
like were on a ferris wheel
were always young and innocent
i promise you when things get hard
our love will be strong enough
i know well last im confident
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likebridge
cause when birds fly south its a beautiful thing
buy a big white house and a diamond ring
leave it all behind leave it all behind
cause when birds fly south its a beautiful thing
buy a big white house and a diamond ring
leave it all behind leave it all behind

chorus
promise that ill make you feel
like were on a ferris wheel
were always young and innocent
i promise you when things get hard
our love will be strong enough
i know well last im confident
i know well last im confident2embed"
