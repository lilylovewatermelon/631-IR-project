how does it feel
when you have it all
how can you live
with nothing at all
where do you run
where do you go
the holes in your truth
are starting to show

chorus
and the rain comes
and the world is on my head
crave the sun
but i cant get out of bed

verse 2
how can you take
without giving back
how does it work
when its really cracked
how does it feel
and no wonder hearts and minds have been won
how does it feel
and i wonder how its all come undone

and the rain comes
and the world is on my head
crave the sun
but i cant get out of bed
