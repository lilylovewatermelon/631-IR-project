beyond the boundaries of your citys lights
stand the heroes waiting for your cries
so many times you did not bring this on yourself
when that moment finally comes
ill be there to help

hook
on that day when you need
your brothers and sisters to care
ill be right here

chorus
citizen soldiers
holding the light for the ones that we guide
from the dark of despair
standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
well always be ready
because we will always be there

verse 2
when there are people crying in the streets
when theyre starving for a meal to eat
when they simply need a place to make their beds
right here underneath my wing
you can rest your head
you might also likehook
on that day when you need
your brothers and sisters to care
ill be right here

chorus
citizen soldiers
holding the light for the ones that we guide
from the dark of despair
standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
well always be ready
because we will always be there

bridge
there there there

verse 3
hope and pray that youll never need me
but rest assured i will not let you down
ill walk beside you but you may not see me
the strongest among you may not wear a crown

hook
on that day when you need
your brothers and sisters to care
ill be right here
hook 2
on that day when you dont have the strength
for the burden you bear
ill be right here

chorus
citizen soldiers
holding the light for the ones that we guide
from the dark of despair
standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
well always be ready
because we will always be there4embed"
