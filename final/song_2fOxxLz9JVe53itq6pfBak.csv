its funny how i find myself
in love with you
if i could buy my reasoning
id pay to lose
one half wont do

ive asked myself
how much do you
commit yourself

its my life
dont you forget
its my life
it never ends it never ends

i never knew
if i was sometimes played upon
afraid to lose

what good do you do
convince myself
