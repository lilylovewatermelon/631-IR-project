he hasnt seen a drop of rain for months it seems
rolling river is nothing but a trickling stream
the crops are dying in the harsh sunlight
the dust on his tongue is dry
the fatted calf is down to skin and bones
we carry on
alone in the city and shes only seventeen
the boy left her black and blue in the street so mean
just twelve weeks along and shes got a life inside
says shes never ever felt so alone
she walks in the shelter they say welcome home

chorus
and we carry on
when our lives come undone
we carry on
cause theres promise in the morning sun
we carry on
as the dark surrenders to the dawn
we were born to overcome
we carry on

verse 2
beyond the picket fences and the oil wells
the happy endings and the fairy tales
is the reality of shattered lives and broken dreams
we carry on
its the family that grieves for a lost loved one
its the soldier who wont leave till the job is done
its the addict trying to turn his life around
its picking yourself off the ground when youve been knocked down

and we carry on
when our lives come undone
we carry on
cause theres promise in the morning sun
we carry on
as the dark surrenders to the dawn
we were born to overcome

chorus
we carry on
when our lives come undone
we carry on
cause theres promise in the morning sun
we carry on
as the dark surrenders to the dawn
we were born to overcome
we carry on

outro
he stands in the field cooled by the winds of change
she smiles as her baby moves and it starts to rainembed"
