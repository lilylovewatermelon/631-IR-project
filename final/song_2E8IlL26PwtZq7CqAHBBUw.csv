was it a wasted couple months
sneaking outta the window spending nights in limbo
was that all there was for us
midnight driving running through highland
does it make me the criminal
that i let you go
that i broke us and left
i hate that i never know
why youre still so caught up in my head

prechorus
i know you wanted a promise
i wasnt ready can i be honest
never knew what i had until i lost it

chorus
and i got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
and i snap it every time that i think about your lips
got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
almost break it every time when im trying to forget

verse 2
i know that i have never been good at this
love you in a second next you know im checking out
of moments i shouldnt miss
now im looking through the photos
wishing i was different

and i got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
and i snap it every time that i think about your lips
got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
almost break it every time when im trying to forget

chorus
and i got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
and i snap it every time that i think about your lips
got this rubber band on my wrist on my wrist
almost break it every time when im trying to forget
