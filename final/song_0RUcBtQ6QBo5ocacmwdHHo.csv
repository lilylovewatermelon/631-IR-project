its 300 am and i finally say
im sorry for actin that way
i didnt really mean to make you cry
oh baby sometimes i wonder why

does it always have to come down to you leavin
before ill say i love you
why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you

verse 2
i know id never let you walk away
so why do i push you til you break
and why are you always on the verge of goodbye
before ill show you how i really feel inside

chorus
why does it always have to come down to you leavin
before ill say i love you
and why do i always use the words that cut the deepest
when i know how much it hurts you
oh baby why do i do that to you
