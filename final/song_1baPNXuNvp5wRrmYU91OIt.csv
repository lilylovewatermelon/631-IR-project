i hate if you love her im gon fuck her
five plain watches in my duffle
i got 20 freaks in my room
i got 20 freaks in my room
while im gettin a massage in my room
i just went skiing with a bad bitch
i spent 20000 on a jacket
i bought all the hitters some more ratchets

verse 1
i just took a meeting out in aspen
you get out of line its gon be drastic
pay my dawg a perc it made him happy
put you in a hearse like an assassin
runnin through the game in some ballys
i just want the green like aladdin
she kept it lowkey i was straddlin
i gave her more wood than a cabin

chorus
i hate if you love her im gon fuck her
five plain watches in my duffle
i got 20 freaks in my room
i got 20 freaks in my room
while im gettin a massage in my room
i just went skiing with a bad bitch
i spent 20000 on a jacket
i bought all the hitters some more ratchets

wrist cost a bentley truck
wrist cost a bentley truck
had drugs on me lot of red
then i hit the globe a lot of red
copped a speedboat and docked it
leftovers in my pocket
ima take off like a rocket
ima hold this money hostage

chorus
i hate if you love her im gon fuck her
five plain watches in my duffle
i got 20 freaks in my room
i got 20 freaks in my room
while im gettin a massage in my room
i just went skiing with a bad bitch
i spent 20000 on a jacket
i bought all the hitters some more ratchets
outro
while im gettin a massage in my room
while im gettin a massage in my room
