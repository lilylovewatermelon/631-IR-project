zephyr in the sky at night i wonder
do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
shes got herself a universe gone quickly
for the call of thunder threatens everyone

chorus
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel

verse 2
faster than the speeding light shes flying
trying to remember where it all began
shes got herself a little piece of heaven
waiting for the time when earth shall be as one

chorus
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel

zephyr in the sky at night i wonder
do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
shes got herself a universe gone quickly
for the call of thunder threatens everyone

bridge
and i feel
quicker than a ray of light then gone for
someone else will be there
through the endless years

outro
shes got herself a universe
shes got herself a universe
shes got herself a universe
and i feel
and i feel
and i feel like i just got home
and i feel
quicker than a ray of light shes flying
quicker than a ray of light im flying9embed"
