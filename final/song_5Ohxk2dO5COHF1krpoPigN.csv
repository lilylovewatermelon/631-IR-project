just stop your crying its a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
i hope youre wearing your best clothes
you cant bribe the door on your way to the sky
you look pretty good down here
but you aint really good

we never learn weve been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullets
we never learn weve been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets the bullets

chorus
just stop your crying its a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying itll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here

verse 2
just stop your crying have the time of your life
breaking through the atmosphere
things look pretty good from here
remember everything will be alright
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here
