im on the corner waiting for a light to come on
thats when i know that youre alone
its cold in the desert water never sees the ground
special unspoken without sound

verse 2
told me you loved me that id never die alone
hand over your heart lets go home
everyone noticed everyone has seen the signs
ive always been known to cross lines

verse 3
ive never ever cried when i was feeling down
ive always been scared of the sound
jesus dont love me no one ever carried my load
im too young to feel this old

outro
is it you
is it me
or does
nobody know
nobody see
nobody but mesee kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also like14embed"
