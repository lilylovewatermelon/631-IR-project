verse
four in the mornin while they sleepin im wide awake
thinkin about the problems i faced make my heart race
i done put my trust in so many they all traded lanes
i dont know where i should start but its time for a change
during the day im rod wave but i feel like cobain
do i wanna deal with the pain that tomorrow brings
might grab a gun blow out his brain he been feelin strange
but then he think bout reginae and think about charmaine
so many smiles so many hugs but i still feel alone
cut down the lights cut off his phone and get in his zone
lost in his thoughts hes in a vault but his mind it roams
and hell give his heart to anyone who will call it home
and hes been like that for so long since a small child
hed be okay until he sober then his thoughts pile
they be on social sites ridin clownin a nigga
then he remember hes up two three hundred thousand on niggas krrah

its just me myself and my heart
my heart said under any circumstance or for any reason
let down your guard again and ima stop beatin
