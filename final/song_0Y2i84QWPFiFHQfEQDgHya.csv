verse 1 corey taylor
come on down and see the idiot right here
too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
whats the matter with calamity anyway

i feel like a wound like i got a fuckin gun against my head
you live when im dead

verse 2 corey taylor
everybody hates me now so fuck it
bloods on my face and my hands
and i dont know why im not afraid to cry
but thats none of your business
whose life is it get it see it feel it eat it
