nobody ever had a dream round here
but i dont really mind that its starting to get to me
nobody ever pulls the seams round here
but i dont really mind that its starting to get to me

verse 2
ive got this energy beneath my feet
like something undergrounds gonna come up and carry me
ive got this sentimental heart that beats
but i dont really mind that its starting to get to me now

chorus 1
why do you waste my time
is the answer to the question on your mind
and im sick of all my judges
so scared of what theyll find
but i know that i can make it
as long as somebody takes me home
every now and then

break
well have you ever seen the lights
have you ever seen the lights

verse 3
i took a shuttle on a shockwave ride
where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
i took a bullet and i looked inside it
running through my veins an american masquerade
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeverse 4
i still remember grandma dixies wake
ive never really known anybody to die before
red white and blue upon a birthday cake
my brother he was born on the fourth of july and thats all

chorus 2
so why do you waste my time
is the answer to the question on your mind
and im sick of all my judges
theyre so scared of letting me shine
but i know that i can make it
as long as somebody takes me home
every now and then
every now and then

outro
you know i see london i see sams town
holds my hand and lets my hair down
rolls that world right off my shoulder
i see london i see sams town now10embed"
