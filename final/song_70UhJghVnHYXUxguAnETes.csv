colorado cans on the tennessee water
nothing really nibblin on the end of that bobber
me and my old mans old man just talkin it up
he said just cause you drop a line
dont mean the fishll bite

chorus
so if it dont rain talk to the good lord
if it dont crank it aint from detroit
you want a good song play an old one
the only good boat is a sold one
work aint always done when the days done
you cant always catch a break or a big one
but you can always catch a cold one

verse 2
yeah i didnt get it then but i sure do now
its kinda up to you how it all turns out
life aint always pinewood docks and blue skies
every time i reach down in the ice
i can still hear him from the other side

chorus
sayin if it dont rain talk to the good lord
if it dont crank it aint from detroit
you want a good song play an old one
the only good boat is a sold one
work aint always done when the days done
you cant always catch a break or a big one
but you can always catch a cold one
yeah you can always catch a cold one

chorus
if it dont rain talk to the good lord
