i was talking with a friend of mine
said a woman had hurt his pride
told him that she loved him so and
turned around and let him go
then he said you better watch your step
or youre gonna get hurt yourself
someones gonna tell you lies
cut you down to size

chorus
dont do me like that
dont do me like that
what if i love you baby
dont do me like that
dont do me like that
dont do me like that
someday i might need you baby
dont do me like that

verse 2
listen honey can you see
baby you would bury me
if you were in the public eye
giving someone else a try
and you know you better watch your step
or youre gonna get hurt yourself
someones gonna tell you lies
cut you down to size
you might also likechorus
dont do me like that

bridge
cause somewhere deep down inside
someone is saying
love doesnt last that long
i got this feeling inside
night and day
and now i cant take it no more

verse 2
listen honey can you see
baby you would bury me
if you were in the public eye
giving someone else a try
and you know you better watch your step
