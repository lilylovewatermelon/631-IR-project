this part i do alone
ill take my lead ill take my lead on this road
and i need something something to hold to hold
make me believe in makebeliefs
cause after the light is it dark is it dark all alone
all alone

interlude jim carrey
you are now listening to 1035 dawn fm
youve been in the dark for way too long
its time to walk into the light
and accept your fate with open arms
scared dont worry
well be there to hold your hand and guide you through this painless transition
but whats the rush
just relax and enjoy another hour of commercial free yourself music on 1035 dawn fm
stay tuned
