well tonight if you turn your radio on
you might hear a sad sad song
about someone who lost everything they had
it may sound like me
but im a little bluer than that

verse 2
when you look out in the morning
you might see clouds rolling by like memories
and a big old sky above you looking back
you may think of me
but im a little bluer than that

chorus
where did we go wrong
i wish i knew
it haunts me all the time
now wherever i go
and whatever i do
youre always on my mind

verse 3
i can picture you in his arms tonight
as for me it dont feel right
to let us fade like some old photograph
it may work for you
but im a little bluer than that
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
where did we go wrong
i wish i knew
it haunts me all the time
now wherever i go
and whatever i do
youre always on my mind

verse 1
so tonight if you turn your radio on
you might hear a sad sad song
about someone who lost everything they had
it may sound like me
but im a little bluer than that

outro
you may think of me
but im a little bluer than thatembed"
