well well well well
hello baby
for one day youre here
and then youre gone

verse 1 chink santana
i’m waking up to another day it’s amazing
its getting crazy thats why i wonder how i keep escaping
touching that pain maybe its just my prayers speak
as in the strange ways stuck in disgrace man
cause if youre hood like my hood youd get fucked up
cause the world is a ghetto niggas dead or locked up
so go on ahead get your hustle on and get your struggles gone
cause one day youre here then the next day youre gone

chorus ashanti  chink santana
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone and the next day youre gone

see every day we complain about little ups and downs
we need to be thanking the lord that we are still around
youll never ever know when
it is youre time to go and
i know its hurting so bad to lose people that we love
gotta use that example and try and straighten up
youve gotta live every day as if its your last one
see one minute youre here and then the next day youre gone

chorus ashanti  chink santana
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone and the next day youre gone

verse 3 ashanti
see lately i wake up in the morning wanting to cry
i bend my knees and i raise my head up to the sky
and sometimes i just cant fight my
feelings i have inside i
see i always wish that you would be here right by my side
im glad i told you i love you so much before you died
i knew you couldnt and wouldnt be here for very long
see one minute youre here and the next day youre gone
chorus ashanti  chink santana
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone and the next day youre gone

bridge ashanti
see what i need for yall to know
that living life can come and go
you gotta face reality
i want the world to sing with me
sometimes the world that we live in
dont seem so fair or forgiving
see these streets are so hard to survive in
cause all day you see people dyin
and i pray that one day we all see
that life aint promised to you and life aint promised to me
never forget this and be clear
we dont know how long we gon be here
i know you know yeah
i know la da da da
chorus ashanti  chink santana
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone the next day youre gone
one day youre here baby
and then youre gone and the next day youre gone
