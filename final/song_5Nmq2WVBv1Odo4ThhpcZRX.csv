truth is a whisper and only a choice
nobody hears above this noise
theres always a risk when you try to believe
i know that theres so much more than me
yeah

prechorus
yeah i got caught in the ruse of the world
its a just a promise no one ever keeps
and now its changing while you sleep
and no one here can see

chorus
you know all i am
feel this moment in you
you know all i am
can you teach me to believe in something

verse 2
sometimes you choke on the smell just to breathe
i need to question what i need
rhythm of silence
that beats through your mind
still you forget what you deny
yeah

and i got caught in the ruse of the world
its a just a promise no one ever keeps
and now its changing in your sleep
and no one here can see

chorus
you know all i am
feel this moment in you
you know all i am
can you teach me to believe in something

verse 3
whos the one you answer to
do you listen when he speaks
or is everything for you
and do you find it hard to sleep
or is it easy on your own
will you ever find some peace
before youre gone

chorus
you know all i am
feel this moment in you
you know all i am
can you teach me to believe in somethingembed"
