one day the dreamers died within us
when all our answers never came
we hid the truth beneath our skin but
our shadows never looked the same

chorus 1
a ghost is all thats left
of everything we swore we never would forget
we tried to bleed the sickness
but we drained our hearts instead
we are we are the dead

verse 2
and when we couldnt stop the bleeding
we held our hearts over the flame
we couldnt help but call it treason
after that we couldnt fill our frames
after that our shadows never looked the same

chorus 1
a ghost is all thats left
of everything we swore we never would forget
we tried to bleed the sickness
but we drained our hearts instead
we are we are the dead
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
in summers past wed challenge fate
with higher pitch and perfect aim
and standing fast wed radiate
a light we loved but never named
but the answers never came
and our shadows never looked the same

chorus 2
a ghost is all thats left
we are the ones who lost our faith
of everything we swore we never would forget
can we be saved
we tried to bleed the sickness
but we drained our hearts instead
we are we are the dead
we are the ones who lost our faith
a ghost of everything we thought but never said
can we be saved
we tried to bleed the sickness
but we drained our hearts instead

outro
we are the ones who lost our faith
we dug ourselves an early grave
we are the dead can we be saved1embed"
