we dont apologize and thats just the way it is
but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
dont try to criticize you bitches better plead the fifth
weve been idolized role models for all the kids

verse 1 jdog
you heard us before but that was just a little sample
were back for more here to set the worst example
chop it up white stuff lets begin
big wolves lining up and snorting little pigs
still drunk and were doing it again
with a huff and a puff ill blow and burn down your shit
murdered out pitch black grin still white skin
you know im hard to kill for real im moving in
im putting twentytwo down while im puking up blood
you know im here to stay or fuck im gonna die young
now my posses getting big and my posses getting bigger
its one eightyeight minus one you know the figure

chorus danny
we dont apologize and thats just the way it is
but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
dont try to criticize you bitches better plead the fifth
weve been idolized role models for all the kids

its easy to be drunk when its hard to be sober
imma steal your leased rover and pull police over
im a mean smoker who reeks of weed odor
certified street soldier devil on your teens shoulder
dont invite scene over he pees at sleepovers
he asks your sister out just so he can cheat on her
what a creep loner shit i couldnt sink lower
you just got a mean boner from a charlie scene poster
if im popping a wheelie its cause im jacking your bike
got my middle finger raised as im running red lights
im known to punch em in the dick at the end of a fight
and ill never say im sorry at the end of the night

chorus danny
we dont apologize and thats just the way it is
but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
dont try to criticize you bitches better plead the fifth
weve been idolized role models for all the kids

verse 3 johnny 3 tears
so many dollars stuffed in my wallet
chain so bling yeah you know that im a baller
we can take the blame cause your parents dont wanna
they roll their blunts with your marijuana
how can i run when the pigs got a chopper
i got a gun but they got a lotta
shooting at the sky with a motherfucking sawedoff
god bless a catholic forgive me father
now whats a man to do when another holds a bible
vatican suing me holding me liable
confessions of a kid and they call em suicidal
temptations of a sinner but we call him a child
how can you blame em a playground of dealing
the mothers still buying the fathers still preaching
now its up to me cause no ones gonna teach em
now nobody nobody needs em
chorus danny
we dont apologize and thats just the way it is
but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit
dont try to criticize you bitches better plead the fifth
weve been idolized role models for all the kids5embed"
