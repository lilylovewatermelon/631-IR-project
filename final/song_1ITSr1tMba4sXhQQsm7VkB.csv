when i think of you and the first time we met
and i heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
my heart took me over and gave me no choice
and right then i knew

chorus chris stapleton  morgane stapleton

from the moment you wake me up
til you kiss me goodnight
everything that you do
it makes me want more of you

and all of the smiles that youve brought to my face
