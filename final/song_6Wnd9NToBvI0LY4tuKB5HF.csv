verse 1
your boyfriend is not a man hes a boy friend
just someone takin up the place of a real man
im 24 and i can take you where you never been
and we aint gotta leave the state to see where ive been
just close ya eyes close ya eyes close ya eyes
and free your mind free your mind free you mind
now open wide open wide open wide
and now im finna come inside
now just when you thought here go the same routine
i got a bowl of strawberries and some whipped cream
and made a trail from your stomach to your clit ring
the strawberries for you girl imma lick the cream

who love women women i love women
i love the way her body wiggle when i lick that clit
victorious in the clitoris my name is vic

when i make her cum three times without using the dick

and if you wanna please em i suggest that you should follow
unless you like it quiet in your bed but mine holla
