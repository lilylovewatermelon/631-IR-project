from the depths of hell
so far i fell
a deal made with the devil
after all the dust had settled
theres an hourglass of time
counting down all of the lies
and with every grain of sand
time is slipping through my hands

verse 2
oh i sold my soul to rock and roll
and i let my demons take control
redemption seems so far away
this microphone is my escape
dont mess with ouija boards
cause now my spirits torn

prechorus
im bound by fear of being trapped
im falling faster fade to black
somethings standing in my way
hoping for better days

chorus
im always searching
for serenity
and im always standing
at the edge of reality oh
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 3
i spill my heart out on the stage
the only way i feel okay
and right before that curtain calls
i just got one more thing to say
dont mess with ouija boards
cause now my spirits torn

chorus
im always searching
for serenity
and im always standing
at the edge of reality oh

postchorus
from the depths of hell
so far i fell
a deal made with the devil
after all the dust had settled

bridge
look into my eyes
you will see the light
it burns so bright
this flame will never die
i speak the truth
immortalized my youth
no other way
until my final day
oh i feel the hate
welling up inside
and its too late
nowhere to run and hide
dont mess with ouija boards
dont mess with ouija boards
prechorus
im bound by fear of being trapped
im falling faster better days

chorus
im always searching
for serenity
and im always standing
at the edge of reality oh
im always searching
for serenity
and im always standing
at the edge of reality oh
