im bound to wander where
all of your glitters going
but im so far from knowing
and none of my instincts showing
kicking kicking im
screaming from outside in
tell me where ive been
theres nowhere to return to out there

prechorus
i think ive lost my way
but thats just not news today

chorus
because the storys old
the black and white
have gone to grey
the storys old
the black and white
have gone to grey
the storys old
the black and white
have gone to grey
and you were right
cause i finally lost my way
