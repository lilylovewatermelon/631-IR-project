wake up in the morning with a head like what ya done
this used to be the life but i dont need another one
you like cuttin up and carryin on you wear them gowns
so how come i feel so lonely when youre up gettin down

prechorus
so ill play along when i hear that special song
im gonna be the one who gets it right
youd better move when youre swingin round the room
looks like the magics only ours tonight

chorus
but i dont feel like dancin when the old joanna plays
my heart could take a chance but my two feet cant find a way
youd think that i could muster up a little softshoe gentle sway
but i dont feel like dancin no sir no dancin today
i dont feel like dancin dancin
even if i find nothin better to do
dont feel like dancin dancin
whyd you pick a tune when im not in the mood
dont feel like dancin dancin
id rather be home with the one in the bed til dawn with you

verse 2
cities come and cities go just like the old empires
when all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
you got so many colours itd make a blind man so confused
then why cant i keep up when youre the only thing id lose
you might also likeprechorus
so ill just pretend that i know which way to bend
and im gonna tell the whole world that youre mine
just please understand when i see you clap your hands
if you stick around im sure that ill be fine

chorus
but i dont feel like dancin when the old joanna plays
my heart could take a chance but my two feet cant find a way
youd think that i could muster up a little softshoe gentle sway
but i dont feel like dancin no sir no dancin today
i dont feel like dancin dancin
even if i find nothin better to do
dont feel like dancin dancin
whyd you pick a tune when im not in the mood
dont feel like dancin dancin
id rather be home with the one in the bed til dawn with you

bridge
you cant make me dance around
but your twostep makes my chest pound
just lay me down
as you float away into the shimmer lights

chorus
but i dont feel like dancin when the old joanna plays
my heart could take a chance but my two feet cant find a way
youd think that i could muster up a little softshoe gentle sway
but i dont feel like dancin no sir no dancin today
i dont feel like dancin dancin
even if i find nothin better to do
dont feel like dancin dancin
whyd you pick a tune when im not in the mood
dont feel like dancin dancin
id rather be home with the one in the bed til dawn with you
i dont feel like dancin dancin
even if i find nothin better to do
dont feel like dancin dancin
whyd you pick a tune when im not in the mood
dont feel like dancin dancin
id rather be home with the one in the bed til dawn with you4embed"
