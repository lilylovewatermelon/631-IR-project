verse 1
borderline
dead inside
i dont mind
falling to pieces
count me in
violent
lets begin
feeding the sickness
how do i
simplify
dislocate
the enemys on the way

chorus
show me what its like
to dream in black and white
so i can leave this world tonight

verse 2
full of fear everclear
ill be here fighting forever
curious venomous
youll find me climbing to heaven
never mind turn back time
youll be fine i will get left behind

so i can leave this world behind

chorus
show me what its like
to dream in black and white
so i can leave this world tonight
holding on too tight
breathe the breath of life
so i can leave this world behind4embed"
