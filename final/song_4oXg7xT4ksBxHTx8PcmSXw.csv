how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i went wrong
wont take my eyes off the ball again
you reel me out then you cut the string

how come i end up where i started
how come i end up where i went wrong
wont take my eyes off the ball again
first you reel me out and then you cut the string

verse 1
you used to be alright
what happened
did the cat get your tongue
did your string come undone
one by one
one by one
it comes to us all
its as soft as your pillow

verse 2
you used to be alright
what happened
et cetera et cetera
fads for whatever
fifteen steps then a sheer drop

wont take my eyes off the ball again
you reel me out then you cut the string31embed"
