recorded samples
rewind rewind
helpless skys skys
drownin in em
drownin rewind

i remember that night i just might rewind
i remember that night i just might rewind
i remember that night i remember that—

angelica
i remember that night i just might
regret that night for the rest of my days
i remember those soldier boys
tripping over themselves to win our praise
i remember that dreamlike candlelight
like a dream that you can’t quite place
but alexander i’ll never forget the first
time i saw your face
i have never been the same
intelligent eyes in a hungerpang frame
and when you said “hi” i forgot my dang name
set my heart aflame ev’ry part aflame

full company
this is not a game…
hamilton
you strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

angelica
i’m sure i don’t know what you mean you forget yourself
hamilton
you’re like me i’m never satisfied
angelica
is that right
hamilton
i have never been satisfied

angelica
my name is angelica schuyler
hamilton
alexander hamilton
angelica
where’s your fam’ly from

hamilton
unimportant there’s a million things i haven’t done but
just you wait just you wait…

angelica
so so so—
so this is what it feels like to match wits
with someone at your level what the hell is the catch it’s
the feeling of freedom of seein’ the light
it’s ben franklin with a key and a kite you see it right
the conversation lasted two minutes maybe three minutes
ev’rything we said in total agreement it’s
a dream and it’s a bit of a dance
a bit of a posture it’s a bit of a stance he’s a
bit of a flirt but i’m ‘a give it a chance
i asked about his fam’ly did you see his answer
his hands started fidgeting he looked askance
he’s penniless he’s flying by the seat of his pants
handsome boy does he know it
peach fuzz and he can’t even grow it
i wanna take him far away from this place
then i turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

eliza
helpless…

angelica
and i know she is…

eliza
helpless…

angelica
and her eyes are just…

eliza
helpless…

angelica
and i realize

angelica and company
three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
hamilton
where are you taking me

angelica
i’m about to change your life

hamilton
then by all means lead the way

company except angelica
number one

angelica
i’m a girl in a world in which
my only job is to marry rich
my father has no sons so i’m the one
who has to social climb for one
so i’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
new york city is insidious
and alexander is penniless
ha that doesn’t mean i want him any less

eliza
elizabeth schuyler it’s a pleasure to meet you

hamilton
schuyler

angelica
my sister

company
number two

angelica
he’s after me cuz i’m a schuyler sister
that elevates his status i’d
have to be naïve to set that aside
maybe that is why i introduce him to eliza
now that’s his bride
nice going angelica he was right
you will never be satisfied

eliza
thank you for all your service
hamilton
if it takes fighting a war for us to meet it will have been worth it

angelica
i’ll leave you to it

company
number three

angelica
i know my sister like i know my own mind
you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
if i tell her that i love him she’d be silently resigned
he’d be mine
she would say “i’m fine”

angelica and company
she’d be lying

angelica
but when i fantasize at night
it’s alexander’s eyes
as i romanticize what might
have been if i hadn’t sized him
up so quickly
at least my dear eliza’s his wife
at least i keep his eyes in my life…

angelica
he will never be satisfied
i will never be satisfied

angelica all men except hamilton all women except eliza
