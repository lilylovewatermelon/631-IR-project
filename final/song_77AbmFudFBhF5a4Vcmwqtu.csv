verse 1
when i reminisce ignorance was bliss
back in the days where the magic exist
never be the same as it was cause the way it was
just another day in the maze of a myth
had a lot of fun livin life on the run
never had chance to pause to get a better glance
everything was free and everything was fast
never even thought it wouldnt last
when you got the mind of a man in the middle
life is just a big fat riddle so figure it out
always thinkin that you know every little thing there is to know
but you dont really know you know
its like love some people get it
for some its just a glove that just never fitted
for me its just a pain in the ass
but im addicted to the taste of hopin it could last

chorus
another day another night inside a lonely world
another game another fight inside a lonely world
another wrong another right inside a lonely world
such a lonely world such a lonely world

verse 2
maybe im a target for people that are bitter
at least i can say that ive never been a quitter
i remember high school man i hated high school
it was like prison with bullies always puttin me down
just a little skaterboy they could pick on
i learned to forgive em now i got the balls they can lick on
i loved sneakin out when my mom was asleep
with my gothic girlfriend makin love in the creek
with the mind of a man in the middle
it could be the end of the world as we know it
still i never want it all and i never want it now
i just wanna cruise if i lose then ill figure it out
how the times files even with the blink of an eye
when youre young you absorb like a sponge in disguise
then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
its was amazing what you learn when youve never been taught you know

chorus
another day another night inside a lonely world
another game another fight inside a lonely world
another wrong another right inside a lonely world
such a lonely world such a lonely world
bridge
no matter how hard i can try inside a lonely world
no one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world
ill never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
such a lonely world such a lonely world
no matter how hard i can try inside a lonely world
no one can hear me when i cry inside a lonely world
ill never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
such a lonely world such a lonely world

chorus
another day another night inside a lonely world
another game another fight inside a lonely world
another wrong another right inside a lonely world
such a lonely world such a lonely world

outro
whos the man in such a lonely world
whowhos the man in such a lonely world
whowhos the man in such a lonely world
whowhos the man in such a lonely world
in such a lonely world
in such a lonely world
in such a lonely world
