racey days help me through the hopeless haze
but my oh my
tragic eyes i cant even recognize myself
behind

chorus 1
so if the answer is no
can i change your mind

verse 2
out again a siren screams at halfpast ten
and you wont let go
while i ignore that weve both felt like this before
it starts to show

chorus 2
so if i have a chance
would you let me know

bridge
why arent you shakin
step back in time
graciously taken
oh youre too kind
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus 1
and if the answer is no
can i change your mind

verse 3
were all the same
and love is blind
the sun is gone
before it shines

chorus 1
and i said if the answer is no
can i change your mind
if the answer is no
can i change your mind9embed"
