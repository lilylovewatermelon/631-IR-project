countdown unless youre juvenile lets go
god bless your miss somewhere
were sick for the big sun
it doesnt matter what you did
and if you did it like you been told

prechorus
true and everlasting thats what you want
true true and everlasting thats what you want
dont say no your breakfast eaten alone
resist or let go youre borderline withdrawn
down unlit from the bottom there is a misfit
better than it looks better than it looks
better than it looks better than it looks

chorus
were sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick
were sick for the big sun
we rumble and trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
i realize that too

verse 2
hear the lonesome bell is this knowledge
ask forgiveness you know somewhere
youre fixed to an atom
it doesnt matter what you did
and if you did it right lets go

cruel and everlasting thats what you want
cruel cruel and everlasting thats what you want
dont say no your breakfast eaten alone
do you remember when 21 years was old
down unlit does it matter that you care the less
better than it looks better than it looks
better than it looks better than it looks

chorus
were sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick sick
were sick for the big sun
we rumble and trip trip trip trip trip trip trip
i realize that too

outro
true true and everlasting it didnt last that long
were the lonesome were the lonesome yell
true and everlasting it didnt last that long
true true and everlasting it didnt last that long
were the lonesome were the lonesome yell
true and everlasting it didnt last that long
were the lonesome were the lonesome3embed"
