walk with me the diamond road
tell me every story told
give me something of your soul
that i can hold onto
i wanna wake up to the sound of waves
crashing on a brand new day
keep the memory of your face
but wipe the pain away

chorus
when youre lonely youre not alone
when your heart aches on diamond road
its gonna take a little time
yeah its gonna take a little time
when the night falls youre not alone
when youre stumbling on diamond road
its gonna take a little time
to make it to the other side
so dont miss the diamonds along the way
cause every road has led us here today

verse 2
little bird whats troubling you
you know what you have to do
is what is yours youll never lose
and whats ahead may shine
oh beneath the promise of blue skies
with broken wings well learn to fly
pull yourself out of the tide
and begin the dream again

when youre lonely youre not alone
when your heart aches on diamond road
its gonna take a little time
to make it to the other side
when the night falls youre not alone
when youre stumbling on diamond road

so dont miss the diamonds along the way

verse 3
walk with me the diamond road
tell me everything is gold
give me something of your soul
so you dont fade away oh

chorus
when youre lonely youre not alone
when your heart aches on diamond road
its gonna take a little time
to make it to the other side
when the night falls youre not alone
when youre stumbling on diamond road
its gonna take a little time
to make it to the other side
when youre lonely in every love song youre not alone
when your heart aches in every sunrise on diamond road
its gonna take a little time i will remember you
to make it to the other side i will remember you
when the night falls in every sunset youre not alone
when youre stumbling in every color on diamond road
its gonna take a little time i will remember you
but everything will be just fine
outro
so dont miss the diamonds along the way
every road has led us here today
life is what happens while youre making plans
and all that you need is right here in your handsembed"
