sometimes i can get a little
i can get a little lonely
sometimes i can get a little
i can get a little lonely

verse 1
some nights i get a little lonely
its even when theres people all around me
sometimes i get a little anxious
cause these pills dont work the way the doctor played it

prechorus
im startin to spin needles and pins
right on the brim hand on a limb takin it in
sleep it away life in a day no day in a life
mixin it up checkin it twice
tryin to breathe startin to seize
lights camera action and scene
story of my life

chorus
oh love sometimes i can get a little
have mercy i can get a little lonely
on me sometimes i can get a little
and keep me company i can get a little lonely
i said oh love sometimes i can get a little
have mercy i can get a little lonely
on me sometimes i can get a little
and keep me company i can get a little lonely
i said—

i hide in corners hope that no one sees me

prechorus
so im playin the role ridin the bull stuck in a hole
takin a bow lookin so proud
look at me now talkin about pills in my mouth
under the tongue isnt it fun
tryin to breathe startin to seize
lights camera action and scene
story of my life ohoh

chorus
oh love sometimes i can get a little
have mercy i can get a little lonely
on me sometimes i can get a little
and keep me company i can get a little lonely
i said oh love sometimes i can get a little
have mercy i can get a little lonely
on me sometimes i can get a little
and keep me company i can get a little lonely
