just one more time
before i go ill let you know
that all this time ive been afraid
wouldnt let it show
nobody can save me now no
nobody can save me now

verse 2
stars are only visible in darkness
fear is everchanging and evolving
and i i feel poisoned inside
but i i feel so alive

chorus
nobody can save me now
king is crowned
its do or die
nobody can save me now
the only sound
is the battle cry
is the battle cry
is the battle cry
nobody can save me now
its do or die

nobody can save me now
king is crowned
its do or die
nobody can save me now
the only sound
is the battle cry
is the battle cry
is the battle cry
nobody can save me now
its do or die

outro
just one more time
before i go ill let you know
that all this time ive been afraid
wouldnt let it show
nobody can save me now no
