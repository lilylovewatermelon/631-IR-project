up all night up all night
up all night up all night

verse 1 yung maraschino
bitch im in russia playin roulette at a casino
bitches calling me yung maraschino
but im selfish with the fucking pinot
direct them out my fucking face i think im tarantino
codeine in my san pellegrino
sniffin up pacino take a trip to reno
dropping acid but it aint amino
now i think im dan marino sipping cappuccino
all of a sudden i see mosquitos
bloodsuckin duckin bugs coming from below
one of them turns into my po
so i fire off a shot and then i fucking reload thinking im a hero
next thing i remember i was in a hospital bed
gun blast to the head looking like a zero
now im surrounded by flames like i was nero

bridge drake
up all night up all night
up all night up all night

verse 2 yung heath ledger
its that thuggish ruggish uicide
every day my momma cries she knows i wanna fucking die
always asking who am i
shoot and die i never miss
carecrow creepin in the mist
put that gun up to my lips fill my mouth up with the clip
the everlasting triple 6 fuckin murder killer
prescription filler aint a thing to rob a drug dealer
underwater savage creepin through the lake like jason
59 mobbing deeper than the free masons
rippin and killin these bitches i swear you gonna feel the pain
never did fuck with no snitches
and i put that on my daddy name
covered in crows up i glo
call up now to roll that dro then up i go driftin in smoke
anxiety creeping through my body ill prolly pop another oxy
tony with the tommy im walking dead just like a zombie
feel like yung heath ledger
put the razor in my mouth cut a smile on my face
do you like how i look now
