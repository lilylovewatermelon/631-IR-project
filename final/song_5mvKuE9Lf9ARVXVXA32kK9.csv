okay coconut man moonhead and pea
you ready

verse 1 jessie j
seems like everybodys got a price
i wonder how they sleep at night
when the sale comes first and the truth comes second
just stop for a minute and smile
why is everybody so serious
acting so damn mysterious
got shades on your eyes
and your heels so high that you cant even have a good time

prechorus jessie j
everybody look to their left
everybody look to their right
can you feel that yeah
were paying with love tonight

chorus jessie j

we just wanna make the world dance
forget about the price tag
aint about the uh chaching chaching
aint about the yeah babling babling
wanna make the world dance
