their cries are blown away with the wind
how passive can we be before humanity is lost
turning our backs on those who need love
we must not rest while healing is needed

chorus 1
tear down the veil
that bars your heart from feeling this
dedicate yourself
give your soul to compassion
with open arms embrace this heart
with open eyes behold the truth
embrace this life

verse 2
so little time is left
we must be relentless in our pursuit of those in torment

chorus 2
tear down the veil tear down the veil
that bars your heart from feeling this
dedicate yourself dedicate yourself
become the voice of compassion
with open arms embrace this heart
with open eyes behold the truth
embrace this life
