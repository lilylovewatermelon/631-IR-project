its in the way she often calls me out
its in the cut of your pretty gown
your come on legs and your pantyhose
you look so precious with your bloody nose

chorus
were gonna come together
were gonna celebrate
were gonna gather round
like its your birthday
i dont want to know
just what im gonna do
i dont care where youre going
im coming along with you

verse 2
walking her home with the grassy hill
falling and laughing at the drinks weve spilled
just one of those nights that i had to share
chasing the death without a care

chorus
were gonna come together
were gonna celebrate
were gonna gather round
like its your birthday
i dont want to know
just what im gonna do
i dont care where youre going
im coming along with you

chorus
were gonna come together
were gonna celebrate
were gonna gather round
like its your birthday
i dont want to know
just what im gonna do
i dont care where youre going
