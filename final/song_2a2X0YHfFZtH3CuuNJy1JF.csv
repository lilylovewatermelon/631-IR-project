baby easy
i lose myself completely
when youre trapped in my mind
i can take you anywhere
you love me im sorry
im trying to look pretty
im homely inside
you dont seem to care
loving isnt easy when the thrill is gone

prechorus
i found my nicotine amphetamine
the only thing thats good to me
my nicotine amphetamine
i look at you and i cant breathe

chorus
sedona arizona
dont you wanna be nobody every once in a while
sedona im looking for ya
nothing even matters just as long as youre minе

verse 2
tried to convince you
ive got nothing to provе and nothing to hide
ill take you everywhere
ill spend less time pretending that i am kind
youre along for the ride not easy to scare
and suddenly its easy with the lights on

i found my nicotine amphetamine
the only thing thats good to me

outro
so what i want no sympathy
i got knots inside of me
so tell me when i can believe
give me peace and sanity
i swear i want no sympathy yeah3embed"
