the film opens with crowds of girls shot in a sequence of closeups chasing after george john and ringo the boys hare off just ahead of them they take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them

2	ext terminal

they rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the london train and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates

3	ext terminal platform

we see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys

norm has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage instruments and the drums are waiting piled up to be put into the guards van the boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts they grab their instruments ringo makes for the drums norm plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing this stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing

as the boys are playing we cut back into the crowds in the centre we see paul struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys he is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him the old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls

at last paul reaches the other boys he sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans the old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings john george and ringo look enquiringly at paul who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say its not my fault and the number proceeds

shot of sudden horror on johns face paul follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd paul dives hastily into the crowd and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group george and paul hold him firmly as they finish the number the old man standing there between them

as the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight the guard blows his whistle norm and shake grab the instruments and the drums and with the rest piles the lot into the guards van the boys head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off they have successfully repelled all extra boarders

the boys stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line  the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out

4	interior  reserved compartment in the train
the boys relax sitting down on one side of the compartment they are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first ringo nudges george who in turn nudges john opposite them is sitting the little old man he is holding himself stiff erect and very aloof

the three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window

paul catches his eye and winks at the little old man he winks back at paul scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again

the boys turn on paul crowding around him

john

shake and norm collect grandfather and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city englishman johnson attempts to enter there is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other

johnson
make up your minds will you

at last shake norm and grandfather sort themselves out and johnson enters with his case the other three go to coffee

johnson puts his case up on the luggage rack then sits down all his movements are disgruntled  he finally picks up his copy of the financial times and burying himself behind it starts to read after a moment he looks up notices the compartment window is open he gets up and without so much as a by your leave he closes it glares at the boys and sits down again

the boys exchange looks as if to say  hello saucy

paul
politely
do you mind if we have it opened

johnson
briefly

john

johnson
rudely

he disappears behind his paper before the boys can say another word

ringo pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio a pop number is playing

johnson puts down his paper firmly

johnson
and well have that thing off as well thank you

ringo
but i 

johnson leans over and switches it off

johnson
an elementary knowledge of the railway acts would tell you im perfectly within my rights

he smiles frostily

paul
yeah but we want to hear it and theres more of us than you were a community like a majority vote up the workers and all that stuff

johnson

the boys troop out of the door into the corridor johnson smiles triumphantly he is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window he looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous beatle faces

paul
eh mister  can we have our ball back

the man jumps to his feet


5	interior  of the corridor

the boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner


6	interior of the train corridor

from the pov of the door leading to the restaurant car

the boys come down the corridor in full flight laughing away like happy idiots george and paul pull open the sliding doors the boys look inside

7	interior  restaurant car

from their pov we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre shake and norm and grandfather are sitting on the table is a pile of photos of the boys norm and shake are arguing norm is being very aggressive much to shakes discomfort

norm

john

10	interior corridor of train

norm and shake meet with the boys as they are returning from coffee

norm
eh have you got pauls grandfather

paul
accusingly

paul

paul
mildly

ringo
he doesnt like me honest i can tell  its cos im little

george
youve got an inferiority complex you have

ringo
yeah i know thats why i took up the drums its me active compensatory factor

john and paul run down the corridor shake and norm turn from the door and go in the opposite direction george and ringo follow after the other two boys

11	interior  corridor of train

paul and john look into various compartments close shot of ringo looking into compartments in the manner of groucho marx in one of the compartments we see from ringos pov the occupant a glamorous woman tania with a small lap dog

she is beautifully and most expensively dressed she looks up and sees ringo

ringo smiles at her and she smiles back she then beckons him to join her

he looks around to see if she means someone else she nods a negative ringo looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say who me

tania smiles enthusiastically

george has been watching all this

george
are you going in

ringo
no shell only reject me in the end and ill be frustrated

george
you never know you might be lucky this time

ringo
no i know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins

he blows the glamorous lady a kiss then moves sadly on

12	interior  further down the corridor

paul enters a compartment followed by john the two girls rita and jean from the restaurant car are sitting there

paul
excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with

the girls jump up surprised

john
weve broken out oh the blessed freedom of it all
he extends his hands as if handcuffed
eh have you got a nail file these handcuffs are killing me i was framed i was innocent

paul
will you stop it sorry to disturb you miss

he starts to drag john after him

john
i was innocent i was framed i wont go back

john is now by the door he leers at the girls horribly

john
i bet you can guess what i was in for

he cackles like a maniac before disappearing the door closing after him

a waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down

paul
how about that one

he moves towards the compartment

paul
to ringo and george
did you look in here

george
no i mean its probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something

paul
well lets broaden our outlook

paul opens the door of the compartment

13	interior of compartment

from the boys pov we see grandfather and the elderly lady audrey sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast

grandfather
looking up
congratulate me boys im engaged

paul enters and crosses over to him

paul
oh no youre not youve gone too far this time  and whos paying for all this

grandfather
its all taken care of its down on our bill

paul
oh well thats all right
realising
what

audrey
young man kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance

paul
im sorry missus but the betrothals off
he grabs grandfather by the arm
ill refuse me consent hes overage

audrey grabs grandfathers other arm and pulls back

audrey
leave him alone after all hes done for you is this the way you repay him

a tug of war now starts between paul and audrey

paul
pulling
him hes never done anything for anybody in his life

audrey
pulling
you dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged indomitables

john and george jump on the seat egging paul and audrey on

john
come on auntie youre winning

george
get in there paul shes weakening

ringo attempts to interfere

ringo
look missus this is all a misunderstanding you see hes 

audrey
keep away from me you depraved lout i know all about your terrible past

ringo
ywhat

she hits ringo with her handbag and continues struggling with paul for grandfather ringo grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him

ringo
hes given me a bad character blackguarding me name to all and sundry hes got to be stopped its not fair

ringo pushes out into the corridor forgetting that he is holding the womans handbag

a voice shouts off from outside

voice off
thats one of them  stop thief

14	interior  corridor

from ringos pov we see down to the right the city man johnson approaching with a guard ringo turns the other way to the left when he is joined by the three other boys from their pov down the corridor we see the two girls autograph books in hand followed by ten girls from the same school

both groups are closing in on the boys theres no escape

ringo
looking down at the handbag in his hand
oh mother

15	interior  luggage van

very dark and behind bars we see grandfather he is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable he turns towards the camera in the foreground of the shot we see paul standing
in the background an impassive guard is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene

grandfather
bitterly
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars

paul
dont dramatise

the camera pulls back and we see grandfather in the luggage compartment of the guards van in with him are a crate of chickens and a dog the chickens peck at him grandfather moves listlessly away

paul
lets face it youre lucky to be here if theyd have had their way youd have been dropped off at stafford already

grandfather proudly turns away from paul who dodges round so he can still see his face

paul
well youve got to admit youve upset a lot of people at least i can keep my eye on you while youre stuck in here

grandfather turns away again

paul
all right how about ringo i mean  hes very upset you know  and as far as your girlfriend little audreys concerned shes finished with men for the rest of her natural and another thing 

grandfather
a harmless bit of fun aah none of you have any sense of humour left these days

paul
oh its all right for you but those two girls were scared to death honest grandad why i mean why do you do these things

grandfather
cutting in
youre lefthanded arent you paul

paul
yeah  so what

grandfather
why do you always use your left hand

paul
well dont be daft ive got to

grandfather
and i take a lefthanded view of life ive got to

paul grins after a moment of looking at him paul opens the door of
the luggage compartment and joins grandfather on a box

paul
shove up

grandfather produces a penny

grandfather
odds or evens

paul sighs

paul
odds

grandfather flips the coin

the guards van door opens and john george and ringo come in with them are the girls rita and jean

john
as he sees paul behind the bars
dont worry son well get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy

paul
oh its a laugh a line with lennon
to ringo

ringo

george
bagsnatcher
grandfather

john
casually
every morning

john has been looking around the guards van

john
gaw its depressing in here isnt it funny
he pats the dog
cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in england dont they youd expect something a little more palatial
he shudders
come on lets have a little action lets do something then

paul
like what

john
well ive got me gob stopper
he produces his mouth organ
look a genuine stradivarius hand tooled at dagenham

and to ringos beat on a tea chest they are off paul and george improvising other sounds much to the girls delight during the number grandfather quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene

16	exterior  train in motion from above night

while the number is progressing the train is getting nearer and nearer to london

17	exterior  platform terminus night

shots of the station full of girls waiting for the boys

18	interior  guards van

by the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling boys and girls

norm enters the guards van

norm

john

norm
no

john
ah go on you swine

norm

he points and we see a big car parked across the road

the boys prepare to depart lining up with grandfather at the door

19	exterior  platform terminus

just as they are ready to go a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them

norm
oh no

grandfather pushes past the boys holding his coat closed

grandfather
all right lads follow me

and before norm can stop him he darts out of the door paul after him the fans further down the platform see paul and charge forward  in a panic norm and the others follow john just having time to kiss both the girls

john
vive lamour

norm drags him away

20	exterior  railway station

the boys manage to follow grandfather by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier george driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back grandfather has arrived at a taxi door he flings it open and runs through opening the other door thus making a safe bridge to the car

the boys follow and manage to make it to the big car safely they run towards grandfathers taxi the fans have followed the boys and we see streams of girls piling through all the taxis one of which contains johnson the city man opening and shutting the doors to get through much to the indignation of the taxi drivers
21	interior  big car

norm is sitting in front with the driver frank the four boys and grandfather are squashed together in the back

norm
to the driver

frank
smoothly

22	exterior  station

the car moves off surrounded by the fans from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off

it moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins

23	interior  hotel suite  night

there is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms bathroom etc john is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio demolishing a basket of fruit paul is sitting at an upright piano and grandfather is mooching about the room one of the doors opens and george enters followed by ringo none of the boys are wearing coats

grandfather

paul

grandfather

norm enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of john on a table ringo is almost in tears examining his nose in a mirror

norm

shake enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together

he dumps it in ringos arms who staggers into an armchair the boys send him up

john

john

grandfather

he grins to himself at this moment a waiter enters with a tray he is clad in tails and grandfather eyes them longingly measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter he leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants ie the waiters suit


24	interior  dancing club  night

the club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves the camera wanders around the club till it finally picks out john paul george and ringo all crowded around one small table the music is blaring away from a juke box and the boys join the dancers they are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement

29	interior  boyds

grandfather is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone he notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple so quick as a flash he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips he then resumes playing

entrance desk they then go to settle up

34	exterior  street

as the big car overtakes a company directors rolls john lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the executive in the back he reacts violently and starts to shout at them as he does so he presses the button of his window so that we hear only part of it but what we do is unpleasant he immediately presses the button and the window rises

ringo and paul jump out of the car ringo takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and using them as banderillas inserts them with style into the radiator grill vo ole from the boys paul then using his coat as a matadors cloak does a butterfly pass at the car which
has just started up narrowly missing him but he keeps in the matador position

35	interior  car

norm

john
as ringo and paul climb in

close shot of a long suffering norm

norm

36	exterior of an old victorian music hall theatre

which has been converted to the tv studios

there are a few groups of girl fans standing outside the front of the theatre but against the kerb of the pavement is a nightwatchmans canvas hut and brazier

the car approaches

37	interior of the car

norm
get ready john open the door and as it draws up out you go and straight in

john nods and opens the door the fans start to swarm round them to escape the boys dash into the nightwatchmans canvas hut pick it up and run with it to the stage door revealing the night watchman staring in astonishment

at the door the boys put the hut down and enter the theatre

38	interior  stage door entrance

as the boys enter two pro men in dark suits stiff white collars
and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly

first pro man
menacingly
press conference theyre waiting for you

norm
jovially
give us a couple of shakes to get our breath

first pro man
more menacingly
theyre waiting now

and without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting norm towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle

paul
eh this lot means it theyre even taking
hostages

the boys shake and grandfather rush after the rapidly disappearing norm who by now is half way up the stairs

39	interior of dress circle lounge ballroom

it is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches the dark suited men enter with norm and close behind them follow grandfather shake and the boys the group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it from all directions newspapermen and photographers converge upon them

now begins an elaborate tugofwar between various photographers using their flash attachments and reporters to capture a beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them together and singly the boys are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of newspapermen are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks to the annoyance of the barmaids

every time one of the boys attempts to get a sandwich or a drink it is either too late the plate is empty or they are intercepted the single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling heavy impersonal handling the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another during the scene these individual exchanges take place

sound reporter
whats your philosophy of life

john
im torn between zen and im all right jack

reporter
has success changed your life

ringo
yes

reporter
do you like playing the guitar

george
next to kissing girls its favourites

paul is surrounded by newspapermen

paul
no actually were just good friends

high shot of the press reception and we see the boys ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle completely unnoticed they slip through

40	interior  theatre dress circle

the boys come up the stairs into the dress circle proper grandfather and shake are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches

paul
ironically
anything to spare

grandfather
weve just finished pauly hey george write us your john henry on this picture

george
sure
he does so

paul
ah well eh look

he points and from pauls pov we see on stage the setting up of the show scenery and lights cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff dancers and singers are milling about as well

paul
lets go and muck in

john
aye before anyone stops us

they exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls which are partly covered up

41	interior  stage

everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the boys who wander about and examine the studio equipment a load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out

voice
here what about these electric guitars

shake
where are they

voice
back here mate

shake
going towards the voice
im coming

ringo is busy setting up his drums and men are setting up the other sets he drops a stick and the floor manager retrieves it and is about to tap the drum the floor manager is a languid young man

ringo
leave them drums alone

floor manager
oh surely one can have a tiny touch

ringo
if you so much as breathe heavy on them im
out on strike

floor manager
arent you being rather arbitrary

ringo
thats right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches i dont go round messing about with your earphones do i

floor manager
spoil sport

ringo
well

ringo fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums the floor manager is furious

george
hes very touchy about those his drums they loom large in his legend

ringo gives his drums a defiant crash and john and paul stop whatever they are up to and hurry over

paul
whats up

george
pointing
hes sulking again

john
ill show him

he picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at ringo who does a more complicated drum roll george now joins in and to pauls encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised during this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and shake sets them to working order paul first then john and george take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers

42	interior  ramp

as the number finishes a baldheaded man he is the tv director storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle

director
with overexaggerated calm
all right im sorry and lets hear no more about it if thats your opinion youre probably right look if you think im unsuitable lets have it out in the open i cant stand these backstage politics

by the end of this speech he is standing in front of john who takes the scene in his stride

john
arent you tending to black and white this whole situation

director
well quite honestly i wasnt expecting a musical arranger who would question my ability  picturewise

john
to the others
i could listen to him for hours

paul
heave to whats all this about a musical arranger

director
mr mccartney senior

the boys have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment grandfather appears from behind the director

grandfather
hey pauly theyre trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but ive given him the test

director
bravely
im quite happy to be replaced

grandfather
indicating the director
hes a typical buckpasser

director
i won an award

john
a likely story

director
its on the wall in my office

at this moment norm comes on the stage confident cigar in mouth and serene

norm
hello our lot everyone happy

the boys the director floor manager and grandfather turn on him and stare silently

norm
all right all right if you dont need this lot ill lock em up in the dressing room till you do

director
please do ill not need them for fifteen minutes thank you

he glares at grandfather who glares right back the director walks away with the floor manager pacifying him

director
give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
oblivion oh its a plot i see it now its
all a plot

they go left towards the backstage

norm
producing key
now come on ive got the key

he leads the lads off right ringo is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely

norm and the boys turn on him

norm
lets have you

john
come on speedy

paul
ringo

george
wake up

ringo glares at them and follows quickly as the boys move off after norm they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal it is an elegant man in fulltail suit meticulously adjusting his cufflinks beside him is a freestanding sign reading leslie jackson and his ten disappearing doves the boys pass him and go through the door grandfather stops and looks at the performer with respect

grandfather
i cant tell you how much ive enjoyed your act

he slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie there is the sound of a dove a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the mans coat and he and grandfather look down at the floor the man glares at grandfather takes out a pen from his pocket crosses out 10 on his sign and writes 9 in its place puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performers smile as he does

43	interior  theatre  backstage corridor

the boys move down the narrow stairs and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses they engulf the lads and force them against the wall  the actors are all making for the stage door as the actors push past the boys we see the boys excited faces their mouths watering for the costumes john touches the costume on one actor

john
to actor
gear costume

actor
eyeing him
swap

norm
right first floor and no messing about

norm leading the way goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls a game of manners starts after you no after you norm who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust

norm
lennon leave them girls alone or ill report you

the boys let the girls pass and resume the journey always surrounded by people

44	interior  dressing room and corridor

ringos attention is caught by a door he crosses and opens it looking out to a fire escape the others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape

45	exterior  top of fire escape

from the boys pov we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre it is a long narrow yard full of old coaches motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways

the boys scamper down the fire escape

when they reach the bottom of the alleyways there is a large door they open it and look through

from their pov we see a large green field quite empty the boys step through the doorway into the field we now see from a helicopter shot the four boys standing together surrounded by space

it is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day

they look at each other and grin  then first george and paul let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field after a moment john and ringo follow them the boys pick up some loose straw and insert it under johns cap and sleeves turning him into a scarecrow

the four boys dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious after a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass

mans voice
off
i suppose you know this is private property

the boys freeze

from their pov we see a big burly middleaged man glowering at them the boys exchange rueful glances and under the big mans eye mooch back towards the gateway they came in by john is the last to go through he turns to the man

john
sorry if we hurt your field mister
46	interior corridor  backstage

grandfather is sneaking down the corridor a pile of photos under his arm

47	interior  tv theatre  underneath the stage

under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on it is placed by the orchestras entrance to the orchestra pit grandfather comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light he spreads the signed photos of the boys in front of him and adjusting an old fashioned pair of glasses ballpoint pen in hand begins to copy the boys signatures on to the fresh photos tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes after a moment there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs grandfather darts into a dark patch out of sight

the menacing shadows appear on the stairway

norm voice off
theres no one here

shake voice off
this is the only way they could have gone

we now see grandfather holding himself stiffly in he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort slowly grandfather ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him

48	interior  tv theatre stage

a rehearsal of the toast scene from a strauss operetta the entire stage is full of singers glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience slowly inbetween the leading man and leading woman who are about to embrace a stage trap opens and a blinking surprised grandfather appears here we intercut to the tv control room for amazed reaction shots of the director and control room crew

back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each others arms grandfather sandwiched between them


48a	interior  corridor as boys pass thru on way to dressing room

john is behind them john boys and millie are walking towards each other

millie

millie touches his arm then walks away after a moment she turns

john winks at her and she winks back

by this time the tailor has his tape stretched between his hands to measure georges shoulders but since george has moved away he is measuring space john takes up his scissors and cuts the tape
john
i now declare this bridge open

the boys run out the door

50	interior  backstage area

five beautiful models are standing about in costume one is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed there is the sound of a juggling acts music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage at the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize on it are three spaced white plates

from the door off stage above which is a sign to canteen and production offices grandfather enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast the knitting girl sees him and in mime asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him grandfather eager to help puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and
three he goes to be measured with the sweater

from the onstage area a jugglers assistant pretty girl in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up without looking plate number one and throws it off screen towards centre stage there is a drum roll from orchestra she then throws plate number two we cut on stage to the juggler now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles one in each hand he has another pole in his mouth and nods to his assistant asking for the third plate

we cut back to the assistant who still not looking throws plate three which is grandfathers there is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangerson in the scene look off interestedly

we hear the directors voice

director vo

we

cut to

centre stage the juggler is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head having slipped off the third plate

the floor manager is bustling around trying to help

we cut back to backstage grandfather has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down he picks up the only remaining plate looks at it wondering where his food has gone shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the directors voice

51	interior  tv studio floor

two stage hands are walking disinterestedly past they look at the director

1st stage hand

at this moment the boys norm shake and grandfather appear the boys grab their instruments and prepare to play

john
to the director

the director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens

director
to himself

the boys are placed in position instruments ready the boom moves in near them there is a mike hovering just over johns head john starts attacking it

directors voice over tannoy

from the directors pov we see into the monitor the boys crowding around ringo we cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio

53	interior  tv studio floor

paul
to ringo

briefly

norm

at this moment several actors come into the room they are all dressed in the uniform of officers in wellingtons army together with the boys they sit down beatles and soldiers all mixed up

now a group of several pretty makeup girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of aye ayes and wolf whistles john meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted makeup things

head make up girl
oh this is impossible well never get you all done in time

actor

norm fights his way to john

norm
now listen john behave yourself or ill murder you and shake take that wig off it suits you

shake has a long blond girls wig on with the assistance of the girls norm gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door for some reason ringo now has a guardsmans busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier reading a copy of queen magazine

norm
to ringo
what do you think are youre up to

ringo

john

the girls now move in and put make up bibs on the boys and start to powder them off

john

concept of my personality will you girl

paul
eh dont take out me lines

george
yeah they give him that je ne sais quoi
rakish air

the lads laugh with pleasure

ringo decides to try a little joke

ringo
indicating the busby he is still
wearing
short back and sides please

the other look at him with mock disgust

paul
behave

john
foreign devil 

george
control yourself

grandfather has been watching the powdering process

grandfather
in my considered opinion youre a bunch of sissies

john grabs a powder puff from his girl

john
you know youre only jealous

and dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to grandfathers annoyance

norm
leave him alone lennon or ill tell them all the truth about you

john

norm
i would though

norm goes out

paul
whats he know

john
nothing hes trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts  oh hes a swine but a clever swine mind

grandfather
impatiently
lookit i thought i was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far ive seen a train and a room a car and a room and a room and a room well thats maybe all right for a bunch of powdered geegaws like you lot but im feeling decidedly straitjacketed this is no life for a freebooting agent of my stamp im a frustrated man and that class of mccartney is a dangerous mccartney

girl
admiringly
what a clean old man

grandfather
touchingly
youre too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes so dont press your luck

john
hes sexobsessed the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin

norm returns leaving the door open the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio

norm
theyre nearly ready for you theyre just finishing the band call

john
jumping from his seat
gear come on girls lets have a bit of a dance

johns girl
i dont think its allowed

john
well  it wouldnt be any fun if it was

the boys drag the makeup girls out of the room and into the studio

the girls are still trying to finish making the boys up

as the boys and makeup girls dance past we see one of the strauss singers combing his long hair straight back two stage hands swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a beatle cut

john
passing him
never

during dance george takes off wig and places it on dummy revealing identical hair underneath

55	interior  tv studio floor

the work is still going on and the music is up full blast the boys enter and with the girls and they start a wild dance hippy shake zulu blue beat the lot lionel and dancers are doing their routine on one side of the stage  it becomes a challenge dance between both groups john swings his girl onto the motorized camera western style and starts to track through the group george is on another camera

56	interior  control room

the whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors the director is about to stop the boys but his girl pa glares at him with a shrug he lets the dance go on

we now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor when the recorded music stops they grab their instruments and go into a number

so we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four

when the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor

57	interior  tv studio floor

directors voice over tannoy

57a	interior  backstage

a man whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets he starts rehearsing his act which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks next to him a juggler is practising with four table tennis balls

grandfather passes him and bumps his arm slightly only 3 balls come down there is the sound of coughing off

the headplayer being patted on the back the ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor

58	interior  tv studio canteen

the canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as nazi soldiers with mock blood bandages and arm bands also there are a sprinkling of tv people at a table sits grandfather and ringo ringo is deeply engrossed in a book and grandfather has a near empty cup of tea in front of him the old man is bored and looks about him slyly he then looks at ringo who is innocently occupied a malicious gleam comes into grandfathers eye he decides to have a go at ringo and sits staring at him ringo gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book

grandfather
disgustedly to no one in particular
will you ever look at him sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book

ringo
well  whats the matter with that

grandfather
taking the book from him

grandfather

ringo
defensively

ringo

he throws the book down

grandfather
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before youre too old like me a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to lifes goodies before the sands run out being an old age pensioners a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office

ringo
yeah  funny really cos id never thought of it but being middleaged and old takes up most of your time doesnt it

grandfather
nodding
youre only right

ringo
nodding back
im not wrong

there is a pause then ringo rises and crosses to the door

grandfather
where are you off to

ringo
im going parading before its too late

ringo leaves and grandfather laughs at what he has done then realizes its full meaning and looks worried

59	interior  corridor and stairway

ringo comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs halfway down he comes face to face with george who is coming up the stairs

george
eh ringo do you know what happened to me

ringo
passing him

as he goes round the corner ringo turns on the surprised george

ringo

george

paul gives him a push to the left and george to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways

62	exterior  street

ringo is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him they quicken their pace and ringo runs ahead of them he turns and comes into another street he sees a secondhand clothes shop with a sign saying we buy anything and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner the girls stand about looking in all directions after a moment ringo comes out of the shop he is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down he is ignored by the girls who dont recognise him realising this he goes back and ogles one of them she glares at him

ringo

closeup on ringos secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road

63	exterior  tow path  canal

ringo kicks at a brick he kicks stylishly but misses so tries again misses again but finally kicks the stone which doesnt budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground it is quite big three quarters of it being below the surface having got it he now decides to throw it away as he does so the same policeman rides past on a bicycle

policeman
aint you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about

before ringo has time to answer the man has disappeared

ringo
shouting after him
southerner

he looks at the canal water moodily at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back sprawling him on the path the tyre on top of him a small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate ringo

67	exterior  street  pub on the corner

the sign on the pub is liverpool arms ringo is standing looking up at it he decides to go in and does so

68	interior  tv control room

the atmosphere is tense grandfather is standing miserable in front of the director the criminal confronted by the judge shake and norm are flanking him grimly

grandfather
im sorry lads i didnt mean it honest

director

shake
unconvincingly
theyll be back theyre good lads theyll be back

director
disgusted

grandfather
i meant no harm i was only trying to encourage little ringo to enjoy himself

norm
grimly cu
god knows what youve unleashed on the unsuspecting south itll be wine women and song all the way with ringo once hes got the taste for it

69	int pub  public bar

closeup on ringo he is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end he puts it down with disgust he has a lager glass in his hand

barmaid
accusingly
that was fresh this morning

we now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints ringo is very much alone he moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together theyve an average height of over sixfoot there is a group at a dart board another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pinball table

near the bar is a shovehalfpenny board with two players there is a caged parrot nearby

barmaid
to ringo
thatll be two and nine

ringo fumbles some change out of his pocket a few coppers fall from his hand on to the shovehalfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made the men glare at him embarrassed he moves away and without looking places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string which hits ringos glass more embarrassed ringo backs
away unfortunately into the pintable just as a winning score is about to be reached he bumps it very slightly but enough to cause it to tilt he then moves to the dart board by this time most of the pub is staring at him with great style he takes the darts the first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration the second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see ringo shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily off the barmaid has had enough

barmaid
right  on your way

ringo
ywhat

barmaid
you heard on your way troublemaker

now the centre of attention ringo backs out of the pub followed by every eye in the place the barmaid and a few players following him to the door 

70	exterior  street outside pub

ringo comes out and crosses road watched by the policeman who is now quite suspicious

71	exterior  street

paul comes down the street looking about him for ringo in the street is an old building the sort of place that is highly favoured for tv rehearsals there is a sign on the door tv rehearsal room as paul draws near a load of actors and extras etc are leaving they are in costume they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal when paul gets near the entrance he decides to go inside

72	interior  hall

paul enters and wanders about he reaches a door pushes it open and looks in he sees a girl clad in period costume she is moving around the room and obviously acting paul watches her for a moment and then decides to go in

73	interior  rehearsal room

paul goes into the room the girl is in midflight she is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing the room is absolutely empty except for paul and herself she is acting in the manner of an eighteenthcentury coquette or to be precise the voice english actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period  her youth however makes it all very charming

girl
if i believed you sir i might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on problems path but i cannot believe you and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me

she dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees paul who is as engrossed in the scene as she was

girl
surprised
oh

paul
enthusiastically
well  go head do the next bit

girl
go away youve spoilt it

paul
oh sorry i spoke

he makes no attempt to go he simply continues to look steadily at the girl then he smiles at her she is undecided what to do next

girl

paul

girl

paul

girl

paul

he laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio

paul

girl
i only enjoy acting for myself i hate it when other people are let in

paul
why i mean which are you scared or selfish

girl
why selfish

paul
well youve got to have people to taste your treacle toffee

she looks at him in surprise

paul
no hang on ive not gone daft you see when i was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery when id done she said to me go and give some to the other kids so i said i would but i thought to meself she must think im soft anyroad i was eating away there but i wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end i wound up giving it all away  but i didnt nmind mind cos id made the stuff in the first place well  thats why you need other people an audience  to taste your treacle toffee like eh  does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me

girl
not really but im probably not a toffee maker how would you do those lines of mine

paul
well look at it this way i mean when you come right down to it that girl shes a bit of a scrubber isnt she

girl

paul

paul stands at the doorway shrugs then goes out
