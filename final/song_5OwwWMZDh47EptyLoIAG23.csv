little darlin
work the night time too
and all the money i make
its in my pocket
its comin home to you
but still youre gone
when i get home
youre runnin down town again
and girl im lonesome
like the whistle
on a sunday mornin train
now you got me drinking in the morning
no need to wait for noon
well i said boys you know that winter time
will sure be comin soon
now i lost my job
i was workin
aint got a friend left in the world
and its all because
of a nogood dirty cheatin girl
now you got me drinking in the morning
no need to wait for noon
well i said boys you know that winter time
will sure be comin soon
now im broke
down and dirty
i waste my time over you
leave me alone
dont you come callin
cause i aint callin you
now you got me drinking in the morning
no need to wait for noon
well i said boys you know that winter time
will sure be comin soon
well i said boys you know that winter time
will sure be comin soonsee trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
