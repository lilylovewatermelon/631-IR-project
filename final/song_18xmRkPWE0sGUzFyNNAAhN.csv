the moment you arrived they built you up
the sun was in your eyes you couldnt believe it
riches all around youre walking
stars are on the ground you start to believe it

prechorus
every face along the boulevard
is a dreamer just like you
you looked at death in a tarot card
and you saw what you had to do

chorus
but nobody knows you now when youre dying in la
and nobody owes you now when youre dying in la
when youre dying in la when youre dying in la
the power the power the power
oh the power the power the power
of la

verse 2
nights at the chateau trapped in your sunset bungalow
you couldnt escape it yeah
drink of paradise they told you put your blood on ice
youre not gonna make it
