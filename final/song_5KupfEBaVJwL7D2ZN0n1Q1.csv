you said you couldnt stay
youve seen it all before i know
and sold you on their way
oh honey thats okay

refrain
no harm hes armed
settin off all your alarms
when i find out
i hope its you who set this trap

verse 2
and store fronts rarely change
at least im on my own again instead of
anywhere with you
oh tell me its all the same

chorus
and i lost my page again
i know this is surreal but ill try my luck with you
oh this life is on my side oh i am your one
believe me this is a chance oh oh

verse 3
lets see what is for sale
hes tryin not to give his job a chance
oh its never gonna be
its sad but i agree
the signal dont seem right
it lasts for just one night and then
im sorry that i said
that we were just good friends
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likerefrain
no harm hes armed
settin off all your alarms
entranced i cant
be here in time ill think about that

chorus
and i lost my page again
