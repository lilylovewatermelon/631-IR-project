verse 1
bitch where the fuck were you tuesday with who you say
i wasnt at the studio bitch whatd you do screw dre

okay yeah and im coocoo eh — well screw you
and ill be the third person who screwed you today
oh fourth—dre drake lupe—ooh touché

thought you was my number one trueblue ace
but you aint and i cant see you when you make that wittle booboo face
cause im hanging up this phone boo you make my fuckin bluetooth ache

think i just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
til the cops pulled me over but they let me go cause i told em
im only drivin drunk cause that bitch drove me to drink
im back on my fuck hoes with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias i hate all bitches the same baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement and im
channelin my anger through every single station thats on
cause a woman broke my heart i say heart
cause she ripped it in two paarts and threw it in the garbage
who do you think you aare bitch guess its time for me to get the dust off
and pick myself up off the carpet
but ill never say the lword again

and go into a cardiac arrest my lifed be so much better if you just—

chorus
my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead

and i thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier

verse 3
and ima have a whale of a time
bein a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale of
one to ten shit i must be the holy grail of
catches ho i got an oscar attached to my fuckin name de la
i might hit the club find a chick thats tailormade
for me say fuck it kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
these bitches tryin to get attached but theyre failin to latch onto the tail of
my bumper theyre scratchin at the back of my trailer
like im itchin to get hitched yeah im rich as a bitch
but bitches aint shit id rather leave a bitch in a ditch
bitch you complain when you listen to this
but you still throw yourself at me thats what i call pitchin a bitch
thats why im swingin at this chicks onsite
long as i got a bat and two balls its foul but my dicks on strike
so all that love shit is null and void bitch im a droid
i avoid cupid stupid wasnt for blow jobs youd be unemployed
oyeyoyyoy manohman your boyboyboys
gettin sick of these girlsgirlsgirls oinkoinkoink
you fuckin pigs all youre good for is doinkdoinkdoink
i got 99 problems and a bitch aint one
shes all 99 of em i need a machine gun
ill take em all out i hope you hear this song
and go into a cardiac arrest have a heart attack and just
drop dead and ima throw a fuckin party after this cause yes
chorus
my life would be so much better
if you just dropped dead i hate you
i was layin in bed last night thinkin
and then this thought just popped in my head you made me like this way
and i thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier
if you dropped dead bitch
i would feel so much much better
