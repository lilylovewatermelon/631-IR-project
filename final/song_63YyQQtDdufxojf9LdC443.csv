you got someone here wants to make it alright
someone who loves you more than life right here
you got willing arms thatll hold you tight
a hand to lead you on through the night right here
i know your heart can get all tangled up inside
but dont you keep it to yourself

chorus
when your long day is over
and you can barely drag your feet
the weight of the world is on your shoulders
i know what you need
bring it on home to me

verse 2
you know i know you like the back of my hand
but did you know im going to do all that i can right here
im going to lie with you till you fall asleep
when the morning comes im still going to be right here yes i am
so take your worries and just drop them at the door
baby leave it all behind

chorus

bridge
baby let me be your safe harbor
dont let the water come and carry you away

you got someone here wants to make it alright
someone who loves you more than life right hereembed"
