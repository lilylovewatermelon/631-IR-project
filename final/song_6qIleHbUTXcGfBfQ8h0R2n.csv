claustrophobic
crawl out of this skin
heart explosive
reach in pull that pin

prechorus
feel thy name extermination
desecrate inhale the fire

chorus
so we cross that line
into the grips
total eclipse
suffer unto my apocalypse

verse 2
deadly vision
prophecy reveal
death magnetic
pulling closer still

prechorus
fear thy name annihilation
desolate inhale the fire

so we cross that line
into the grips
total eclipse
suffer unto my apocalypse
my apocalypse

go

bridge
crushing metal ripping skin
tossing body mannequin
spilling blood bleeding gas
mangle flesh snapping spine
dripping bloody valentine
shattered face spitting glass
split apart
split apart
split apart
split
spit it out

verse 3
what makes me drift a little bit closer
dead man takes the steering wheel
what makes me know its time to cross over
worn to repeat until i feel
see through the skin the bones they all rattle
future and past they disagree
flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
i start to see the end in me
see the end in me
verse 4
claustrophobic
climb out of this skin
heart explosive
reach in pull that pin
violate annihilate
wounds unto my eyes
obliterate exterminate
life itself denied

prechorus
fear thy name as hell awakens
destiny inhale the fire

chorus
but weve crossed that line
into the grips
total eclipse
suffer unto my apocalypse

outro
tyrant awaken my apocalypse
demon awaken my apocalypse
heaven awaken my apocalypse
suffer forever my apocalypse1embed"
