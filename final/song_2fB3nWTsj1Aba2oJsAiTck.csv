when i was five i fell in love
it didn’t last
he ran from me
literally ran from me
and being kenyan he ran fast

when i was ten in love again
this peace corps guy
i waited hours
inside his tent with flowers
which made him laugh
which made me cry

by thirteen i gave up trying
i decided i would be a mathematician
cause math is real
i memorized a lot of pi
because addition and subtraction and division
would never make me feel
so stupid with love

like i didnt get it
i didnt get it somehow
smart with math but stupid with love
i didnt get it
i didnt get it
till now
you might also likeaaron spoken
do you have an eraser

cady spoken
i would love to 

sung
so thank you math for being there
to bring me joy
and thank you math
cause now youve brought me
this cute boy

aaron spoken

cady spoken
yes

sung
hes like someone from tv
he’s like that guy who gives out roses to those women
his clothes his grooming

and hes a foot away from me
with swoopy hair and shiny eyes that i could swim in
he is live and in the room
and im
stupid with love
i wanna get it
i wanna get it but how
smart with math but stupid with love
i wanna get it
i didnt get it
till now

cady  aaron spoken
two over zero is undefined 

aaron

cady
im astounded and nonplussed
i am filled with calculust
does this guy work out he must
all sweaty at the gym

could that image be more hot
let me just enjoy that thought
school was rough but now its not

cause now theres him
its all so simple
stupid with love
but i can get it
watch this girl selfeducate
i learned math so i can learn love

you wanna bet it
that i can get it
just wait

just wait
just wait6embed"
