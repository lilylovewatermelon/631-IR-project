oh i love you my dear
but im gone im gone

verse
my time is here and im makin it clear
oh i love you my dear
but im goin im gone
i might come back when the benz all black
ten racks on my lap
if i dont relapse and i stay strong
i could do anything i want to
bump lil peep when i die ima haunt you
i could live forever if i want to
i could stop time but i never wanna do that again
nothin worse than losin a friend
and the feelin you get when everybody that you love aint around
i really gotta get away from this town
im just waitin for a wave and ill drown
satan lettin me down
i just wanna help you see you should run away from me
baby im a drug and i dont wanna hurt you
no im not gonna hurt you girl not at all
i aint gonna set you free all you gonna get from me
little bit of love and a little virtue
if i hurt you ill end it allyou might also like110embed"
