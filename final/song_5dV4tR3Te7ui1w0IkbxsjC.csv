15 years on the county line
nough to make a man nearly lose his mind
down in arlington virginia where the lawmakers stay
a ball and chain never felt so real
walls of stone 50 bars of steel
when the warden gives me pardon darlin ill be comin home your way

chorus
and i wish you could have seen it when the good lord spun me round
i shoulda known better than to think they could keep a good man down
so please dont you worry
please dont you ever come see me

verse 2
leavin out of texas for that eastern sunlight
and now i was in a bad way lord but not to my surprise
judge in a cornfield tryin a man
said let him hang in the white desert sand
when the warden gives me pardon darlin ill be coming home your way

chorus
and i wish you could have seen it when the good lord spun me round
i shoulda known better than to think they could keep a good man down
so please dont you worry no
please dont you ever come see me
