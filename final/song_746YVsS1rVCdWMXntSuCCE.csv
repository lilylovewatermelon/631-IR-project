verse 1 ti
hey hey hey
look at shorty hoppin out that maserati
in them giuseppe zanottis and that bangin ass body
in them low cut frankie bs with the panties peekin out em
with a booty that big and her stomach rock solid
on rodeo drive walkin in her roberto cavalli
i should probably walk up to the register and say i got it
go and pick up what you want its nothin ma dont worry about it
that bag should be carried by somebody so exotic
and that dress should be worn when theres nothin else up under
just in case i run into you i can pull up to your bumper
she politely declined when i offered her my number
then i asked her whats her name
said shed rather make me wonder
so i paid and she laughed carried out her bags outside
and i couldnt get her ass i tried
as i watch her leave out the store
how one man wanted shorty ass and more for sure
see nelly liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likechorus nelly
shes so fly
shes outrageous i met her out in vegas
she fresh off the pages of a magazine i said
shes so fly
she like eye candy i cant stop starin

shes so fly

verse 2 nelly
shorty harder than cialis
see my hand got the money countin careless
couldnt find a bigger star than in dallas
and the pistons aint the only one with rings in the palace
do your research tell me your analysis
take a jet and make you wonder where you land like alice
tell me shorty aint the baddest
tell me shorty dont deserve to rock the runway in paris woo
she deserve it all
i dont do the mall i do it by catalog
la perla panties and bras fuck buyin at the bar
i fuck around and buy this whole club by tomorrow
see shes so nice
she can get whatever she likes
dont let the price make you mad
i live a fabolous life shorty throw it in the bag
chorus nelly
shes so fly
shes outrageous i met her out in vegas
she fresh off the pages of a magazine i said
