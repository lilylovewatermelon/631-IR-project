out of the shadows
bound for the gallows
a dead man walking
til love came calling
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
six feet under
i thought it was over
an answer to prayer
the voice of a savior
rise up rise up
rise up rise up

chorus
all at once i came alive
this beating heart these open eyes
the grave let go
the darkness should have known
youre still rolling rolling
youre still rolling rolling oh youre still rolling stones
youre still rolling rolling oh
youre still rolling stones

verse 2
now that you saved me
i sing cause you gave me
a song of revival
i put it on vinyl
rise up rise up
rise up rise up
i once was blinded
but now i see it
ive heard about the power
and now i believe it
oh rise up rise up
rise up rise up
