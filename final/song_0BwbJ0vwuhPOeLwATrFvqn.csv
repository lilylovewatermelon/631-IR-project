flip it terrific
and ill be specific
the words i say pump it up
shows much significance
and for instance
if you take time
to figure out each rhyme
you must figure out
you must figure out
you must fi out
out each rhyme
you know it gotta make much sense ayo

verse edan
im out to live tonight like its the final night of all of my living
appreciating all that ive been given
the physical body a miracle of composition
consisting of several million cellular systems
forming a living organism
to witness and absorb the existence of an earth
that orbits the source with perfect proportionate distance
equilibrius harmonious life giving
relationship between the sun and the earth is tight dig it
by the slightest percentage
we live a miracle which reinforces
there being forces beyond the physical
i knew the wizardry was wise
when my eyes went along lines that finally arrive at the horizon
so mathematically joined at the vanishing point
to describe this vocabulary had to be coined
terminology invented phenomenally defined
by significant minds such as einstein
without the long line of strongminded scientists
the globe would be without most household appliances
that make yo ice freezy that make yo life easy
satellites allowing any you likes to use sights to see me
not to mention inventions like the phonograph
if not for edison enough of them wouldve known the half
on a myriad of musical mentors mcs to radical rockers
and classical sonatas
so realists set impressions as painters
manmade spaces using amazing architectural angles
intellectual breakthroughs that gave you the gift
still we doin this foolishness
truth of it is despite the damage we doin 
the  shall rejuvenate
if the human race selfmutilates
using racially motivated hate that splits society
where life is built with nothing but variety
we the third rock the earth got locked in the perfect spot
to flourish watch the birds flock and perch atop
a tree branch emerging from green plants
if you had these fam youll see yourself standing in beat sand
watching ships from shore underwater lobster and shrimp galore
dolphins fish and coral all of this and more
exploring forest hills until your mortal will realigns
refined to the floral build the chlorophyll
theres more to this than meets the eye dude
thats why you invert the light viewed through the iris
and see the sky is blue
if you a thug who find my lyric too scientific
and wish to try and diss it then fuck you
you might also likeinterlude doug e fresh  the get fresh crew
theres no need to curse
try to diss me and ill tell you first
slow down be cool and dont act ill
