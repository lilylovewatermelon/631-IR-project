dont solve the problem
when danger is better
far away you stock them
in cages and tether

prechorus
and all the bridges youve burned
leave you trapped off at all sides
now the tables do turn
and its all gone whats left for you

chorus
and when the sky is falling
dont look outside the window
step back and hear im calling
give up dont take the fast road
its just your doubt that binds you
just drop those thoughts behind you now
change your mind let go too soon

verse 2
sit down youre sinking
theres no one to watch you
skip town youre thinking
theres no one to stop you

and all the bridges youve burned
leave you trapped off at all sides
now the tables do turn
and its all gone whats left for you

chorus
and when the sky is falling
dont look outside the window
step back and hear im calling
give up dont take the fast road
its just your doubt that binds you
just drop those thoughts behind you now
change your mind let go too soon

bridge
dont run away start feeling fine
its better than your worst your worst day
no words to say ill give you mine
and pocket all the hurt
just stay dont run away
its better than your worst your worst day

chorus
and when the sky is falling
dont look outside the window
step back and hear im calling
give up dont take the fast road
and when the sky is falling
dont look outside the window
step back and hear im calling
give up dont take the fast road
its just your doubt that binds you
just drop those thoughts behind you now
change your mind let go too soon
outro
dont run away
change your mind
let go too soon
dont run away
change your mind
let go too soon
dont run away
ill change your mind
let go too soon
dont run away
