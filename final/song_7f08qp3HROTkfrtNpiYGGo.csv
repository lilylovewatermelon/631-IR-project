been up since the crack of dawn just tryna get paid
been hotter than a hundred suns i cant find no shade
just two more rows and im good to go
yeah im shuttin this tractor down
give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
and ill be outside your house

chorus
might have a little dirt on my boots
but im takin you uptown tonight
might have a little mud on my wheels
but they gonna shine with ya up inside
gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
burn it up like neon lights
might have a little dirt on my boots
but were gonna dance the dust right off them tonight yeah girl
got a little dirt on my boots

verse 2
hard as i worked all day im gonna work harder lovin on you
spin you all over that dance floor right out of them high heeled shoes
and when youre ready to quit
baby we can slip right out of that barroom door
and when i take you home dont worry babe
im gonna kick em off on the porch
