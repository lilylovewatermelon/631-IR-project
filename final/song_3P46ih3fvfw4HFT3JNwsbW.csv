verse 1 mac miller
hey hey
see i was six years old with a dream
when my moms told me i could do anything
said shed be there forever no matter whats the weather
shed always have my back even when we werent together
and i took her for granted thought i had a plan
this a different generation i dont think youd understand
in the quest to be a man you start to learn you need your family
it wasnt for them id be way closer to insanity
it aint about the vanity think about whats important
the reason i was six years old rockin some jordans
the reason i had food my own damn room
a tv in the livin room to watch my cartoons
i just hope she know i love her the worlds best mother
yeah it aint fair so ima take care of her in her gray hair
when i get rich ill have her livin like she should be
no stress no worries you can call me cause its

chorus phonte  mac miller
sunshine or rain uhhuh ill be there i know you feel me
for the good times or bad i know you feel me like ill be there hey hey
sunshine or rain ill be there thats how its always gon be
for the good times or bad thats how its always gon be ill be there

hey hey hey
dear momma please dont start to cry
you the reason im alive how these years have gone by
you were there when i was on my first bike ride
ridin in the street and that delivery truck almost ran right over me
you were at my games when i was sittin on the bench
and when i skipped school you lie and say that i was home sick
had my back before i had my own
i know im always welcome when im back at home
i just want to bring you out on stage to get a standin ovation
all the work you did to make my life feel like a vacation
if you have your moms you better treat her right
call her up say wassup before you sleep tonight
tell her you love her and thank her for what she did
you may be grown now but remember bein a kid
when she fed you in a bib shit you were her baby
so find out what she doin lately
uh i wanna tell you momma

chorus phonte  mac miller
sunshine or rain ill be there
for the good times or bad ill be there i know you feel me
