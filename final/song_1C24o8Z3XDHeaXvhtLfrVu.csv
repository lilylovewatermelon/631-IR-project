see i got a lot to say and i aint afraid to say it
mind on money so its why im tryin to make it
yeah but the moneys what you make it
let it make you see where its gon take ya
hey youll be headed nowhere
moving so fast you wont even care
yeah but when you get there
what you gon do when nobodys there
ay i know what youre gonna say
made it there alone so you dont worry bout they
hey but when it all goes away
you gonna be stuck so what im tryna say is
dont lose your

chorus jhené aiko
soul oh let go let go of your ego
dont lose your soul
sail your soul
sailing soul

verse 2 jhené aiko
is it really worth it
you are only hurting yourself
you will never grow if you lose control over yourself
dont let go
if you dont get a hold of yourself
then you will end up with no self
youre playing the game for the fame in the end
but what do you gain when youre paying to win
you dont
you better keep your soul
set sail or get sold oh

soul
oh let go let go of your ego
dont lose your soul

verse 3 kanye west
i sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
this game you could never win
cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
get away from me loneliness get away from me misery
get away from me fake bitches i can’t take the phoniness
get away from me wack tracks i can only make only hits
i’m an only child lost in the world
where do the lonely kids go when the bell rings
its feeling like hell rings
bringing me back down hes checking my background
its ironic whats happening imagine if i didn’t have the ends
i wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
i’m spaced out dog i be on that moon talk
wonder if god asked mike how to moonwalk
i swear to momma wish me and my father talked more
i stopped visiting around the time i was a sophomore
i guess everything i hate about me i see in him
and i ain’t finna change so well never agree again
just a few things pouring out my soul
rosewood we can see yall with our eyes closed
good music
hook
soul
oh let go let go of your ego
dont lose your soul
sail your soul
