all day
starin at the ceilin makin
friends with shadows on my wall
all night
hearin voices tellin me
that i should get some sleep
because tomorrow might be good for somethin

prechorus
hold on
feelin like im headed for a
breakdown
and i dont know why

chorus
but im not crazy im just a little unwell
i know right now you cant tell
but stay awhile and maybe then youll see
a different side of me
im not crazy im just a little impaired
i know right now you dont care
but soon enough youre gonna think of me
and how i used to be

verse 2
me
im talkin to myself in public
and dodgin glances on the train
and i know
i know theyve all been talkin bout me
i can hear them whisper
and it makes me think there must be somethin wrong
