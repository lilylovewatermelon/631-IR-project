wait time is the worst
i can hardly sit
no one has the time
someones always late
i look for you
and you look for me

chorus
i dont know why
i came down
i hold your phone
dont wake up
i hear a voice
in the ground
tell me dont tell me
the hard part is telling you
something that you would not like me to tell you
tell me dont tell me
the hard part is telling you
something that you would not like me to tell you

verse 2
wait time is to blame
mapped out fames a trip
we all have the time
someones always fed
i look for you
and you look away
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
i dont know why
i came down
i hold your phone
dont wake up
i hear a voice
in the ground
waking up is so much fun to do
tell me dont tell me
the hard part is telling you
something that you would not like me to tell you
an 80s movie makeout party with you
tell me dont tell me
the hard part is telling you
something that you would not like me to tell you15embed"
