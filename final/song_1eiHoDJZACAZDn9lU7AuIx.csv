how much you going for a p
i wanna fly for the week
now she on her knees
cause i let her fly for the free

verse 1
don’t nobody love me
dont nobody care where i spend my days
what you mean that you wont let me
i thought you knew that i was this way

chorus
how much you going for a p
i wanna fly for the week
now she on her knees
’cause i let her fly for the free

verse 2
pick it up and break it down
roll it up and pass it round
louder than a fuckin sound
gotta grab it by the pound

verse 3
sometimes i feel it in my sleep
these demons these demons
they drag me deep
so i gotta know
you might also likechorus
how much you going for a p
i wanna fly for the week
now she on her knees
cause i let her fly for the free

verse 4
why you acting like you got no options
everybody knows that you a star
why you make it look like you so rotten
everyone is troubled in the dark
why you acting like you got no options
everybody knows that you a star
why you make it look like you so rotten
everyone is troubled in the dark

chorus
how much you going for a p
i wanna fly for the week
now she on her knees
cause i let her fly for the free

verse 5
babies dying children crying
twelve steady lying tryna get us indicted
maybe theres heaven for us
always slighted world wanna fight it
always keep your piece on you
maybe theres somewhere for us
outro
tell the youth the future’s on your shoulders’
you cant lose your faith
you can be what you want when you get older
tell the youth ’the futures on your shoulders
you cant lose your faith
you can be what you want when you get older5embed"
