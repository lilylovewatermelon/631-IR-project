take it all away

verse 1
breathe your smoke into my lungs
in the back of the car with you
i stare into the sun
still not too old to die young

prechorus
but lovers hold on to everything
and lovers hold on to anything

chorus
i chase your love around a figure eight
i need you more than i can take
you promise forever and a day
and then you take it all awaywaywaywayway
and then you take it all awaywaywaywayway

verse 2
place a kiss on my cheekbone
then you vanish me
im buried in the snow
but something tells me im not alone
