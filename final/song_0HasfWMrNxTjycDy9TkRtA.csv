truth of the matter is im complicated
youre as straight as they come
you go bout your day baby
while i hide from the sun

prechorus bruno mars
its better if you dont understand
cause you wont know what its like until you try

chorus bruno mars
you know i ill be waiting on the other side
and you all you gotta do is cross the line
i could wait a whole lifetime but you just gotta decide
you know i ill be waiting on the other
waiting on the other side

verse 2 ceelo green
we would live forever
who could ask for more
you could die if you wanted
but baby what for

verse 3 bob
if they say lifes a dream call this insomnia
cause this aint wonderland it damn sure aint narnia
and once you cross the line you cant change your mind
yeah im a monster but im no frankenstein
and quite frankly ive been feelin insane in between my eyes
i really cant explain what i feel inside
if you knew what i was you would run and hide
many have tried to go into the night
and cross over the line and come back alive
but thats the price we paying when we living on the other side

chorus bruno mars
you know i ill be waiting on the other side
and you all you gotta do is cross the line
i could wait a whole lifetime but you just gotta decide
you know i ill be waiting on the other
waiting on the other side
