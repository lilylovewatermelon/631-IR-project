hide and seek is a game
well teach you how to play
close your eyes really tight
make it dark like the night

chorus i monster
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again

verse 2
climb the steps to the top
rooms are dark but dont stop
getting close
really warm
now youre cold
on the floor

chorus i monster
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins again
the party never ends
the game begins againyou might also likeembed"
