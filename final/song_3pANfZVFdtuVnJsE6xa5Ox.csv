i steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
and then ill be nothing forever
and all of my memories
and all of the things i have seen will be gone
with my eyes with my body with me
chorus
but me and my husband
we are doing better
its always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
were sticking together
me and my husband
were sticking together

verse 2
and im the idiot with the painted face
in the corner taking up space
but when he walks in i am loved i am loved
chorus
me and my husband
we are doing better
its always been just him and me
together
so i bet all i have on that
furrowed brow
and at least in this lifetime
were sticking together
me and my husband
were sticking together
me and my husband
we are doing bettersee mitski liveget tickets as low as 55you might also like26embed"
