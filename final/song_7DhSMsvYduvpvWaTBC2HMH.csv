verse 1
pick up the phone answer your text
well i apologize about last night
i really did not mean to disrespect you
you better be alone no im not obsessed
but if i catch you with somebody else
you know that i am gonna be upset

prechorus
i truly believe that the reason im here
is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
and one day you must look at yourself in the mirror
i still dont think that you are hearing me clear
you must understand that our friendship is done
justified by the person that you have become
but because of the fact that enough is enough
now im the one that is holding the gun

chorus
whoa this will be the end of us
i have tried way too many times to heal
i have loved you so much it hurts me dear
and this this will be the end of us

pick up the phone
pick up the phone

well i apologize about last night

verse 2
pick yourself up up off the floor
wipe the tears from off your face
because the cops are knocking on the door
theyre gonna wanna know whats up
better tell em that you fell
cause when they see the bruises on my face
theyre probably taking both of us to jail

prechorus
im sick and tired of fighting each other
the lying the crying the calling your mother
the calling of names im bothered and smothered
we kiss and make up and get under the covers
a dangerous cycle i dont understand
the kicking the screaming the breaking of lamps
ill be damned if i see you with some other man
cause if i cannot have you then nobody can
chorus
whoa this will be the end of us
i have tried way too many times to heal
i have loved you so much it hurts me dear
and this this will be the end of us

bridge
death do us part
i thought you would never go straight for my heart
im better off living in hell
