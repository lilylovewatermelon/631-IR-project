i can understand how the edges are rough
and they cut you like the tiniest slivers of glass
and you feel too much
and you dont know how long youre gonna last

prechorus 1
but everyone you know is trying to smooth it over
find a way to make the hurt go away
but everyone you know is trying to smooth it over
like youre trying to scream underwater

chorus
but i wont let you make the great escape
im never gonna watch you checking out of this place
im not gonna lose you
cause the passion and the pain
are gonna keep you alive someday
gonna keep you alive someday

verse 2
i feel like i could wave my fist in front of your face
and you wouldnt flinch or even feel a thing
and youve retreated to your silent corner
like you decided the fight was over for ya
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeprechorus 2
but everyone you know is trying to smooth it over
find a way to make the hurt go away
but everyone you know is trying to smooth it over
everyone needs a floor they can fall through

chorus
but i wont let you make the great escape
im never gonna watch you checking out of this place
im not gonna lose you
cause the passion and the pain
are gonna keep you alive someday
theyre gonna keep you alive someday

bridge
oh terrified of the dark but not if you go with me
and i wont need a pill to make me numb
and i wrote the book on running
but that chapter of my life will soon be done oh

chorus 2
im the king of the great escape
youre not gonna watch me checking out of this place
youre not gonna lose me
cause the passion and pain
are gonna keep us alive someday
yeah the passion and the pain
are gonna keep us alive someday someday5embed"
