going out every night dont feel the envy
cause the thrill always ends when they say last call
and its not like other girls they dont wanna know me
waking up with strangers aint no fix at all

chorus
cause im lonely for you only
everyday is just a deeper shade of blue
i dont want no other heart to ever hold me
cause im only lonely for you

verse 2
i jump every time i hear the phone ring
but its never your voice on the end of the line
and i run to the blinds and look out my window
hold my breath every time a car drives by

chorus
cause im lonely for you only
everyday is just a deeper shade of blue
and i dont want no other heart to ever hold me
cause im only lonely for you

and i dont want no other heart to ever hold me
cause im only lonely for you
