verse 1
first of all forget these bitches
i aint even care bout your riches
you know im a different girl
i come from a different world
it aint even worth us splittin but
if you knew what i was hittin on
you never wouldve came at me like that
never wouldve tried play me like that
like you dont have to spend no time
like you dont have to give your all
like you dont have to do it right
like you dont have to oh
like you dont have to talk to me talk talk to me
like you dont have to try to teach me
like you aint have to learn me earn me

you can take that bag back
ive had enough of all that
