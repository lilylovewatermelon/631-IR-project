you will release your life
forgetting whats forsaken
the reason why
you are alone again
you will believe the lie
judging from what youve taken
you breathe alive
you are alone again

prechorus
from the heart of darkness
you call to me
spirit raging on
there is nothing i can do
for you are next to no one

chorus
you will release your life
joining with the goddamned world
of the dead and the lonely
youll never leave alive
now do you think youre too damn good
for the killing kind

verse 2
you will release your life
forgetting whats forsaken
the reason why
you are alone again
you will begin to cry
hearing the silence breaking
you breathe alive
but you are alone again
