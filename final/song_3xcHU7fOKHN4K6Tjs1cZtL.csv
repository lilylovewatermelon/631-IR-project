the snow in montana was three feet high
the lady at the counter said there aint no flights
and so he called her on the telephone
he said ill rent a car and ill drive home

first chorus
and she said ill wait for you
like i did last year
at christmas time with your family here
and your truck broke down out in san antone
and the gifts stayed wrapped until you got home
oh this aint nothin new
sweetheart ill wait for you

verse 2
now hes on his cell phone is a coupe deville
talkin to the one he loves and always will
his heart is breakin cause shes there alone
her heart is achin cause she wants him home

second chorus
she says ill wait for you like in 68
when our child was due but i said hell have to wait
until his dad gets here and stands by my side
remember dear our sons first cry
oh this aint nothin new
sweetheart ill wait for you
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeverse 3
he didnt stop all day to eat a bite
and he finally got there around midnight
the doctor said shes in a better place
she said to give you this note just in case

third chorus
and it said ill wait for you at heavens gate
oh i dont care how long it takes
and ill tell saint pete i cant come in
without my love and my best friend
oh this aint nothin new
sweetheart ill wait for you
