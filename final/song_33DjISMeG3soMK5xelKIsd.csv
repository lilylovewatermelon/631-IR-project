saw myself in you didnt know who i was
didnt need a map didnt think i was lost with you
but you dont stand a chance when youre young and in love
right out of the gate dont it all seem great
tried to tell my mother that it felt like fate but she brushed it all off
and she laughed cause were young and in love

chorus
ooh and i hate that she was right
didnt wanna say goodbye
you loved me i loved you too
ooh maybe in another life
cause this one wasnt right
you loved me i loved you too ooh ooh soon

verse 2
maybe we could meet when were thirtythree
its hard to keep a love you meet at fifteen
thought my bеst friend was wrong when she said yourе just young not in love

chorus
ooh and i hate that she was right
didnt wanna say goodbye
you loved me i loved you too ooh ooh ooh you loved me i loved you
ooh maybe in another life
cause this one wasnt right
you loved me i loved you too ooh ooh soon you loved me i loved youyou might also like5embed"
