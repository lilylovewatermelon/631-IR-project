highway boys on the road tonight got a gig out at the ryman
finally learned the hard way that all good things take time friend
i heard theyll pay a lost soul to sing his songs true
that make a southern boy cry or turn a northeast man confused
and i awoke with a fever sweatin oceans again
theres mirrors in hotel rooms but i do not recognize them
maybe its the feelin that i get in my sleep
that all the memories in my mind are only mine to keep

chorus
i wanna ride that k10 to way back when
sleep next to the river hear it rushin again
get my nogood soul back to wherе it belongs
and do my best to keep truth in songs
and do my best to keep truth in songs

verse 2
and all of my old friеnds miss havin me around but
highways work both ways and i cant stand the liars in town
if you need me you can find me slightly out of control
cause highway boys dont rest and dont hang hats til theyre home
highway boys on the road tonight got a gig out at the ryman
they finally found out the hard way that this sound i got is mine man

bridge
so if you need me call
if youre in love fall
just know that highway boys dont stick around at all

i wanna ride that k10 to way back when
sleep next to the river hear it rushin again
get my nogood soul back to where it belongs
and do my best to keep truth in songs
and do my best to keep truth in songs

outro
highway boys on the road tonight got a gig out at the ryman
they finally found out the hard way that this sound i got is mine manembed"
