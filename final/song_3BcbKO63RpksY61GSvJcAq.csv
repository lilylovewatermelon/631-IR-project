i wanted somethin thats purer than the water
like we were
its not there now ineloquence and anger
are all we have
like saturns rings an icy loop around me
too hard to hold
lash out first at all the things we dont like
or understand

chorus
and its beginnin to get to me
that i know more of the stars and sea
than i do of whats in your head
barely touchin in our cold bed
are you beginnin to get my point
that all this fighting with aching joints
is doin nothin but tire us out
and no one knows what this fights about

verse 2
the answer phone the lonely sound of your voice
frozen in time
i only need the compass that you gave me
to guide me on
see snow patrol liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likechorus
and its beginnin to get to me
that i know more of the stars and sea
than i do of whats in your head
barely touchin in our cold bed
are you beginnin to get my point
that all this fighting with aching joints
is doin nothin but tire us out
and no one knows what this fights about

postchorus
its so thrillin but also wrong
dont have to prove that you are so strong
cause i can carry you on my back
after our enemies attack
i tried to tell you before i left
but i was screamin under my breath
you are the only thing that makes sense
just ignore all this present tense

outro
we need to feel breathless with love
and not collapsed under its weight
im gaspin for the air to fill
my lungs with everything ive lost
we need to feel breathless with love
and not collapsed under its weight
im gaspin for the air to fill
my lungs with everything ive lost1embed"
