im sitting here alone
thoughts of you run wild
im longing for your touch
haunted by your smile
no use in trying to erase
no one could ever take your place

chorus
well i remember how it used to feel
back when our love was strong and real
and i remember tears in your eyes
and i looked at you and said goodbye i remember
all i want right now is to forget
every single thing that i regret
and drown out these embers but i remember

verse 2
its yesterday again
here inside my mind
and i cant find a way
to leave your love behind
i wanna wake up to the day
your memory wont stand in my way

chorus
well i remember how it used to feel
back when our love was strong and real
and i remember tears in your eyes
i looked at you and said goodbye i remember
all i want right now is to forget
every single thing that i regret
and drown out these embers but i remember
