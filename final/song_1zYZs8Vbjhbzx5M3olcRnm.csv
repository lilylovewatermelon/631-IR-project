red leaves on the river
footprints in the sand
cold walk in december
warming up your hands
sun dress on the front steps
sun up by the lake
blanket down in the backyard
lying wide awake

chorus
thats a memory i dont mess with
the girl i was the best with
the one i was obsessed with
girl you just dont get it
id fall right back with one slip
always leaves me helpless
dont hate me i cant help it
gotta leave us where we left it
youre a memory i dont mess with

verse 2
moonlight on the back seat
a breeze through the wires
springsteen on the speakers
girl im on fire
thats stuff i dont think about
cause it still kills me now
i still cant dance around
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
that memory i dont mess with
the girl i was the best with
the one i was obsessed with
girl you just dont get it
id fall right back with one slip
always leaves me helpless
dont hate me i cant help it
gotta leave us where we left it
youre a memory i dont mess with

bridge
its good running into you like this
but girl im close as i can get

chorus
to a memory i dont mess with
the girl i was the best with
the one i was obsessed with
girl you just dont get it
id fall right back with one slip
always leaves me helpless
dont hate me i cant help it
gotta leave us where we left it
youre a memory i dont mess with
outro
red leaves on the river
footprints in the sand
cold walk in december
warming up your handsembed"
