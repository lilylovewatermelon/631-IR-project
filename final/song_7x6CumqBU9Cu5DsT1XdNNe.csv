cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
one more down to drink you off my mind
lord knows i’ve tried a thousand times to give you up
but its closing time and we both know why

chorus miranda lambert  blake shelton
i’m just too selfish i guess
i know you’re tired and restless
it’s no surprise we’ve come undone
but i can’t unlove you just because
you say it’s better in the long run

verse 2 blake shelton
we’ve been driving down this highway
now we’re out of gas too far outta town
oh here we are all tangled up and sideways
you’re all broken down yeah i’m breaking down

chorus miranda lambert  blake shelton
i’m just too selfish i guess
i know you’re tired and restless
it’s no surprise we’ve come undone
but i can’t unlove you just because
you say it’s better in the long run
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebridge blake shelton
oh maybe somewhere a little down the line
i’ll get a little better leaving us behind
maybe someday oh i’ll be fine

interlude miranda lambert
oh and you’ll move on and i will too
but still i don’t see getting over you
oh no no no

chorus miranda lambert  blake shelton
i’m just too selfish i guess
i know you’re tired and restless
it’s no surprise we’ve come undone
but i can’t unlove you just because
you say it’s better in the long run

outro
in the long run
oh in the long run
in the long run
in the long runembed"
