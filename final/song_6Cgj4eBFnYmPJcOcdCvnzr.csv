the night spent kicking cars
wont you help me find the stars
the things i dream
are tearing up the structures seams

prechorus owain
and analyse with ice cold eyes
something in me makes you realise
the things i dream
are tearing up the structures seams

chorus owain
and why cant we be analogue
running around in your consumer fog
and youre another stupid pet
hey did you forget your cigarettes

verse 2 owain
we look to the kicked in stars
family daytrips to the moon and mars
the things i dream
are tearing up the structures seams

prechorus owain
and analyse with irish eyes
something to me makes you want to die
the things i dream
are tearing up the structures seams

and youre another stupid pet
