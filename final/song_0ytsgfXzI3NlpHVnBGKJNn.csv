score the lines in a deepening order
score them deep just to make sure you told her
destructive rage its just easier to be that way
at least you never have to eat the words you say

prechorus
i take pleasure in being all alone
i save passion in makin it on my own

chorus 1
and i will never be taken by your humility
and i i will never fall on my knees now

verse 2
bear the weight of the world as you told her
but it weighs heavy on a wounded shoulder
sew the petals on a dying flower
at least you know that she will stay in your power now

prechorus
i take pity on those who cant see clearly now
you take pleasure in making it hard to see here

chorus 1
now i will never be taken by your humility
and i i will never fall on my knees now
you might also likebridge
make sure shes breathing make sure shes feeling
make sure shes responding to you now
so you can tell her the score
make sure shes breathing make sure shes feeling
make sure shes responding to you now
so you can hurt her all the more

chorus 2
i will never be beaten by your brutality
and i i i will never be shaken by your stupidity

outro
and i oh i
make sure shes breathing make sure shes feeling
make sure shes responding to you now
make sure make sure
make sure dont you hurt her now
make sure make sure
make sure dont you dare hurt her2embed"
