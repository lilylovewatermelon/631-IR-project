i did ask him if he were
amphibion broker
shun
why

alm
a creature of two natures
because he has two offices
bro
you may jeer
you ha the wits young gentlemen but your hope
of helicon will never carry it here
with our fat family we ha the dullest
most unbord ears for verse amongst our females
i grievd you read so long sir old nurse mortgage
she snoard i the chair and statute if you markd her
fell fast asleep and mistris band she nodded
but not with any consent to what you read
they must have somewhat else to chink than rymes
if you could make an epitaph on your land
imagine it on departure such a poem
would wake em and bring wax to her true temper

mad
i faith sir and i will try

bro
tis but earth
fit to make bricks and tyles of

shun
pox upont
tis but for pots or pipkins at the best
if it would keep us in good tabaccopipes

bro
twere worth keeping

fit
or in porclane dishes
there were some hope

alm
but this is a hungry soil
and must be helpt

fit
who would hold any land
to have the trouble to marl it

shun
not a gentleman

bro
let clowns and hinds affect it that love plows
and carts and harrows and are busie still
in vexing the dull element

alm
our sweet songster
shall rarifit into air

fit
and you mas broker
shall have a feeling

bro
so it supple sir
the nerves

mad
o it shall be palpable
make thee run through a hoop or a thumbring
the nose of a tabaccopipe and draw
thy ductile bones out like a knittingneedle

to serve my subtil turns

bro
i shall obey sir
and run a thred like an hourglass

p sen
where is broker
are not these flies gone yet pray quit my house
ill smoak you out else

fit
o the prodigal
will you be at so much charge with us and loss

mad
i have heard you ha offerd sir to lock up smoak
and cauk your windows spar up all your doors
thinking to keep it a close prisoner wi you
and wept when it went out sir at your chimney

fit
and yet his eyes were drier than a pumice

shun
a wretched rascal that will bind about
the nose of his bellows lest the wind get out
when hes abroad

alm sweeps down no cobwebs here
but sells em for cut fingers and the spiders
as creatures reard of dust and cost him nothing
to fat old ladies monkeys

fit
he has offerd
to gather up spilt water and preserve
each hair falls from him to stop balls withal

shun
a slave and an idolater to pecunia
p sen
you all have happy memories gentlemen
in rocking my poor cradle i remember too
vvhen you had lands and credit vvorship friends
i and could give security now you have none
or will have none right shortly this can time
and the vicissitude of things i have
all these and money too and do possess em
and am right heartily glad of all our memories
and both the changes

fit
let us leave the viper

p sen
hes glad he is rid of his torture and so soon
broker come hither up and tell your lady
she must be ready presently and statute
band mortgage wax my prodigal young kinsman
vvill streight be here to see her top of our house
the flourishing and flanting peniboy
vve were but three of us in all the world
my brother francis whom they calld frank peniboy
father to this hes dead this peniboy
is now the heir i richer peniboy
not richard but old harry peniboy
and to make ryme close wary peniboy
i shall have all at last my hopes do tell me
go see all ready and where my dogs have faulted
remove it with a broom and sweeten all
vvith a slice of juniper not too much but sparing
vve may be faulty our selves else and turn prodigal
in entertaining of the prodigal
here he is and with him — what a clapperdudgeon
thats a good sign to have the beggar follow him
so near at his first entry into fortuneembed"
