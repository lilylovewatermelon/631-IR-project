verse 1
why would i say all these things to have you feelin a way
why would i tell you im 30 away if im not on the way
why do i settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces
why do i want an independent woman
to feel like she needs me—i lost my way

run your mouth id rather listen to someone else
i gave your nickname to someone else
i know youre seein someone that loves you
and i dont want you to see no one else
i dont want you here with no one else
i dont wanna do this with no one else

verse 4
damn im not unrealistic with none of my women
i tell them if they aint with it then lets just forget it
relationships slowin me down they slow down the vision
guess im not in a position to deal with commitment
certain people need to tell me theyre proud of me
that mean a lot to me
not havin closure it take a lot out of me
this year for christmas i just want apologies
sydney gave up on me when i went missin
syn had a baby and treated me different
erika sued me and opened a business
wonder if they wish it couldve been different
wonder what theyd do put in my position
i wonder when my shit drop do they listen
wonder if theyre second guessin their decisions
i hate the number 2 that shit is unforgiving
tryna satisfy everybody its like they cant get enough
until enough is enough and then its too much
you tip the scale when i weigh my options
west palm girls are spoiled rotten
tiffany on you you know you poppin
ill kill somebody if they give you problems
master bedrooms where we get it poppin
just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
im a walkin comeup im a bank deposit
sell my secrets and get top dollar
sell my secrets for a range rover
opportunity and temptation
they would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
sell my secrets back to me if i was payin
whos gonna save me when i need savin
since take care ive been caretakin
but second chances that aint how you livin
redemption on your mind ill never be forgiven
outro
yeah
