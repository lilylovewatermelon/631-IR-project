maybe its time to let the old ways die
maybe its time to let the old ways die
it takes a lot to change a man
hell it takes a lot to try
maybe its time to let the old ways die

verse 1
nobody knows what waits for the dead
nobody knows what waits for the dead
some folks just believe in the things theyve heard and the things they read
nobody knows what awaits for the dead

verse 2
im glad i cant go back to where i came from
im glad those days are gone gone for good
but if i could take spirits from my past and bring em here
you know i would
know i would

verse 3
nobody speaks to god these days
nobody speaks to god these days
id like to think hes lookin down and laughin at our ways
nobody speaks to god these days

when i was a child they tried to fool me
said the worldly man was lost and that a hell was real

and this worlds one big old catherine wheel
spinnin steel

chorus 2
maybe its time to let the old ways die
maybe its time to let the old ways die
it takes a lot to change your plans
and a train to change your mind
maybe its time to let the old ways die
oh maybe its time to let the old ways die1embed"
