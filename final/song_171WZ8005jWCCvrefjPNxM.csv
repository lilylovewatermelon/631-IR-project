its beautiful out today
i wish you could take me upstate
to the little place you would tell me about
when youd sense that id want to escape

verse 2
texas is a landlocked state
its a little bit far away
from the water from the home that ive wanted to make
it somehow in the city you make it there and you make it

chorus
anywhere anywhere
but ive been anywhere and its not what i want
i wanna be still with you
doo doodoo doodoo doo

bridge
you keep your socks on in bed
keep our hearth warm
see the trees shadows lie in black pools in the lawns
youre the breeze in my austin nights

outro
youre the breeze in my austin nights
youre the breeze in my austin nightssee mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like10embed"
