instead of the fine that i could not pay
said walk right youll soon be home
cross the line and youre on your own

fourty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
fourty nights to sit an listen to the midnight train to memphis

well now whistle blows when the sun comes up
head to floor keep your big mouth shut
eat your breakfast on the ground
work like hell till the sun goes down

fourty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
fourty nights to sit an listen to the midnight train to memphis

well now 10 for the jury 10 for the judge
20 more to forget my grudge
when i get to 39
thats the longest day in a prisoners mind

fourty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
fourty nights to sit an listen to the midnight train to memphis
