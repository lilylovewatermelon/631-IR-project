and when it rains
on this side of town it touches
everything
just say it again and mean it
we dont miss a thing

prechorus 1
you made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole blackest hole
and convinced yourself that its not the reason you dont see the sun anymore

oh i i never saw it coming
oh oh i need an ending
so why cant you stay just long enough to explain

verse 2
and when it rains
well you always find an escape
just running away
from all of the ones who love you
from everything

prechorus 2
