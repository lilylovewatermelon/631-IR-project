i was raised on red beams  rice
 if you shot up my crib i wouldnt be surprised
mama used to trip cause i fed the mice
im the one they sent home cause my head had lice
im the kid that lost my sanity
im the kid that had the toys with no batteries
mama sat me down for some serious talks
on how to keep the rats out the cereal box

los
im a smoke til i croak nigga fuck bein broke nigga
i need 7 bedrooms  my boat nigga
watchin rats with 87 new gats
the penitentarys the only place where i can relax
i want some hoes in they heads they pushin me to the edge
the only thing im a miss is my beautiful kids
im just sippin pedron i handle shit on my own
i got a camera for every fuckin inch of my home
its in my blood to be a drunk  not give a fuck
i do a drive by in my grandmas truck
a g since daddy left me at the age of 3
now every south side crackhead pagin me

los

i grab my muthafuckin glock  start squeezin my shit
no mercy for the weak bitch so save yo speech bitch
