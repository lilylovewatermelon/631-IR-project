angel roger

benny
you make fun yet im the one
attempting to do some good
or do you really want a neighborhood
where people piss on your stoop every night
bohemia bohemias a fallacy in your head
this is calcutta
bohemia is dead

mark
dearly beloved we gather here to say our goodbyes

collins  roger
dies irae dies illa kyrie eleison
yitgadal vyitkadash

mark
here she lies no one knew her worth
the late great daughter of mother earth
on these nights when we celebrate the birth
in that little town of bethlehem
we raise our glass you bet your ass to
la vie boheme
all
la vie boheme
la vie boheme
la vie boheme
la vie boheme

mark
to days of inspiration playing hookey
making something out of nothing
the need to express to communicate
to going against the grain
going insane going mad
to loving tension no pension
to more than one dimension
to starving for attention
hating convention hating pretension
not to mention of course hating dear old mom and dad
to riding your bike midday past the threepiece suits
to fruits to no absolutes
to absolut to choice to the village voice
to any passing fad
to being an us for once instead of a them
