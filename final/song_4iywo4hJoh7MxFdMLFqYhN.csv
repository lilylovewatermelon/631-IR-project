heres a little story ive gotta tell
bout this boy i know so well
back in the day was cool and all
fell in love i fell in love
thought he was the one for me
other boys i could not see
and look what happened to our love
im like how could it be

verse 1 rihanna  william
it shoulda been me and you
it coulda been you and me
but boy you broke my heart and now im standing there
it shoulda been me and you
it coulda been you and me
now all i got are these photographs

chorus rihanna  william
all ive got all ive got
