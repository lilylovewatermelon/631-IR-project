intro justin vernon
i can hold my liquor
but this man cant handle his weed
dark and lonely now
on chicago south of town
im onto indiana
i heard it in the radio now
refrain chief keef
i cant handle no liquor
but these bitches cant handle me
i cant control my niggas
and my niggas they cant control me
you say you know me my nigga
but you really just know the old me
verse kanye west
bitch im back out my coma
wakin up on your sofa
when i parked my range rover
slightly scratched your corolla
okay i smashed your corolla
im hangin on a hangover
five years we been over
ask me why i came over
one more hit and i can own ya
one more fuck and i can own ya
one cold night in october
pussy had me floatin
feel like deepak chopra
pussy had me dead
might call 2pac over
yeezys all on your sofa
these the red octobers
still aint learn me no manners
you love me when i aint sober
you love me when im hungover
even when i blow doja
then her auntie came over
skinny bitch with no shoulders
tellin you that im bogus
bitch you dont even know us
baby girl hes a loner
baby girl hes a loner
latenight organ donor
after that he disown ya
after that hes just hopeless
soul mates become soulless
when its over its over
and bitch im back out my coma

refrain chief keef
i cant handle no liquor
but these bitches cant handle me

you say you know me my nigga
but you really just know the old me
