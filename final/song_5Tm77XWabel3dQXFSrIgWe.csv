so i say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
i can hear you whispering as i walk by as i walk by
familiar faces smiling back at me
and i knew this would make them change make them change

but if you call my name just know that ill come running
for one more night to spare with you
this is where im meant to be please dont leave me
