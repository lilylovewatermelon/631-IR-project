i took my baby on a riverboat cruise
and she was well aware
i was excited bout the way that things couldve been
she said that i dont care
i wore a face no one could recognize in disguise
someone called out my name
they thought of takin pictures autographs then they grabbed
my joy had turned to pain

prechorus
father always told me
you wont live a quiet life
if youre reachin for fortune and fame
i feel the pressure settin in im livin just to win
im done in my pain dont be feelin your pain

chorus
its the price of fame you pay the price of fame
so dont be feelin your pain
its the price of fame its the price of fame
so dont you ever complain

verse 2
i am a cover of a magazine what a scene
they know my every move
just sign your name on the dotted line youll be fine
that always bothers me
get in your car you want to take a ride look behind
someone is followin you
you try to get away you turn round fast but too bad
they know your every move
you might also likeprechorus
father always told me
you wont live a quiet life
if youre reachin for fortune and fame
and i feel the pressure settin in im livin just to win
im feelin all this pain dont you ever complain

chorus
its the price of fame you pay the price of fame
so dont you ever complain
its the price of fame you pay the price for fame
so dont be feelin no pain
its the price of fame you pay the price of fame
father never lies the price of fame
my father never lies
my father never lies the price of fame
so dont be feelin this way boy

instrumental break

verse 3
i like to take some time and get away then they say
is that boy still alive
the weak that really start takin pills what a thrill
only the strong survive
prechorus
father always told me
you wont live a quiet life
they start to wonderin where have you been
i feel the envious look at me
their mistaken jealousy
well then stand here in my shoes
and get a taste of my blues

chorus
itâ€™s the price of fame
you pay the price for fame
so dont you ever complain
its the price of fame
you pay the price for fame
so dont be feelin this way
its the price of fame
you pay the price for fame
so dont you ever complain
its the price of fame
you pay the price of fame
my father never lies the price of fame
my father never lies baby
my father never lies the price of fame
so dont be feelin no pain boy9embed"
