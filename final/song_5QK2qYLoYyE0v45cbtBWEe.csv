i didnt hear a single word you said
the things i was afraid of
they were all confined beneath my bed
but the years have been long
and you have taught me well to hide away
the things that i believed in
youve taught me to call them all escapes
i know who you are now
i know who you are
i know who you are now
there before the threshold
i saw a brighter world beyond myself
and in my hour of weakness
you were there to see my courage fail
for the years have been long
and you have taught me well to sit and wait
planning without acting
steadily becoming what i hate

i know who you are now
i know who you are
i know who you are now
you might also likei have always known you
you have always been there in my mind
but now i understand you
and i will not be part of your designs
i know who i am now
and all that youve made of me
i know who you are now
and i name you my enemy

i know who i am now
i know who i want to be
i want to be more than this devil inside of me1embed"
