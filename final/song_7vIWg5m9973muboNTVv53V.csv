anita come closer
stop crying and listen to me
i guess its too late now
but somehow i must make you see
what we thought was our world
was only a dream world
and we just cant go on like this
anita youre dreaming
of a world that can never exist

chorus
anita its over
theres nothing thats left now to say
anita youre dreaming
and i know its better this way

instrumental

verse 2
anita come closer
and close your pretty blue eyes
your young dreams just cant be
and somehow you must realize
and each time youre with me
my conscience reminds me
of someone whos waiting alone
anita youre dreaming
and when you awake ill be gone
