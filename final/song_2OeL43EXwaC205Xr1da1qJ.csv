and means at least one other language you would never speak in polite company
shes a dancer lone riddle in the answer
she auditioned for romantics
but no calls from the right company
shell never love the way you need her to darlin
youll never lift her at all
she only wants the man she thinks is you darlin
youll only take her if you think you could lose
so what if i dont find you take you back
i only want what i cant have
if you love me give me nothing
but
polite company
were the dance among the drunklegs a contest between
untied lace popshoegaze and 808 heartbreak
we both caught the pace of two hearts offbeat
what will hold you when the dance is through
put your back against the wall
follow syncopated water fountain conversation
making love inside a crayon covered bathroom stall
what if i dont find you take you there
i only want what i cant have
if you love me give me nothing
nothing
some simple math
two i can add
i aint writing it down
i remember now what you came for where your aim is
maintain it
try to burn the right glow
ill be on my way out
ill be over soon
sober later
fire that only id know
youve been on my radar
are you lonely too
cause your coast is clear to get a hold on me
shes the edge between the cadence of my name
and on these walls another language we would never speak
in polite companyyou might also like5embed"
