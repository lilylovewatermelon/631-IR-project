at my door the leaves are falling
a cold wild wind will come
sweethearts walk by together
and i still miss someone
i go out on a party
and look for a little fun
but i find a darkened corner
because i still miss someone

oh i never got over those blues eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there
i wonder if shes sorry
for leaving what wed begun
theres someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone

i still miss someone

oh i never got over those blue eyes
i see them every where
i miss those arms that held me
when all the love was there
i wonder if shes sorry
for leaving what wed begun
theres someone for me somewhere
and i still miss someone
i still miss someoneyou might also likeembed"
