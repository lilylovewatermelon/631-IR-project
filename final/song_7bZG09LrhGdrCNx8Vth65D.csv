ive been doing my best to make church on sundays
and aint been calling in hungover most mondays
i guess you could say im being grown up
i got my shit together and oddly enough
i dont mind
cause its about time
but if you second guessin dont think for a second
that i cant hang

chorus
cause ive been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
you can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
stomping on a hardwood floor
and buying the bar another round of shots
close my tab and hit the parking lot
next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
i aint afraid to take too many steps out of line
so dont tempt me with a good time

verse 2
well most folks think i dont know how to throw down
they done forgot about rowdy
but no doubt hes still around
so keep cracking those jokes
cause im willing and able
yeah this old boyll drink you under the table
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
cause ive been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
you can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
stomping on a hardwood floor
and buying the bar another round of shots
close my tab and hit the parking lot
next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
i aint afraid to take too many steps out of line
so dont tempt me with a good time

bridge
at 3am im still hanging tough
my buddys passed out in the bed of my truck
and i cant wait til he wakes up
and sees the pictures on his phone

chorus
cause ive been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
you can bet these boots have gotten pretty used to
stomping on a hardwood floor
and buying the bar another round of shots
close my tab and hit the parking lot
next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
i aint afraid to take too many steps out of line
so dont tempt me with a good time
with a good timeembed"
