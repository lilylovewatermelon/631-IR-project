on the night line
on the night line

verse 1
when i wake up in the morning light
sunlight hurts my eyes
something without warning love
bears heavy on my mind

prechorus
then i look at you
then i look at you
then i look at you
then i look at you

chorus
then i look at you
and the worlds alright with me
oh just one look at you
just one look at you
just one look at you
and i know its gonna be
a lovely day
for the night line
for the night line
you might also likeverse 2
when the day that lies ahead of me
seems impossible to face
when someone else instead of me
always seems to know the way

chorus
then i look at you
and the worlds alright with me
oh just one look at you
and i know its gonna be
a lovely day
on the night line
for the night line

outro
