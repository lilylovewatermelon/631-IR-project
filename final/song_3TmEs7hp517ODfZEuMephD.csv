i know we made a downtown reservation
lets get there early get drunk and break it
theres cabs outside we could wave and take one
to that little dive bar you like
i know you got your red dress on but
it was always gonna come back off
so go on and call me crazy
we both know its just a matter of time baby

chorus
with me on whiskey and you on wine
gettin tennessee tipsy in the neon light
yeah its what we do girl its kind of our thing
a little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
were as easy as you got your drink i got mine
but we got the same thing on our mind
i guarantee best times tend to be
with you on wine and me on whiskey
with you on wine and me on whiskey yeah

verse 2
lets get started on an allnight nightcap
that wont wind down until the break of dawn
and we can keep it rollin like that
cause right about now it dont sound wrong
girl i know you got all dressed up
yeah and now were gettin all messed up
we dont just do it cause were good at it
yeah we do it cause we find some good things happen
