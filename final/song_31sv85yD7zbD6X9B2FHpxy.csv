as they search for blood
all eyes descend on one
honest man in chains
but that dont matter anyway
my judgment day

chorus
my flesh will feed the demon
no trial no case for reason
ive been chosen to pay with my life
mad men define what mad is
turning witches and saints to ashes
rising masses marching to find
heretic blood

verse 2
impose your will on me
until fire sets me free
the flames of hell burn bright
my fate decided by their lies
final demise

chorus
my flesh will feed the demon
no trial no case for reason
ive been chosen to pay with my life
mad men define what mad is
turning witches and saints to ashes
rising masses marching to find
heretic heretic blood

ive walked a fragile line
and ive fallen down

chorus
my flesh will feed the demon
no trial no case for reason
ive been chosen to pay with my life
mad men define what mad is
turning witches and saints to ashes
rising masses marching to find
