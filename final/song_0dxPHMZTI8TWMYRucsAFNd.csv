breathing each others lives
holding this in mind
that if we fall we all fall
and we fall alone

verse 1 serj tankian
the cold insincerity of steel machines
have consumed our euphoria
transforming us into muted dreams
dreaming of the day that

chorus serj tankian
we attack attack attack your fetal servitude
we attack attack attack attack with pesticide
we attack all the years of propaganda
we shall attack

verse 2 serj tankian
books illustrate what we already know
candles cry towards the sky
raising your flags along polluted coast
dreaming of the day that

chorus serj tankian
we attack attack attack your fetal servitude
we attack attack attack attack with pesticide
we attack all the years of propaganda
we shall attack

bridge daron malakian with serj tankian
breathing each others lives
holding this in mind
that if we fall we all fall
and we fall alone
breathing each others lives
holding this in mind
that if we fall we all fall
and we fall alone

verse 3 serj tankian
whats the philosophy of displaced mines
the bombing of all homes and villages
truth is the only sword bleeding minds
bleeding til the day that

chorus serj tankian
we attack attack attack your fetal servitude
we attack attack attack attack with pesticide
we attack all the years of propaganda
we shall attack
outro serj tankian
attack all the homes and villages
attack all the schools and hospitals
you attack all the rapes and pillages
we shall attack we shall attack6embed"
