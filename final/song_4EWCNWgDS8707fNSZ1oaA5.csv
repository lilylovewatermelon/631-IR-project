in the night i hear em talk
the coldest story ever told
somewhere far along this road
he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
how could you be so heartless
oh how could you be so heartless

verse 1
how could you be so
cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
just remember that you talkin to me though
you need to watch the way you talkin to me yo
i mean after all the things that we been through
i mean after all the things we got into
ayo i know of some things that you aint told me
ayo i did some things but thats the old me
and now you wanna get me back and you gon show me
so you walk around like you dont know me
you got a new friend well i got homies
but in the end its still so lonely

chorus
in the night i hear em talk
the coldest story ever told
somewhere far along this road
he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
how could you be so heartless
oh how could you be so heartless

youre bringin out a side of me that i dont know

and you cant make it right

the coldest story ever told
somewhere far along this road
he lost his soul to a woman so heartless
how could you be so heartless how how
