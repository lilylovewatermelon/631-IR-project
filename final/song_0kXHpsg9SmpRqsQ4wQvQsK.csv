i tell myself that ill take you for the last time
ill be over you eventually
time after time you seem to brush me off
i understand what we have become
you wash your neck when you leave now i know your routine
i was in love with your mystery
now ill just take what i can get from you
im not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

prehook
cause unlike you i got nothing to hide
i dont pretend to have any shame
i got a box you can put all your lies in
until the end of days
you know that i will be a call away
the call youll make when youre all alone
and i know that i will always be the one
you repent when you are done

hook
well here comes the sun
and you’re in my arms
and my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
that you’ll stay through the night

you just wanna fill the void now
i can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
and i can hear it in your voice now
he got you smoking extra packs a day
don’t you worry bout me talking
i know why you’ve been coming
i’ll be quiet this aint nothing to me
just wrap your legs around my waist
i won’t stop until you ask me
don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets

prehook
cause unlike you i got nothing to hide
i dont pretend to have any shame
i got a box you can put all your lies in

and know that i will be a call away
the call youll make when youre all alone
and i know that i will always be the one
you repent when you are done

hook
well here comes the sun
and you’re in my arms
and my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
that you’ll stay through the night
well here comes the sun
and you’re in my arms
and my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
that you’ll stay through the night

you’re gonna hate him

you’re gonna hate him
then you’ll want me
then you’ll miss him
then you’ll hate me
girl i know you so well
girl i know your routine
