take a bow the night is over
this masquerade is getting older
lights are low the curtains down
theres no one here
theres no one here theres no one in the crowd
say your lines but do you feel them
do you mean what you say when theres no one around
no one around
watchin you watchin me one lonely star
one lonely star you dont know who you are

chorus madonna babyface both
ive always been in love with you always with you
i guess youve always known its true you know its true
you took my love for granted why oh why
the show is over say goodbye
say goodbye byebye
say goodbye

verse 2 madonna  babyface
make them laugh it comes so easy
when you get to the part where youre breakin my heart
breakin my heart
hide behind your smile all the world loves a clown
just make em smile the whole world loves a clown
wish you well i cannot stay
you deserve an award for the role that you played
role that you played
no more masquerade youre one lonely star
one lonely star you dont know who you are
