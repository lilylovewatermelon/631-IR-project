i need to hear a melody
the sad with three part harmony
a bar room jukebox symphony
i need to hear a melody
i need to hear a song thats blue
enough to break a heart in two
after what you put me through
i need to hear a song thats blue

chorus
yeah make it lonely
when you do it
ill know somebody else
have just been through it
instead of hurting by myself
man ill just sing along
i need to hear a loser crying
songs about a love thats dying
lying cheating to the bone
three chord stone cold country song

verse 2
i need to hear a drinking tune
with cowboys howling at the moon
and some swinging lonesome moon
i need to hear a drinking tune

yeah make it lonely
when you do it
ill know somebody else
have just been through it
instead of hurting by myself
man ill just sing along
i need to hear a loser crying
songs about a love thats dying
lying cheating to the bone
three chord stone cold country song
yeah country song
three chord stone cold country songembed"
