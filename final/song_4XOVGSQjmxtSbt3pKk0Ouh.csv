when i was a kid i used to buy and sell gravity
i knew how to fly and i would teach you for a fee
broke every window in my hotel heart
when i was only five years old but twelve years scarred
and id hear the same voice echo in my mind
itd say son youve got an angel
thatd chase the devil at night

chorus
when i was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
hed talk about god he was something like a teacher
he said god only helps those who learn to help themselves
he was a million miles from a million dollars
but you could never spend his wealth

verse 2
i took a little faith and put it in a parking lot
i drove to a strange town full of have and have nots
and as i walked through that storybook life
ive been looking for an angel whod chase the devil at night

chorus 2
when i was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
he’d talk about love he was something like a teacher
he said “god only helps those who learn to help themselves”
he was a million miles from a million dollars
but you could never spend his wealth

wave put your hands up and hands down
wave put your hands up and hands down

chorus 3
when i was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
he’d talk about life he was something like a teacher
he said “god only helps those who learn to help themselves”
he was a million miles from a million dollars
but you could never spend his wealth

he was a million miles from a million dollars
but you could never spend his wealth19embed"
