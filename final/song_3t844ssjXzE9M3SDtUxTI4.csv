is it strange for me to say that if i were to die today
theres not a thing that i would change ive lived well
maybe i have made mistakes and been through my fair share of pain
but all in all its been okay ive lived well

prehook
and the more that i see the more that i know
i dont know anything at all
like the more that i breathe and start to go slow
of all the many things i can only recall

hook
all of the good things good things
all of the good things good things
only the good the good the good
only the good the good the good
all of the good things good things
all of the good things good things
only the good the good the good
only the good

living on sycamore street and spending weekends on the beach
we were free to be everything we dreamed
flying kites and water fights
summer nights wed ride our bikes
on overhill ladera heights
