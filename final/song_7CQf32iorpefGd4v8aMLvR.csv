oh oh deary me
my little brothers in his bedroom smoking weed
i tell him he should get up cause its nearly half past three
he cant be bothered cause hes high on thc
i ask him very nicely if hed like a cup of tea
i cant even see him cause his room is so smoky
dont understand how one can watch so much tv
my baby brother alfie how i wish that you could see

chorus
i only say it cause i care
so please can you stop pulling my hair
now now theres no need to swear
please dont despair my dear mon frère

verse 2
ohh alfie get up its a brand new day
i just cant sit back and watch you waste your life away
you need to get a job because the bills need to get paid
get off your lazy arse alfie please use your brain
surely theres some walls out there that you can go and spray
im feeling guilty for leading you astray
now how the hell do you ever expect that youll get laid
when all you do is stay and play on your computer games

i only say it cause i care
so please can you stop pulling my hair
now now theres no need to swear
please dont despair my dear mon frère

bridge
oh little brother please refrain from doing that
im tryna help you out so can you stop being a twat
its time that you and i sat down and had a little chat
and look me in the eyes take off that stupid fitted cap

chorus
i only say it cause i care
so please can you stop pulling my hair
now now theres no need to swear
please dont despair
please dont despair
