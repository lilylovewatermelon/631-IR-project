the mouths of envious
always find another door
while at the gates of paradise
they beat us down some more
our missions set in stone
because the writings on the wall
ill scream it from the mountain tops
pride comes before a fall
so many thoughts to share
all this energy to give
unlike those who hide the truth
i tell it like it is
if the truth will set you free
i feel sorry for your soul
cant you hear the ringing
because for you the bell tolls

chorus
im just a freedom fighter no remorse
raging on in holy war
soon therell come a day
when youre face to face with me

bridge
face to face with mex3

cant you hear us coming
people marching all around
cant you see me coming
close your eyes its over now
cant you hear us coming
the fight has only just begun
cant you see were coming

chorus

chorus
freedom fighter no remorse
raging on in holy war
