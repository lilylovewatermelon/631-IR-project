look what this girl done did to me
she done cut me off from a good good love
she told me that those days were gone gone gone gone

prechorus
now im sitting here going half crazy oh oh
cause i know she still thinks about me too oh oh
and it aint no way in hell
that i can be just friends with you you you you

chorus
and i wish we never did it
and i wish we never loved it
and i wish i never fell so deep in love with you
and now it aint no way we can be friends right

verse 2

but what weve done we cant take it back back back back

prechorus
now im sitting here halfway crazy oh oh
cause i know she still thinks about me too oh oh
and it aint no way in hell
that i can be just friends with you you you you
