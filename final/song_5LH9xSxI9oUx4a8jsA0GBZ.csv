i play the road
and the highway is our song
and every citys like the same three chords
been helping us along when the storys told
and the crowd has come and gone
shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

verse 1
every exit is a season
every signal is a beacon
and the wind it carries me
and it eases up my load
everyday i drag the turns
every candle still burns
and every lesson i have learned
brings us closer to the crowd

chorus
i play the road
and the highway is our song
and every citys like the same three chords
been helping us along when the storys told
and the crowd has come and gone
shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

well the bus it is our steeple
it brings us to the people
and they will be there waiting
dancing young and old
and every one of us gets tired
but every one remains inspired
and every one of us require
to keep picking through our souls

chorus
i play the road
and the highway is our song
and every citys like the same three chords
been helping us along when the storys told
and the crowd has come and gone
shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

bridge
she says daddy where do you go
when you leave me all these nights
with a suitcase and guitar in your hand
kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile
where do you go
daddy where do you go
chorus
i play the road
and the highway is our song
and every citys like the same three chords
been helping us along when the storys told
and the crowd has come and gone
shaking off the miles and trying to make it home

outro
shaking off the miles
shaking off the miles
mile after mile
mile after mile
baby im coming home1embed"
