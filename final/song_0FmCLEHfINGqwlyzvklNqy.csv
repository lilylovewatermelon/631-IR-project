sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

verse 3 ludacris
stop drop kaboom baby rub on your nipples
some call me ludacris some call me mr wiggles
far from little make ya mammary glands jiggle
got em under control with a bowl of tender vittles
doctor giggles i cant stop until it tickles
just play a little d and ill make ya mouth dribble
bits and kibbles got em all after the pickle
i swing it like a bat but these balls are not wiffle
hit em in triples with no strikes stripes or whistles
i aint felt this good since my wood lived off a thistle
sippin some ripple i got quarters dimes and nickels
for shizzle dizzle im on a track with the big snoop dizzle
let the henny trickle down the beat with a ghetto tempo
i done blazed the instrumental laid it plain and simple
getting brain in the rental i done did it again
