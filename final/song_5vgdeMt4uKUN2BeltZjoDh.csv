hey boy stop pacing round the room
using other peoples faces as a mirror for you
i know your lungs need filling
since your gums have lost their feeling
but dont say that youre givin it up again
do you have a card
my irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself
its just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
from being just and givin it up givin it up

chorus
and youre the only thing thats going on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i dont have the capacity for fuckin
youre meant to be helpin me
when i said i liked it better without my money i lied
it took a little while to recognize that i im not givin it up again

verse 2
this conversations not about reciprocation no more
but im gon wait until you finish so i can talk some more
about me and my things my car my living
and how im givin it up givin it up again

chorus
and youre the only thing thats goin on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i dont have the capacity for fuckin
youre meant to be helpin me
when i said i liked it better without my money i lied
it took a little while to recognize that i im not givin it up again

oh the kick wont last for long but the song only lasts three minutes
i think ive lost my phone so wont you call it up for me
oh the kick wont last for long but the song only lasts three minutes
and i know its wrong but give me one

chorus
and youre the only thing thats going on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i dont have the capacity for fuckin
youre meant to be helpin me
when i said i liked it better without my money i lied
it took a little while to recognize that i im not givin it up again

outro
im not givin it up im not givin it up
im not givin it up im not givin it up
im not givin it up givin it up
im not givin it up givin it up47embed"
