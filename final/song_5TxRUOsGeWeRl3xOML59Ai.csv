dont get green skin green skin keep contact keep contact
dont say goodbye smell you later later
nah i cant
i dont want to end this season on a bad episode nigga nah
bouncing off things and you dont know how you fall
your power is drained so you cannot go through walls
youre caught in this matrix dont know where you play it
you hate it it could be your favorite if you make it your friend
