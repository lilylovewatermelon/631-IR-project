im a 50 hour paycheck

shower in between the two
let it ride kinda guy
cause i got my
angels workin overtime

punchin that time clock
wearin them wings off
wishin i was someone else

daddys been saying
son how the hell you get by
cause i got my
angels workin overtime

verse 2
i got some bar stool best friends
little off the deep end
thats my kinda crowd
a little rough around the edges
get a little reckless
might get a little too loud
but well be fine
with our angels workin overtime
