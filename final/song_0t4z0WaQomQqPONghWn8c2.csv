woah…

verse 1
not everyone can be like me and michael
the only problem is forgetting which side youre on
so you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
like all the rest but they cant find out

interlude
woah…

verse 2
in every scene its me and michael
imaginary bombs raining down from the clouds
so it seems the danger signs will never let the feelings die
when all the best and brightest have gone

chorus
me and michael woah…
solid as they come woah…
me and michael woah…
its not a question now woah…
me and michael woah…
solid as they come woah…
me and michael woah…
its not a question now woah…

verse 3
binary stars sink like the setting sun
too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
so you think the losing side would never break dividing lines
but sanctity wasnt in doubt

chorus
me and michael woah… solid as they come woah…
me and michael woah… its not a question now woah…
its me and michael woah… solid as they come woah…
me and michael woah… its not a question now woah…
me and michael woah woah…
