strictly outta curiosity
what would happen if you got with me
kissin you would hit the spot with me
come on skip a couple rocks with me

prechorus
give me any of your heart tonight
aint no reason that we need to be apart tonight
i got something we can start tonight
lookin at you girl its hard to fight

chorus
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby theyre fixed on you
in your snapback
tshirt of your favourite rock band
checkin your makeup in my ray bans
breakin hearts like only you can
in your snapback

come on baby shoot a smile at me
midnight selfie on a balcony
a little somethin for my lock screen
youre burnin a hole in my pocket
and weve got the beat lets drop it

chorus
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby theyre fixed on you
in your snapback
tattoos cutoffs and converse
singin along to the song with the wrong words
every move you make baby it works
in your snapback
woahohohoh

chorus
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby theyre fixed on you
