wha
uh
lets see if you a rider
lets see if you a rider
that sounds clean

prechorus
hey
lets see if you a rider for real
i dont know if you a rider for real
ima fight for your love survival for real
uhhuh

chorus
lets see if you a rider for real
i really wanna see if you a rider for real
dont think just cause you grip the wheel
makes you a straightup rider for real
i dont know i dont know
if i should give you the key to my soul
i dont know no i dont know
my paranoia and insecurities hold me close

verse 1
lay me down to sleep with my casket closed
nail it shut make sure not to leave a thing exposed
i dont know oh i dont know
blonde hair dont care please dont leave me froze
stuffed cigarillos and percs keep me whole
shouldve shot it in the head — words from my bro
but anything for romance ima risk it all
oh oh

i really wanna see if you a rider for real
dont think just cause you grip the wheel
makes you a straightup rider for real
i dont know i dont know
if i should give you the key to my soul
i dont know no i dont know
my paranoia and insecurities hold me close

verse 2
im codeine cobain ima pour a four
i dont do cocaine but its perc in my nose
i suffer from excessive roadrage
take my life and crash it into this ho
it dont matter you can have my heart
kill me faster whats mine is yours
on a platter i watched you grab that dagger
shes a stabber
but is she a rider
or is she poison a viper
she gets me high as supplier and im on fire
will she be my firefighter

chorus
lets see if you a rider for real
i really wanna see if you a rider for real
dont think just cause you grip the wheel
makes you a straightup rider for real
i dont know i dont know
if i should give you the key to my soul
i dont know no i dont know
my paranoia and insecurities hold me close18embed"
