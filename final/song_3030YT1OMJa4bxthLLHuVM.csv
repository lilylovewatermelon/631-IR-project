theres a whole nother conversation going on
in a parallel universe
where nothing breaks and nothing hurts
theres a waltz playin frozen in time
blades of grass on tiny bare feet
i look at you and youre lookin at me

chorus
could you beam me up
give me a minute i dont know what id say in it
id probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face
beam me up
let me be lighter im tired of being a fighter
i think a minutes enough
just beam me up

verse 2
saw a blackbird soarin in the sky
barely a breath i caught one last sight
tell me that was you sayin goodbye
there are times i feel the shiver and cold
it only happens when im on my own
thats how you tell me im not alone

chorus
could you beam me up
give me a minute i dont know what id say in it
id probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face
beam me up
let me be lighter im tired of being a fighter
i think a minutes enough
just beam me up
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likebridge
in my head i see your baby blues
i hear your voice and i i break in two
and now theres one of me with you
so when i need you can i send you a sign
ill burn a candle and turn off the lights
ill pick a star and watch you shine

chorus
just beam me up
give me a minute i dont know what id say in it
id probably just stare happy just to be there holding your face
beam me up
let me be lighter im tired of being a fighter
i think a minutes enough
beam me up

outro
beam me up
beam me up
