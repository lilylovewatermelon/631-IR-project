in any other world
you could tell the difference
and let it all unfurl
into broken remnants

prechorus 1
smile like you mean it
and let yourself let go

chorus
cause its all in the hands of a bitter bitter man
say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in
take a bow play the part of a lonely lonely heart
say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in

to the world you thought you lived in

verse 2
i tried to live alone
but lonely is so lonely alone
so human as i am
i had to give up my defences

prechorus 2
so i smiled and tried to mean it
to let myself let go
