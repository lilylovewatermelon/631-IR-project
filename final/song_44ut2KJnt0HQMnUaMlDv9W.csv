verse 1 eminem  lesley gore
girl i think you just mightve tried to pull a motherfuckin fast one im mad
you just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one i had
does this look like an arcade tryna play games see this saw blade
see this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway better cooperate
or get sauteed and rotisseried while youre hogtied
mcs get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin dog whistle when i walk by
colt seavers on a mule stuntin on that ass like the fuckin fall guy
i dont gas my mercedes after midnight i treat it like a mogwai
cause it will turn into a gremlin and run over kids women and men
vrinnvrinn—motor so big you can fit a midget in his engine
bitch give me them digits why you cringin not by the hair on my chinnychinchin
will i spendspend even ten cents on you since when
do you think its gonna cost me a pretty penny shit if i think a pennys pretty
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me eeniemeeniemineymo
