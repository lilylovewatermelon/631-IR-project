reasons why you ran dont make you a good man
yes i understand
you were on time at the wrong time
i was debating but tried and i dont know why
you can act cold on a dime and so outta line

chorus
for you
i’d do anything for you
nail my heart to the ceiling
put my fist through a wall
how come how come i stick around when i break down break down break down
i take the blows like a champion champion champion but i get nothing at all

verse 2
reasons for my hope all make me a big joke
i already know
you were just fine i was just fine
why did we turn a good time to a dark one
i give you a chance but the better man never comes

chorus
for you for you
i’d do anything for you for you for you
nail my heart to the ceiling ceiling ceiling
id put my fist through a wall
how come how come i stick around when i break down break down break down
i take the blows like a champion champion champion but i get nothing at all
but i get nothing at all
but i get nothing at all
