verse 1
chaos — its just the beginning
every promise i made im rescinding
center mass in the middle of the monster
im getting tired of drowning the constant
cry for help — its debatable
the only reason that you love me is im hated by all
come on — come see dysfunction
i guess were gonna leave it open for discussion
who am i where am i going
maybe im looking in the wrong direction
maybe im looking for any direction

hook 1
this is not my war — this is not my fight
this is something more — this is not my life
this is not my revolution
this is not my convolution
this is not my expectation
this is not my desperation

verse 2
holed up scarred and tamed for the hell of it
look at me — i am the glorified malcontent
save me save this
all i gotta do is give up and all is forgiven
im sick of — being the butt of a cosmic joke
and i dont get the punchline
a million people lined up for miles
to see the great big mouth shut up and apologize
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likehook 2
this is not my war — this is not my fight
this is something more — this is not my life
this is not my revolution
this is not my convolution
this is not my only reason to question why
today i said goodbye

chorus

oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here

oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here

oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here

bridge
im the pariah break me
i am the liar save me
i can take anything make me
accuse me of everything kill me
cut off the system enslave me
deny my existence erase me
i wont be afraid try me
i wont be unmade free me
so come on — break it off
come on — buy the lie
come on — say it say it
come on
say goodbye
chorus

oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here

oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye
goodbye
oh i didnt need to leave to stay right here
today i said goodbye
