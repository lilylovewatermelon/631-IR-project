dont get it twisted dont get clever
this is the most craziest shit ever

verse 1
okay this is the most craziest shit ever
top of the charts i wish it did feel better
so i take a two this is before i knew
what to do what to do
ah whats that
got a mood and im tripping and my head is a block
collecting all of the symptoms about to call the doc
get a hold of yourself youre acting odd girl
its going on and on and on

prechorus
whats the matter with me
im acting really odd
and i think youd agree there must be something wrong
its going on and on and on and on and on
uhoh uhoh
whats the matter with me
im acting really odd
and i think youd agree there must be something wrong
its going on and on and on and on and on
uhoh uhoh
