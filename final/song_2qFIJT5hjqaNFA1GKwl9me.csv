my dearest angelica
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
i trust youll understand the reference to
another scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
they think me macbeth and ambition is my folly
im a polymath a pain in the ass a massive pain
madison is banquo jeffersons macduff
and birnam wood is congress on its way to dunsinane
you might also likehamiltonangelica
and there you are an ocean away
do you have to live an ocean away
thoughts of you subside
then i get another letter
i cannot put the notion away…

in a letter i received from you two weeks ago

it changed the meaning did you intend this
one stroke and youve consumed my waking days
