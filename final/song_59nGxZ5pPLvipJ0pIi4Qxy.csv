i blew right past that city limit sign
into that little town we used to own
the coop and the quick stop were all boarded up
and those yellow lines faded on the road

prechorus
man i swear i can still hear you singing
like an angel through my chevy stereo
oh every turn every street i drop down a memory
youre everywhere we used to go

chorus
i still look for your car
i still stop at the bar on the weekend drinking too much crown
im still chasing the buzz yeah that used to be us
keeps me up like were still going down
still feeling you like you never said goodbye
like you were mine

verse 2
sometimes this takemeback truck
talks me into burning gas
past your house
a little south where the gravel runs out
but it never brings you back

i still look for your car
i still stop at the bar on the weekend drinking too much crown
im still chasing the buzz yeah that used to be us
keeps me up like were still going down
still feeling you like you never said goodbye
baby like you were mine

prechorus
oh yeah still feels youre mine
man i swear i can still hear you singing
like an angel through my chevy stereo
oh every turn every street i drop down a memory
youre everywhere we used to go

chorus
i still look for your car
i still stop at the bar on the weekend drinking too much crown
im still chasing the buzz yeah that used to be us
keeps me up like were still going down
still feeling you like you never said goodbye
baby like you were mine
yeah it still feels like youre mine
