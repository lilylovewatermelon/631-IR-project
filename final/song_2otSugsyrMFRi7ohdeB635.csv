verse 1
like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding drivers seat
like a face that learned to speak when all it knew was how to bite
like a misery that keeps me focused though ive gone astray
like an endless nightmare that i must awaken from each day
like conviction a premonition not worthy of so i deny i deny

prechorus
i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes i hide and feel it passing me by
i open just in time to say goodbye

chorus
almost like your life almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight and there it went almost like your life

verse 2
like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
like a raging river drowning when i only need a drink
like a poison that i swallow but i want the world to die
like a release from a prison that i didnt know i was in
like a fight to live the past i prayed to leave from way back then
like a general without a mission until the war would start again
start again

i blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
i stitch them up see not my fall from grace
i blind my eyes i hide and feel it passing me by

chorus
almost like your life almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight and there it went almost like your life

bridge
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if you get caught
like a strike from heaven that turns that key
that brings you straight down to your knees
like a touch from hell to feel how hot
that it can get if i get caught
like a strike from heaven to reprieve
that brings you straight down to your knees

chorus
almost like your life almost like your endless fight
curse the day is long realize you dont belong
disconnect somehow never stop the bleeding now
almost like your fight and there it went almost like your life
