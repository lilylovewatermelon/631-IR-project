oh yeah oh yeah alright okay

verse 1
my escape from everything
please say youll be my nothing
and i will give you everything
man you are really something else
you caught me at an awful time
see i just lost my smile
and that is what you helped me find
hadnt seen it in a while
and then you
came to save the day and i must say
i think you may have done some more
god damn you
stay on my mind like all the time
so every night i end up at your door
hope thats cool
cause im really not trying to
impose but i suppose that
im supposed to be here
with you
with eyes as sad as mine i think youll find
you need me just like i need you yeah
you might also likehook
but its cool
we aint gotta be nothing
its true
id actually prefer it yeah
its on you its on you its on you
its on you its on you its on you
its on you its on you its on you
its on you cause im cool

verse 2
and im not even gonna front
at first i was just tryna fuck
but you have got me so in love
so deep in love so please be loved
and im not even gonna lie
i wouldnt mind if we just lie
together till the end of time
if that is fine with you its fine with me
definitely love
definitive love
infinite love yeah
ive been wrong before but this time i am for sure
its you
something you did made me feel it deep in my core
hook
and its cool
