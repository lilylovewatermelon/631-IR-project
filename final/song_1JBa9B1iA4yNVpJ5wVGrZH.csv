hes a stranger to some and a vision to none
he can never get enough get enough of the world
for a fortune hed quit
but its hard to admit how it ends and begins

on his face is a map of the world
a map of the world
on his face is a map of the world
a map of the world

chorus
from yesterday its coming
from yesterday the fear
from yesterday it calls him
but he doesnt want to read the message here

verse 2
on a mountain he sits not of gold but of shit
through the blood he can learn see the life that he took
from a council of one hell decide when hes done
with the innocent

on his face is a map of the world
a map of the world
on his face is a map of the world
a map of the world
