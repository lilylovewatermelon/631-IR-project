fried pickles drunk chicken craw fishing in the creek
wild turkey deer jerky tough as tarzans feet
hot women skinny swimmin barely belly button deep
turn muddy river water into sweet sweet tea
hayloft lovin in the holler behind the house
no doubt about what i love about the south
loretta lynn makers mark thats kentucky as can be
jack daniels dolly parton oh the hills of tennessee
finger pickin bluegrass blowing in the wind around here
we believe the book of john and we drive john deeres
the devil came to georgia mr daniels showed him out
no doubt about it what i love about the south

chorus
what i love about the south
if you need a dixie fix just come on down
thats what i love about the south
southern bells with a drawl
make you stop and drop your jaw
come on yall shut your mouth
thats what i love about the south

verse 2
grew up down here and its where ill grow my kids
old mcdonald had a daughter get her done got her did
corn grows in rows on a cob but it flows from a jar
in a rocky top bar
a little fountain from the mountain
even made the possum shout
thats what i love about the south
