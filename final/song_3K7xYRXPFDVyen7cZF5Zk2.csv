i really hope i can do it
cause theyre all depending on me
i know that i must leave the only home ive ever known
and brave the dangers of the forest
saving them before theyre eaten
i mean how hard can that be

verse 1
looking up at a sunny sky so shiny and blue
and theres a butterfly
well isnt that a super fantastic sign
its gonna be a fantastic day
such marvelousness its gonna bring
gotta pocket full of songs that im gonna sing
and im ready to take on anything hooray
some super fun surprise around each corner
just riding on a rainbow im gonna be okay

chorus
hey im not giving up today
theres nothing getting in my way
and if you knock knock me over
i will get back up again
oh if something goes a little wrong
well you can go ahead and bring it on
cause if you knock knock me over
i will get back up again
whoaohohohohoh get back up again
whoaohohohohoh oh ahh

im marching along ive got confidence
im cooler than a pack of peppermints
and i havent been this excited since
i cant remember when
im off on this remarkable adventure
just riding on a rainbow
what if its all a big mistake
what if its more than i can take
no i cant think that way cause i know
that iâ€™m really really really gonna be okay

chorus
hey im not giving up today
theres nothing getting in my way
and if you knock knock me over
i will get back up again
oh if something goes a little wrong
well you can go ahead and bring it on
cause if you knock knock me over
i will get back up again
get up get up get up
