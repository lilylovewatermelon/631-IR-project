fading so slow black hole
i feel it slipping away
were all weve got
if youre lost i’m diving in after you
i would touch the sun i’d come undone
it’s true i’d fall for you

chorus bright lights
wherever you go whatever you do
you know ill follow you down
wherever you go if ever you lose your ground
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you
down down down down down down

drop

chorus bright lights
wherever you go whatever you do
you know ill follow you down
wherever you go if ever you lose your ground
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you

you’re lost worn out face down
don’t know where you’re headed to
right here right now somehow i
i’ll light the way up for you
i would touch the sun i’d come undone
it’s true i’d fall for you

chorus bright lights
wherever you go whatever you do
you know ill follow you down
wherever you go if ever you lose your ground
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you down
i’ll follow you
down down down down down down

wherever you go
whatever you do
wherever you go
whatever you do

wherever you go whatever you do
you know ill follow you down
wherever you go if ever you lose your ground
i’ll follow you down5embed"
