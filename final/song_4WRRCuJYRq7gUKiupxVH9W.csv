she took down the photograph of our wedding day
ripped it down the middle and threw my half away
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me

verse 2
she broke all my fishing rods put my guns in hock
threw my clothes out in the yard
and changed out all the locks
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me

chorus
i know right where i went wrong
i know just what got her gone
turned my life into this country song
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me

verse 3
she fired up my old hot rod ran it in the pond
put sugar in my john deere
i cant even mow my lawn
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me

she built her a bonfire with my old six string
took all my good whiskey and poured it down the drain
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me

chorus
i know right where i went wrong
i know just what got her gone
turned my life into this country song
and i got nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me
nobody to blame but me
i got nobody to blame but me1embed"
