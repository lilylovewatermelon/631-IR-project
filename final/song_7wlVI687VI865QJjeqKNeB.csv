like a thunder cloud roaring cross the pasture near
light up a lonely smoke i found in a crushed pack on the floor
my heart sinks as the crowed walked by slowly toward the door
winding road and sold out shows are things ive come to love
cause im as free as the wind that flies with lonesome dove
ramblin on with my life like an outlaw from the old
not caring if im pleasing you
cause im cut yeah
im cut from a different mold
i aint got no bills to pay i dont care where im going next
people like to hear me play hell maybe ill get a check
moneys dessert on top of a meal i ate for free
playin for people listening is payment enough for me
winding road and sold out shows are things ive come to love
cause im as free as the wind that flies with lonesome dove
ramblin on with my life like an outlaw from the old
not caring if im pleasing you
cause im cut yeah
im cut from a different mold
yeah
winding road and sold out shows are things ive come to love
im as free as the wind that flies with lonesome dove
ramblin on with my life like an outlaw from the old
not caring if im pleasing you
cause im cut yeah
im cut from a different mold yeahsee whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
