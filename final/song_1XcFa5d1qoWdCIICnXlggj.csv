merrily we fall out of line out of line
i’d fall anywhere with you im by your side
swinging in the rain humming melodies
were not going anywhere until we freeze

prechorus
im not afraid anymore
im not afraid

chorus
forever is a long time
but i wouldnt mind spending it by your side

verse 2
carefully well place for our destiny
you came and you took this heart and set it free
every word you write or sing is so warm to me so warm to me
im torn im torn to be right where you are

prechorus
im not afraid anymore
im not afraid

chorus
forever is a long time
but i wouldnt mind spending it by your side
tell me everyday i get to wake up to that smile
i wouldnt mind it at all
i wouldnt mind it at all
you might also likebridge
you so know me
pinch me gently
i can hardly breathe

chorus
forever is a long long time
but i wouldnt mind spending it by your side
tell me everyday i get to wake up to that smile
i wouldnt mind it at all
i wouldnt mind it at all30embed"
