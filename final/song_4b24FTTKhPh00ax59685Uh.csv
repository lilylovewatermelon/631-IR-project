damn she hurts the morning after
drunk on thinking i could have her
strung her out long like lights on a balcony
come wednesday she dont care
tuesday night i had her here
like beads and feathers it was heaven her hanging on me

chorus
she took me for a ride hit a new high
throwing confetti in her green eyes
trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
she pulled me in a world of wonder
its a charade trying to love her
its like trying to save a soul from mardi gras
from mardi gras

verse 2
trashed my heart just like these streets
her perfumes all over me
just reminded me of a night i cant forget
she paraded me around
swirled eyes not i had a crown on my head till she left
thought shed stay but instead

chorus
she took me for a ride hit a new high
throwing confetti in her green eyes
trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
she pulled me in a world of wonder
its a charade trying to love her
its like trying to save a soul from mardi gras
from mardi gras
from mardi gras
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likebridge
she aint looking for love
no shes just looking for a real good time
and you cant change her weather
shes a hurricane every time

chorus
she took me for a ride hit a new high
throwing confetti in her green eyes
trying like hell to hold the bell of a ball
she pulled me in a world of wonder
its a charade trying to love her
its like trying to save a soul from mardi gras
from mardi gras

outro
from mardi gras
from mardi gras
mardi grasembed"
