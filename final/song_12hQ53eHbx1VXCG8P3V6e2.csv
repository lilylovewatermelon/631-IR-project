sophistafunk aristocats
distinguished dogs clean up your acts
pull up your pants ladies and gents
please act like you got some sense
you know what i really wanna know
where do all the good girls go
what clubs they hang at

chorus andré 3000
behold
a lady
i see you standing on the wall
clap clap you deserve it all
behold candycoated unicorns are
a lady quite hard to find
i see you standing on the wall
the classic lady a rare breed indeed
clap clap you deserve it all
is that make and model discontinued

verse 1 andré 3000
today i might snow tomorrow ill rain
3000s always changing but you stay the same
and i need that
hey i need that in my life
when i feel washed up and inadequate
and throw all my songs away no matter how mad i get
you make me smile you make me smile
you make me smile you make me oh
youre the anchor that holds me down
when my ship is sinking you wont let me drown
and im grateful oh ohohoh ohoh ohoh

behold maybe they disappeared with the dinosaurs
a lady oh but thats such a big bang theory
i see you standing on the wall maybe theyre still around
clap clap you deserve it all
but only to be seen with appreciative eyes
behold maybe they were taken for granted
a lady and lost all their magic
i see you standing on the wall oh how awful
clap clap you deserve it all oh so tragic

verse 2 andré 3000
yo mamas old fashioned yo daddy dont play
youll always be this lovely cause they raised you that way
hallelujah thank ya jesus thank ya lord
thank ya jesus thank ya lord
thank ya jesus thank ya lord
youre not extra extra youre so plain jane
the ying to my yang darlin youve got that thang
and you know it but yet you dont
but yet you dont and thats whats so cool
you dont say too much but when you do its profound
in the street you hold your head high
at home you get low down for me
cant get no lower cant get no lower cant get no lower yeah
oh youre the anchor that holds me down
when my ship is sinking you wont let me drown ahahahah
sad but one day our kids will have to visit museums
to see what a lady looks like
chorus andré 3000
behold so if you find one i beg you hold her tight
a lady yes if you spot one good sir treat her right
i see you standing on the wall benjamin andré signing off

i see you standing on the wall
clap clap you deserve it all
