i met way too many fans in a day

verse
i met way too many fans in a day ayy
snuck too many xans on the way ayy
still be off the shits but i make twentysomething bands before we came ayy
still look at your mans like a stain in 3d it’s really you ayy
i was so surprised that you came ayy
copped me so many demons on the way i’m off a 60 in a coupe
can’t look me in my eyes it’s too late ayy
i spent every penny in a day like houdini what i do
heard too many lies to my face ayy
this ho on my line buildin’ cases i got no reason to prove
heard too many lies in a day ayy
still be off my ass in la i got no reason to lose
yo yo ain’t no more options to do
yo i snuck codeine with me too ayy
i had kicked the cup but that’s a phase ayy
i know where my heart at anyway yo uh ayy
heard too many lies in a day ayy
i snuck half a 30 on a stage vroom demon in a desert ayy
i was high for miles now i ain’t
guess it’s for the better when you came ayy woah woah
ayy ayy heard too many lies in a day ayy
met too many fans in a day whoa uh
i made twentysomething bands before we came
still look at your mans like a stain whoa ayy
heard too many lies in a day
ayy ayy ayy
i met way too many fans in a dayyou might also likeembed"
