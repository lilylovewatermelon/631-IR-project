when we were coming down they said it was too soon
i never had to lie no no no no
when we were coming down they left us all alone
were headed nowhere nowhere
i know youve been around i feel you in and out
how are you do you sleep are you with me
we used to be unspoken
now everything is broken im a good son
youre a good son
youre a good son oh
youre a good son
oh youre a good son

verse 1 childish gambino
arlanda hotel to the bar
young girl with an accent with her back bent
ass out to the whole world
we can vibe out for the night
stepping outside for a light
no coke and i just smoke vapor no papers
slow poke and i dont know bout photos
lets go though
how old are you
saying that you never date older dudes
why i never wanna say no to you
the coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
the coldest dude who cant hold his goose woo
ima walk out wanna walk too
what about dude
fuck him i just really wanna feel something

it took me like five minutes to figure out
like where the voice memos were on the phone
but i figured it out
okay so can we just–

chorus kilo kish

is it real cause youre online
is it real cause youre online
is it real cause youre online

verse 2 childish gambino
heathen its a struggle just to keep breathing
existential asthmatic puff puff pass addict
craftmatic making moves but they sleeping on me
we can kick it like its fifa homie
nevertheless i got that fresh like it was crest
grind cause im stressed
tmj or tmi its a lie that youre living
i never understood the hate on a nigga preference
when every marriage is a samesex marriage
same sex everyday monotonous
lost god never pray forgotten us
lost love never say it just like our parents
too much power aint enough power
brain splattered like ive fallen off a watch tower
and anybody can walk into any dennys
and wait til im walkin in it
with a gun that they 3d printed and finish it
kinison said if you gon miss heaven why do it by two inches
old money and new bitches
old money and new bitches
outro
getting next level in a hotel
aint shit that we don’t need nigga oh well
