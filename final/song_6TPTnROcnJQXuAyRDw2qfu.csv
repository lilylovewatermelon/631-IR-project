looks like ive been crying again over the same thing
i wonder if anyone has ever cried for me
nothing means anything at least anymore
even my tears have gone room temperature

chorus
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more

verse 2
i was sitting here last year the same time ago
still wearing the same thing these arent even my clothes
i just dont change that much cause whos to impress
theres nobody around when im at my best

chorus
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more

instrumental interlude

chorus
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more
i should get out more i should get out more
