verse 1
i used to trap flip we doin’ shit you imagine ayy
ran up at saks fifth i spent a brick on the fashion
my body different thats all she could say when we kick it
i just seen the opps had them dodgin and dippin
popped a perc and that shit had me trippin ayy
run up ayy run up i get you done up
i aint trustin a soul that’s a set up
told lil’ bro let off shots never let up
if they slip then we slide get wet up
you aint really outside then shut up
no you can’t sit with the gang gotta get up
pull up with gang we got fifty or better ayy
fuck around make it hot in december
i know my heart cold i was born in the winter
and this ice on my neck make em shiver
told lil mama come fuck with a winner
had my shooters pull up in the sprinter
boy you food then we lookin for dinner
they can’t see in this whip cause its tinted
im smokin on dope this is not for beginners ayy

verse 2

cause they said that we cant get the grip in
no feelin john gon cook up the beat ima kill it
i cant fuck with the fake im the realest
big ebk shoot your shot then we dippin
ayy boy we steppin
if he move incorrect i correct him
he get popped like a quiz when we test him
rap with the opps we throw shots at the session
ayy thats impressive
rubber band on the clip ima stretch em
rubber band on the bread when i check it
drop me the addy i bet i address it
ayy never stress it
just make sure that i get all my credit
we treat bullets like butter we spread it
all over blocks tell the opps that we blooded
ayy never said it
choppa burnin like usher i let it
if he beef with the gang aint no dead it
it aint no peace with the gang thats a lesson ayy
chorus
we gettin chicken chicken
thats the reason why shes splittin lickin ayy
you know they dont love you hey
they just tryna get the riches ayy
get it huh flip it if he talkin down ima lift it
niggas participatin in snitchin
you cant take the heat better get out the kitchen3embed"
