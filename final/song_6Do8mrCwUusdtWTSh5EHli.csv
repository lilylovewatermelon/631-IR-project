i dont care about expensive things
cashmere coats diamond rings
dont mean a thing
all i care about is love
thats what im here for thats whats hes here for
i dont care for wearing silk cravats
ruby studs satin spats
dont mean a thing
all i care about is love all he cares about is love
gimme two eyes of blue
softly saying i need you
let me see her standing there
and honest mister im a millionaire
i dont care for any fine attire
vanderbilt might admire
no no not me
all i care about is love
all he cares about is love
thats what hes here for
all he cares about is love

show me long raven hair
flowing down bout to there
when i see her running free
keep your money thats enough for me
i dont care for driving packard cars
or smoking long buck cigars
no no not me
all i care about is
doing the guy in
whos picking on you
twisting the wrist
thats turning the screw

all i care about is love all he cares about is loveembed"
