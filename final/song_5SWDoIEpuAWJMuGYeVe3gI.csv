wait wont you wait for me
dont you bathe in rivers
dont you feel alive
and when i see you waking up
and it sends me shivers
how you love like weapons kill

chorus
so take aim
at me for once
just take aim
break me apart

verse 2
call wont you call out my name
like a curse on this world
like a battle cry
and you make me hate myself
make me tear my body
make me yearn for your embrace

chorus
so take aim
at me for once
just take aim
break me apart love
wont you
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeoutro
and you know ill be yours
when the moment is perfect
i will fire and forget till we both lay broken
and you know ill be yours
just want to be worth it
i will run like the wind till you follow me againembed"
