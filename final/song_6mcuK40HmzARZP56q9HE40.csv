im a simple man aint no other way to say it
lay my cards on the table only way i play it
i got some draw in my yall they cant imitate it
tough and rowdy reckless
rough around the edges

prechorus
ever since you came around ive been
thinking thoughts that i need to get out so i
i grabbed a pen and a napkin and i wrote this down

chorus
my tractors green my pastures greener
my tea is sweet but honey youre sweeter
my road is dirt your heart is gold
im a man of few words but baby here it goes
my neck is red my collars blue
and i love you

verse 2
yeah i know it might sound a little elementary
like a nursery rhyme straight up from the country
it wont pass for shakespeare girl i know it
but ima pour my heart out like a back porch poet
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
my tractors green my pastures greener
my tea is sweet but honey youre sweeter
my road is dirt your heart is gold
im a man of few words but baby here it goes
my neck is red my collars blue
and i love you

bridge
yeah i love your pretty smile
i love your skinny jeans
i love the fact that you fell for a good ol boy like me
i love your long kiss
and i love your long hair
i wanna shout it out from the town square
that i love you
i love you i love you

chorus
yeah my tractors green my pastures greener
my tea is sweet but honey youre sweeter
my road is dirt your heart is gold
im a man of few words but baby here it goes
my neck is red my collars blue

yeah i love your pretty smile
i love your skinny jeans
i love the fact that you fell for a good ol boy like me
i love your long kiss
and i love your long hair
i wanna shout it out from the town square
that i love you
i love you i love you
