november of  43
on a boat coming across the sea
he left a boy came back a man
she started running when she saw his face
itd been 655 days
since she held his hand
he got down on one knee
and pulled out that ring
that he bought in aberdeen
and when it hit that new york sky

chorus
it shined just like a spotlight
a star up in the night sky
the kind of thing that takes your breath away
her eyes sparked like that diamond
with love beaming from them
the kind of light thats never going to fade
its going to shine

verse 2
for the next 55 years
through the laughter and the tears
my grandma always fore that band
through atom bombs and a baby boom
dr king and a man on the moon
no it never left her hand
on the day she passed away
mama put it on a chain
now and then on special days
mom would wear it around her neck

verse 3
mama said one of these days
id know why she gave me that ring
sitting here i know she was right
oh its knot the biggest stone youve ever seen
but girl i can promise you one thing
the rest of your life

its going to shine just like a spotlight
a star up in the night sky
the kind of thing that takes your breath away
your eyes sparkled like that diamond
with love beaming from them
the kind of light thats never never never going to fade
its going to shine shine shine
shine shine shine
shine shine shine
like a beacon calling me home
its going to shine
oh yeah shine shine shineembed"
