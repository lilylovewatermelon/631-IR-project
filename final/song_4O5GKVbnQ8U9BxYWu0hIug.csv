will you join me in this dance this dance of misery
cradled in imposs impossibility
swooning i am swept away
swept off my feet with step by step by step
we take the lead as drop by drop we start to bleed

chorus
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
oh we dance in misery
all lost in the arms of our misery oh
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
swept off our feet by misery were swept into the shadows

verse 2

let me hide within your black the still inside your eyes
deafened caught within a cry
so sensual as step by step by step i separate
as breath to breath i suffocate

chorus
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
oh we dance in misery
all lost in the arms of our misery oh
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
swept off our feet by misery were swept into the shadows

as we dance we all dance
we all have no chance in this horrid romance

guitar solo

chorus
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
oh we dance in misery
all lost in the arms of our misery oh
oh we dance in misery
and we dance on and we dance on
swept off our feet by misery were swept into the shadows
swept off our feet by misery were swept into the shadows
