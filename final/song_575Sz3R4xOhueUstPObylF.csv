i love the way you look at me
i feel the pain you place inside
you lock me up inside your dirty cage
while im alone inside my mind
i like to teach you all the rules
i get to see them set in stone
i like it when you chain me to the bed
but then your secrets never show

chorus
i need to feel you
you need to feel me
i cant control you
youre not the one for me no
i cant control you
you cant control me
i need to feel you
so whys there even

verse 2
i love the way you rake my skin
i feel the hate you place inside
i need to get your voice out of my head
cause im that guy youll never find
i think you know all of the rules
theres no expressions on your face
i hope that someday you will let me go
release me from my dirty cage

you cant control me
i need to feel you
so whys there even
you and me

i love the way you look at me

i have control of you
i love the way you look at me
