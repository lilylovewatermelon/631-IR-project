champagne glass of blood and wine
on chocolate hearts alone i dine
candles weeping waxen tears
ten four roses each one a year
disappear yeah

verse 2
arrows fester in my heart
each memory another dart
love and death both colored red
showing my past the dream is dead
dream is dead yeah

chorus
another lonely valentines day
i cant believe that things turned out this way
and though i hate to see you go
i know it must be so
another lonely valentines day

bridge
nobody will break your fall
all for one yeah none for all
nothings so cruel as the truth
join the festival of fools
nobody will break your fall
all for one yeah none for all
nothing so cruel as the truth
join the festival of fools
