is there anyone who ever remembers
changing their mind from the paint on a sign
is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank at all
for something someone yelled real loud one time

prechorus
oh everyone believes
in how they think it ought to be
oh everyone believes
and theyre not going easily

verse 2
belief is a beautiful armor
but makes for the heaviest sword
like punching underwater
you never can hit who youre trying for
some need the exhibition
and some have to know they tried
its the chemical weapon for the war thats ragin on inside

prechorus
oh everyone believes
from emptiness to everything
oh everyone believes
and no ones going quietly

were never going to win the world
were never going to stop the war
were never going to beat this if belief is what were fighting for
were never going to win the world
were never going to stop the war
were never going to beat this if belief is what were fighting for

verse 3
is there anyone you can remember
ever surrendered with their life on the line

chorus
were never going to win the world
were never going to stop the war
were never going to beat this if belief is what were fighting for
were never going to win the world
were never going to stop the war
were never going to beat this if belief is what were fighting for

outro
what puts a hundred thousand children in the sand
belief can belief can
what puts the folded flag inside his mothers hand
