ive been having strange dreams
seeing ghosts and breaking things
rooms on fire as i sit and watch it melt around me
ive been hosting screenings
of slightly altered movie scenes
seems familiar til i realize that they look just like me

prechorus lizzy mcalpine
where am i i cant find the door
how long have i been here for
where the houses all can talk
and i dont mind the creaky floors

chorus lizzy mcalpine
and now were in a basement
i feel wasted and im sure
that youll kiss me anyway
thatll be just the thing to wake me

postchorus lizzy mcalpine
maybe im weird or maybe im off the wall
but maybe its weirder not to have dreamed at all

verse 2 laura elliott
i can walk through walls now
quietly i roam the halls
suddenly im ten feet tall and i can touch the ceiling
i think i scared you off now
im regretting getting close hoping
it was just a ghost that sorta looked just like you
you might also likeprechorus laura elliott
where am i i cant find the door
how long have i been here for
where the houses all can talk
and i dont mind the creaky floors

chorus laura elliott
and now im in a maze
down in this basement and im sure
that youll miss me anyway
thatll be just the thing to wake me

but maybe its weirder not to have dreamed at all
