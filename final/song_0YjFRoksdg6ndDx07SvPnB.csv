never want to be apart
never want to be apart
i’m not gonna break my heart now
want to be together
want to make it better
i never want to be apart
i just want to be in love
and never break your heart
girl can we just stay together
practice lust forever
practice what you love
if i ever tear your love
it’s because i’m scared of losing
scared of losing you
i’m not tryna break us up
i’m delicate enough
i wanna be with you
i never want to be apart
i just wanna be in love and never break your heart
girl can we just stay together
practice lust forever
