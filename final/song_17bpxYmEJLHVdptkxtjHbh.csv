my my cold hearted child
tell me how you feel
just a blade in the grass
a spoke unto the wheel

my my cold hearted child
tell me where its all gone
oh the luster of your bones
those arms that held you strong

chorus
ive been worrying
that my time heres a little unclear
ive been worrying
that im losing the ones i hold dear
ive been worrying
that we all
live our lives
in the confines of fear

verse 2
my my cold hearted child
tell me how you feel
just a grain in the morning air
dark shadow on the hill
see ben howard liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likemy my cold hearted child
tell me where it all falls tell me where it all falls
this apathy you feel
will make a fool of us all

chorus
ive been worrying
that my time heres a little unclear
ive been worrying
that im losing the ones i hold dear
ive been worrying
that we all
live our lives
in the confines of fear

oh i will become what i deserve
ive been worrying my time is a little unclear
oh i will become what i deserve
