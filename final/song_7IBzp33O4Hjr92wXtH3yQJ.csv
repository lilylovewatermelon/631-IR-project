ive been here before
this miseensc√®ne reminds me
of all my mistakes
and i know its not too late

bridge
to set adrift
on a new path
and move further away
from my former self every day

chorus
ill find my way in time in time
ill find my way in time in time

outro
i know its not too late
i know its not too late
i know its not too late
i know its not too lateyou might also like1embed"
