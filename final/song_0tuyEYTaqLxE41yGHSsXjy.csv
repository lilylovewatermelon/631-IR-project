i asked her to stay
but she wouldnt listen
and she left before i had the chance to say oh
the words that would mend
the things that were broken
but now its far too late shes gone away

prechorus
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe that

chorus
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you

verse 2
the taste of her breath
ill never get over
the noises that she made kept me awake oh
the weight of the things
that remained unspoken
built up so much it crushed us every day
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeprechorus
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe that

chorus
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
oh woahoh
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
oh woahoh

bridge
of all the things i felt but never really showed
perhaps the worst is that i ever let you go
i should not ever let you go ohohoh

chorus
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
oh woahoh
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
outro
and i wont go home without you
and i wont go home without you
and i wont go home without you18embed"
