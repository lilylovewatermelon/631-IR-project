you hang around for a living
somewhere between all the land and the sky
being by never forgiving
nobody knows you and neither do i

verse 2
birds may believe at a distance
you wear a grin and keep perfectly still
driven away with persistence
i wonder if they have wondered or will ever wonder
ever wonder

verse 3
farmer jim hums when hes all alone
he may imagine you heard and he knew
you wouldnt hear what he might have known
i wonder whether he wonders if you ever wonder
ever wonder

chorus
oh scarecrow maybe the wind knows
whether you wonder whos calling your name
scarecrow maybe the wind knows
whether you wonder if you are to blame

mother earths love whispered to me and it wasnt her fault
real is a feeling and feeling is real
all of you are flowing through me
but you wouldnt know how to fathom or feel when the wind blows
the wind knows the wind knows

chorus
oh scarecrow maybe the wind knows
whether you wonder whos calling your name
shame how nobody knows you
only who wonders if you are to blame

bridge
saving the grain of your golden domain
without even reasoning why
the crows seem to know where you need them to go
igniting a spark in their minds
so they circle and fly
fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly fly

verse 5
you hang around for a living
blown in the wind like a pinned butterfly
monarch of ever forgiving
some of us wonder if you wanna die
would you wanna die
outro
how i wonder ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder
ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder
ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder
ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder ever wonder
the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows
the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows
the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows
the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows
the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows the wind knows
the wind knows the wind knows4embed"
