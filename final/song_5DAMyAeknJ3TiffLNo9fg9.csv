i am all alone this time around
sometimes on the side i hear a sound
places parallel i know its you
feel the little pieces bleeding through

chorus
and on and on this goes on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on this goes on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
and on

verse 2
now that ive decided not to stay
i can feel me start to fade away
everything is back where it belongs
i will be beside you before long

chorus
and on and on this goes on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on
and on and on this goes on
and on and on
and on and on
and on and on
