why wont you call me
stephen why wont you call me

verse 1
i saw you in your tightass rocker pants you saw me too
i laughed cause i was completely trashed
and i watched your ugly girlfriend sneer across the room
as if i really care that shes here with you
all i know is youre my object of affection
my drug of choice my sick obsession oh

verse 2
ive got guys waiting in a line
for me to play my evil girly games with all their minds
just watch me ive got it down to a simple art
just bat my eyes like this and theres a broken heart
but somehow you turned the tables what the hell
i can charm the pants off anyone else but you
