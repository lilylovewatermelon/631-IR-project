baby baby when we first met
i never felt something so strong
you were like my lover and my best friend
all wrapped into one with a ribbon on it
and all of a sudden you went and left
i didnt know how to follow
its like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
i feel so empty and hollow

prechorus rihanna
and ill never give myself to another the way i gave it to you
dont even recognize the ways you hurt me do you
its gonna take a miracle to bring me back
and youre the one to blame

chorus rihanna
and now i feel like oh youre the reason why im thinking
i dont wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
i guess thats what i get for wishful thinking
i shouldve never let you enter my door
next time you wanna go on and leave
i should just let you go on and do it do it
cause now im using like i bleed

postchorus rihanna
its like i checked into rehab
and baby youre my disease
its like i checked into rehab
and baby youre my disease
i gotta check into rehab
cause baby youre my disease
i gotta check into rehab
cause baby youre my disease

damn aint it crazy when youre love swept
youll do anything for the one you love
cause anytime that you needed me id be there

in a different way that i was using you
but now that i know its not meant to be
you gotta go i gotta wean myself off of you

prechorus rihanna
