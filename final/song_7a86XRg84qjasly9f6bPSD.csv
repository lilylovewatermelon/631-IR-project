give me a second i i need to get my story straight
my friends are in the bathroom getting
higher than the empire state
my lover she is waiting for me just across the bar
my seats been taken by some sunglasses askin bout a scar and
i know i gave it to you months ago
i know youre tryin to forget
but between the drinks and subtle things
the holes in my apologies
you know im tryin hard to take it back

prechorus nate ruess
so if by the time the bar closes
and you feel like fallin down
ill carry you home

chorus nate ruess
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

now i know that im not all that you got
i guess that i i just thought
maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
but our friends are back so lets raise a toast
cause i found someone to carry me home

chorus nate ruess
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun
