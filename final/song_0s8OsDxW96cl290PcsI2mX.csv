to this world im unimportant
just because i have nothing to give
so you call this your free country
tell me why it costs so much to live
tell me why

prechorus
this world can turn me down
but i won’t turn away oh no
i won’t turn around

verse 2
all my work and endless measures
never seem to get me very far
walk a mile just to move an inch now
even though im trying so damn hard
im trying so hard

chorus
this world can turn me down
but i won’t turn away
and i won’t duck and run
cause im not built that way
when everything is gone
there is nothing there to fear
this world cannot bring me down
no cause im already here

oh no i am already here
down on my knees
i am already here on no
im already here
i must have told you a thousand times
im not running away

bridge
i won’t duck and run
i won’t duck and run
i won’t duck and run
no i wont pass away

chorus
this world can turn me down
but i won’t turn away
and i won’t duck and run
cause im not built that way
when everything is gone
there is nothing there to fear
this world cannot bring me down
no cause im already here
this world can turn me down
but i won’t turn away
and i won’t duck and run
cause im not built that way
when everything is gone
there is nothing there to fear
this world cannot bring me down
no cause im already here2embed"
