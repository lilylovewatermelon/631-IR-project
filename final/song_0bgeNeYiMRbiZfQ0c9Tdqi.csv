how how am i supposed to feel
when everything surrounding me
is nothing but a fake disguise
i dont know
i dont know where i belong
its time for me to carry on
ill say goodbye

chorus
i cant stop the rain from fallin
im drownin in these tears i cry
since you left without a warning
i face the dawn with sleepless eyes
no i cant go on go on
when clouds are pushin down on me boy
i cant stop i cant stop the rain
from fallin

drop mainfield
