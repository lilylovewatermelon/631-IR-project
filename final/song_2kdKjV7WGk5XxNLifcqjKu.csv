i know you wanna make up for last time
ill let you know when its alright
i know you feel like youve fallen behind
but youve been right by my side

ohhh i bet you think that youre my lifesaver
i just want to let you know
im glad to finally see you go

verse 2
this is how you know
when youre feelin out of place
when your palms are sweaty
and dont know what to say
think that theyre all judging
but feel the same way
they just want to be free
so open up their cage
and do em a favor
yeah aye oh tell em tell em tell em
