i hope im not getting too sentimental
but tonight might be something special
all the drugs were fundamental in
getting us on that level so we say

chorus
hell yeah motherfucking right
tonight is a good night
to start the rest of our lives
so we toast to the stars in the sky
as they
disappear deep into your eyes

verse 2
you gotta fake it til you make it
ive accepted it and embraced it thats why
were so heavily medicated
but somehow speak in the same language cause we say

chorus

bridge
i love you and
i want you to know that
the drugs are working
are they working for you or against you cause
i hope we dont get lost in translation
because id rather get lost in a moment with you
and have love sensations

ladies and gentleman please remain seated as the seat belt sign
is illuminated thank you1embed"
