and all the nights they wander on by
now i just sit here and wonder why oh no
i cant keep up with my own life oh

but in my dreams i see a lady
a river runs through her its okay
but in my mind im not okay
and all these thoughts i cant erase oh

my brother found god at the bottom of a bottle
i lost my way home you think that i can call you
mother how are you doing im sorry that i left you
im tryna find my way i promise that ill be home soon
woah yeah

and i put my faith in my own hands see where i go
oh i threw my fears into the ocean
hoping that theyd be washed away
be washed away

and i
i found a little peace in my own mind
my own mind woah

but in my dreams i see a lady
a river runs through her its okay
but in my mind im not okay
and all these thoughts i cant erase woah
but in my dreams i see a lady
a river runs through her its okay
but in my mind im not okay
and all these thoughts i cant erase no
