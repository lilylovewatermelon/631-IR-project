i burn with desire each time my heart fans the fire
to that old flame that burns inside of me
she cried when i left her now i cry to forget her
oh how foolish i was to ever want to leave

chorus
cause nobody in his right mind wouldve left her
i had to be crazy to say goodbye
nobody in his right mind wouldve left her
even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

verse 2
i still carry her picture i wish her well with the new love
i know shes found by now
each night finds me dreaming each day i spend thinking
how much i wish she was still around

chorus
cause nobody in his right mind wouldve left her
i had to be crazy to say goodbye
nobody in his right mind wouldve left her
even my heart was smart enough to stay behind

outro
even my heart was smart enough to stay behindsee george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeembed"
