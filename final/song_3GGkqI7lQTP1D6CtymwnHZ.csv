everyone hates me but nobody knows me
where did the time go could somebody show me
get in and ride slow you know where im going
back of the club girl your feelings are showing
how can i not stare the way that youre glowing
i am a nightmare you dont wanna know me
running my fingers through your hair makes me remember everything
why dont you hate me

chorus
ill be the first there
and ill be the last there
im not gonna last here
im not gonna last long
i will be right here
ill buy you a flight here
ill give you a night here
we gotta move on

running my fingers through your hair makes me remember everything
why dont you hate me
