is there a word or right to say
even in this oldfashioned way
go make your move girl im not coming home
would things have changed if i couldve stayed
would you have loved me either way
dressed to the blues day to day with my collar up
decision sits so make it quick
a breath inhaled from an air so sick
i cursed the day that i learned of the web you spun
you had your hold til bleeding

prechorus
hey hey if it was up to me
i wouldve figured you out
way before the year clocked out
oh i hope youre waiting
hey hey if it was up to me
i wouldve never walked out
so until the sun burns out
oh i hope youre waiting

verse 2
would we have lived as a child would care
with this vial to drink i dare
only to cry all alone with your taste on tongue
oh where have you been oh where have you been
oh where have you been if it hurts to be forgiving bye
should we try this again with hope bye bye
or is it lost give up the ghost
and should i die all alone as i knew i would
then burn in hell young sinner
