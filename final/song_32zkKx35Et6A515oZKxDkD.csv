daddy was dumb said that id be something special
brought me up tough but i was a gentle human
said that he loved each of my two million freckles
when i grew up was gonna be a superstar

prechorus 1
i cant get a job so i live with my mum
i take her money but not quite enough
i sit in the car and i listen to static
she said i look fat but i look fantastic

chorus
cut  back down to my knees
gotta get back gotta get free
cut back down to my knees
lean back now lean back and breathe
cut back down to my knees
gotta get back gotta get free
cut back down to my knees
lean back now lean back and breathe
