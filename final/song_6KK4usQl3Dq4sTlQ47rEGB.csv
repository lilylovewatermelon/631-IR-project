real u and titan showing what we are
they say we second hand
in other words we amateurs by far
stupid
they never heard me write these bars
my flow is so unique like i’m driving a space car

from saint helena i rap to the masses in jostina
and even in cape town we repping yeshua

my rhymes take five minutes on a computer
their rhymes take five days
like they writing some urban scripture

illuminati and bugati that stuff will make you worry
they say thats what you need to be like everybody

i dont care about the tv i dont care if you see me
my song will be on radio and i will make that music video

a year of unashamed now a year of making him proud
a year of standing up for everything these christians allowed

im so sagacious i even try and challenge
a world of atheists
yet while they denying me i let them know
where the real victor is thats the guy with the victory
the king with all the royalty the one thats on the throne
from the cross letting me rap with all this authority
you might also likeim prince uriel nathan like you see in galatians 4
and tweet my matric partner at tshepiroyalty more

i am an underground king no matter what you damn well think
just let these words sink and let the holy spirit think
cause with just one flash jesus will be back in a blink
theres no tolerance for their disobedience
and i will kill emcees
if god gives me the ingredients

hook
underground kings
we are the underground kings yeah
underground kings
oooohhh ooohhh

we kill the underground
we rap to make him proud

undergrounds kings
ooohh ooh ohhhhh
underground kings

father thy kingdom come
underground kings x3
verse 2 titan kai

titan and real u
he brew like hebrew
noah on that ark bru
with animals no zoo
pure love no vodo
when we had no clue to
and all we could do
is dudu call that cudu

im about to go in like curfew
resurrection of christ all minds blew
now im always looking up call that eye glue

sin take you down six foot seven foot
one more foot
lower then a coffinyeah she do this often
and im doing this for nathan
education flow  hmm yeah boston
freds master grand dad like im winston

i aint a beast i aint a dog
im a living child of god

life aint about ice
life aint about money
yet around easter some people praising bunny
no it aint funny kinda like another jesus vs satan
i mean santa ho ho ho merry christmas
i wonder why people gotta do
what they do
acting like a sinful zoo
like they got nothing better to do

stealing money like jack the kangaroo
and still getting lullabies like  da da doo

firelighters
watch me fire light this

no illuminators
but a bunch of haters
in the other escalator
heading down cause they lacking jesus

my father is the king of kings
now that makes me a king yeah

verse 3 tha real u

yeah what’s that about brother
watch me walk it out
west coast west toast always in the west though
i do it for the south though
jesus on the cross
in the sky looking so blessed
like once again i’m high they say all my rap should rather die
laingville won’t listen to christian rap so i rather lie
i’m like why the heck should i care
west coast can kiss my bible i’m on the brink of survival
internet with 200 downloads
youtube going small but like king david
against giants i don’t care we all titans
watch us start riots light up the night
light up sky we gonna try it
facebook twitter bbm demolished
my spirit has been lifted and my flesh is being polished
all these local rappers are undernourished
i eat bread and drink wine
while they eat food from the pig stein
and even cow intestines
and  they pray to freaken rick ross like his santa clause
that’s what they say i ain’t part of the nwa
i’m 116 all the way to the grave like my homies in the
usa

moddibo told me about the church bombings
nigeria being violated by all these muslim alcoholics
they want gin and
tonic we give them holy water
and a bucket full of the anointing
like
ointment
they getting healed by all these lyrics
so tell all these dumb ass rappers out there
who be the real kings
we serve the world with consciousness
and serving god with righteousness
if i should die before i wake
i pray to the lord our soul to take
then god be like boy who really fake
is it tha real u i don’t think so
and let me perform in heaven though

my glory awaits in christ
my grammy is in the afterlife
my trophies and medals
they all with my superhero
what do you have and what will you have
nothing cause your life is such a drag
will you make a change
will you change your range
will quit rapping shit
like you got something better today
i don’t think you will
but i know god has something better still
so stand exalted he will humble you
luke chapter 14 verse 11 bru
i stay humble let him exalt me too
you know how we do

hook
