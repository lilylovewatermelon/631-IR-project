fall on me
wont you tell me
when the hour is late
tell them old crows
want to fly away
tell the darkness
that you aint no slave
well sunshine

wont you follow me
through the night
wont you guide me
when we go by
says trouble
along the road ahead
some lawmen
really want me dead
well sunshine

aint done nothing
is what i told that man
said i aint done nothing
with these two hands
see there aint no blood
aint no blood on my hands
stains to come
made the government mad
well sunshine
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likewell sunshine
follow me
wont you guide me
till i can see
tell them old crows
want to fly away
tell the darknessembed"
