all the folks down in lynchburg tennessee
been working hard for good ol boys like me
i dont wanna be the one to tell em
that stuff that theyve been selling
aint working like it should
but i damn sure wish it would

chorus jason aldean  miranda lambert
whiskeys supposed to drown the memory
ive gone from one to one too many
and the thing that really gets me
is how your memory drowns the whiskey

verse 2 jason aldean  miranda lambert
maybe its the bar or the stool im on
maybe its the band and the sad old song
that keeps me buying rounds
that keeps me turning down
any girl that wants to dance
and you aint giving them a chance

chorus jason aldean  miranda lambert
whiskeys supposed to drown the memory
ive gone from one to one too many
and the thing that really gets me
is how your memory drowns the whiskey
