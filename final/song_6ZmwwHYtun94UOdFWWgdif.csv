and down came your innocence

verse 1 halsey
a shining badge a suit to match
bit my nails down so they wouldnt scratch
but who believes with knees like these
ill take two of em please

prechorus halsey
with soft skin soft eyes
all these beautiful laughs and beautiful thighs
they always kept me up at night
but i cant change my appetite

chorus halsey
cause your pussy is a wonderland
and i could be a better man
it doesnt matter to me
your pussy is a wonderland
and i could be a better man
it doesnt matter to me

postchorus alanis morissette
cause he is she is her
and her and he are love
and i have never felt the difference
cause he is she is her
and her and he are love
tired of all these labels
