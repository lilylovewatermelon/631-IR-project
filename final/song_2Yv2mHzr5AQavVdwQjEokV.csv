im thinkin maybe i should thank you
oh baby i should buy you another round
cause you care and i swear that im here but im there
its gettin harder to hunt me down
get away to a place with a lake such a great view
leave the bank couple hunnid thou
i made it but i hate once i build it i break it
that might just break me down

prechorus mac miller
and all i ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
ever since i can remember ive been keepin it together but im feelin strange
get away when it aint really safe and it dont seem right
but whats new you get used to the bullshit the screws they go missin
its likely they might be but

chorus baro sura
you remind me
shit i need to stay in line
you damn well are a great design
you despite bein an only child
say you need more of a family round
lets turn these genes into hand me downs

yeah well im just being honest my conscience aint doin bad
because i try to minus the problems that i attract
and half the time the wheels thats in the back of my mind
just keep on turnin til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
i do not lie though facts may seem a little farfetched
thats only cause i may be makebelieve and full of darkness
when im stuck between a rock and a hard place
walkin droppin change inside your empty guitar case
thats charity um i move carelessly thats why im always trippin
i guess its like electrolytes you help me go the distance
not too efficient but the way its always been
until the day we have to meet again

prechorus mac miller
get away when it aint really safe and it dont seem right
but whats new you get used to the bullshit the screws they go missin
its likely they might be but

chorus baro sura
you remind me
shit i need to stay in line
you damn well are a great design
you despite bein an only child
