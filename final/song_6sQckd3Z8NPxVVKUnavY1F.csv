if i wanted to know who you were hanging with
while i was gone i wouldve asked you
its the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass
but i felt it when i passed you
theres an ache in you put there by the ache in me
but if its all the same to you
its the same to me

chorus
so we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
​tis the damn season write this down
im stayin at my parents house
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown

verse 2
i parkеd my car right between the methodist
and thе school that used to be ours
the holidays linger like bad perfume
you can run but only so far
i escaped it too remember how you watched me leave
but if its okay with you its okay with me

chorus
we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
​tis the damn season write this down
im stayin at my parents house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
now im missing your smile hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
sleep in half the day just for old times sake
i wont ask you to wait if you dont ask me to stay
so ill go back to la and the socalled friends
wholl write books about me if i ever make it
and wonder about the only soul
who can tell which smiles im fakin
and the heart i know im breakin is my own
to leave the warmest bed ive ever known
we could call it even
even though im leaving
and ill be yours for the weekend
​tis the damn season

chorus
we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
​tis the damn season write this down
im stayin at my parents house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
now im missing your smile hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown
outro
it always leads to you and my hometown54embed"
