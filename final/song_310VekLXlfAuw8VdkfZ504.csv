just light the match and run run from all those times
she poured gasoline and by fire’s light she cried
she cried all night the salt from her tears rusted shut her eyes
she should have shut her eyes

verse 2 jt woodruff
turn off the lights blow out the candles tonight
romance this chance to set angels to flight before they die

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert matt ridenour
i’ll take this ink from my arms and write your name in the sky
please dont use my letters to start your fires this time
your fires this time
your fires this time

verse 3 jt woodruff
please drive faster faster than the light
erase her embrace erase it from your mind let this die

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
i’ll take this ink from my arms and write your name in the sky
please dont use my letters to start your fires this time

bridge jt woodruff with casey calvert
remember oceans like times together
across these oceans i sent my letters
i sent these letters to you
remember oceans and time together in my mind
remember starting your fires off my eyes

outro jt woodruff
remember these oceans like fires off your eyesembed"
