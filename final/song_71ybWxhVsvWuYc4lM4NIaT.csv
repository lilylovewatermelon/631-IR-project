the shoes you wear
aint the shoes id wear but i dont care
youve got things to say
but theyre thrown away cause theyre so passe

prechorus 1
to them they who are they anyway
theyre just beating each other at being each other
with nothing to say

verse 2
so everyone cares
cause the hat that he wears is on the wrong way
and i heard them say
dont be square so square well stay

prechorus 2
without them they who are they anyway
theyre just beating each other at being each other
with nothing to say

chorus
im holding on to my old mans sneakers
just going deaf to my hifi records and
hanging round at the pawn shop waiting for nothing to change
anything strange is wrong
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeverse 3
so here we are
in a dead mans car going to the show
in my old chapeau
well its full of holes but its got more soul

prechorus 3
than them they who are they anyway
theyre just beating each other at being each other
with nothing to say

chorus
im holding on to my old mans sneakers
just going deaf to my hifi records and
hanging round at the pawn shop waiting for nothing to change
anything strange is wrongembed"
