there is a view that reaches far
where we see the universe
i see the fire i see the end
seven miles above the earth
there is emmanuel of mothers
with his sword with his robe
he comes dividing man from brothers

in the tower above the earth we built it for emmanuel
in the powers of the earth we wait until he rails and rails
in the tower above the earth we built it for emmanuel
oh my mother she betrayed us but my father loved and bathed us

still i go to the deepest grave
where i go to sleep aloneyou might also like3embed"
