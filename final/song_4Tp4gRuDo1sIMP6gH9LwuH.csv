lost and afraid young and innocent but getting older
i dont wanna be alone i dont wanna be alone
sharper the blade is the easier it scars your soul
i dont wanna be alone i dont wanna be alone

prechorus 1
my current state is heavy
hope its a phase or something

chorus
dont let me go

verse 2
up and away im an alien i need a moment
i dont know what to believe
all i wanna do is leave
what can i say that would make you see make you need me
maybe i wont ever know maybe ill end up alone

prechorus 2
running in place circles in circles with you
dont mind me out in a race i didnt mean to be here

chorus
watch me go
i dont wanna let you down
so promise you won’t let me drown

how can you feel the way that im feeling
if youre not inside of my head
i got the pressure its pushing my buttons
and making me think about death
i got some mixed emotions about how ive been getting to all these checks
acting all funny because of the money
its making my tummy upset
how can you feel the way that im feeling
if youre not inside of my head
i got the pressure its pushing my buttons
and making me think about death
somebody find me a balance
look what i did to myself and my friends
emotions are paying the rent oh
emotions are paying the rent oh
instrumental interlude

outro
im back and forth i think im going crazy
im back and forth i cant make up my mind
im up and down im never sad
im up and down im never satisfied
im back and forth i think im going crazy
im back and forth i cant make up my mind
im up and down im never sad
im up and down im never satisfied
im back and forth i think im going crazy
im back and forth i cant make up my mind
im up and down im never sad
im up and down im never satisfied
im back and forth i think im going crazy
im back and forth i cant make up my mind
