i cant escape it
im never gonna make it out of this in time
i guess thats just fine
im not there quite yet
my thoughts such a mess
like a little boy
what you runnin for

prechorus
arrive at the door
anyone home
have i lost it all

chorus
struck me like a chord
im a lonely boy
holding out the knife
lonely afterlife
you begged me not to go
sinkin like a stone
use me like an oar
and get yourself to shore

verse 2
a bang at the door
anyone home
thats just what they do
right in front of you
like a cannonball
slammin through your wall
in their face i saw
what theyre fightin for
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeprechorus

im never gonna make it til the end i guess

chorus
struck me like a chord
im a lonely boy
holding out the knife
lonely afterlife
bangin on the door
i dont wanna know
sinkin like a stone
so use me like an oar

bridge
hard to fight what i cant see
not tryna build no dynasty
i cant see beyond this wall
but we lost this game
so many times before

outro
ive been on a cold road
ill be waiting yeah
ill be waiting from the other side
waiting for the tide to rise
