coming to the end of the century observing its last twentyfive years we have seen exactly that limited vision hofstadter talked about—a capitalistic encouragement of enormous fortunes alongside desperate poverty a nationalistic acceptance of war and preparations for war governmental power swung from republicans to democrats and back again but neither party showed itself capable of going beyond that vision

after the disastrous war in vietnam came the scandals of watergate there was a deepening economic insecurity for much of the population along with environmental deterioration and a growing culture of violence and family disarray clearly such fundamental problems could not be solved without bold changes in the social and economic structure but no major party candidates proposed such changes the american political tradition held fast

in recognition of this perhaps only vaguely conscious of this voters stayed away from the polls in large numbers or voted without enthusiasm more and more they declared if only by nonparticipation their alienation from the political system in 1960 63 percent of those eligible to vote voted in the presidential election by 1976 this figure had dropped to 53 percent in a cbs news and new york times survey over half of the respondents said that public officials didnt care about people like them a typical response came from a plumber the president of the united states isnt going to solve our problems the problems are too big

there was a troubling incongruity in the society electoral politics dominated the press and television screens and the doings of presidents members of congress supreme court justices and other officials were treated as if they constituted the history of the country yet there was something artificial in all this something pumped up a straining to persuade a skeptical public that this was all that they must rest their hopes for the future in washington politicians none of whom were inspiring because it seemed that behind the bombast the rhetoric the promises their major concern was their own political power

the distance between politics and the people was reflected clearly in the culture in what was supposed to be the best of the media uncontrolled by corporate interestthat is in public television the public was largely invisible on the leading political forum on public television the nightly macneillehrer report the public was uninvited except as viewer of an endless parade of congressmen senators government bureaucrats experts of various kinds

on commercial radio the usual narrow band of consensus excluding fundamental criticism was especially apparent in the mid1980s with ronald reagan as president the fairness doctrine of the federal communications commission requiring air time for dissenting views was eliminated by the 1990s talk radio had perhaps 20 million listeners treated to daily tirades from rightwing talkshow hosts with leftwing guests uninvited

a citizenry disillusioned with politics and with what pretended to be intelligent discussions of politics turned its attention or had its attention turned to entertainment to gossip to ten thousand schemes for selfhelp those at its margins became violent finding scapegoats within ones group as with poorblack on poorblack violence or against other races immigrants demonized foreigners welfare mothers minor criminals standing in for untouchable major criminals

there were other citizens those who tried to hold on to ideas and ideals still remembered from the sixties and early seventies not just by recollecting but by acting indeed all across the country there was a part of the public unmentioned in the media ignored by political leaders energetically active in thousands of local groups around the country these organized groups were campaigning for environmental protection or womens rights or decent health care including anguished concern about the horrors of aids or housing for the homeless or against military spending

this activism was unlike that of the sixties when the surge of protest against race segregation and war became an overwhelming national force it struggled uphill against callous political leaders trying to reach fellow americans most of whom saw little hope in either the politics of voting or the politics of protest

the presidency of jimmy carter covering the years 1977 to 1980 seemed an attempt by one part of the establishment that represented in the democratic party to recapture a disillusioned citizenry but carter despite a few gestures toward black people and the poor despite talk of human rights abroad remained within the historic political boundaries of the american system protecting corporate wealth and power maintaining a huge military machine that drained the national wealth allying the united states with rightwing tyrannies abroad

carter seemed to be the choice of that international group of powerful influencewielders—the trilateral commission two founding members of the commission according to the far eastern economic review—david rockefeller and zbigniew brzezinski—thought carter was the right person for the presidential election of 1976 given that the watergateplagued republican party was a sure loser

carters job as president from the point of view of the establishment was to halt the rushing disappointment of the american people with the government with the economic system with disastrous military ventures abroad in his campaign he tried to speak to the disillusioned and angry his strongest appeal was to blacks whose rebellion in the late sixties was the most frightening challenge to authority since the labor and unemployed upsurges in the thirties
his appeal was populist—that is he appealed to various elements of american society who saw themselves beleaguered by the powerful and wealthy although he himself was a millionaire peanut grower he presented himself as an ordinary american farmer although he had been a supporter of the vietnam war until its end he presented himself as a sympathizer with those who had been against the war and he appealed to many of the young rebels of the sixties by his promise to cut the military budget

in a muchpublicized speech to lawyers carter spoke out against the use of the law to protect the rich he appointed a black woman patricia harris as secretary of housing and urban development and a black civil rights veteran andrew young as ambassador to the united nations he gave the job of heading the domestic youth service corps to a young former antiwar activist sam brown

his most crucial appointments however were in keeping with the trilateral commission report of harvard political scientist samuel huntington which said that whatever groups voted for a president once elected what counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions brzezinski a traditional cold war intellectual became carters national security adviser his secretary of defense harold brown had during the vietnam war according to the pentagon papers envisaged the elimination of virtually all the constraints under which the bombing then operated his secretary of energy james schlesinger as secretary of defense under nixon was described by a member of the washington press corps as showing an almost missionary drive in seeking to reverse a downward trend in the defense budget schlesinger was also a strong proponent of nuclear energy

his other cabinet appointees had strong corporate connections a financial writer wrote not long after carters election so far mr carters actions commentary and particularly his cabinet appointments have been highly reassuring to the business community veteran washington correspondent tom wicker wrote the available evidence is that mr carter so far is opting for wall streets confidence

carter did initiate more sophisticated policies toward governments that oppressed their own people he used united nations ambassador andrew young to build up good will for the united states among the black african nations and urged that south africa liberalize its policies toward blacks a peaceful settlement in south africa was necessary for strategic reasons south africa was used for radar tracking systems also it had important us corporate investments and was a critical source of needed raw materials diamonds especially therefore what the united states needed was a stable government in south africa the continued oppression of blacks might create civil war

the same approach was used in other countries—combining practical strategic needs with the advancement of civil rights but because the chief motivation was practicality not humanity there was a tendency toward token changes—as in chiles release of a few political prisoners when congressman herman badillo introduced in congress a proposal that required the us representatives to the world bank and other international financial institutions to vote against loans to countries that systematically violated essential rights by the use of torture or imprisonment without trial carter sent a personal letter to every congressman urging the defeat of this amendment it won a voice vote in the house but lost in the senate

under carter the united states continued to support all over the world regimes that engaged in imprisonment of dissenters torture and mass murder in the philippines in iran in nicaragua and in indonesia where the inhabitants of east timor were being annihilated in a campaign bordering on genocide

the new republic magazine presumably on the liberal side of the establishment commented approvingly on the carter policies    american foreign policy in the next four years will essentially extend the philosophies developed  in the nixonford years this is not at all a negative prospect there should be continuity it is part of history

carter had presented himself as a friend of the movement against the war but when nixon mined haiphong harbor and resumed bombing of north vietnam in the spring of 1973 carter urged that we give president nixon our backing and supportwhether or not we agree with specific decisions once elected carter declined to give aid to vietnam for reconstruction despite the fact that the land had been devastated by american bombing asked about this at a press conference carter replied that there was no special obligation on the united states to do this because the destruction was mutual

considering that the united states had crossed half the globe with an enormous fleet of bombers and 2 million soldiers and after eight years left a tiny nation with over a million dead and its land in ruins this was an astounding statement

one establishment intention perhaps was that future generations see the war not as it appeared in the defense departments own pentagon papers—as a ruthless attack on civilian populations for strategic military and economic interests—but as an unfortunate error noam chomsky one of the leading antiwar intellectuals during the vietnam period looked in mid1978 at how the history of the war was being presented in the major media and wrote that they were destroying the historical record and supplanting it with a more comfortable story reducing lessons of the war to the socially neutral categories of error ignorance and cost

the carter administration clearly was trying to end the disillusionment of the american people after the vietnam war by following foreign policies more palatable less obviously aggressive hence the emphasis on human rights the pressure on south africa and chile to liberalize their policies but on close examination these more liberal policies were designed to leave intact the power and influence of the american military and american business in the world

the renegotiation of the panama canal treaty with the tiny central american republic of panama was an example the canal saved american companies 15 billion a year in delivery costs and the united states collected 150 million a year in tolls out of which it paid the panama government 23 million dollars while maintaining fourteen military bases in the area
back in 1903 the united states had engineered a revolution against colombia set up the new tiny republic of panama in central america and dictated a treaty giving the united states military bases control of the panama canal and sovereignty in perpetuity the carter administration in 1977 responding to antiamerican protests in panama decided to renegotiate the treaty the new york times was candid about the canal we stole it and removed the incriminating evidence from our history books

by 1977 the canal had lost military importance it could not accommodate large tankers or aircraft carriers that plus the antiamerican riots in panama led the carter administration over conservative opposition to negotiate a new treaty which called for a gradual removal of us bases which could easily be relocated elsewhere in the area the canals legal ownership would be turned over to panama after a period the treaty also contained vague language which could be the basis for american military intervention under certain conditions

whatever carters sophistication in foreign policy certain fundamentals operated in the late sixties and the seventies american corporations were active all over the world on a scale never seen before there were by the early seventies about three hundred us corporations including the seven largest banks which earned 40 percent of their net profits outside the united states they were called multinationals but actually 98 percent of their top executives were americans as a group they now constituted the thirdlargest economy in the world next to the united states and the soviet union

the relationship of these global corporations with the poorer countries had long been an exploiting one it was clear from us department of commerce figures whereas us corporations in europe between 1950 and 1965 invested 81 billion and made 55 billion in profits in latin america they invested 38 billion and made 112 billion in profits and in africa they invested 52 billion and made 143 billion in profits

it was the classical imperial situation where the places with natural wealth became victims of more powerful nations whose power came from that seized wealth american corporations depended on the poorer countries for 100 percent of their diamonds coffee platinum mercury natural rubber and cobalt they got 98 percent of their manganese from abroad 90 percent of their chrome and aluminum and 20 to 40 percent of certain imports platinum mercury cobalt chrome manganese came from africa

another fundamental of foreign policy whether democrats or republicans were in the white house was the training of foreign military officers the army had a school of the americas in the canal zone from which thousands of military leaders in latin america had graduated six of the graduates for instance were in the chilean military junta that overthrew the democratically elected allende government in 1973 the american commandant of the school told a reporter we keep in touch with our graduates and they keep in touch with us

and yet the united states cultivated a reputation for being generous with its riches indeed it had frequently given aid to disaster victims this aid however often depended on political loyalty in one sixyear drought in west africa 100000 africans died of starvation a report by the carnegie endowment said the agency for international development aid of the united states had been inefficient and neglectful in giving aid to nomads in the sahel area of west africa an area covering six countries the response of aid was that those countries had no close historical economic or political ties to the united states

in early 1975 the press carried a dispatch from washington secretary of state henry a kissinger has formally initiated a policy of selecting for cutbacks in american aid those nations that have sided against the us in votes in the united nations in some cases the cutbacks involve food and humanitarian relief

most aid was openly military and by 1975 the united states exported 95 billion in arms the carter administration promised to end the sale of arms to repressive regimes but when it took office the bulk of the sales continued

and the military continued to take a huge share of the national budget when carter was running for election he told the democratic platform committee without endangering the defense of our nation or commitments to our allies we can reduce present defense expenditures by about 5 to 7 billion dollars annually but his first budget proposed not a decrease but an increase of 10 billion for the military indeed he proposed that the us spend a thousand billion dollars a trillion dollars in the next five years on its military forces and the administration had just announced that the department of agriculture would save 25 million a year by no longer giving free second helpings of milk to 14 million needy schoolchildren who got free meals in school

if carters job was to restore faith in the system here was his greatest failure—solving the economic problems of the people the price of food and the necessities of life continued to rise faster than wages were rising unemployment remained officially at 6 or 8 percent unofficially the rates were higher for certain key groups in the population—young people and especially young black people—the unemployment rate was 20 or 30 percent

it soon became clear that blacks in the united states the group most in support of carter for president were bitterly disappointed with his policies he opposed federal aid to poor people who needed abortions and when it was pointed out to him that this was unfair because rich women could get abortions with ease he replied well as you know there are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people cannot
carters populism was not visible in his administrations relationship to the oil and gas interests it was part of carters energy plan to end price regulation of natural gas for the consumer the largest producer of natural gas was exxon corporation and the largest blocs of private stock in exxon were owned by the rockefeller family
early in carters administration the federal energy administration found that gulf oil corporation had overstated by 791 million its costs for crude oil obtained from foreign affiliates it then passed on these false costs to consumers in the summer of 1978 the administration announced that a compromise had been made with gulf oil in which gulf agreed to pay back 422 million gulf informed its stockholders that the payments will not affect earnings since adequate provision was made in prior years

the lawyer for the energy department who worked out the compromise with gulf said it had been done to avoid a lengthy and costly lawsuit would the lawsuit have cost the 369 million dropped in the compromise would the government have considered letting off a bank robber without a jail term in return for half the loot the settlement was a perfect example of what carter had told a meeting of lawyers during his presidential campaign—that the law was on the side of the rich

the fundamental facts of maldistribution of wealth in america were clearly not going to be affected by carters policies any more than by previous administrations whether conservative or liberal according to andrew zimbalist an american economist writing in le monde diplomatique in 1977 the top 10 percent of the american population had an income thirty times that of the bottom tenth the top 1 percent of the nation owned 33 percent of the wealth the richest 5 percent owned 83 percent of the personally owned corporate stock the one hundred largest corporations despite the graduated income tax that misled people into thinking the very rich paid at least 50 percent in taxes paid an average of 269 percent in taxes and the leading oil companies paid 58 percent in taxes internal revenue service figures for 1974 indeed 244 individuals who earned over 200000 paid no taxes

in 1979 as carter weakly proposed benefits for the poor and congress strongly turned them down a black woman marian wright edelman director of the childrens defense fund in washington pointed to some facts one of every seven american children 10 million altogether had no known regular source of primary health care one of every three children under seventeen 18 million altogether had never seen a dentist in an article on the new york times oped page she wrote

the senate budget committee recently   knocked off 88 million from a modest 288 million administration request to improve the program that screens and treats childrens health problems at the same time the senate found 725 million to bail out litton industries and to hand to the navy at least two destroyers ordered by the shah of iran

carter approved tax reforms which benefited mainly the corporations economist robert lekachman writing in the nation noted the sharp increase in corporate profits 44 percent in the last quarter of 1978 over the previous years last quarter he wrote perhaps the presidents most outrageous act occurred last november when he signed into law an  18 billion tax reduction the bulk of whose benefits accrue to affluent individuals and corporations

in 1979 while the poor were taking cuts the salary of the chairman of exxon oil was being raised to 830000 a year and that of the chairman of mobil oil to over a million dollars a year that year while exxons net income rose 56 percent to more than 4 billion three thousand small independent gasoline stations went out of business

carter made some efforts to hold onto social programs but this was undermined by his very large military budgets presumably this was to guard against the soviet union but when the soviet union invaded afghanistan in 1979 carter could take only symbolic actions like reinstituting the draft or calling for a boycott of the 1980 moscow olympics

on the other hand american weaponry was used to support dictatorial regimes battling leftwing rebels abroad a report by the carter administration to congress in 1977 was blunt saying that a number of countries with deplorable records of human rights observance are also countries where we have important security and foreign policy interests

thus carter asked congress in the spring of 1980 for 57 million in credits for the military junta fighting off a peasant rebellion in el salvador in the philippines after the 1978 national assembly elections president ferdinand marcos imprisoned ten of the twentyone losing opposition candidates many prisoners were tortured many civilians were killed still carter urged congress to give marcos 300 million in military aid for the next five years

in nicaragua the united states had helped maintain the somoza dictatorship for decades misreading the basic weakness of that regime and the popularity of the revolution against it the carter administration continued its support for somoza until close to the regimes fall in 1979

in iran toward the end of 1978 the long years of resentment against the shahs dictatorship culminated in mass demonstrations on september 8 1978 hundreds of demonstrators were massacred by the shahs troops the next day according to a upi dispatch from teheran carter affirmed his support for the shah

troops opened fire on demonstrators against the shah for the third straight day yesterday and president jimmy carter telephoned the royal palace to express support for shah mohammad reza pahlevi who faced the worst crisis of his 37year reign nine members of parliament walked out on a speech by irans new premier shouting that his hands were stained with blood in the crackdown on conservative moslems and other protesters

on december 13 1978 nicholas gage reported for the new york times

the staff of the united states embassy here has been bolstered by dozens of specialists flown in to back an effort to help the shah against a growing challenge to his rule according to embassy sources   the new arrivals according to the embassy sources include a number of central intelligence agency specialists on iran in addition to diplomats and military personnel

in early 1979 as the crisis in iran was intensifying the former chief analyst on iran for the cia told new york times reporter seymour hersh that he and his colleagues knew of the tortures of iranian dissenters by savaki the iranian secret police set up during the late 1950s by the shah with help from the cia furthermore he told hersh that a senior cia official was involved in instructing officials in savaki on torture techniques

it was a popular massive revolution and the shah fled the carter administration later accepted him into the country presumably for medical treatment and the antiamerican feelings of the revolutionaries reached a high point on november 4 1979 the us embassy in teheran was taken over by student militants who demanding that the shah be returned to iran for punishment held fiftytwo embassy employees hostage

for the next fourteen months with the hostages still held in the embassy compound that issue took the forefront of foreign news in the united states and aroused powerful nationalist feelings when carter ordered the immigration and naturalization service to start deportation proceedings against iranian students who lacked valid visas the new york times gave cautious but clear approval politicians and the press played into a general hysteria an iranianamerican girl who was slated to give a high school commencement address was removed from the program the bumper sticker bomb iran appeared on autos all over the country

it was a rare journalist bold enough to point out as alan richman of the boston globe did when the fiftytwo hostages were released alive and apparently well that there was a certain lack of proportion in american reactions to this and other violations of human rights there were 52 of them a number easy to comprehend it wasnt like 15000 innocent people permanently disappearing in argentina they the american hostages spoke our language there were 3000 people summarily shot in guatemala last year who did not

the hostages were still in captivity when jimmy carter faced ronald reagan in the election of 1980 that fact and the economic distress felt by many were largely responsible for carters defeat

reagans victory followed eight years later by the election of george bush meant that another part of the establishment lacking even the faint liberalism of the carter presidency would be in charge the policies would be more crass—cutting benefits to poor people lowering taxes for the wealthy increasing the military budget filling the federal court system with conservative judges actively working to destroy revolutionary movements in the caribbean

the dozen years of the reaganbush presidency transformed the federal judiciary never more than moderately liberal into a predominantly conservative institution by the fall of 1991 reagan and bush had filled more than half of the 837 federal judgeships and appointed enough rightwing justices to transform the supreme court

in the seventies with liberal justices william brennan and thurgood marshall in the lead the court had declared death penalties unconstitutional had supported in roe v wade the right of women to choose abortions and had interpreted the civil rights law as permitting special attention to blacks and women to make up for past discrimination affirmative action

william rehnquist first named to the supreme court by richard nixon was made chief justice by ronald reagan in the reaganbush years the rehnquist court made a series of decisions that weakened roe v wade brought back the death penalty reduced the rights of detainees against police powers prevented doctors in federally supported family planning clinics from giving women information on abortions and said that poor people could be forced to pay for public education education was not a fundamental right

justices william brennan and thurgood marshall were the last of the courts liberals old and ill though reluctant to give up the fight they retired the final act to create a conservative supreme court was president bushs nomination to replace marshall he chose a black conservative clarence thomas despite dramatic testimony from a former colleague a young black law professor named anita hill that thomas had sexually harassed her thomas was approved by the senate and now the supreme court moved even more decisively to the right

with conservative federal judges with probusiness appointments to the national labor relations board judicial decisions and board findings weakened a labor movement already troubled by a decline in manufacturing workers who went out on strike found themselves with no legal protection one of the first acts of the reagan administration was to dismiss from their jobs en masse striking air traffic controllers it was a warning to future strikers and a sign of the weakness of a labor movement which in the thirties and forties had been a powerful force

corporate america became the greatest beneficiary of the reaganbush years in the sixties and seventies an important environmental movement had grown in the nation horrified at the poisoning of the air the seas and rivers and the deaths of thousands each year as a result of work conditions after a mine explosion in west virginia killed seventyeight miners in november 1968 there had been angry protest in the mine district and congress passed the coal mine health and safety act of 1969 nixons secretary of labor spoke of a new national passion passion for environmental improvement

the following year yielding to strong demands from the labor movement and consumer groups but also seeing it as an opportunity to win the support of workingclass voters president nixon had signed the occupational safety and health act of 1970 this was an important piece of legislation establishing a universal right to a safe and healthy workplace and creating an enforcement machinery reflecting on this years later herbert stein who had been the chairman of nixons council of economic advisers lamented that the juggernaut of environmental regulation proved not to be controllable by the nixon administration

while president jimmy carter came into office praising the osha program he was also eager to please the business community the woman he appointed to head osha eula bingham fought for strong enforcement of the act and was occasionally successful but as the american economy showed signs of trouble with oil prices inflation and unemployment rising carter seemed more and more concerned about the difficulties the act created for business he became an advocate of removing regulations on corporations and giving them more leeway even if this was hurtful to labor and to consumers environmental regulation became more and more a victim of cost benefit analysis in which regulations protecting the health and safety of the public became secondary to how costly this would be for business

under reagan and bush this concern for the economy which was a shorthand term for corporate profit dominated any concern for workers or consumers president reagan proposed to replace tough enforcement of environmental laws by a voluntary approach leaving it to businesses to decide for themselves what they would do he appointed as head of osha a businessman who was hostile to oshas aims one of his first acts was to order the destruction of 100000 government booklets pointing out the dangers of cotton dust to textile workers

political scientist william grover the president as prisoner evaluating environmental policy under carter and reagan as part of his penetrating structural critique of both presidents concluded

osha appears caught in a cycle of liberal presidents—who want to retain some health and safely regulatory programs but who also need economic growth for political survival—and conservative presidents who focus almost exclusively on the growth side of the equation such a cycle will always tend to subordinate the need for safe and healthful workplaces to  ensuring that commitment to osha will only be as strong as the priorities of business will allow

george bush presented himself as the environmental president and pointed with pride to his signing of the clean air act of 1990 but two years after that act was passed it was seriously weakened by a new rule of the environmental protection agency that allowed manufacturers to increase by 245 tons a year hazardous pollutants in the atmosphere

furthermore little money was allocated for enforcement contaminated drinking water had caused over 100000 illnesses between 1971 and 1985 according to an epa report but in bushs first year in office while the epa received 80000 complaints of contaminated drinking water only one in a hundred was investigated and in 1991 and 1992 according to a private environmental group the national resources defense council there were some 250000 violations of the safe water drinking act which had been passed during the nixon administration

shortly after bush took office a government scientist prepared testimony for a congressional committee on the dangerous effects of industrial uses of coal and other fossil fuels in contributing to global warming a depletion of the earths protective ozone layer the white house changed the testimony over the scientists objections to minimize the danger boston globe october 29 1990 again business worries about regulation seemed to override the safety of the public

the ecological crisis in the world had become so obviously serious that pope john paul ii felt the need to rebuke the wealthy classes of the industrialized nations for creating that crisis today the dramatic threat of ecological breakdown is teaching us the extent to which greed and selfishness both individual and collective are contrary to the order of creation

at international conferences to deal with the perils of global warming the european community and japan proposed specific levels and timetables for carbon dioxide emissions in which the united states was the leading culprit but as the new york times reported in the summer of 1991 the bush administration fears that  it would hurt the nations economy in the short term for no demonstrable longterm climatic benefit scientific opinion was quite clear on the longterm benefit but this was not as important as the economythat is the needs of corporations

evidence became stronger by the late eighties that renewable energy sources water wind sunlight could produce more usable energy than nuclear plants which were dangerous and expensive and produced radioactive wastes that could not be safely disposed of yet the reagan and bush administrations made deep cuts under reagan a 90 percent cut in research into renewable energy possibilities

in june 1992 more than a hundred countries participated in the earth summit environmental conference in brazil statistics showed that the armed forces of the world were responsible for two thirds of the gases that depleted the ozone layer but when it was suggested that the earth summit consider the effects of the military on environmental degradation the united states delegation objected and the suggestion was defeated

indeed the preservation of a huge military establishment and the retention of profit levels of oil corporations appeared to be twin objectives of the reaganbush administrations shortly after ronald reagan took office twentythree oil industry executives contributed 270000 to redecorate the white house living quarters according to the associated press

the solicitation drive    came four weeks after the president decontrolled oil prices a decision worth 2 billion to the oil industry   jack hodges of oklahoma city owner of core oil and gas company said the top man of this country ought to live in one of the top places mr reagan has helped the energy business

while he built up the military allocations of over a trillion dollars in his first four years in office reagan tried to pay for this with cuts in benefits for the poor there would be 140 billion of cuts in social programs through 1984 and an increase of 181 billion for defense in the same period he also proposed tax cuts of 190 billion most of this going to the wealthy

despite the tax cuts and the military appropriations reagan insisted he would still balance the budget because the tax cuts would so stimulate the economy as to generate new revenue nobel prizewinning economist wassily leontief remarked dryly this is not likely to happen in fact i personally guarantee that it will not happen

indeed department of commerce figures showed that periods of lowered corporate taxes 1973 1975 19791982 did not at all show higher capital investment but a steep drop the sharpest rise of capital investment 19751979 took place when corporate taxes were slightly higher than they had been the preceding five years

the human consequences of reagans budget cuts went deep for instance social security disability benefits were terminated for 350000 people a man injured in an oil field accident was forced to go back to work the federal government overruling both the company doctor and a state supervisor who testified that he was too disabled to work the man died and federal officials said we have a pr problem a war hero of vietnam roy benavidez who had been presented with the congressional medal of honor by reagan was told by social security officials that the shrapnel pieces in his heart arms and leg did not prevent him from working appearing before a congressional committee he denounced reagan

unemployment grew in the reagan years in the year 1982 30 million people were unemployed alt or part of the year one result was that over 16 million americans lost medical insurance which was often tied to holding a job in michigan where the unemployment rate was the highest in the country the infant death rate began to rise in 1981

new requirements eliminated free school lunches for more than one million poor children who depended on the meal for as much as half of their daily nutrition millions of children entered the ranks of the officially declared poor and soon a quarter of the nations children—twelve million—were living in poverty in parts of detroit onethird of the children were dying before their first birthday and the new york times commented given whats happening to the hungry in america this administration has cause only for shame

welfare became an object of attack aid to single mothers with children through the afdc aid to families with dependent children program food stamps health care for the poor through medicaid for most people on welfare the benefits differed from state to state this meant 500 to 700 a month in aid leaving them well below the poverty level of about 900 a month black children were four times as likely as white children to grow up on welfare

early in the reagan administration responding to the argument that government aid was not needed that private enterprise would take care of poverty a mother wrote to her local newspaper

i am on aid to families with dependent children and both my children are in school  i have graduated from college with distinction 128th in a class of over 1000 with a ba in english and sociology i have experience in library work child care social work and counseling

i have been to the ceta office they have nothing for me i also go every week to the library to scour the newspaper help wanted ads i have kept a copy of every cover letter that i have sent out with my resume the stack is inches thick i have applied for jobs paving as little as 8000 a year i work parttime in a library for 350 an hour welfare reduces my allotment to compensate  

it appears we have employment offices that cant employ governments that cant govern and an economic system that cant produce jobs for people ready to work  

last week i sold my bed to pay for the insurance on my car which in the absence of mass transportation i need to go job hunting i sleep on a piece of rubber foam somebody gave me

so this is the great american dream my parents came to this country for work hard get a good education follow the rules and you will be rich i dont want to be rich i just want to be able to feed my children and live with some semblance of dignity  

democrats often joined republicans in denouncing welfare programs presumably this was done to gain political support from a middleclass public that believed they were paying taxes to support teenage mothers and people they thought too lazy to work much of the public did not know and were not informed by either political leaders or the media that welfare took a tiny part of the taxes and military spending took a huge chunk of it yet the publics attitude on welfare was different from that of the two major parties it seemed that the constant attacks on welfare by politicians reported endlessly in the press and on television did not succeed in eradicating a fundamental generosity felt by most americans

a new york timescbs news poll conducted in early 1992 showed that public opinion on welfare changed depending on how the question was worded if the word welfare was used 44 percent of those questioned said too much was being spent on welfare while 50 percent said either that the right amount was being spent or that too little was being spent but when the question was about assistance to the poor only 13 percent thought too much was being spent and 64 percent thought too little was being spent

this suggested that both parties were trying to manufacture an antihumanneeds mood by constant derogatory use of the word welfare and then to claim they were acting in response to public opinion the democrats as well as the republicans had strong connections to wealthy corporations kevin phillips a republican analyst of national politics wrote in 1990 that the democratic party was historys secondmost enthusiastic capitalist party

phillips pointed out that the greatest beneficiaries of government policy during the republican presidencies of ronald reagan and george bush were the superrich it was the truly wealthy more than anyone else who flourished under reagan  the 1980s were the triumph of upper america  the political ascendancy of the rich and a glorification of capitalism free markets and finance

when government policy enriched the already rich it was not called welfare this was not as obvious as the monthly checks to the poor it most often took the form of generous changes in the tax system

in america who really pays the taxes two investigative reporters with the philadelphia inquirer donald barlett and james steele traced the path by which tax rates for the very rich got lower and lower it was not the republicans but the democrats—the kennedyjohnson administrations—who under the guise of tax reform first lowered the world war 11era rate of 91 percent on incomes over 400000 a year to 70 percent during the carter administration though over his objections democrats and republicans in congress joined to give even more tax breaks to the rich

the reagan administration with the help of democrats in congress lowered the tax rate on the very rich to 50 percent and in 1986 a coalition of republicans and democrats sponsored another tax reform hill that lowered the top rate to 28 percent barlett and steele noted that a schoolteacher a factory worker and a billionaire could all pay 28 percent the idea of a progressive income in which the rich paid at higher rates than everyone else was now almost dead

as a result of all the tax bills from 1978 to 1990 the net worth of the forbes 400 chosen as the richest in the country by forbes magazine advertising itself as capitalist tool was tripled about 70 billion a year was lost in government revenue so that in those thirteen years the wealthiest 1 percent of the country gained a trillion dollars

as william greider pointed out in his remarkable book who will tell the people the betrayal of american democracy

for those who blame republicans for what has happened and believe that equitable taxation will be restored if only the democrats can win back the white house there is this disquieting feet the turning point on tax politics when the monied elites first began to win big occurred in 1978 with the democratic party fully in power and well before ronald reagan came to washington democratic majorities have supported this great shift in tax burden every step of the way

not only did the income tax become less progressive during the last decades of the century but the social security tax became more regressive that is more and more was deducted from the salary checks of the poor and middle classes but when salaries reached 42000 no more was deducted by the early 1990s a middleincome family earning 37800 a year paid 765 percent of its income in social security taxes a family earning ten times as much 378000 paid 146 percent of its income in social security taxes

the result of these higher payroll taxes was that threefourths of all wage earners paid more each year through the social security tax than through the income tax embarrassingly for the democratic party which was supposed to he the party of the working class those higher payroll taxes had been put in motion under the administration of jimmy carter

in a twoparty system if both parties ignore public opinion there is no place voters can turn and in the matter of taxation it has been clear that american citizens have wanted taxes that are truly progressive william greider informs us that shortly after world war ii when rates on the very rich were up to 90 percent a gallup poll showed that 85 percent of the public thought the federal tax code was fair but by 1984 when all those tax reforms had been put into effect by democrats and republicans a public opinion survey by the internal revenue service found that 80 percent of those polled agreed with the statement the present tax system benefits the rich and is unfair to the ordinary working man and woman

by the end of the reagan years the gap between rich and poor in the united states had grown dramatically where in 1980 the chief executive officers ceos of corporations made forty times as much in salary as the average factory worker by 1989 they were making ninetythree times as much in the dozen years from 1977 to 1989 the beforetax income of the richest 1 percent rose 77 percent meanwhile for the poorest twofifths of the population there was no gain at all indeed a small decline

and because of favorable changes for the rich in the tax structure the richest 1 percent in the decade ending in 1990 saw their aftertax income increase 87 percent in the same period the aftertax income of the lower fourfifths of the population either went down 5 percent at the poorest level or went up no more than 86 percent

while everybody at the lower levels was doing worse there were especially heavy losses for blacks hispanics women and the young the general impoverishment of the lowestincome groups that took place in the reaganbush years hit black families hardest with their lack of resources to start with and with racial discrimination facing them in jobs the victories of the civil rights movement had opened up spaces for some africanamericans but left others far behind

at the end of the eighties at least a third of africanamerican families fell below the official poverty level and black unemployment seemed fixed at two and a half times that of whites with young blacks out of work at the rate of 30 to 40 percent the life expectancy of blacks remained at least ten years lower than that of whites in detroit washington and baltimore the mortality rate for black babies was higher than in jamaica or costa rica

along with poverty came broken homes family violence street crime drugs in washington dc with a concentrated population of black poor within walking distance of the marbled buildings of the national government 42 percent of young black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty five were either in jail or out on probation or parole the crime rate among blacks instead of being seen as a crying demand for the elimination of poverty was used by politicians to call for the building of more prisons

the 1954 supreme court decision in brown v board of education had begun the process of desegregating schools but poverty kept black children in ghettos and many schools around the country remained segregated by race and class supreme court decisions in the seventies determined that there need be no equalization of funds for poor school districts and rich school districts san antonio independent school district v rodriguez and that the busing of children need not take place between wealthy suburbs and inner cities milliken v bradley

to admirers of free enterprise and laissezfaire those people were poor who did not work and produce and so had themselves to blame for their poverty they ignored the fact that women taking care of children on their own were working very hard indeed they did not ask why babies who were not old enough to show their work skills should be penalized—to the point of death—for growing up in a poor family

ironically it was republican kevin phillips who analyzing the reagan years wrote less and less wealth was going to people who produced something  disproportionate rewards to societys economic legal and cultural manipulatorsfrom lawyers to financial advisers

in the mideighties a major scandal began to emerge in washington the deregulation of the savings and loan banks begun in the carter administration had continued under reagan leading to risky investments which drained the assets of the banks leaving them owing billions of dollars to depositors which the government had insured

as the years went by and the problem was kept behind a screen it was going to take more and more money to pay depositors and bail out these banks the figure began to reach 200 billion during the 1988 presidential campaign the democratic candidate michael dukakis was restrained from pointing the finger at the republican administration because the democrats in congress were heavily involved in bringing about and then covering up the situation so the voters were kept in the dark

the enormous drain of money from the treasury for defense had once been declared by president eisenhower to be a theft from human needs but it was accepted by both parties as democrats competed with republicans to show the electorate how tough they were

jimmy carter as president had proposed a  10 billion increase in the military budget an enactment of exactly what eisenhower had described all of the huge military budgets of the postworld war ii period from truman to reagan and bush were approved overwhelmingly by both democrats and republicans

the spending of trillions of dollars to build up nuclear and nonnuclear forces was justified by fears that the soviet union also building up its military forces would invade western europe but george kennan the former ambassador to the soviet union and one of the theoreticians of the cold war said this fear had no basis in reality and harry rositzke who worked for the cia for twenty five years and was at one time cia director of espionage operations against the soviet union wrote in the 1980s in all of my years in government and since i have never seen an intelligence estimate that shows how it would be profitable to soviet interests to invade western europe or to attack the united states

however the creation of such a fear in the public mind was useful in arguing for the building of frightful and superfluous weapons for instance the trident submarine which was capable of firing hundreds of nuclear warheads cost 15 billion it was totally useless except in a nuclear war in which case it would only add several hundred warheads to the tens of thousands already available that 15 billion was enough to finance a fiveyear program of child immunization around the world against deadly diseases and prevent five million deaths ruth sivard world military and social expenditures 19811988

in the mid1980s an analyst with the rand corporation which did research for the defense department told an interviewer in an unusually candid statement that the enormous number of weapons was unnecessary from a military point of view but were useful to convey a certain image at home and abroad

if you had a strong president a strong secretary of defense they could temporarily go to congress and say were only going to build what we need  and if the russians build twice as many tough but it would be unstable politically  and it is therefore better for our own domestic stability as well as international perceptions to insist that we remain good competitors even though the objective significance of the competition is  dubious

in 1984 the cia admitted that it had exaggerated soviet military expenditures that since 1975 it had claimed soviet military spending was growing by 4 to 5 percent each year when the actual figure was 2 percent thus by misinformation even deception the result was to inflate military expenditures

one of the favorite military programs of the reagan administration was the star wars program in which billions were spent supposedly to build a shield in space to stop enemy nuclear missiles in midair but the first three tests of the technology failed a fourth test was undertaken with government funding for the program at stake there was another failure but reagans secretary of defense caspar weinberger approved the faking of results to show that the test had succeeded

when the soviet union began to disintegrate in 1989 and there was no longer the familiar soviet threat the military budget was reduced somewhat but still remained huge with support from both democrats and republicans in 1992 the head of the house armed services committee les aspin a democrat proposed in view of the new international situation that the military budget be cut by 2 from 281 billion to 275 billion

that same year as democrats and republicans both supported minor cuts in the military budget a public opinion survey done for the national press club showed that 59 percent of american voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending over the next five years

it seemed that both parties had failed in persuading the citizenry that the military budget should continue at its high level but they continued to ignore the public they were supposed to represent in the summer of 1992 congressional democrats and republicans joined to vote against a transfer of funds from the military budget to human needs and voted to spend 120 billion to defend europe which everyone acknowledged was no longer in danger—if it ever had been— from soviet attack

democrats and republicans had long been joined in a bipartisan foreign policy but in the reaganbush years the united states government showed a special aggressiveness in the use of military force abroad this was done either directly in invasions or through both overt and covert support of rightwing tyrannies that cooperated with the united states

reagan came into office just after a revolution had taken place in nicaragua in which a popular sandinista movement named after the 1920s revolutionary hero augusto sandino overthrew the corrupt somoza dynasty long supported by the united states the sandinistas a coalition of marxists leftwing priests and assorted nationalists set about to give more land to the peasants and to spread education and health care among the poor

the reagan administration seeing in this a communist threat but even more important a challenge to the long us control over governments in central america began immediately to work to overthrow the sandinista government it waged a secret war by having the cia organize a counterrevolutionary force the contras many of whose leaders were former leaders of the hated national guard under somoza

the contras seemed to have no popular support inside nicaragua and so were based next door in honduras a very poor country dominated by the united states from honduras they moved across the border raiding farms and villages killing men women and children committing atrocities a former colonel with the contras edgar chamorro testified before the world court

we were told that the only way to defeat the sandinistas was to use the tactics the agency the cia attributed to communist insurgencies elsewhere kill kidnap rob and torture   many civilians were killed in cold blood many others were tortured mutilated raped robbed or otherwise abused    when i agreed to join  i had hoped that it would be an organization of nicaragnans it turned out to be an instrument of the us government   

there was a reason for the secrecy of the us actions in nicaragua public opinion surveys showed that the american public was opposed to military involvement there in 1984 the cia using latin american agents to conceal its involvement put mines in the harbors of nicaragua to blow up ships when information leaked out secretary of defense weinberger told abc news the united states is not mining the harbors of nicaragua

later that year congress responding perhaps to public opinion and the memory of vietnam made it illegal for the united states to support directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in nicaragua the reagan administration decided to ignore this law and to find ways to fund the contras secretly looking for thirdparty support reagan himself solicited funds from saudi arabia at least 32 million the friendly dictatorship in guatemala was used to get arms surreptitiously to the contras israel dependent on us aid and always dependable for support was also used

in 1986 a story appearing in a beirut magazine created a sensation that weapons had been sold by the united states to iran supposedly an enemy that in return iran had promised to release hostages being held by extremist moslems in lebanon and that profits from the sale were being given to the contras to buy arms

when asked about this at a press conference in november 1986 president reagan told four lies that the shipment to iran consisted of a few token antitank missiles in fact 2000 that the united states didnt condone shipments by third parties that weapons had not been traded for hostages and that the purpose of the operation was to promote a dialogue with iranian moderates in reality the purpose was a double one to free hostages and get credit for that and to help the contras

the previous month when a transport plane that had carried arms to the contras was downed by nicaraguan gunfire and the american pilot captured the lies had multiplied assistant secretary of state elliot abrams lied secretary of state shultz lied no connection with the us government at all evidence mounted that the captured pilot was working for the cia

the whole irancontra affair became a perfect example of the double line of defense of the american establishment the first defense is to deny the truth if exposed the second defense is to investigate but not too much the press will publicize but they will not get to the heart of the matter

once the scandal was out in the open neither the congressional investigating committees nor the press nor the trial of colonel oliver north who oversaw the contra aid operation got to the critical questions what is us foreign policy all about how are the president and his staff permitted to support a terrorist group in central america to overthrow a government that whatever its faults is welcomed by its own people as a great improvement over the terrible governments the us has supported there for years what does the scandal tell us about democracy about freedom of expression about an open society

out of the muchpublicized contragate scandal came no powerful critique of secrecy in government or of the erosion of democracy by actions taken in secret by a small group of men safe from the scrutiny of public opinion the media in a country priding itself on its level of education and information kept the public informed only on the most superficial level

the limits of democratic party criticism of the affair were revealed by a leading democrat senator sam nunn of georgia who as the investigation was getting under way said we must all of us help the president restore his credibility in foreign affairs

a few democrats were critical which was deplored by a harvard professor james q wilson who was a member of reagans foreign intelligence advisory board wilson looked back nostalgically to a bipartisan consensus the equivalent of the oneparty system in a totalitarian state he worried most about a lack of resolve to act like a great power

it became clear that president reagan and vicepresident bush were involved in what became known as the irancontra affair but their underlings scrupulously kept them out of it illustrating the familiar government device of plausible denial in which the top official shielded by subordinates can plausibly deny involvement although congressman henry gonzalez of texas introduced a resolution for the impeachment of reagan it was quickly suppressed in congress

neither reagan nor bush were indicted rather the congressional committee put the lesser culprits on the witness stand and several of them were indicted one robert mcfarlane a former national security adviser to reagan tried to commit suicide another colonel oliver north stood trial for lying to congress was found guilty but was not sentenced to prison reagan retired in peace and bush became the next president of the united states

in an ironic twist an obscure citizen of the tiny town of odon indiana became a tangential actor in the irancontra controversy this was a young man named bill breeden a former minister who lived in a tepee in the woods with his wife and two children teaching the children at home breedens home town of odon was also the home town of admiral john poindexter mcfarlanes successor as reagans national security adviser who was heavily involved in the illegal activities of the irancontra affair

one day bill breeden noticed that the town to show its pride in its home boy had renamed one of its streets john poindexter street breeden a pacifist and critic of us foreign policy indignant at what he thought was a celebration of immoral behavior in government stole the sign he announced that he was holding it for ransom30 million the amount of money that had been given to iran for transfer to the contras

he was apprehended put on trial and spent a few days in jail as it turned out bill breeden was the only person to be imprisoned as a result of the irancontra affair

the irancontra affair was only one of the many instances in which the government of the united states violated its own laws in pursuit of some desired goal in foreign policy

toward the end of the vietnam war in 1973 congress seeking to limit the presidential power that had been used so ruthlessly in indochina passed the war powers act which said

the president in every possible instance shall consult with congress before introducing united states armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances

almost immediately president gerald ford violated the act when he ordered the invasion of a cambodian island and the bombing of a cambodian town in retaliation for the temporary detention of american merchant seamen on the ship mayaguez he did not consult congress before he gave the attack orders

in the fall of 1982 president reagan sent american marines into a dangerous situation in lebanon where a civil war was raging again ignoring the requirements of the war powers act the following year over two hundred of those marines were killed when a bomb was exploded in their barracks by terrorists

shortly after that in october 1983 with some analysts concluding this was done to take attention away from the lebanon disaster reagan sent us forces to invade the tiny caribbean island of grenada again congress was notified but not consulted the reasons given to the american people for this invasion officially called operation urgent fury were that a recent coup that had taken place in grenada put american citizens students at a medical school on the island in danger and that the united states had received an urgent request from the organization of eastern caribbean states to intervene

an unusually pointed article in the new york times on october 29 1983 by correspondent bernard gwertzman demolished those reasons

the formal request that the us and other friendly countries provide military help was made by the organization of eastern caribbean states last sunday at the request of the united states which wanted to show proof that it had been requested to act under terms of that groups treaty the wording of the formal request however was drafted in washington and conveyed to the caribbean leaders by special american emissaries

both cuba and grenada when they saw that american ships were heading for grenada sent urgent messages promising that american students were safe and urging that an invasion not occur  there is no indication that the administration made a determined effort to evacuate the americans peacefully officials have acknowledged that there was no inclination to try to negotiate with the grenadian authorities  we got there just in time the president said a major point in the dispute is whether in fact the americans on the island were in such danger as to warrant an invasion no official has produced firm evidence that the americans were being mistreated or that they would not be able to leave if they wanted

the real reason for the invasion one high american official told gwertzman was that the united states should show determined to overcome the sense of defeat in vietnam that it was a truly powerful nation what good are maneuvers and shows of force if you never use it

the connection between us military intervention and the promotion of capitalist enterprise had always been especially crass in the caribbean as for grenada an article in the wall street journal eight years after the military invasion october 29 1991 spoke of an invasion of banks and noted that st georges the capital of grenada with 7500 people had 118 offshore banks one for every 64 residents st georges has become the casablanca of the caribbean a fastgrowing haven for money laundering tax evasion and assorted financial fraud 

after a study of various us military interventions political scientist stephen shalom imperial alibis concluded that people in the invaded countries died not to save us nationals who would have been far safer without us intervention but so that washington might make clear that it ruled the caribbean and that it was prepared to engage in a paroxysm of violence to enforce its will he continued

there have been some cases where american citizens were truly in danger for example the four churchwomen who were killed by governmentsponsored death squads in el salvador in 1980 but there was no us intervention there no marine landings no protective bombing raids instead washington backed the death squad regime with military and economic aid military training intelligence sharing and diplomatic support

the historic role of the united states in el salvador where 2 percent of the population owned 60 percent of the land was to make sure governments were in power there that would support us business interests no matter how this impoverished the great majority of people popular rebellions that would threaten these business arrangements were to be opposed when a popular uprising in 1932 threatened the military government the united states sent a cruiser and two destroyers to stand by while the government massacred thirty thousand salvadorans

the administration of jimmy carter did nothing to reverse this history it wanted reform in latin america but not revolution that would threaten us corporate interests in 1980 richard cooper a state department expert on economic affairs told congress that a more equitable distribution of wealth was desirable however we also have an enormous stake in the continuing smooth functioning in the economic system   major changes in the system can   have important implications for our own welfare

in february 1980 el salvador catholic archbishop oscar romero sent a personal letter to president carter asking him to stop military aid to el salvador not long before that the national guard and national police had opened fire on a crowd of protesters in front of the metropolitan cathedral and killed twentyfour people but the carter administration continued the aid the following month archbishop romero was assassinated

there was mounting evidence that the assassination had been ordered by roberto daubuisson a leader of the right wing but daubuisson had the protection of nicolas carranza a deputy minister of defense who at the time was receiving 90000 a year from the cia and elliot abrams ironically assistant secretary of state for human rights declared that daubuisson was not involved in murder

when reagan became president military aid to the el salvador government rose steeply from 1946 to 1979 total military aid to el salvador was 167 million in reagans first year in office the figure rose to 82 million

congress was sufficiently embarrassed by the killings in el salvador to require that before any more aid was given the president must certify that progress in human rights was taking place reagan did not take this seriously on january 28 1982 there were reports of a government massacre of peasants in several villages the following day reagan certified that the salvadoran government was making progress in human rights three days after certification soldiers stormed the homes of poor people in san salvador dragged out twenty people and killed them

when at the end of 1983 congress passed a law to continue the requirement of certification reagan vetoed it

the press was especially timid and obsequious during the reagan years as mark hertsgaard documents in his book on bended knee when journalist raymond bonner continued to report on the atrocities in el salvador and on the us role the new york times removed him from his assignment back in 1981 bonner had reported on the massacre of hundreds of civilians in the town of el mozote by a battalion of soldiers trained by the united states the reagan administration scoffed at the account but in 1992 a team of forensic anthropologists began unearthing skeletons from the site of the massacre most of them children the following year a un commission confirmed the story of the massacre at el mozote

the reagan administration which did not appear at all offended by military juntas governing in latin america guatemala el salvador chile if they were friendly to the united states became very upset when a tyranny was hostile as was the government of muammar khadafi in libya in 1986 when unknown terrorists bombed a discotheque in west berlin killing a us serviceman the white house immediately decided to retaliate khadafi was probably responsible for various acts of terrorism over the years but there was no real evidence that in this case he was to blame

reagan was determined to make a point planes were sent over the capital city of tripoli with specific instructions to aim at khadafis house the bombs fell on a crowded city perhaps a hundred people were killed it was estimated by foreign diplomats in tripoli khadafi was not injured but an adopted daughter of his was killed

professor stephen shalom analyzing this incident writes imperial alibis if terrorism is defined as politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets then one of the most serious incidents of international terrorism of the year was precisely this us raid on libya

early in the presidency of george bush there came the most dramatic developments on the international scene since the end of world war ii in the year 1989 with a dynamic new leader mikhail gorbachev at the head of the soviet union the long suppressed dissatisfaction with dictatorships of the proletariat which had turned out to be dictatorships over the proletariat erupted all through the soviet bloc

there were mass demonstrations in the soviet union and in the countries of eastern europe which had been long dominated by the soviet union east germany agreed to unite with west germany and the wall separating east berlin from west berlin long a symbol of the tight control of its citizens by east germany was dismantled in the presence of wildly exultant citizens of both germanies in czechoslovakia a new noncommunist government came into being headed by a playwright and former imprisoned dissident named vaclav havel in poland bulgaria hungary a new leadership emerged promising freedom and democracy and remarkably all this took place without civil war in response to overwhelming popular demand

in the united states the republican party claimed that the hardline policies of reagan and the increase in military expenditures had brought down the soviet union but the change had begun much earlier after the death of stalin in 1953 and especially with the leadership of nikita khrushchev a remarkably open discussion had been initiated

but the continued hard line of the united states became an obstacle to further liberalization according to former ambassador to the soviet union george kennan who wrote that the general effect of cold war extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the soviet union by the end of the 1980s while the press and politicians in the united states exulted over the collapse of the soviet union kennan pointed out that not only did american policies delay this collapse but these cold war policies were carried on at a frightful cost to the american people

we paid with forty years of enormous and otherwise unnecessary military expenditures we paid through the cultivation of nuclear weaponry to the point where the vast and useless nuclear arsenal had become and remains today a danger to the very environment of the planet  

the sudden collapse of the soviet union left the political leadership of the united states unprepared military interventions had been undertaken in korea and vietnam with enormous loss of life also in cuba and the dominican republic and huge amounts of military aid had been given all over the world—in europe africa latin america the middle east asia—on the supposition that this was necessary to deal with a communist menace emanating from the soviet union several trillion dollars had been taken from american citizens in the form of taxes to maintain a huge nuclear and nonnuclear arsenal and military bases all over the world—all primarily justified by the soviet threat

here then was an opportunity for the united states to reconstruct its foreign policy and to free hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the budget to be used for constructive healthy projects

but this did not happen along with the exultation we have won the cold war came a kind of panic what can we do to maintain our military establishment

it became clearer now although it had been suspected that united states foreign policy was not simply based on the existence of the soviet union but was motivated by fear of revolution in various parts of the world the radical social critic noam chomsky had long maintained that the appeal to security was largely fraudulent the cold war framework having been employed as a device to justify the suppression of independent nationalism—whether in europe japan or the third world world orders old and new

the fear of independent nationalism was that this would jeopardize powerful american economic interests revolutions in nicaragua or cuba or el salvador or chile were threats to united fruit anaconda copper international telephone and telegraph and others thus foreign interventions presented to the public as in the national interest were really undertaken for special interests for which the american people were asked to sacrifice their sons and their tax dollars

the cia now had to prove it was still needed the new york times february 4 1992 declared that in a world where the postwar enemy has ceased to exist the cia and its handful of sister agencies with their billiondollar satellites and mountains of classified documents must somehow remain relevant in the minds of americans

the military budget remained huge the cold war budget of 300 billion was reduced by 7 percent to 280 billion the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff colin powell said i want to scare the hell out of the rest of the world i dont say that in a bellicose way

as if to prove that the gigantic military establishment was still necessary the bush administration in its fouryear term launched two wars a small one against panama and a massive one against iraq

coming into office in 1989 george bush was embarrassed by the new defiant posture of panamas dictator general manuel noriega noriegas regime was corrupt brutal authoritarian but president reagan and vicepresident bush had overlooked this because noriega was useful to the united states he cooperated with the cia in many ways such as offering panama as a base for contra operations against the sandinista government of nicaragua and meeting with colonel oliver north to discuss sabotage targets in nicaragua when he was director of the cia in 19761977 bush had protected noriega

but by 1987 noriegas usefulness was over his activities in the drug trade were in the open and he became a convenient target for an administration which wanted to prove that the united states apparently unable to destroy the castro regime or the sandinistas or the revolutionary movement in el salvador was still a power in the caribbean

claiming that it wanted to bring noriega to trial as a drug trafficker he had been indicted in florida on that charge and also that it needed to protect us citizens a military man and his wife had been threatened by panamanian soldiers the united states invaded panama in december 1989 with 26000 troops

it was a quick victory noriega was captured and brought to florida to stand trial where he was subsequently found guilty and sent to prison but in the invasion neighborhoods in panama city were bombarded and hundreds perhaps thousands of civilians were killed it was estimated that 14000 were homeless writer mark hertsgaard noted that even if the official pentagon figure of several hundred civilian casualties was correct this meant that in panama the us had killed as many people as did the chinese government in its notorious attack on student demonstrators at tiananmen square in beijing six months earlier a new president friendly to the united states was installed in panama but poverty and unemployment remained and in 1992 the new york times reported that the invasion and removal of noriega failed to stanch the flow of illicit narcotics through panama

the united states however succeeded in one of its aims to reestablish its strong influence over panama the times reported the president of panama and his key aides and the american ambassador deane hinton have breakfast together once a week in a meeting that many panamanians view as the place where important decisions are taken

liberal democrats john kerry and ted kennedy of massachusetts and many others declared their support of the military action the democrats were being true to their historic role as supporters of military intervention anxious to show that foreign policy was bipartisan they seemed determined to show they were as tough or as ruthless as the republicans

but the panama operation was on too small a scale to accomplish what both the reagan and bush administrations badly wanted to overcome the american publics abhorrence since vietnam of foreign military interventions

two years later the gulf war against iraq presented such an opportunity iraq under the brutal dictatorship of saddam hussein had taken over its small but oilrich neighbor kuwait in august 1990

george bush needed something at this point to boost his popularity among american voters the washington post october 16 1990 had a frontpage story headline poll shows plunge in public confidence bushs rating plummets the post reported october 28 some observers in his own party worry that the president will be forced to initiate combat to prevent further erosion of his support at home

on october 30 a secret decision was made for war against iraq the united nations had responded to the invasion of kuwait by establishing sanctions against iraq witness after witness testified before congressional committees in the fall of 1990 that the sanctions were having an effect and should continue secret cia testimony to the senate affirmed that iraqs imports and exports had been reduced by more than 90 percent because of the sanctions

but after the november elections brought gains for the democrats in congress bush doubled american military forces in the gulf to 500000 creating what was now clearly an offensive force rather than a defensive one according to elizabeth drew a writer for the new yorker bushs aide john sununu was telling people that a short successful war would be pure political gold for the president and would guarantee his reelection

historian jon wiener analyzing the domestic context of the war decision shortly afterward wrote that bush abandoned sanctions and chose war because his time frame was a political one set by the approaching 1992 presidential elections

that and the longtime us wish to have a decisive voice in the control of middle east oil resources were the crucial elements in the decision to go to war against iraq shortly after the war as representatives of the thirteen oilproducing nations were about to gather in geneva the business correspondent of the new york times wrote by virtue of its military victory the united states is likely to have more influence in the organization of petroleum exporting countries than any industrial nation has ever exercised

but those motives were not presented to the american public it was told that the united states wanted to liberate kuwait from iraqi control the major media dwelled on this as a reason for war without noting that other countries had been invaded without the united states showing such concern east timor by indonesia iran by iraq lebanon by israel mozambique by south africa to say nothing of countries invaded by the united states itself—grenada panama

the justification for war that seemed most compelling was that iraq was on its way to building a nuclear bomb but the evidence for this was very weak before the crisis over kuwait western intelligence sources had estimated it would take iraq three to ten years to build a nuclear weapon even if iraq could build a bomb in a year or two which was the most pessimistic estimate it had no delivery system to send it anywhere besides israel already had nuclear weapons and the united states had perhaps 30000 of them the bush administration was trying hard to develop a paranoia in the nation about an iraqi bomb which did not yet exist

bush seemed determined to go to war there had been several chances to negotiate an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait right after the invasion including an iraqi proposal reported on august 29 by newsday correspondent knut royce but there was no response from the united states when secretary of state james baker went to geneva to meet with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz the instruction from bush was no negotiations

despite months of exhortation from washington about the dangers of saddam hussein surveys showed that less than half of the public favored military action

in january 1991 bush apparently feeling the need for support asked congress to give him the authority to make war this was not a declaration of war as called for by the constitution but since korea and vietnam that provision of the constitution seemed dead and even the strict constructionists on the supreme court who prided themselves on taking the words of the constitution literally and seriously would not intervene

the debate in congress was lively at one point a senate speech was interrupted by protesters in the balcony shouting no blood for oil the protesters were hustled out by guards it is likely that bush was sure of having enough votes or he would have launched the invasion without congressional approval after all the precedent for ignoring congress and the constitution had been set in korea vietnam grenada and panama

the senate voted for military action by only a few votes the house supported the resolution by a larger majority however once bush ordered the attack on iraq both houses with just a few dissents democrats as well as republicans voted to support the war and support the troops

it was in midjanuary 1991 after saddam hussein defied an ultimatum to leave kuwait that the us launched its air war against iraq it was given the name desert storm the government and the media had conjured up a picture of a formidable military power but iraq was far from that the us air force had total control of the air and could bomb at will

not only that us officials had virtual total control of the airwaves the american public was overwhelmed with television photos of smart bombs and confident statements that laser bombs were being guided with perfect precision to military targets the major networks presented all of these claims without question or criticism

this confidence in smart bombs sparing civilians may have contributed to a shift in public opinion from being equally divided on going to war to perhaps 85 percent support for the invasion perhaps more important in winning over public support was that once american military were engaged it seemed to many people who had previously opposed military action that to criticize it now meant betraying the troops who were there all over the nation yellow ribbons were displayed as a symbol of support for the forces in iraq

in fact the public was being deceived about how smart the bombs being dropped on iraqi towns were after talking with former intelligence and air force officers a correspondent for the boston globe reported that perhaps 40 percent of the laserguided bombs dropped in operation desert storm missed their targets

john lehman secretary of the navy under president reagan estimated there had been thousands of civilian casualties the pentagon officially had no figure on this a senior pentagon official told the globe to tell you the truth were not really focusing on this question

a reuters dispatch from iraq described the destruction of a seventythreeroom hotel in a town south of baghdad and quoted an egyptian witness they hit the hotel full of families and then they came back to hit it again reuters reported that the air raids on iraq first used laserguided bombs but within a few weeks turned to b52s which carried conventional bombs meaning more indiscriminate bombing

american reporters were kept from seeing the war closeup and their dispatches were subject to censorship apparently recalling how press reports of civilian casualties had affected public opinion during the vietnam war the us government was taking no chances this time

a washington post reporter complained about the control of information writing january 22 1991

the bombing has involved dozens of highflying b52 bombers equipped with huge unguided munitions but the pentagon has not allowed interviews with b52 pilots shown videotapes of their actions or answered any questions about the operations of an aircraft that is the most deadly and least accurate in the armada of more than 2000 us and allied planes in the persian gulf region 

in midfebruary us planes dropped bombs on an air raid shelter in baghdad at four in the morning killing 400 to 500 people an associated press reporter who was one of few allowed to go to the site said most of the recovered bodies were charred and mutilated beyond recognition some clearly were children the pentagon claimed it was a military target but the ap reporter on the scene said no evidence of any military presence could be seen inside the wreckage other reporters who inspected the site agreed

after the war fifteen washington news bureau chiefs complained in a joint statement that the pentagon exercised virtual total control  over the american press during the gulf war

but while it was happening leading television news commentators behaved as if they were working for the united states government for instance cbs correspondent dan rather perhaps the most widely seen of the tv newsmen reported from saudi arabia on a film showing a laser bomb this one dropped by british aircraft in support of the american war hitting a marketplace and killing civilians rathers only comment was we can be sure that saddam hussein will make propaganda of these casualties

when the soviet government tried to negotiate an end to the war bringing iraq out of kuwait before the ground war could get under way top cbs correspondent lesley stahl asked another reporter isnt this the nightmare scenario arent the soviets trying to stop us ed siegel tv reporter for the boston globe february 23 1991

the final stage of the war barely six weeks after it had begun was a ground assault which like the air war encountered virtually no resistance with victory certain and the iraqi army in full flight us planes kept bombing the retreating soldiers who clogged the highway out of kuwait city a reporter called the scene a blazing hell  a gruesome testament  to the east and west across the sand lay the bodies of those fleeing

a yale professor of military history michael howard writing in the new york times january 28 1991 quoted the military strategist clausewitz approvingly the fact that a bloody slaughter is a horrifying act must make us take war more seriously but not provide an excuse for gradually blunting our swords in the name of humanity howard went on to say in this conflict of wills the bottom line remains a readiness to kill and be killed   

the human consequences of the war became shockingly clear after its end when it was revealed that the bombings of iraq had caused starvation disease and the deaths of tens of thousands of children a un team visiting iraq immediately after the war reported that the recent conflict has wrought nearapocalyptic results upon the infrastructure most means of modern life support have been destroyed or rendered tenuous

a harvard medical team reporting in may said that child mortality had risen steeply and that 55000 more children died in the first four months of the year the war lasted from january 15 to february 28 than in a comparable period the year before

the director of a pediatric hospital in baghdad told a new york times reporter that on the first night of the bombing campaign the electricity was knocked out mothers grabbed their children out of incubators took intravenous tubes out of their arms others were removed from oxygen tents and they ran to the basement where there was no heat i lost more than 40 prematures in the first 12 hours of the bombing

although in the course of the war saddam hussein had been depicted by us officials and the press as another hitler the war ended short of a march into baghdad leaving hussein in power it seemed that the united states had wanted to weaken him but not to eliminate him in order to keep him as a balance against iran in the years before the gulf war the united states had sold arms to both iran and iraq at different times favoring one or the other as part of the traditional balance of power strategy

therefore as the war ended the united states did not support iraqi dissidents who wanted to overthrow the regime of saddam hussein a new york times dispatch from washington datelined march 26 1991 reported president bush has decided to let president saddam hussein put down rebellions in his country without american intervention rather than risk the splintering of iraq according to official statements and private briefings today

this left the kurdish minority which was rebelling against saddam hussein helpless and anti hussein elements among the iraqi majority were also left hanging the washington post reported may 3 1991 major defections from the iraqi military were in the offing in march at the height of the kurdish rebellion but never materialized because the officers concluded the us would not back the uprising

the man who had been jimmy carters national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski a month after the end of the gulf war gave a cold assessment of the pluses and minuses of the event the benefits are undeniably impressive first a blatant act of aggression was rebuffed and punished second us military power is henceforth likely to be taken more seriously third the middle east and persian gulf region is now clearly an american sphere of preponderance

brzezinski however was concerned about some negative consequences one of them was that the very intensity of the air assault on iraq gives rise to concern that the conduct of the war may come to be seen as evidence that americans view arab lives as worthless and that raises the moral question of the proportionality of response

his point about arab lives being seen as worthless was underlined by the feet that the war provoked an ugly wave of antiarab racism in the united states with arabamericans insulted or beaten or threatened with death there were bumper stickers that said i dont brake for iraqis an arabamerican businessman was beaten in toledo ohio

brzezinskis measured assessment of the gulf war could be taken as close to representing the view of the democratic party it went along with the bush administration it was pleased with the results it had some misgivings about civilian casualties but it did not constitute an opposition

president george bush was satisfied as the war ended he declared on a radio broadcast the specter of vietnam has been buried forever in the desert sands of the arabian peninsula

the establishment press very much agreed the two leading news magazines time and newsweek had special editions hailing the victory in the war noting there had been only a few hundred american casualties without any mention of iraqi casualties a new york times editorial march 30 1991 said americas victory in the persian gulf war  provided special vindication for the us army which brilliantly exploited its firepower and mobility and in the process erased memories of its grievous difficulties in vietnam
