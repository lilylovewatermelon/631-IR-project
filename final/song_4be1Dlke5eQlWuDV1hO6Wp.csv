standing here on this cold ground
tears falling down in the dirt
this world keeps spinning round and round but
youre lying still in the dirt
dont wanna swim in this darkness
drown in a whiskey sea
but theres no making sense of the senseless while this
pain is killing me

chorus
theres not a stone in my heart ive left unturned
not a piece of my soul that i aint searched
the only answer i found for all this hurt
is there aint not answer here on earth

verse 2
i aint the best of believers
aint at the front of the church
ive read the words of the teacher but i
still struggle with what its all worth cause

chorus
theres not a stone in my heart ive left unturned
not a piece of my soul that i aint searched
the only answer i found for all this hurt
is there aint not answer here on earth

i wish that i could be stronger
i wanna have that kind of faith
but even if i did i still wonder cause
nothing would change

bridge
youre gone youre gone youre gone youre gone youre gone
cause youre gone youre gone youre gone youre gone youre gone
please help me believe
im on my knees
help me believe

chorus
theres not a stone in my heart ive left unturned
not a piece of my soul that i aint searched
the only answer i found for all this hurt
is there aint not answers here on earth
down here on earth
theres no answers here on earth
here on earth
