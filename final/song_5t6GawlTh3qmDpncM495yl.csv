the sweat is dancing on your skin
and i cant help this devils grin
temperatures rising in your eyes and the way youre looking girl

prechorus
you know you got me
wrapped around your finger and your body
more than just a passin fascination set me blazin
when i felt it
your hands all over me like they were velvet
theres no way to temper this desire im on fire tonight

chorus
more than a fever ooh ooh
girl youve got the red line on the rise
more than a fever ooh oohoo
i dont wanna break it tonight
ooh oooh oooh

verse 2
nothings gonna cool me down
swimming in the sheets lets drown
baby pull me under theres no wonder the way youre looking girl

prechorus
you know you got me
wrapped around your finger and your body
more than just a passin fascination set me blazin
when i felt it
your hands all over me like they were velvet
theres no way to temper this desire im on fire tonight
