well cant you see that its just raining
there aint no need to go outside

verse 1
but baby you hardly even notice
when i try to show you this
song its meant to keep you
from doing what youre supposed to
like waking up too early
maybe we could sleep in
make you banana pancakes
pretend like its the weekend now

chorus
and we could pretend it all the time
cant you see that its just raining
there aint no need to go outside

verse 2
but just maybe
hala ka ukulele
mama made a baby
really dont mind the practice
cause youre my little lady
lady lady love me
cause i love to lay here lazy
we could close the curtains
pretend like theres no world outside

and we could pretend it all the time
and cant you see that its just raining
there aint no need to go outside

postchorus
aint no need aint no need
mmmmmmmmmmmm
cant you see cant you see
rain all day and i dont mind

bridge
but the telephone singing ringing its too early dont pick it up
we dont need to
we got everything we need right here and everything we need is enough
just so easy when
the whole world fits inside of your arms
do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
wake up slow mmmmmm wake up slow

verse 1
but baby
you hardly even notice
when i try to show you this
song its meant to keep you
from doing what youre supposed to
like waking up too early
maybe we could sleep in
make you banana pancakes
pretend like its the weekend now
chorus
and we could pretend it all the time
cant you see that its just raining
there aint no need to go outside

outro
aint no need aint no need
rain all day and i really really really dont mind
