i ride east every other friday
but if i had it my way
a day would not be wasted on this drive
and i want so bad to hold you
son theres things i havent told you
your mom and me couldnt get along

chorus
so ill drive
and i think about my life
and wonder why
that i slowly die inside
every time i turn that truck around right at the georgia line
and i count the days and the miles back home to you
on that highway 20 ride

verse 2
a day might come youll realize
that if you see through my eyes
there was no other way to work it out
and a part of you might hate me
but son please dont mistake me
for a man that didnt care at all

chorus
and ill drive
and ill think about my life
and wonder why
that i slowly die inside
every time i turn that truck around right at the georgia line
and i count the days and the miles back home to you
on that highway 20 ride
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeoutro
so when you drive
and the years go flying by
i hope you smile
if i ever cross your mind
it was a pleasure of my life
and i cherished every time
and my whole world
it begins and ends with you
on that highway 20 ride
woah 20 ride
woah 20 ride
woah highway 20 ride
woah 20 ride
