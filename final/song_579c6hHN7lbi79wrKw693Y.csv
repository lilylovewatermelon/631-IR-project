are you overloaded cant decode it
your lifes imploding now
theres a risk worth takin a pain worth achin
on this hollow ground
we can let go dont hold onto
all of lifes hardest parts
when we think of stoppin lets keep on rockin
to the rhythm of our hearts

jump on over there
where the air is clearer

win in our own race
become a broken chain yeah
we are broken chains yeah
