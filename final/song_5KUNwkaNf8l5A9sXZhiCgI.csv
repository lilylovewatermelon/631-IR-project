verse 1 mr fantastik
type profile low like a in paid in full
attract heavy cash cause the games centrifugal
mr fantastik long dough like elastic
guard my life with twin glocks thats made out of plastic
cant stand a brownnosin nigga fake ass bastard
admirin my style tour bus through manhattan
plottin plan the quickest my flows the sickest
my hoes be the thickest my dro the stickiest
street nigga stamped and bonafide
when beef jump niggas come get me cause they know i ride
true to the ski mask new yorks my origin
play a fake gangsta like an old accordion
accordin to him when the ds rushed in
complication from the wire testimony was thin
caused his man to go up north the ball hit em again
