i know what i said was heat
of the moment
but theres a little truth in
between the words weve spoken
its a little late now to fix a heart
thats broken
please dont ask me where im going

chorus
cause i dont know no i dont know
anymore
it used feel like heaven it used feel like
may i used to hear those violins playing
harp strings like a symphony
now theyve gone away
nobody wants to face the truth
but you wont believe what love can do
till it happens to you
till it happens to you

verse 2
went to the old flat
guess i was trying to turn the clock back
but how come that nothing feels the same now
when im with you
we used to stay up all night in the kitchen when
our love was new
ooh love am i a fool to believe in you

cause i dont know no i dont know anymore
it used feel like heaven it used feel like may
i used hear those violins playing harp strings
like a symphony now there gone away
nobody wants to know the truth until their
hearts broken
dont you dare tell them what you think to do
until they get over you can only learn these things
from experience when you get older
i just wish that someone wouldve told me
till it happens to you
till it happens to you
till it happens to you2embed"
