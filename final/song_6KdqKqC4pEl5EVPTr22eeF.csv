you’re the lonely
one and only body in the world
who can make me
who can break me down into a young girl
you say that love is not that easy
and that’s the lesson that you teach me
so hypocritical overly cynical
i’m sick and tired of all your preaching

chorus
who are you to tell me tell me
who to to be to be

verse 2
you’re my last bone of contention
that could break at any mention
you’re the last wall that will stand tall
till the end of the world
i know you only want to own me
and that’s the kind of love you show me
you tell me one thing and do another
keep all your secrets undercover

chorus
who are you to tell me tell me
who to to be to be
