i wouldnt recommend what i have done
oh the prophets pointed out where i went wrong
singing woohoo go figure out your desire

we fall down we go there we go anywhere woohoo oo

my mistakes land like embers on your tongue
in the foreground youre still busy getting young
singing woohoo go figure out your desire
ooo my darling stand by your gun

chorus
see we dont need
no nothing more
were quite attached to the fortyfour
take a chance
take our words
we fall down we go there we go anywhere singing
