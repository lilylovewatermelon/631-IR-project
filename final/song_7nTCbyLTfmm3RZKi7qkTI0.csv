intro
verse 1
we’re on the same street as the devil
i’ve shook his hand
i can tell you i ain’t ever
feared another man
i’m far from the same just shy of shappels
some know what i mean
i’ve done things that would make your skin crawl baby
but i’m ten years clean

chorus
runnin’ round  runnin’ round
when it comes to lonely
i know that sound
runnin’ round  runnin’ round
cause i’ve been lost
more than i’ve been found

verse 2
whiskey and codeine
was my poison of choice
that was long before my babies
and i found my voice
i picked up a piercе and started ridin’ y’all
and it became hеalin’ for me
but even after all these years now
it’s still plain to see
you might also likechorus
i’m runnin’ round  runnin’ round
when it comes to lonely
i know the sound
runnin’ round  runnin’ round
i’ve been lost oh
more than i’ve been found

solo
chorus
runnin’ round  runnin’ round

cause i’ve been lost
oh i’ve been lost
more than i’ve been found

outro
were on the same street as the devil
i’ve shook his handembed"
