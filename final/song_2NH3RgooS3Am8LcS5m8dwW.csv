summers gone
and no songbirds are singing

gone from my arms

what to do
oh im left here just crying
over you
oh im so blue
what can i do
now that youre gone

the days they grow long now that youre gone
my nights they leave me blue are so blue
i dont know why there are tears in my eyes
can it mean that im still in love with you
