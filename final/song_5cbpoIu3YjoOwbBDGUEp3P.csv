i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire exhale desire
i know its dire my time today
i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

verse 1
sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it my pride is no longer inside
its on my sleeve my skin will scream
reminding me of who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that im driving theres no hiding for me
im forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel

refrain
i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i ponder of something terrifying
cause this time theres no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and its that were all battling fear
oh dear i dont know if we know why were here
oh my too deep please stop thinking
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
anda from the two that we choose to do
peace will win and fear will lose
and theres faith and theres sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think

refrain
i have these thoughts so often i ought
to replace that slot with what i once bought
cause somebody stole my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

woah ohohoh
woah ohohoh
woah ohohoh
woah ohohoh
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit in silence
and now i just sit
refrain
i ponder of something great

i know its dire my time today
