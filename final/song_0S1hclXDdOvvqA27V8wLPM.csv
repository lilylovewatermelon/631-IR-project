yeah

verse 1
i cant believe what ive seen so scratch my eyes out
you were at ease on your knees in his apartment
you said his name as i came in your direction
now i can choose what to do with both of you

prechorus
i loved you i hate you
you hurt me i loved you
i loved you
you hurt me bad
go

chorus
your words bury me of what i used to be
i cant erase all those things ive seen
your heart smothers me now its hard to breathe
i cant erase all my memories

verse 2
i take a step to the left now you see me
tears start to pour as you crawl in his apartment
you screamed his name as i came in your direction
fists start to fly say goodbye theres no excuses
