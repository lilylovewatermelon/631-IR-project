the sun is falling down outside the city walls
shes glowin like the cherry on my cigarette
beads of sweat are diamonds drippin down her neck
i cannot take my eyes off her silhouette

god you really outdid yourself with this one
shes an overnight sensation

but im talking playboy 1974

read between your tan lines forevermore

overnight sensation
god you really outdid yourself with this one
shes an overnight sensation

the sun is risin up outside this balcony
