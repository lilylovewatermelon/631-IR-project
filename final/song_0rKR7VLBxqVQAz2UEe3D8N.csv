verse 1 substantial
you bust lead so do i word
except mine impregnates the page giving birth to thoughts that unify huh
you fuck little girls what i make love to women
my words uplift yours are poisonous like venom yeah yeah
im an emcee youre a rapper
im as real as they come while half the guys you idolize are just actors
you run from commitment i remain loyal
you call women bitches i call ‘em queens ‘cause theyre royal
you make rap songs i make soul music
when god speaks through rhythm will you go to it
yo i save my cash yours you blow through it
i say “your childs special” you say “hes so stupid”
im pouring my heart out in everything written
youre scared you look soft heart remains hidden
aiyo on touchy subjects nerves i stay hitting
but i aint better than you i just think different

im out doing it while you talk about it
im constantly in the mix while you walk around it

i get the job done you fail and make excuses
im a gentleman your behaviors abusive

verse 3 substantial
you fall in love with body parts yeah i do i connect mentally
with my female counterpart before we bond physically
cats i chill with rap about revolution
while you rap about drug abuse and distribution just keeping it real
you wanna be like mike yo i wanna be me
my queens hard to obtain and yours is easy
we both from maryland but we’re repping dc
we all front sometimes—thats how emcees be
my word is bond and yours is worthless
youre mainstream im beneath the surface
i stay working hard while youre hardly working
all you want is money and your dick sucked damn right—are you certain
yo i want a better world for our seeds to live in
i put faith in myself not the system
yo we’re trying to travel so why you making pit stops
you cats is rap and im hip hop
