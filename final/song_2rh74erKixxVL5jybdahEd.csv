youre weak on the surface
you speak when you’re nervous
and all the wrong words seem right in your head
you cant stand the space in your bed
so you shake in the darkness
you break like an artist
and all your big plans are small the next day
you cant wait to throw them away

prechorus
you perseverate
and the truth might be a million miles away

chorus
hide your secrets disguise your weakness
and lose yourself inside your busyhead
burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
all alone inside your busyhead
your busyhead

verse 2
you sleep in the moment but dream like a poet
and all your good grace like faded tattoos
you spend your days in wait for bad news

so you perseverate
and the truth might be a million miles away

chorus
hide your secrets disguise your weakness
and lose yourself inside your busyhead
burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
all alone inside your busyhead

bridge
going nowhere
fast enough to tell a lie
give yourself an alibi
you’ve been gone lately
stand upon your peace of mind
youre bound to fall if you take your time
cause were all waiting
and you can stare below into the abyss
find a home on the edge of it
and be defined by its presence
by its size and its message
you can move along through the dark
and when you wonder where you are
youll be proud of your weakness
so busyhead just keep breathing oh
oh busyhead just keep breathing
oh busyhead just

hide your secrets disguise your weakness
and lose yourself inside your busyhead
burn your bridges and leave no witnesses
all alone inside your busyhead
youre all alone inside your busyhead
youre all alone inside your busyhead
