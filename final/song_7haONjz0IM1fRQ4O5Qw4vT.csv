focus on nothing only your face
follow me closely into the night
just one last time turn out the light
and when you wake up turn out the light

prechorus
oh no not again
my eyes are heavy again
oh please not tonight

black and blue over time
let’s see how far i can drift tonight
kissing you everyday
well never go this way again
just wake me when its over
just wake me when its over

chorus
im not afraid to go afar with you
the way the light flies right off your face
the way the nights are made of me and you

these nights are black and blue
these nights these nights are black and blue
just wake me when its over
just wake me when its over

im not afraid to go afar with you
the way the light flies right off your face
the way the nights are made of me and you

oh no not again
my eyes are heavy again
