verse 1
friday night its 1015
youre working late am i naive
to believe that its true
finally ive realized
your lies have opened up my eyes
this love affair now its over over

chorus
youve been wrong for so long
and i cant take the pain you bring me
no more
youve been wrong for so long
and i cant take the pain you bring me
no more

verse 2
here we go over again
ya got me hangin on a limb
i recommend that you leave
what do i do
what do u say
when i love you
and you dont feel the same
dont wanna play no more games
i dont wanna play it now
