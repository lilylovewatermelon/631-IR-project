verse 1
pretty thing youre makin me go back
lookin like a shania twain throwback
picture perfect girl i gotta post that
sippin seven and seven in your seven jeans
put on a string a little rip on the seam
a southern boys dream like a movie scene
so go on shake your thing like a leaf
nobody gonna see it but the moon and me
come on
