little freak jezebel
you sit high atop the kitchen counter
stay green a little while
you bring blue lights to dreams
starry haze crystal ball
somehow youve become some paranoia
a wet dream just dangling
but your gift is wasted on me

chorus
i was thinkin about who you are
your delicate point of view
i was thinkin about you
im not worried about where you are
or who you will go home to
im just thinkin about you
just thinkin about you

verse 2
did you dress up for halloween
i spilled beer on your friend im not sorry
a golf swing and a trampoline
maybe well do this again
tracksuit and a ponytail
you hide the body all that yoga gave you
red wine and a ginger ale
but you would make fun of me for sure
you might also likechorus
i was thinkin about who you are
your delicate point of view
i was thinkin about you
im not worried about where you are
or who you will go home to
im just thinkin about you

verse 3
i disrespected you
jumped in feet first and i landed too hard
a broken ankle karma rules
you never saw my birthmark

chorus
i was thinkin about who you are
your delicate point of view
i was thinkin about you
im not worried about where you are
or who you will go home to
im just thinkin about you

outro
just thinkin about you
just thinkin about you28embed"
