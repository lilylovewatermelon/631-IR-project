all by myself trying to get back home
always acute waiting to cast a stone
and im not sorry
and i i dont feel ashamed

prechorus
because im not one to look out
for personal glory
im not one to stay out
of my own true story

chorus
did someone notice me when i walked on by
did someone take the time to recognize
that sometimes words will sting
and hearts may die
did someone notice me when i said goodbye

verse 2
how long did you think that i would last
cause ive seen the cycle and people turn their backs
and i dont care now
cause i im not scared now

prechorus
because im not one to look out
for personal glory
im not one to stay out
of my own true story

if i say to you
what if you were me
would you stand your ground and choose in what you believe
or would you run from who you are and give up easily
i know just how you feel
its no surprise to me

chorus
did someone notice me when i walked on by
did someone take the time to recognize
that sometimes words will sting
and hearts may die
did someone notice me when i said goodbye
