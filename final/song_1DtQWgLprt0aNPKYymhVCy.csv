well there was a little falter at the altar of confession
down on its knees true love did fall
after 31 days of sleepless nights she woke up to end it all
with i love you on a fresh tattoo engraved upon his chest
she tore her name right off his heart
so heres to the unblessed

chorus
oh love oh love you fickle thing
such pretty words and golden rings
it was a broken dream right from the start
bless their tortured tangled hearts

verse 2
well a blast of confusion coupled with delusion
makes the best made plans sometimes fail
they wined and they dined had peace of mind
she bought a gown and he rented tails
but the mighty cloud of destiny came drifting through the gates
and busted up what could have been a perfect hopeless case

chorus x2
oh love oh love you fickle thing
such pretty words and golden rings
it was a broken dream right from the start
bless their tortured tangled heartsyou might also likeembed"
