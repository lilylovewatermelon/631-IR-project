conversations that went on terrible paths
dont talk about that no no dont talk about that
were coming back loud ending this conversation

verse 2
said you let your hair down
youve got enough to go round oh my
said youd let your hair down
but youve been telling me that since the day we met
shes laughing like a choir girl
shes laughing like a choir girl
shes laughing like a choir girl
when she doubles over sounds like hallelujah

verse 3
shes talking to my mother
shes on the phone with my mother
shes talking to my mother
shes looking up at me like im a criminal

verse 4
she bargains like a lawyer
sacrifice like a martyr
shes just her mothers daughter
cutting cloth and washing a pan
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeverse 5
we were still just babies
dreaming of the 60s
we were still just babies
dressing up in rags with our wallets full

verse 6
now our pockets are shallow coin runnin low
i saw theyre empty but im just a fool
roman in the kitchen told me that true love it waits
but of all the rules he lives by thats the one that he hates1embed"
