stuck in the clouds
thats my story and im sticking to it
im high as a kite
donâ€™t bother me
im out here probably doing the most

verse 2
from the minute i wake up im staring at the screen
watching the world go insane
gotta stay connected so i know whats happening
in these streets
thank god for technology cause
where would we be if we couldnt tweet our thoughts
wont you leave some things to mystery
opening your mouth removes all doubt
so be quiet
technology is the key to it all

verse 3
where did i lose my phone at
doesnt really matter cause youre already behind the curve
its okay to disconnect sometimes
were out here doing the mostsee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like4embed"
