i know the rain like the clouds know the sky
i speak to birds and tell them where to fly
i sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
i write the names of the rocks and the trees

chorus
oh you fool there are rules i am coming for you
darkness brings evil things oh the reckoning begins

verse 2
i tried to warn you when you were a child
i told you not to get lost in the wild
i sent you omens and all kinds of signs
i taught you melodies poems and rhymes

chorus
oh you fool there are rules i am coming for you
you can run but you cant escape
darkness brings evil things oh the reckoning begins
you will open the yawning grave

chorus
oh you fool there are rules i am coming for you
you can run but you cant escape
darkness brings evil things oh the reckoning begins
you will open the yawning gravesee lord huron liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like2embed"
