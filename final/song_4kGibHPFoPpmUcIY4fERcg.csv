grand old opry music show playing on my radio
fiddle and a steel guitar in some little redneck bar
parking lot full of four wheel drives
you wont hear no hip hop jive
cowgirls looking for cowboys
twostep to that old white noise

chorus
im talking about white noise coming from the white boys
i cant keep my cowboy boots from stomping
to that white noise coming from the white boys
take me where those honkys are atonking

bridge
when the evening sun goes down cruising through our little town
country girls and country boys showing off hillbilly toys

chorus

verse 2
tractor pulls and rodeos county fairs and bluegrass shows
it aint a thing about black and white
its johnny cash and charley pride
