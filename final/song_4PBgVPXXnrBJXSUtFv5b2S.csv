all of this comes crashing down
cornerstones gone
sleepless hopeless
no end in sight

refrain
inkwell has run dry
fill it with blood of the scribe

bridge
rest comes easy to the guiltless
the vampire laments as he prays for the sun

verse 2
doom despair tragedy
are the tools of the trade

chorus
cut to the bone rob the grave
unearth the stone lay to waste
defile the tome rip the page
stripmine the vein lay to waste

verse 3
frayed at the edge flatlined
the anvil cracks the hammer
relentlessly comes down
a new pariah is born
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
cut to the bone rob the grave
unearth the stone lay to waste
defile the tome rip the page
stripmine the vein lay to waste

bridge
chastisement lays you down to sleep
tucks you in with bloody kisses
gifts of nightmares
bittersweet

verse 4
type a negative shuts me down
catchphrase will be death of me
is this not what you came to see
what are you not entertained

outro
climb the walls till nails bleed
rip the hair tear the seams
break the glass head in hands
bell tolls endlessly no end in sightembed"
