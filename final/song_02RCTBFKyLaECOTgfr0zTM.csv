there was a time that i swore i would never go back
i was blind to the truth didnt know what i had
i was running i was searching
but every place i turned for healing
left me more broken than the last

chorus
take me back
to the place that feels like home
to the people i can depend on
to the faith thats in my bones
take me back
to a preacher and a verse
where theyve seen me at my worst
to the love i had at first
oh i want to go to church

verse 2
tried to walk on my own but i wound up lost
now im making my way to the foot of the cross
its not a trophy for the winners
its a shelter for the sinners
and its right where i belong

chorus
take me back
to the place that feels like home
to the people i can depend on
to the faith thats in my bones
take me back
to a preacher and a verse
where theyve seen me at my worst
to the love i had at first
oh i want to go to church
i want to go to church

oh more than an obligation
its our foundation
the family of god
i know its hard
but we need each other
were sisters and brothers

chorus
oh take me back
to the place that feels like home
to the people i can depend on
to the faith thats in my bones
take me back
to a preacher and a verse
where theyve seen me at my worst
to the love i had at first
oh i want to go to church
yeah i want to go to church take me back
oh i want to go want to go i want to go
oh i want to go to church take me back
oh i want to go to church1embed"
