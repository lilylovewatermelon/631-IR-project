verse 3 ms jade
ive been through many things
ive seen a lot of faces
a lot of you bet they peep bagged up by many cases
it aint my skin its my will im a win
right a will til the end
i dont break fo the bend
then again yall done begged bored shooters
in the streets like scooters to my shakers and movers
exploited for the green
everything aint what it seems
a different scene lanes leaving em with a va lean
it aint no magic we living up in the real world

i know its lonely at the top and i might fall
as for now follow the rules and turn them lights off
