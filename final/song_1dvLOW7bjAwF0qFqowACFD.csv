and they all fell from the sky into my eye
i did not cry i felt alive and not so blind anymore
oh i yelled out into the atmosphere
i hope youre here
oh they say how i was gone for a long time
but for me it was five minutes aye
thats relativity for you
i could show you euphoria and you wouldnt even know ah
no you wouldnt even know
itd just be a subconscious plant in your mind
a subconscious plant in your minds eye

verse 2
i dont know why i cry i lie but i
just feel my way through life
and try to be that shining light
for you and for me
oh we dont get an eternity oh
its all an eternity
i dont know why i cry i lie but i
just feel my way through life
and try to be that shining light
for you and for me

verse 3
love runs out in a flash
i could never stick with it
but it always sticks with me
love runs out in a flash
i could never stick with it
but it always sticks with me
