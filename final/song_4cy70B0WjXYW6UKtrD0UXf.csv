i cant get you close enough
i cant get you close enough
i cant get you close enough
i cant get you close enough
mmmh

verse 1
it aint like this 15 hundred miles between us
and it aint been but 15 minutes since ive seen ya
your side of the love seat might as well be california
and my side feels like carolina girl the way i want ya

chorus
cause i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough
its touching going might go crazy everytime we touch
if theres an inch of air between our two hearts beating thats too much
cause i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough
oooh
oh oh
oooh
oh oh

verse 2
i dont just know you i know everything about you
so i just cant begin to wrap my mind around you
youre sun and rain fire and ice a whole new world behind your eyes
i want to kiss you when you close em and hold you till they open

cause i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough
its touching going might go crazy everytime we touch
if theres an inch of air between our two hearts beating thats too much
cause i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough

come over here and kiss me babe
oooh

bridge
lean on in
i need more than skin on skin

chorus
i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough
its touching going might go crazy everytime we touch
if theres an inch of air between our two hearts beating thats too much
cause i cant get you close enough i cant get you close enough
