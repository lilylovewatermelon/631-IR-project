as i get a little older i realize life is perspective
and my perspective may differ from yours
i wanna say thank you to everyone thats been down with me
all my fans all my beautiful fans
anyone whos ever gave me a listen all my people

verse 1 kendrick lamar
i come from a generation of pain where murder is minor
rebellious and margielasll chip you for designer
belt buckles and clout overzealous if prone to violence
make the wrong turn be it will or the wheel alignment
residue burned mist of the innercity
miscommunication to keep homi detective busy
no protection is risky
desensitized i vandalized pain covered up and camouflaged
get used to hearin arsenal rain
analyze risk your life take the charge
homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
thats culture
twentythree hour lockdown then somebody called
said your lil nephew was shot down the cultures involved
i done seen niggas do seventeen hit the halfway house
get out and get his brains blown out lookin to buy some weed
car wash is played out new gofundme accountsll proceed
a brandnew victimll shatter those dreams
the culture

verse 2 kendrick lamar
i said i do this for my culture
to let yall know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof rover
in my mamas sofa was a doodoo popper
hair trigger walk up closer aint no photoshoppin
friends bipolar grab you by your pockets
no option if you froze up always play the offense
niggas goin to work and sellin work late for work
workin late prayin for work but he on paperwork
thats the culture point the finger promote ya
remote location witness protection they gon hold ya
the streets got me fucked up yall can miss me
i wanna represent for us
new revolution was up and movin
im in argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
water in between us another peers been executed
history repeats again
make amends then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
but thats the culture crack a bottle
hard to deal with the pain when youre sober
by tomorrow we forget the remains we start over
thats the problem
our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
dehumanized insensitive
scrutinize the way we live for you and i
enemies shook my hand i can promise ill meet you
in the land where no equal is your equal
never say i aint told ya nah
in the land where hurt people hurt more people
fuck callin it culture
chorus kendrick lamar with marvin gaye
i want i want i want i want
but i want you to want me too i want i want i want i want
i want the hood to want me back i want i want i want i want
i want the hood
look what i done for you look what i done for you
look what i done for you

interlude kendrick lamar
take the drums out

verse 3 kendrick lamar
celebrate new life when it come back around
the purpose is in the lessons we learnin now
sacrifice personal gain over everything
just to see the next generation better than ours
i wasnt perfect the skin i was in had truly suffered
temptation impatience everything that the body nurtures
i felt the good i felt the bad and i felt the worry
but allinall my productivity had stayed urgent
face your fears always knew that i would make it here
where the energy is magnified and persevered
consciousness is synchronized and crystalclear
euphoria is glorified and made his
reflectin on my life and what i done
paid dues made rules change outta love
them same views made schools change curriculums
but didnt change me starin down the barrel of the gun
should i feel resentful i didnt see my full potential
should i feel regret about the good that i was into
everything is everything this aint coincidental
i woke up that morning with more heart to give you
as i bleed through the speakers feel my presence
to my brother to my kids im in heaven
to my mother to my sis im in heaven
to my father to my wife i am serious this is heaven
to my friends make sure you countin them blessings
to my fans make sure you make them investments
and to the killer that sped up my demise
i forgive you just know your souls in question
i seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
and though you did me gruesome i was surely relieved
i completed my mission wasnt ready to leave
but fulfilled my days my creator was pleased
i cant stress how i love yall
i dont need to be in flesh just to hug yall
the memories recollect just because yall
celebrate me with respect
the unity we protect is above all
and sam ill be watchin over you
make sure my kids watch all my interviews
make sure you live out our dreams we produced
keep that genius in your brain on the move
and to my neighborhood let the good prevail
make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
look for salvation when troubles get real
cause you cant help the world until you help yourself
and i cant blame the hood the day that i was killed
yall had to see it thats the only way to feel
and though my physical wont reap the benefits
the energy that carry on emits still
i want you201embed"
