fuck me like were lyin on our deathbed
i can feel the sudden emptiness
im here to grant your one last wish so
fuck me like were lyin on our deathbed
hear the sadness in your laughter
shes afraid of what comes after me true love

verse
i dont know when ill be back in town back in town
all i know is that shell wait around for me
all i know is that shell hold me down all i know is that shell hold me down
my girl keeps all ten toes on the ground for me
i can feel it i can feel it now
i can feel you watchin after me holdin my breath

i still feel your skin all over me
