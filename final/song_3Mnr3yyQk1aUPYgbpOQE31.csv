i know its a drag i know its a grind
i know that a dollar aint worth a dime
just trying to keep up with the joneses at the end of the block
i know you get tired i know you get down
i know you get sick of this soulsucking town
but lets make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

chorus
cause im stuck on you youre stuck on me
i never gotta wonder where my honey be
i aint savin all my sugar for a saturday night
seven days a week i got an appetite
the sunsets like a tangerine lets find a road weve never seen
dont waste another mile or a minute not kissin me
life is short make it sweet

verse 2
open sky glimpse of heaven take the top off the cj7
let that surfside santa ana wind mess up your hair
and let that windshield frame the ocean
radio keep coasttocoastin
if we dont get where were going baby i dont care
im already there

chorus
cause im stuck on you youre stuck on me
i never gotta wonder where my honey be
i aint savin all my sugar for a saturday night
seven days a week i got an appetite
the sunsets like a tangerine lets find a road weve never seen
dont waste another mile or a minute not kissin me
life is short make it sweet
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
days will be long but the years will fly right by
well never be as young as we are tonight
baby aint that right yeah

chorus
cause im stuck on you youre stuck on me
i never gotta wonder where my honey be
i aint savin all my sugar for a saturday night
seven days a week i got an appetite
the sunsets like a tangerine lets find a road weve never seen
dont waste another mile or a minute not kissin me
life is short make it sweet
life is short make it sweet
