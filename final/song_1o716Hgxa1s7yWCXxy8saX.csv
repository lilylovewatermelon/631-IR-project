midnight rush with a pen in my hand
inkin lincoln sanskrit with a fan
rememberin me before we began
sometimes i felt so def in the jam
but the ones who loved me told me to stop
like homegirl cant catch shit if it drop
a superwoman chick you know that i am
some shit dont fly by me in a man

prechorus
cause i do not accept any less
than someone just as real as fabulous

chorus
dont want no paper gangsta
wont sign away my life to
someone whos got the flavor
but dont have no followthrough
dont want no paper gangsta
wont sign no monkey papers
i dont do funny business
not interested in fakers
dont want any paper gangsta
ohoh
dont want no paper gangsta
ohoh
dont want no paper gangsta
dont want no paper gangsta

got something really shiny to start
want me to sign there on your range rover heart
i’ve heard it before yeah the dinners were nice
til your diamond words melted into some ice
you shoulda been rappin to the beat of my song

im lookin for love not an empty page
full of stuff that means nothin but you’ve been played

prechorus
cause i do not accept any less
than someone just as real as fabulous

chorus

wont sign away my life to
someone whos got the flavor
