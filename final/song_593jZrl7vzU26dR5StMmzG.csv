you said that i wasnt pretty
so i just believed you
and you said that i wasnt special
so i lived that way
with critical gazes and brutal amazement
and how my reflection could be so imperfect
with all of my blemishes
how could somebody want me

chorus
but god loves ugly
he doesnt see the way i see
oh god takes ugly
and turns it into something that is beautiful
apparently im beautiful
cause you love me
whoa oh oh

verse 2
i tried to clean up the outside
all shiny and new
worked over time to thin up and look right
but inside i knew
that deep in the bottom were secrets
i thought i could try to ignore
old ghosts in my corridors
never get tired of haunting the past thats in me

but god loves ugly
he doesnt see the way i see
oh god takes ugly
and turns it into something that is beautiful
apparently im beautiful
cause you love me

bridge
help me believe why you love me
when i know you see
you see everything
help me believe why you love me
when i know you see
inside and you still say im beautiful

outro
youre telling me im beautiful
youre screaming out im so beautiful
and im finding out im beautiful
youre making me so beautiful
and i can see im beautiful
cause you love me
whoa oh ohembed"
