verse 1
meet me in the hallway
meet me in the hallway
i just left your bedroom
give me some morphine
is there any more to do

chorus
just let me know ill be at the door at the door
hoping youll come around
just let me know ill be on the floor on the floor
maybe well work it out
i gotta get better gotta get better
i gotta get better gotta get better
i gotta get better gotta get better
and maybe well work it out

i walked the streets all day
running with the thieves
cause you left me in the hallway give me some more
just take the pain away
