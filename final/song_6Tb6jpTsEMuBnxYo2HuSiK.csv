things were all good yesterday
and then the devil took your memory
and if you fell to your death today
i hope that heaven is your restin place
i heard the doctors put your chest in pain
but then that couldve been the medicine
and now youre lyin in the bed again
either way ill cry with the rest of them

prechorus
and my father told me son
its not his fault he doesnt know your face
and youre not the only one
although my grandma used to say
that he used to sing

chorus
darlin hold me in your arms the way you did last night
and well lie inside for a little while here oh
i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
and were wrapped in light in life and love
put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
for theyre designed to be together oh
with your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
and were set alight were afire love

verse 2
and things were all good yesterday
but then the devil took your breath away
and now were left here in the pain
black suit black tie standin in the rain
and now my family is one again
stapled together with the strangers and a friend
came to my mind i should paint it with a pen
six years old i remember when

prechorus
my father told me son
its not his fault he doesnt know your face
and youre not the only one
although my grandma used to say
that he used to sing

chorus
darlin hold me in your arms the way you did last night
and well lie inside for a little while here oh
i could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
and were wrapped in light in life and love
put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
for theyre designed to be together oh
with your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
and were set alight were afire love
