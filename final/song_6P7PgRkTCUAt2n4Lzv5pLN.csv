when youre feeling lonely lost and let down
seems like those dark skies are following you around
and lifes just one big shade of gray
you wonder if youll see the light of day

chorus
behind the clouds the sun is shining
believe me even though you cant quite make it out
you may not see the silver linin
but theres a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds

verse 2
ive heard it said that this too shall pass
good times or bad times neither one lasts
but thinking that your luck wont ever change
is like thinkin it wont ever stop once it starts to rain

chorus
behind the clouds the sun is shining
believe me even though you cant quite make it out
you may not see the silver linin
but theres a big blue sky waiting right behind the clouds

outro
