in thebes directly in front of the royal palace which stands in the background its main doors facing the audience
enter antigone leading ismene away from the palace
antigone
now dear ismene my own blood sister
do you have any sense of all the troubles
zeus keeps bringing on the two of us
as long as we’re alive all that misery
which stems from oedipus there’s no suffering
no shame no ruin—not one dishonour—
which i have not seen in all the troubles
you and i go through what’s this they’re saying now
something our general has had proclaimed
throughout the city do you know of it                                      10
have you heard or have you just missed the news
dishonours which better fit our enemies
are now being piled up on the ones we love
ismene
i’ve had no word at all antigone
nothing good or bad about our family
not since we two lost both our brothers
killed on the same day by a double blow
and since the argive army just last night
has gone away i don’t know any more
if i’ve been lucky or face total ruin                                               20
antigone
i know that that’s why i brought you here
outside the gates so only you can hear
ismene
what is it the way you look makes it seem
you’re thinking of some dark and gloomy news
antigone
look—what’s creon doing with our two brothers
he’s honouring one with a full funeral
and treating the other one disgracefully
eteocles they say has had his burial
according to our customary rites
to win him honour with the dead below                                       30
but as for polyneices who perished
so miserably an order has gone out
throughout the city—that’s what people say
he’s to have no funeral or lament
but to be left unburied and unwept
a sweet treasure for the birds to look at
for them to feed on to their heart’s content
that’s what people say the noble creon
has announced to you and me—i mean to me—
and now he’s coming to proclaim the fact                                    40
to state it clearly to those who have not heard
for creon this matter’s really serious
anyone who acts against the order
will be stoned to death before the city
now you know and you’ll quickly demonstrate
whether you are nobly born or else
a girl unworthy of her splendid ancestors
ismene
oh my poor sister if that’s what’s happening
what can i say that would be any help
to ease the situation or resolve it                                                 50
antigone
think whether you will work with me in this
and act together
ismene
in what kind of work
what do you mean
antigone
will you help these hands
take up polyneices’ corpse and bury it
ismene
what you’re going to bury polyneices
when that’s been made a crime for all in thebes
antigone
yes i’ll do my duty to my brother—
and yours as well if you’re not prepared to
i won’t be caught betraying him
ismene
you’re too rash
has creon not expressly banned that act                                    60
antigone
yes but he’s no right to keep me from what’s mine
ismene
o dear think antigone consider
how our father died hated and disgraced
when those mistakes which his own search revealed
forced him to turn his hand against himself
and stab out both his eyes then that woman
his mother and his wife—her double role—
destroyed her own life in a twisted noose
then there’s our own two brothers both butchered
in a single day—that illfated pair                                                 70
with their own hands slaughtered one another
and brought about their common doom
now the two of us are left here quite alone
think how we’ll die far worse than all the rest
if we defy the law and move against
the king’s decree against his royal power
we must remember that by birth we’re women
and as such we shouldn’t fight with men
since those who rule are much more powerful
we must obey in this and in events                                               80
which bring us even harsher agonies
so i’ll ask those underground for pardon—
since i’m being compelled i will obey
those in control that’s what i’m forced to do
it makes no sense to try to do too much
antigone
i wouldn’t urge you to no not even
if you were keen to act doing this with you
would bring me no joy so be what you want
i’ll still bury him it would be fine to die
while doing that i’ll lie there with him                                        90
with a man i love pure and innocent
for all my crime my honours for the dead
must last much longer than for those up here
i’ll lie down there forever as for you
well if you wish you can show contempt
for those laws the gods all hold in honour
ismene
i’m not disrespecting them but i can’t act
against the state that’s not in my nature
antigone
let that be your excuse i’m going now
to make a burial mound for my dear brother                               100
ismene
oh poor antigone i’m so afraid for you
antigone
don’t fear for me set your own fate in order
ismene
make sure you don’t reveal to anyone
what you intend keep it closely hidden
i’ll do the same
antigone
no no announce the fact—
if you don’t let everybody know
i’ll despise your silence even more
ismene
your heart is hot to do cold deeds
antigone
but i know
i’ll please the ones i’m duty bound to please
ismene
yes if you can but you’re after something                                   110
which you’re incapable of carrying out
antigone
well when my strength is gone then i’ll give up
ismene
a vain attempt should not be made at all
antigone
i’ll hate you if you’re going to talk that way
and you’ll rightly earn the loathing of the dead
so leave me and my foolishness alone—
we’ll get through this fearful thing i won’t suffer
anything as bad as a disgraceful death
ismene
all right then go if that’s what you think right
but remember this—even though your mission                           120
makes no sense your friends do truly love you
exit antigone away from the palace ismene watches her go and then returns slowly
into the palace enter the chorus of theban elders
chorus
o ray of sunlight
most beautiful that ever shone
on thebes city of the seven gates
you’ve appeared at last
you glowing eye of golden day
moving above the streams of dirce
driving into headlong flight
the whiteshield warrior from argos
who marched here fully armed                                                    130
now forced back by your sharper power
chorus leader
against our land he marched
sent here by the warring claims
of polyneices with piercing screams
an eagle flying above our land
covered wings as white as snow
and hordes of warriors in arms
helmets topped with horsehair crests
chorus
standing above our homes
he ranged around our seven gates                                               140
with threats to swallow us
and spears thirsting to kill
before his jaws had had their fill
and gorged themselves on theban blood
before hephaistos’ pinetorch flames
had seized our towers our fortress crown
he went back driven in retreat
behind him rings the din of war—
his enemy the theban dragonsnake
too difficult for him to overcome                                                150
chorus leader
zeus hates an arrogant boasting tongue
seeing them march here in a mighty stream
in all their clanging golden pride
he hurled his fire and struck the man
up there on our battlements as he began
to scream aloud his victory
chorus
the man swing down torch still in hand
and smashed into unyielding earth—
the one who not so long ago attacked
who launched his furious enraged assault                                  160
to blast us breathing raging storms
but things turned out not as he’d hoped
great war god ares assisted us—
he smashed them down and doomed them all
to a very different fate
chorus leader
seven captains at seven gates
matched against seven equal warriors
paid zeus their full bronze tribute
the god who turns the battle tide
all but that pair of wretched men                                                 170
born of one father and one mother too—
who set their conquering spears against each other
and then both shared a common death
chorus
now victory with her glorious name
has come bringing joy to wellarmed thebes
the battle’s done—let’s strive now to forget
with songs and dancing all night long
with bacchus leading us to make thebes shake
the palace doors are thrown open and guards appear at the doors
chorus leader
but here comes creon new king of our land
son of menoikeos thanks to the gods                                        180
who’ve brought about our new good fortune
what plan of action does he have in mind
what’s made him hold this special meeting
with elders summoned by a general call
enter creon from the palace he addresses the assembled elders
creon
men after much tossing of our ship of state
the gods have safely set things right again
of all the citizens i’ve summoned you
because i know how well you showed respect
for the eternal power of the throne
first with laius and again with oedipus                                      190
once he restored our city  when he died
you stood by his children firm in loyalty
now his sons have perished in a single day
killing each other with their own two hands
a double slaughter stained with brother’s blood
and so i have the throne all royal power
for i’m the one most closely linked by blood
to those who have been killed it’s impossible
to really know a man to know his soul
his mind and will before one witnesses                                        200
his skill in governing and making laws
for me a man who rules the entire state
and does not take the best advice there is
but through fear keeps his mouth forever shut
such a man is the very worst of men—
and always will be and a man who thinks
more highly of a friend than of his country
well he means nothing to me let zeus know
the god who always watches everything
i would not stay silent if i saw disaster                                         210
moving here against the citizens
a threat to their security for anyone
who acts against the state its enemy
i’d never make my friend for i know well
our country is a ship which keeps us safe
and only when it sails its proper course
do we make friends these are the principles
i’ll use in order to protect our state
that’s why i’ve announced to all citizens
my orders for the sons of oedipus—                                            220
eteocles who perished in the fight
to save our city the best and bravest
of our spearmen will have his burial
with all those purifying rituals
which accompany the noblest corpses
as they move below as for his brother—
that polyneices who returned from exile
eager to wipe out in allconsuming fire
his ancestral city and its native gods
keen to seize upon his family’s blood                                           230
and lead men into slavery—for him
the proclamation in the state declares
he’ll have no burial mound no funeral rites
and no lament he’ll be left unburied
his body there for birds and dogs to eat
a clear reminder of his shameful fate
that’s my decision for i’ll never act
to respect an evil man with honours
in preference to a man who’s acted well
anyone who’s well disposed towards our state                           240
alive or dead that man i will respect
chorus leader
son of menoikeos if that’s your will
for this city’s friends and enemies
it seems to me you now control all laws
concerning those who’ve died and us as well—
the ones who are still living
creon
see to it then
and act as guardians of what’s been proclaimed
chorus
give that task to younger men to deal with
creon
there are men assigned to oversee the corpse
chorus leader
then what remains that you would have us do                            250
creon
don’t yield to those who contravene my orders
chorus leader no one is such a fool that he loves death
creon
yes that will be his full reward indeed
and yet men have often been destroyed
because they hoped to profit in some way
enter a guard coming towards the palace
guard
my lord i can’t say i’ve come out of breath
by running here making my feet move fast
many times i stopped to think things over—
and then i’d turn around retrace my steps
my mind was saying many things to me                                       260
you fool why go to where you know for sure
your punishment awaits—and now poor man
why are you hesitating yet again
if creon finds this out from someone else
how will you escape being hurt such matters
kept my mind preoccupied and so i went
slowly and reluctantly and thus made
a short road turn into a lengthy one
but then the view that i should come to you
won out if what i have to say is nothing                                     270
i’ll say it nonetheless for i’ve come here
clinging to the hope that i’ll not suffer
anything that’s not part of my destiny
creon
what’s happening that’s made you so upset
guard
i want to tell you first about myself
i did not do it and i didn’t see
the one who did so it would be unjust
if i should come to grief
creon
you hedge so much
clearly you have news of something ominous
guard
yes strange things that make me pause a lot                              280
creon
why not say it and then go—just leave
guard
all right i’ll tell you it’s about the corpse
someone has buried it and disappeared
after spreading thirsty dust onto the flesh
and undertaking all appropriate rites
creon
what are you saying what man would dare this
guard
i don’t know there was no sign of digging
no marks of any pick axe or a mattock
the ground was dry and hard and very smooth
without a wheel track whoever did it                                         290
left no trace when the first man on day watch
revealed it to us we were all amazed
the corpse was hidden but not in a tomb
it was lightly covered up with dirt
as if someone wanted to avert a curse
there was no trace of a wild animal
or dogs who’d come to rip the corpse apart
then the words flew round among us all
with every guard accusing someone else
we were about to fight to come to blows—                               300
no one was there to put a stop to it
every one of us was responsible
but none of us was clearly in the wrong
in our defence we pleaded ignorance
then we each stated we were quite prepared
to pick up redhot iron walk through flames
or swear by all the gods that we’d not done it
we’d no idea how the act was planned
or how it had been carried out at last
when all our searching had proved useless                                  310
one man spoke up and his words forced us all
to drop our faces to the ground in fear
we couldn’t see things working out for us
whether we agreed or disagreed with him
he said we must report this act to you—
we must not hide it and his view prevailed
i was the unlucky man who won the prize
the luck of the draw that’s why i’m now here
not of my own free will or by your choice
i know that—for no one likes a messenger                                  320
who comes bearing unwelcome news with him
chorus leader
my lord i’ve been wondering for some time now—
could this act not be something from the gods
creon
stop now—before what you’re about to say
enrages me completely and reveals
that you’re not only old but stupid too
no one can tolerate what you’ve just said
when you claim gods might care about this corpse
would they pay extraordinary honours
and bury as a man who’d served them well                                  330
someone who came to burn their offerings
their pillared temples to torch their lands
and scatter all its laws or do you see
gods paying respect to evil men no no
for quite a while some people in the town
have secretly been muttering against me
they don’t agree with what i have decreed
they shake their heads and have not kept their necks
under my yoke as they are duty bound to do
if they were men who are content with me                                 340
i well know that these guards were led astray—
such men urged them to carry out this act
for money to foster evil actions
to make them commonplace among all men
nothing is as powerful as money
it destroys cities driving men from home
money trains and twists the minds in worthy men
so they then undertake disgraceful acts
money teaches men to live as scoundrels
familiar with every profane enterprise                                         350
but those who carry out such acts for cash
sooner or later see how for their crimes
they pay the penalty for if great zeus
still has my respect then understand this—
i swear to you on oath—unless you find
the one whose hands really buried him
unless you bring him here before my eyes
then death for you will never be enough
no not before you’re hung up still alive
and you confess to this gross violent act                                    360
that way you’ll understand in future days
when there’s a profit to be gained from theft
you’ll learn that it’s not good to be in love
with every kind of monetary gain
you’ll know more men are ruined than are saved
when they earn profits from dishonest schemes
guard
do i have your permission to speak now
or do i just turn around and go away
creon
but i find your voice so irritating—
don’t you realize that
guard
where does it hurt                                             370
is it in your ears or in your mind
creon
why try to question where i feel my pain
guard
the man who did it—he upsets your mind
i offend your ears
creon
my my it’s clear to see
its natural for you to chatter on
guard
perhaps but i never did this
creon
this and more—
you sold your life for silver
guard
how strange and sad
when the one who sorts this out gets it all wrong
creon well enjoy your sophisticated views
but if you don’t reveal to me who did this                                  380
you’ll just confirm how much your treasonous gains
have made you suffer
exit creon back into the palace the doors close behind him
guard
well i hope he’s found
that would be best but whether caught or not—
and that’s something sheer chance will bring about—
you won’t see me coming here again
this time against all hope and expectation
i’m still unhurt i owe the gods great thanks
exit the guard away from the palace
chorus
there are many strange and wonderful things
but nothing more strangely wonderful than man
he moves across the whitecapped ocean seas                            390
blasted by winter storms carving his way
under the surging waves engulfing him
with his teams of horses he wears down
the unwearied and immortal earth
the oldest of the gods harassing her
as year by year his ploughs move back and forth
he snares the lightwinged flocks of birds
herds of wild beasts creatures from deep seas
trapped in the fine mesh of his hunting nets
o resourceful man whose skill can overcome                             400
ferocious beasts roaming mountain heights
he curbs the roughhaired horses with his bit
and tames the inexhaustible mountain bulls
setting their savage necks beneath his yoke
he’s taught himself speech and windswift thought
trained his feelings for communal civic life
learning to escape the icy shafts of frost
volleys of pelting rain in winter storms
the harsh life lived under the open sky
that’s man—so resourceful in all he does                                   410
there’s no event his skill cannot confront—
other than death—that alone he cannot shun
although for many baffling sicknesses
he has discovered his own remedies
the qualities of his inventive skills
bring arts beyond his dreams and lead him on
sometimes to evil and sometimes to good
if he treats his country’s laws with due respect
and honours justice by swearing on the gods
he wins high honours in his city                                                   420
but when he grows bold and turns to evil
then he has no city a man like that—
let him not share my home or know my mind
enter the guard bringing antigone with him she is not resisting
chorus leader
what this i fear some omen from the gods
i can’t deny what i see here so clearly—
that young girl there—it’s antigone
oh you poor girl daughter of oedipus
child of a such a father so unfortunate
what’s going on surely they’ve not brought you here
because you’ve disobeyed the royal laws                                     430
because they’ve caught you acting foolishly
guard
this here’s the one who carried out the act
we caught her as she was burying the corpse
where’s creon
the palace doors open enter creon with attendants
chorus leader
he’s coming from the house—
and just in time
creon
why have i come just in time
what’s happening what is it
guard
my lord
human beings should never take an oath
there’s something they’ll not do—for later thoughts
contradict what they first meant i’d have sworn
i’d not soon venture here again back then                                  440
the threats you made brought me a lot of grief
but there’s no joy as great as what we pray for
against all hope and so i have come back
breaking that oath i swore i bring this girl
captured while she was honouring the grave
this time we did not draw lots no this time
i was the lucky man not someone else
and now my lord take her for questioning
convict her do as you wish as for me
by rights i’m free and clear of all this trouble                               450
creon
this girl here—how did you catch her and where
guard
she was burying that man now you know
all there is to know
creon
do you understand
just what you’re saying are your words the truth
guard
we saw this girl giving that dead man’s corpse
full burial rites—an act you’d made illegal
is what i say simple and clear enough
creon
how did you see her catch her in the act
guard
it happened this way when we got there
after hearing those awful threats from you                                   460
we swept off all the dust covering the corpse
so the damp body was completely bare
then we sat down on rising ground up wind
to escape the body’s putrid rotting stench
we traded insults just to stay awake
in case someone was careless on the job
that’s how we spent the time right up ’til noon
when the sun’s bright circle in the sky
had moved half way and it was burning hot
then suddenly a swirling windstorm came                                   470
whipping clouds of dust up from the ground
filling the plain—some heavensent trouble
in that level place the dirt storm damaged
all the forest growth and the air around 420
was filled with dust for miles we shut our mouths
and just endured this scourge sent from the gods
a long time passed the storm came to an end
that’s when we saw the girl she was shrieking—
a distressing painful cry just like a bird
who’s seen an empty nest its fledglings gone                              480
that’s how she was when she saw the naked corpse
she screamed out a lament and then she swore
calling evil curses down upon the ones
who’d done this then right away her hands
threw on the thirsty dust she lifted up
a finely made bronze jug and then three times
poured out her tributes to the dead
when we saw that we rushed up right away
and grabbed her she was not afraid at all
we charged her with her previous offence                                    490
as well as this one she just kept standing there
denying nothing that made me happy—
though it was painful too for it’s a joy
escaping troubles which affect oneself
but painful to bring evil on one’s friends
but all that is of less concern to me
than my own safety
creon
you there—you with your face
bent down towards the ground what do you say
do you deny you did this or admit it
antigone
i admit i did it i won’t deny that                                                      500
creon to the guard
you’re dismissed—go where you want you’re free—
no serious charges made against you
exit the guard creon turns to interrogate antigone
tell me briefly—not in some lengthy speech—
were you aware there was a proclamation
forbidding what you did
antigone
i’d heard of it
how could i not it was public knowledge
creon
and yet you dared to break those very laws
antigone
yes zeus did not announce those laws to me
and justice living with the gods below
sent no such laws for men i did not think                                    510
anything which you proclaimed strong enough
to let a mortal override the gods
and their unwritten and unchanging laws
they’re not just for today or yesterday
but exist forever and no one knows
where they first appeared so i did not mean
to let a fear of any human will
lead to my punishment among the gods
i know all too well i’m going to die—
how could i not—it makes no difference                                    520
what you decree and if i have to die
before my time well i count that a gain
when someone has to live the way i do
surrounded by so many evil things
how can she fail to find a benefit
in death and so for me meeting this fate
won’t bring any pain but if i’d allowed
my own mother’s dead son to just lie there
an unburied corpse then i’d feel distress
what going on here does not hurt me at all                                 530
if you think what i’m doing now is stupid
perhaps i’m being charged with foolishness
by someone who’s a fool
chorus leader
it’s clear enough
the spirit in this girl is passionate—
her father was the same she has no sense
of compromise in times of trouble
creon to the chorus leader
but you should know the most obdurate wills
are those most prone to break the strongest iron
tempered in the fire to make it really hard—
that’s the kind you see most often shatter                                   540
i’m well aware the most tempestuous horses
are tamed by one small bit pride has no place
in anyone who is his neighbour’s slave
this girl here was already very insolent
in contravening laws we had proclaimed
here she again displays her proud contempt—
having done the act she now boasts of it
she laughs at what she’s done well in this case
if she gets her way and goes unpunished
then she’s the man here not me no she may be                        550
my sister’s child closer to me by blood
than anyone belonging to my house
who worships zeus herkeios in my home
but she’ll not escape my harshest punishment—
her sister too whom i accuse as well
she had an equal part in all their plans
to do this burial go summon her here
i saw her just now inside the palace
her mind out of control some kind of fit
exit attendants into the palace to fetch ismene
when people hatch their mischief in the dark                              560
their minds often convict them in advance
betraying their treachery how i despise
a person caught committing evil acts
who then desires to glorify the crime
antigone
take me and kill me—what more do you want
creon
me nothing with that i have everything
antigone
then why delay there’s nothing in your words
that i enjoy—may that always be the case
and what i say displeases you as much
but where could i gain greater glory                                            570
than setting my own brother in his grave
all those here would confirm this pleases them
if their lips weren’t sealed by fear—being king
which offers all sorts of various benefits
means you can talk and act just as you wish
creon
in all of thebes you’re the only one
who looks at things that way
antigone
they share my views
but they keep their mouths shut just for you
creon
these views of yours—so different from the rest—
don’t they bring you any sense of shame                                    580
antigone
no—there’s nothing shameful in honouring
my mother’s children
creon
you had a brother
killed fighting for the other side
antigone
yes—from the same mother and father too
creon
why then give tributes which insult his name
antigone
but his dead corpse won’t back up what you say
creon
yes he will if you give equal honours
to a wicked man
antigone
but the one who died
was not some slave—it was his own brother
creon
who was destroying this country—the other one                        590
went to his death defending it
antigone
that may be
but hades still desires equal rites for both
creon
a good man does not wish what we give him
to be the same an evil man receives
antigone
who knows in the world below perhaps
such actions are no crime
creon
an enemy
can never be a friend not even in death
antigone
but my nature is to love i cannot hate
creon
then go down to the dead if you must love
love them no woman’s going to govern me—                            600
no no—not while i’m still alive
enter two attendants from the house bringing ismene to creon
chorus leader
ismene’s coming there—right by the door
she’s crying how she must love her sister
from her forehead a cloud casts its shadow
down across her darkly flushing face—
and drops its rain onto her lovely cheeks
creon
you there—you snake lurking in my house
sucking out my life’s blood so secretly
i’d no idea i was nurturing two pests
who aimed to rise against my throne come here                        610
tell me this—do you admit you played your part
in this burial or will you swear an oath
you had no knowledge of it
ismene
i did it—
i admit it and she’ll back me up
so i bear the guilt as well
antigone
no no—
justice will not allow you to say that
you didn’t want to i didn’t work with you
ismene
but now you’re in trouble i’m not ashamed
of suffering too as your companion
antigone
hades and the dead can say who did it—                                     620
i don’t love a friend whose love is only words
ismene
you’re my sister don’t dishonour me
let me respect the dead and die with you
antigone
don’t try to share my death or make a claim
to actions which you did not do i’ll die—
and that will be enough
ismene
but if you’re gone
what is there in life for me to love
antigone
ask creon he’s the one you care about
ismene
why hurt me like this it doesn’t help you
antigone
if i am mocking you it pains me too                                          630
ismene
even now is there some way i can help
antigone
save yourself i won’t envy your escape
ismene
i feel so wretched leaving you to die
antigone
but you chose life—it was my choice to die
ismene
but not before i’d said those words just now
antigone
some people may approve of how you think—
others will believe my judgment’s good
ismene
but the mistake’s the same for both of us
antigone
be brave you’re alive but my spirit died
some time ago so i might help the dead                                        640
creon
i’d say one of these girls has just revealed
how mad she is—the other’s been that way
since she was born
ismene
my lord whatever good sense
people have by birth no longer stays with them
once their lives go wrong—it abandons them
creon
in your case that’s true once you made your choice
to act in evil ways with wicked people
ismene
how could i live alone without her here
creon
don’t speak of her being here her life is over
ismene
you’re going to kill your own son’s bride                                    650
creon
why not there are other fields for him to plough
ismene
no one will make him a more loving wife
than she will
creon
i have no desire my son
should have an evil wife
antigone
dearest haemon
how your father wrongs you
creon
i’ve had enough of this—
you and your marriage
ismene
you really want that
you’re going to take her from him
creon
no not me
hades is the one who’ll stop the marriage
chorus leader
so she must die—that seems decided on
creon
yes—for you and me the matter’s closed                                    660
creon turns to address his attendants
no more delay you slaves take them inside
from this point on they must act like women
and have no liberty to wander off
even bold men run when they see hades
coming close to them to snatch their lives
the attendants take antigone and ismene into the palace leaving creon and the chorus on stage
chorus
those who live without tasting evil
have happy lives—for when the gods
shake a house to its foundations
then inevitable disasters strike
falling upon whole families                                                          670
just as a surging ocean swell
running before cruel thracian winds
across the dark trench of the sea
churns up the deep black sand
and crashes headlong on the cliffs
which scream in pain against the wind
i see this house’s ageold sorrows
the house of labdakos’ children
sorrows falling on the sorrows of the dead
one generation bringing no relief                                                  680
to generations after it—some god
strikes at them—on and on without an end
for now the light which has been shining
over the last roots of oedipus’ house
is being cut down with a bloody knife
belonging to the gods below—
for foolish talk and frenzy in the soul
oh zeus what human trespasses
can check your power even sleep
who casts his nets on everything                                                 690
cannot master that—nor can the months
the tireless months the gods control
a sovereign who cannot grow old
you hold olympus as your own
in all its glittering magnificence
from now on into all future time
as in the past your law holds firm
it never enters lives of human beings
in its full force without disaster
hope ranging far and wide brings comfort                                    700
to many men—but then hope can deceive
delusions born of volatile desire
it comes upon the man who’s ignorant
until his foot is seared in burning fire
someone’s wisdom has revealed to us
this famous saying—sometimes the gods
lure a man’s mind forward to disaster
and he thinks evil’s something good
but then he lives only the briefest time
free of catastrophe
the palace doors open
chorus leader
here comes haemon                                                                   710
your only living son is he grieving
the fate of antigone his bride
bitter that his marriage hopes are gone
creon
we’ll soon find out—more accurately
than any prophet here could indicate
enter haemon from the palace
my son have you heard the sentence that’s been passed
upon your bride and have you now come here
angry at your father or are you loyal to me
on my side no matter what i do
haemon
father i’m yours for me your judgments                                    720
and the ways you act on them are good—
i shall follow them i’ll not consider
any marriage a greater benefit
than your fine leadership
creon
indeed my son
that’s how your heart should always be resolved
to stand behind your father’s judgment
on every issue that’s what men pray for—
obedient children growing up at home
who will pay back their father’s enemies
evil to them for evil done to him                                                 730
while honouring his friends as much as he does
a man who fathers useless children—
what can one say of him except he’s bred
troubles for himself and much to laugh at
for those who fight against him so my son
don’t ever throw good sense aside for pleasure
for some woman’s sake you understand
how such embraces can turn freezing cold
when an evil woman shares your life at home
what greater wound is there than a false friend                          740
so spit this girl out—she’s your enemy
let her marry someone else in hades
since i caught her clearly disobeying
the only culprit in the entire city
i won’t perjure myself before the state
no—i’ll kill her and so let her appeal
to zeus the god of blood relationships
if i foster any lack of full respect
in my own family i surely do the same
with those who are not linked to me by blood                            750
the man who acts well with his household
will be found a just man in the city
i’d trust such a man to govern wisely
or to be content with someone ruling him
and in the thick of battle at his post
he’ll stand firm beside his fellow soldier
a loyal brave man but anyone who’s proud
and violates our laws or thinks he’ll tell
our leaders what to do a man like that
wins no praise from me no we must obey                                 760
whatever man the city puts in charge
no matter what the issue—great or small
just or unjust for there’s no greater evil
than a lack of leadership that destroys
whole cities turns households into ruins
and in war makes soldiers break and run away
when men succeed what keeps their lives secure
in almost every case is their obedience
that’s why they must support those in control
and never let some woman beat us down                                    770
if we must fall from power let that come
at some man’s hand—at least we won’t be called
inferior to any woman
chorus leader
unless we’re being deceived by our old age
what you’ve just said seems reasonable to us
haemon
father the gods instill good sense in men—
the greatest of all the things which we possess
i could not find your words somehow not right—
i hope that’s something i never learn to do
but other words might be good as well                                      780
because of who you are you cant perceive
all the things men say or do—or their complaints
your gaze makes citizens afraid—they can’t
say anything you would not like to hear
but in the darkness i can hear them talk—
the city is upset about the girl
they say of all women here she’s least deserves
the worst of deaths for her most glorious act
when in the slaughter her own brother died
she did not just leave him there unburied                                    790
to be ripped apart by carrion dogs or birds
surely she deserves some golden honour
that’s the dark secret rumour people speak
for me father nothing is more valuable
than your well being for any children
what could be a greater honour to them
than their father’s thriving reputation
a father feels the same about his sons
so don’t let your mind dwell on just one thought
that what you say is right and nothing else                                  800
a man who thinks that only he is wise
that he can speak and think like no one else
when such men are exposed then all can see
their emptiness inside for any man
even if he’s wise there’s nothing shameful
in learning many things staying flexible
you notice how in winter floods the trees
which bend before the storm preserve their twigs
the ones who stand against it are destroyed
root and branch in the same way those sailors                           810
who keep their sails stretched tight never easing off
make their ship capsize—and from that point on
sail with their rowing benches all submerged
so end your anger permit yourself to change
for if i as a younger man may state
my views i’d say it would be for the best
if men by nature understood all things—
if not and that is usually the case
when men speak well it good to learn from them
chorus leader
my lord if what he’s said is relevant                                           820
it seems appropriate to learn from him
and you too haemon listen to the king
the things which you both said were excellent
creon
and men my age—are we then going to school
to learn what’s wise from men as young as him
haemon
there’s nothing wrong in that and if i’m young
don’t think about my age—look at what i do
creon
and what you do—does that include this
honouring those who act against our laws
haemon
i would not encourage anyone                                                      830
to show respect to evil men
creon
and her—
is she not suffering from the same disease
haemon
the people here in thebes all say the same—
they deny she is
creon
so the city now
will instruct me how i am to govern
haemon
now you’re talking like someone far too young
don’t you see that
creon
am i to rule this land
at someone else’s whim or by myself
haemon
a city which belongs to just one man
is no true city
creon
according to our laws                                  840
does not the ruler own the city
haemon
by yourself you’d make an excellent king
but in a desert
creon
it seems as if this boy
is fighting on the woman’s side
haemon
that’s true—
if you’re the woman i’m concerned for you
creon
you’re the worst there is—you set your judgment up
against your father
haemon
no not when i see
you making a mistake and being unjust
creon
is it a mistake to honour my own rule
haemon
you’re not honouring that by trampling on                                  850
the gods’ prerogatives
creon
you foul creature—
you’re worse than any woman
haemon
you’ll not catch me
giving way to some disgrace
creon
but your words
all speak on her behalf
haemon
and yours and mine—
and for the gods below
creon
you woman’s slave—
don’t try to win me over
haemon
what do you want—
to speak and never hear someone reply
creon
you’ll never marry her while she’s alive
haemon
then she’ll die—and in her death kill someone else
creon
are you so insolent you threaten me                                          860
haemon
where’s the threat in challenging a bad decree
creon
you’ll regret parading what you think like this—
you—a person with an empty brain
haemon
if you were not my father i might say
you were not thinking straight
creon
would you indeed
well then by olympus i’ll have you know
you’ll be sorry for demeaning me
with all these insults
creon turns to his attendants
go bring her out—
that hateful creature so she can die right here
with him present before her bridegroom’s eyes                          870
haemon
no don’t ever hope for that she’ll not die
with me just standing there and as for you—
your eyes will never see my face again
so let your rage charge on among your friends
who want to stand by you in this
exit haemon running back into the palace
chorus leader
my lord haemon left in such a hurry
he’s angry—in a young man at his age
the mind turns bitter when he’s feeling hurt
creon
let him dream up or carry out great deeds
beyond the power of man he’ll not save these girls—                 880
their fate is sealed
chorus leader
are you going to kill them both                                   770
creon
no—not the one whose hands are clean you’re right
chorus leader
how do you plan to kill antigone
creon
i’ll take her on a path no people use
and hide her in a cavern in the rocks
while still alive i’ll set out provisions
as much as piety requires to make sure
the city is not totally corrupted
then she can speak her prayers to hades
the only god she worships for success                                         890
avoiding death—or else at least she’ll learn
although too late how it’s a waste of time
to work to honour those whom hades holds
chorus
o eros the conqueror in every fight
eros who squanders all men’s wealth
who sleeps at night on girls’ soft cheeks
and roams across the ocean seas
and through the shepherd’s hut—
no immortal god escapes from you
nor any man who lives but for a day                                           900
and the one whom you possess goes mad
even in good men you twist their minds
perverting them to their own ruin
you provoke these men to family strife
the bride’s desire seen glittering in her eyes—
that conquers everything its power
enthroned beside eternal laws for there
the goddess aphrodite works her will
whose ways are irresistible
antigone enters from the palace with attendants who are taking her away to her execution
choral leader
when i look at her i forget my place                                           910
i lose restraint and can’t hold back my tears—
antigone going to her bridal room
where all are laid to rest in death
antigone
look at me my native citizens
as i go on my final journey
as i gaze upon the sunlight one last time
which i’ll never see again—for hades
who brings all people to their final sleep
leads me on while i’m still living
down to the shores of acheron                                                  920
i’ve not yet had my bridal chant
nor has any wedding song been sung—
for my marriage is to acheron
chorus
surely you carry fame with you and praise
as you move to the deep home of the dead
you were not stricken by lethal disease
or paid your wages with a sword
no you were in charge of your own fate
so of all living human beings you alone
make your way down to hades still alive                                   930
antigone
i’ve heard about a guest of ours
daughter of tantalus from phrygia—
she went to an excruciating death
in sipylus right on the mountain peak
the stone there just like clinging ivy
wore her down and now so people say
the snow and rain never leave her there
as she laments below her weeping eyes
her neck is wet with tears god brings me
to a final rest which most resembles hers                                   940
chorus
but niobe was a goddess born divine—
and we are human beings a race which dies
but still it’s a fine thing for a woman
once she’s dead to have it said she shared
in life and death the fate of demigods
antigone
oh you are mocking me why me—
by our fathers’ gods—why do you all
my own city and the richest men of thebes
insult me now right to my face
without waiting for my death                                                     950
well at least i have dirce’s springs
the holy grounds of thebes
a city full of splendid chariots
to witness how no friends lament for me
as i move on—you see the laws
which lead me to my rockbound prison
a tomb made just for me alas
in my wretchedness i have no home
not with human beings or corpses
not with the living or the dead                                                    960
chorus
you pushed your daring to the limit my child
and tripped against justice’s high altar—
perhaps your agonies are paying back
some compensation for your father
antigone
now there you touch on my most painful thought—
my father’s destiny—always on my mind
along with that whole fate which sticks to us
the splendid house of labdakos—the curse
arising from a mother’s marriage bed
when she had sex with her own son my father                           970
from what kind of parents was i born
their wretched daughter i go to them
unmarried and accursed an outcast
alas too for my brother polyneices
who made a fatal marriage and then died—
and with that death killed me while still alive
chorus
to be piously devout shows reverence
but powerful men who in their persons
incorporate authority cannot bear
anyone to break their rules hence you die                                 980
because of your own selfish will
antigone
without lament without a friend
and with no marriage song i’m being led
in this miserable state along my final road
so wretched that i no longer have the right
to look upon the sun that sacred eye
but my fate prompts no tears and no friend mourns
creon
don’t you know that no one faced with death
would ever stop the singing and the groans
if that would help take her and shut her up                              990
as i have ordered in her tomb’s embrace
and get it done as quickly as you can
then leave her there alone all by herself—
she can sort out whether she wants suicide
or remains alive buried in a place like that
as far as she’s concerned we bear no guilt
but she’s lost her place living here with us
antigone
oh my tomb and bridal chamber—
my eternal hollow dwelling place
where i go to join my people most of them                                1000
have perished—persephone has welcomed them
among the dead  i’m the last one dying here
the most evil death by far as i move down
before the time allotted for my life is done
but i go nourishing the vital hope
my father will be pleased to see me come
and you too my mother will welcome me
as well as you my own dear brother
when you died with my own hands i washed you
i arranged your corpse and at the grave mound                            1010
poured out libations but now polyneices
this is my reward for covering your corpse
however for wise people i was right
to honour you i’d never have done it
for children of my own not as their mother
nor for a dead husband lying in decay—
no not in defiance of the citizens
what law do i appeal to claiming this
if my husband died there’d be another one
and if i were to lose a child of mine                                             1020
i’d have another with some other man
but since my father and my mother too
are hidden away in hades’ house
i’ll never have another living brother
that was the law i used to honour you
but creon thought that i was in the wrong
and acting recklessly for you my brother
now he seizes me by force and leads me here—
no wedding and no bridal song no share
in married life or raising children                                                1030
instead i go in sorrow to my grave
without my friends to die while still alive
what holy justice have i violated
in my wretchedness why should i still look
up to the gods which one can i invoke
to bring me help when for my reverence
they charge me with impiety well then
if this is something fine among the gods
i’ll come to recognize that i’ve done wrong
but if these people here are being unjust                                     1040
may they endure no greater punishment
than the injustices they’re doing to me
chorus leader
the same storm blasts continue to attack
the mind in this young girl
creon
then those escorting her
will be sorry they’re so slow
antigone
alas then
those words mean death is very near at hand
creon
i won’t encourage you or cheer you up
by saying the sentence won’t be carried out

o city of my fathers
in this land of thebes—                                                              1050
and my ancestral gods
i am being led away
no more delaying for me
look on me you lords of thebes
the last survivor of your royal house
see what i have to undergo
the kind of men who do this to me
for paying reverence to true piety
antigone is led away under escort
chorus
in her brassbound room fair danae as well
endured her separation from the heaven’s light                          1060
a prisoner hidden in a chamber like a tomb
although she too came from a noble line
and she my child had in her care
the liquid streaming golden seed of zeus
but the power of fate is full of mystery
there’s no evading it no not with wealth
or war or walls or black seabeaten ships
and the hottempered child of dryas
king of the edonians was put in prison
closed up in the rocks by dionysus                                            1070
for his angry mocking of the god
there the dreadful flower of his rage
slowly withered and he came to know
the god who in his frenzy he had mocked
with his own tongue for he had tried
to hold in check women in that frenzy
inspired by the god the bacchanalian fire
more than that—he’d made the muses angry
challenging the gods who love the flute
beside the black rocks where the twin seas meet                       1080
by thracian salmydessos at the bosphorus
close to the place where ares dwells
the war god witnessed the unholy wounds
which blinded the two sons of phineus
inflicted by his savage wife—the sightless holes
cried out for someone to avenge those blows
made with her sharpened comb in bloodstained hands
in their misery they wept lamenting
their wretched suffering sons of a mother
whose marriage had gone wrong and yet                                  1090
she was an offspring of an ancient family
the race of erechtheus raised far away
in caves surrounded by her father’s winds
boreas’ child a girl who raced with horses
across steep hills—child of the gods
but she too my child suffered much
from the immortal fates
enter teiresias led by a young boy
teiresias
lords of thebes we two have walked a common path
one person’s vision serving both of us
the blind require a guide to find their way                                 1100
creon
what news do you have old teiresias
teiresias
i’ll tell you—and you obey the prophet
creon
i’ve not rejected your advice before
teiresias
that’s the reason why you’ve steered the city
on its proper course
creon
from my experience
i can confirm the help you give
teiresias
then know this—
your luck is once more on fate’s razor edge
creon
what what you’ve just said makes me nervous
teiresias
you’ll know—once you hear the tokens of my art
as i was sitting in my ancient place                                             1110
receiving omens from the flights of birds
who all come there where i can hear them
i note among those birds an unknown cry—
evil unintelligible angry screaming
i knew that they were tearing at each other
with murderous claws the noisy wings
revealed that all too well i was afraid
so right away up on the blazing altar
i set up burnt offerings but hephaestus
failed to shine out from the sacrifice—                                        1120
dark slime poured out onto the embers
oozing from the thighs which smoked and spat
bile was sprayed high up into the air
and the melting thighs lost all the fat
which they’d been wrapped in the rites had failed—
there was no prophecy revealed in them
i learned that from this boy who is my guide
as i guide other men  our state is sick—
your policies have done this in the city
our altars and our hearths have been defiled                              1130
all of them with rotting flesh brought there
by birds and dogs from oedipus’ son
who lies there miserably dead the gods
no longer will accept our sacrifice
our prayers our thigh bones burned in fire
no bird will shriek out a clear sign to us
for they have gorged themselves on fat and blood
from a man who’s dead consider this my son
all men make mistakes—that’s not uncommon
but when they do they’re no longer foolish                                1140
or subject to bad luck if they try to fix
the evil into which they’ve fallen
once they give up their intransigence
men who put their stubbornness on show
invite accusations of stupidity
make concessions to the dead—don’t ever stab
a man who’s just been killed what’s the glory
in killing a dead person one more time
i’ve been concerned for you it’s good advice
learning can be pleasant when a man speaks well                      1150
especially when he seeks your benefit
creon
old man you’re all like archers shooting at me—
for you all i’ve now become your target—
even prophets have been aiming at me
i’ve long been bought and sold as merchandise
among that tribe well go make your profits
if it’s what you want then trade with sardis
for their goldensilver alloy—or for gold
from india but you’ll never hide that corpse
in any grave even if zeus’ eagles                                               1160
should choose to seize his festering body
and take it up right to the throne of zeus
not even then would i in trembling fear
of some defilement permit that corpse
a burial for i know well that no man
has the power to pollute the gods
but old teiresias among human beings
the wisest suffer a disgraceful fall
when to promote themselves they use fine words
to spread around abusive insults                                                 1170
teiresias
alas does any man know or think about   
creon interrupting
think what what sort of pithy common thought
are you about to utter
teiresias ignoring the interruption
   how good advice
is valuable—worth more than all possessions
creon
i think that’s true as much as foolishness
is what harms us most
teiresias
yet that’s the sickness
now infecting you
creon
i have no desire
to denigrate a prophet when i speak
teiresias
but that’s what you are doing when you claim
my oracles are false
creon
the tribe of prophets—                                1180
all of them—are fond of money
teiresias
and kings
their tribe loves to benefit dishonestly
creon
you know you’re speaking of the man who rules you
teiresias
i know—thanks to me you saved the city
and now are in control
creon
you’re a wise prophet
but you love doing wrong
teiresias
you’ll force me
to speak of secrets locked inside my heart
creon
do it—just don’t speak to benefit yourself
teiresias
i don’t think that i’ll be doing that—
not as far as you’re concerned
creon
you can be sure              1190
you won’t change my mind to make yourself more rich
teiresias
then understand this well—you will not see
the sun race through its cycle many times
before you lose a child of your own loins
a corpse in payment for these corpses
you’ve thrown down to those below someone
from up above—in your arrogance
you’ve moved a living soul into a grave
leaving here a body owned by gods below—
unburied dispossessed unsanctified                                          1200
that’s no concern of yours or gods above
in this you violate the ones below
and so destroying avengers wait for you
furies of hades and the gods who’ll see
you caught up in this very wickedness
now see if i speak as someone who’s been bribed
it won’t be long before in your own house
the men and women all cry out in sorrow
and cities rise in hate against you—all those
whose mangled soldiers have had burial rites                              1210
from dogs wild animals or flying birds
who carry the unholy stench back home
to every city hearth  like an archer
i shoot these arrows now into your heart
because you have provoked me i’m angry—
so my aim is good you’ll not escape their pain
boy lead us home so he can vent his rage
on younger men and keep a quieter tongue
and a more temperate mind than he has now
exit teiresias led by the young boy
chorus leader
my lord my lord such dreadful prophecies—                            1220
and now he’s gone since my hair changed colour
from black to white i know here in the city
he’s never uttered a false prophecy
creon
i know that too—and it disturbs my mind
it’s dreadful to give way but to resist
and let destruction hammer down my spirit—
that’s a fearful option too
chorus leader
son of menoikeos
you need to listen to some good advice
creon
tell me what to do speak up i’ll do it
chorus leader
go and release the girl from her rock tomb                                1230
then prepare a grave for that unburied corpse
creon
this is your advice you think i should concede
chorus leader
yes my lord as fast as possible
swift footed injuries sent from the gods
hack down those who act imprudently
creon
alas—it’s difficult but i’ll give up
i’ll not do what i’d set my heart upon
it’s not right to fight against necessity
chorus leader
go now and get this done don’t give the work
to other men to do
creon
i’ll go just as i am                    1240
come you servants each and every one of you
come on bring axes with you go there quickly—
up to the higher ground i’ve changed my mind
since i’m the one who tied her up i’ll go
and set her free myself now i’m afraid
until one dies the best thing well may be
to follow our established laws
creon and his attendants hurry off stage
chorus
oh you with many names
you glory of that theban bride
and child of thundering zeus                                                     1250
you who cherish famous italy
and rule the welcoming valley lands
of eleusianian deo—
o bacchus—you who dwell
in the bacchants’ mother city thebes
beside ismenus’ flowing streams
on land sown with the teeth
of that fierce dragon
above the double mountain peaks
the torches flashing through the murky smoke                            1260
have seen you where corcyian nymphs
move on as they worship you
by the kastalian stream
and from the ivycovered slopes
of nysa’s hills from the green shore
so rich in vines you come to us
visiting our theban ways
while deathless voices all cry out
in honour of your name evoe
you honour thebes our city                                                      1270
above all others you and your mother
blasted by that lightning strike
and now when all our people here
are captive to a foul disease
on your healing feet you come
across the moaning strait
or over the parnassian hill
you who lead the dance
among the firebreathing stars
who guard the voices in the night                                               1280
child born of zeus oh my lord
appear with your attendant thyiads
who dance in frenzy all night long
for you their patron iacchus
enter a messenger
messenger
all you here who live beside the home
of amphion and cadmus—in human life
there’s no set place which i would praise or blame
the lucky and unlucky rise or fall
by chance day after day—and how these things
are fixed for men no one can prophesy                                       1290
for creon in my view was once a man
we all looked up to for he saved the state
this land of cadmus from its enemies
he took control and reigned as its sole king—
and prospered with the birth of noble children
now all is gone for when a man has lost
what gives him pleasure i don’t include him
among the living—he’s a breathing corpse
pile up a massive fortune in your home
if that’s what you want—live like a king                                    1300
if there’s no pleasure in it i’d not give
to any man a vapour’s shadow for it
not compared to human joy
chorus leader
have you come with news of some fresh trouble
in our house of kings
messenger
they’re dead—
and those alive bear the responsibility
for those who’ve died
chorus leader
who did the killing
who’s lying dead tell us
messenger
haemon has been killed
no stranger shed his blood
chorus leader
at his father’s hand
or did he kill himself
messenger
by his own hand—
angry at his father for the murder                                               1310
chorus leader
teiresias how your words have proven true
messenger
that’s how things stand consider what comes next
chorus leader
i see creon’s wife poor eurydice—
she’s coming from the house—either by chance
or else she’s heard there’s news about her son
enter eurydice from the palace with some attendants
eurydice
citizens of thebes i heard you talking
as i was walking out going off to pray
to ask for help from goddess pallas
while i was unfastening the gate
i heard someone speaking of bad news                                       1320
about my family i was terrified
i collapsed fainting back into the arms
of my attendants so tell the news again—
i’ll listen i’m no stranger to misfortune
messenger
dear lady i’ll speak of what i saw
omitting not one detail of the truth
why should i ease your mind with a report
which turns out later to be incorrect
the truth is always best i went to the plain
accompanying your husband as his guide                                   1330
polyneices’ corpse still unlamented
was lying there the greatest distance off
torn apart by dogs we prayed to pluto
and to hecate goddess of the road
for their good will and to restrain their rage
we gave the corpse a ritual wash and burned
what was left of it on freshcut branches
we piled up a high tomb of his native earth
then we moved to the young girl’s rocky cave
the hollow cavern of that bride of death                                    1340
from far away one man heard a voice
coming from the chamber where we’d put her
without a funeral—a piercing cry
he went to tell our master creon
who as he approached the place heard the sound
an unintelligible scream of sorrow
he groaned and then spoke out these bitter words
has misery made me a prophet now
and am i travelling along a road
that takes me to the worst of all disasters                                  1350
i’ve just heard the voice of my own son
you servants go ahead—get up there fast
remove the stones piled in the entrance way
then stand beside the tomb and look in there
to see if that was haemon’s voice i heard
or if the gods have been deceiving me
following what our desperate master asked
we looked in the furthest corner of the tomb
we saw antigone hanging by the neck
held up in a noose—fine woven linen                                        1360
haemon had his arms around her waist—
he was embracing her and crying out
in sorrow for the loss of his own bride
now among the dead his father’s work
and for his horrifying marriage bed
creon saw him let out a fearful groan
then went inside and called out anxiously
you unhappy boy what have you done
what are you thinking have you lost your mind
come out my child—i’m begging you—please come              1370
but the boy just stared at him with savage eyes
spat in his face and without saying a word
drew his twoedged sword creon moved away
so the boy’s blow failed to strike his father
angry at himself the illfated lad
right then and there leaned into his own sword
driving half the blade between his ribs
while still conscious he embraced the girl
in his weak arms and as he breathed his last
he coughed up streams of blood on her fair cheek                      1380
now he lies there corpse on corpse his marriage
has been fulfilled in chambers of the dead
the unfortunate boy has shown all men
how of all the evils which afflict mankind
the most disastrous one is thoughtlessness
eurydice turns and slowly returns into the palace
chorus leader
what do you make of that the queen’s gone back
she left without a word good or bad
messenger
i’m surprised myself it’s about her son—
she heard that terrible report i hope
she’s gone because she doesn’t think it right                               1390
to mourn for him in public in the home
surrounded by her servants she’ll arrange
a period of mourning for the house
she’s discreet and has experience—
she won’t make mistakes
chorus leader
i’m not sure of that
to me her staying silent was extreme—
it seems to point to something ominous
just like a vain excess of grief
messenger
i’ll go in
we’ll find out if she’s hiding something secret
deep within her passionate heart you’re right—                        1400
excessive silence can be dangerous
the messenger goes up the stairs into the palace enter creon from the side with attendants
creon is holding the body of haemon
chorus leader
here comes the king in person—carrying
in his arms if it’s right to speak of this
a clear reminder that this evil comes
not from some stranger but his own mistakes
creon
aaiii—mistakes made by a foolish mind
cruel mistakes that bring on death
you see us here all in one family—
the killer and the killed
oh the profanity of what i planned                                            1410
alas my son you died so young—
a death before your time
aaiii    aaiii    you’re dead    gone—
not your own foolishness but mine
chorus leader
alas it seems you’ve learned to see what’s right—
but far too late
creon
aaiiii    i’ve learned it in my pain
some god clutching a great weight struck my head
then hurled me onto paths in wilderness
throwing down and casting underfoot
what brought me joy                                                                  1420
so sad    so sad   
the wretched agony of human life
the messenger reappears from the palace
messenger
my lord you come like one who stores up evil
what you hold in your arms and what you’ll see
before too long inside the house
creon
what’s that
is there something still more evil than all this
messenger
your wife is dead—blood mother of that corpse—
slaughtered with a sword—her wounds are very new
poor lady
creon
aaiiii     a gathering place for death   
no sacrifice can bring this to an end                                           1430
why are you destroying me you there—
you bringer of this dreadful news this agony
what are you saying now aaiii   
you kill a man then kill him once again
what are you saying boy what news
a slaughter heaped on slaughter—
my wife alas    she’s dead
messenger opening the palace doors revealing the body of eurydice
look here no longer is she concealed inside
creon
alas how miserable i feel—to look upon
this second horror what remains for me
what’s fate still got in store i’ve just held                                  1440
my own son in my arms and now i see
right here in front of me another corpse
alas for this suffering mother
alas my son
messenger
stabbed with a sharp sword at the altar
she let her darkening eyesight fail
once she had cried out in sorrow
for the glorious fate of megareos
who died some time ago and then again
for haemon and then with her last breath                               1450
she called out evil things against you
the killer of your sons
creon
aaaii    my fear now makes me tremble
why won’t someone now strike out at me
pierce my heart with a double bladed sword
how miserable i am    aaiii   
how full of misery and pain   
messenger
by this woman who lies dead you stand charged
with the deaths of both your sons
creon
what about her
how did she die so violently
messenger
she killed herself                                1460
with her own hands she stabbed her belly
once she heard her son’s unhappy fate
creon
alas for me    the guilt for all of this is mine—
it can never be removed from me or passed
to any other mortal man i and i alone   
i murdered you    i speak the truth
servants—hurry and lead me off
get me away from here for now
what i am in life is nothing
chorus leader
what you advise is good—if good can come                              1470
with all these evils when we face such things
the less we say the better
creon
let that day come oh let it come
the fairest of all destinies for me
the one which brings on my last day
oh let it come so that i never see
another dawn
chorus leader
that’s something for the times ahead
now we need to deal with what confronts us here
what’s yet to come is the concern of those                                 1480
whose task it is to deal with it
creon
in that prayer
i included everything i most desire
chorus
pray for nothing
there’s no release for mortal human beings
not from events which destiny has set
creon
then take this foolish man away from here
i killed you my son without intending to
and you as well my wife how useless i am now
i don’t know where to look or find support
everything i touch goes wrong and on my head
fate climbs up with its overwhelming load                                 1490
the attendants help creon move up the stairs into the palace taking haemon’s body with them
chorus
the most important part of true success
is wisdom—not to act impiously
towards the gods for boasts of arrogant men
bring on great blows of punishment—
so in old age men can discover wisdom2embed"
