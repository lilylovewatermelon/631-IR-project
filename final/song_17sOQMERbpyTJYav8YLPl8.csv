it was a beautiful letdown
when i crashed and burned
when i found myself alone unknown and hurt
it was a beautiful letdown
the day i knew
that all the riches this world had to offer me
would never do

prechorus 1
in a world full of bitter pain and bitter doubts
i was trying so hard to fit in fit in
until i found out

chorus
that i dont belong here i dont belong
i dont belong here i dont belong
i will carry a cross and a song where i dont belong i dont belong
i dont belong

it was a beautiful letdown
when you found me here
yeah for once in a rare blue moon
