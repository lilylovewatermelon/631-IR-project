a groan of tedium escapes me
startling the fearful
is this a test it has to be
otherwise i cant go on
draining patience drain vitality
this paranoid paralyzed vampire acts a little old

verse 2
but im still right here
giving blood keeping faith
and im still right here
but im still right here
giving blood keeping faith
and im still right here

pre chorus
wait it out
gonna wait it out
wait it out be patient

chorus
if there were no rewards to reap
no loving embrace to see me through
this tedious path ive chosen here
i certainly wouldve walked away by now
gonna wait it out

if there were no desire to heal
the damaged and broken met along
this tedious path ive chosen here
i certainly wouldve walked away by now

and i still may
i still may
be patient
be patient
be patient
i must keep reminding myself of this
i must keep reminding myself of this
i must keep reminding myself of this
i must keep reminding myself of this

chorus
if there were no rewards to reap
i must keep reminding myself of this
no loving embrace to see me through
i must keep reminding myself of this
this tedious path ive chosen here
i must keep reminding myself of this
i certainly wouldve walked away
i must keep reminding myself of this

by now
