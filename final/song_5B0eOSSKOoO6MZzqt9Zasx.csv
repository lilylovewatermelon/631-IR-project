we are living our lives
abound with so much information

come on let go of the remote
dont you know youre letting all the junk flood in
i try to stop the flow doubleclicking on the go
but its no use hey im being consumed

loading loading loading
quickly reaching maximum capacity
warning warning warning
gonna shortcircuit my identity ahh

prechorus
get up on your feet tear down the walls
catch a glimpse of the hollow world
snooping round town will get you nowhere
youre locked up in your mind

chorus
were all trapped in a maze of relationships
life goes on with or without you
i swim in the sea of the unconscious
i search for your heart pursuing my true self

get up get up its time to get real
cant control the steering wheel
outside is in a veil of mystery
wont get out so easily
we are living our lives and we realize whats happening
hey brother watch yourself
grab your things dont miss your chance
find your own rhythm and dance your own dance

prechorus 2
be creative chart your course
you must know what lies ahead
driving through the deep end of the ocean
leaving obscurity

chorus
you are standing in the middle of another world
its hard to feel emotions
you are smiling in a shirt wet with bitter tears
let me help you find a place to call it home

were all trapped in a maze of relationships
life goes on with or without you
i swim in the sea of the unconscious
i search for your heart pursuing my true selfembed"
