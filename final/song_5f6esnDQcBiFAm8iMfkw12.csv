verse 1 isaiah rashad  syd
i ride around in your car
i put my weed in your blunt
i am the sky to your star
i am the end of your month
you are the start of my day
you brought the smile from my face
i see the world from your eyes
you pulled a thorn from my side

verse 2 isaiah rashad  syd
you give me all that you got
you make it stretch it and flip
i fell in love with your thoughts
i learned its more than your hips
you know im caught in my vibe
but i still give you my rib
you hear em callin my name
but know its hard for me here
i left a home with my son
i chose the world in the end
i say you know i be back
you try your best to pretend
i say you all that i want
and when i make it its real
i hear em callin my name
its gettin hard for me here
