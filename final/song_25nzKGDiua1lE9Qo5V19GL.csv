were only young and naive still
we require certain skills
the mood it changes like the wind
hard to control when it begins

chorus
the bittersweet between my teeth
trying to find the inbetweens
fall back in love eventually
yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
cant help myself but count the flaws
claw my way out through these walls
one temporary escape
feel it start to permeate

we lie beneath the stars at night
our hands gripping each other tight
you keep my secrets hope to die
promises swear them to the sky

chorus
the bittersweet between my teeth
trying to find the inbetweens
fall back in love eventually
yeah yeah yeah yeah

as you shiver count up all your mistakes
pair of forgivers let go before its too late
can you whisper can you whisper
can you whisper can you whisper

chorus
the bittersweet between my teeth
trying to find the inbetweens
fall back in love eventually

can you whisper
the bittersweet between my teeth
can you whisper
trying to find the inbetweens
can you whisper
fall back in love eventually
can you whisper
