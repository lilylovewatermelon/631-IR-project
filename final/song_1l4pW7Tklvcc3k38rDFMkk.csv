oh i missed you and i cried
but i said that i was alright
and i know its been a while
since i needed a distraction

prechorus
’cause i wanna do everything
that you want me to to tell you the truth
i need to stay alive
so sad that i could die

chorus
its leading me on every time we touch
leading me on every time it hurts
feeling so lonely cause it’s not enough
missin you only ever since we fell in love

verse 2
and i watched you do a line
that you spread out on the table
i dont need to see you wired
i just wanna see you upside down

prechorus
i wanna do everything
that you want me to to tell you the truth
i listen to you cry all night
through the telephone

its leading me on every time we touch
leading me on every time it hurts
feeling so lonely cause its not enough
missin you only ever since we fell in love

verse 3
couldnt say you didn’t want me then
when we were lyin’ in my bed that night
you were acting like a different person
as if suddenly you wanted to just be friends
i was hurt and so i took a shower
so you couldnt hear me knowing i had to cry
sad to know that while my heart was breaking
you were sleeping or just faking

chorus
it’s leading me on every time we touch
leading me on every time it hurts
feeling so lonely cause its not enough
missin you only ever since we fell in love4embed"
