remember those walls i built
well baby theyre tumblin down
and they didnt even put up a fight
they didnt even make a sound
i found a way to let you in
but i never really had a doubt
standin in the light of your halo
i got my angel now

prechorus
its like ive been awakened
every rule i had you breakin
its the risk that im takin
i aint never gonna shut you out

chorus
everywhere im lookin now
im surrounded by your embrace
baby i can see your halo
you know youre my savin grace
youre everything i need and more
its written all over your face
baby i can feel your halo
pray it wont fade away

hit me like a ray of sun
burnin through my darkest night
youre the only one that i want

i swore id never fall again
but this dont even feel like fallin
gravity cant begin
to pull me back to the ground again
