a love letter came through the mail it said i miss you
i ripped it up and flushed with the tissue try to forget you
i aint got nothing against you we human we all got issues
but im tired of being tired of being tired
that part of me done died
i see it then i dont act like im blind
im confident it wont be one of mine
i know emotions come with lies so i tell the truth all the time
aint got no sympathy for no bitch
i admit that im rich and im lit
jumpin up on stages i get two hundred an occasion
bro had really fucked the game up we made niggas shut they trap down
they see how i made it im the reason they wont rap now
see me out in traffic make a hater pull his hat down
the biggest ogs salute me a stylist cant even style me
the robbers probably wanna get me im hoppin out lamborghinis
the youngins turn in my city they try me i get it cracking
some of this still would happen if i never had started rapping
my people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
i tell em to chill im tryna run up these ms
paid cash and then he post the crib nah
i cant show nobody where my mama live thats how i posed to feel
my niece just asked me were my diamonds real i said of course
i just played the hand that i was dealt didnt have to force
all around the world they know its me they hear my voice
and i done it all in a pair of diors yeah

young age learned how to get paid we gon get the money

big wave he gon have to get saved big old wave
ridin in the foreign chiefin on the forest
i know i wasnt there for you at least i said im sorry
you know what it was i told you that i was heartless
im emotionally scarred that aint even your fault
but dont listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

verse 2
all this revenue coming in ill probably never spend
i just bought my bm a benz now thats another benz
i just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
i dont see nobody but me who im gon lose to
i cant move around without tools these niggas loose screws
i can see me taking the lead over the new school
they remember me from selling weed at my old school
only hit it once and now its old news
blew up who the fuck would knew paint my trackhawk nipsey blue
if i get one you get one too i really move how bosses move
i never call myself a goat i leave that up to the people
everybody cant go to the top i had to leave some people
ima be forever scheming woke up i thought i was dreaming
watched my lil boy play with toys i just dropped a tear of joy
some shit that i feel for
i been going crazy with that scoring call me baby harden
they say ill be great i guess im waiting for it
