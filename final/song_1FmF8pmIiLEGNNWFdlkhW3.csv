home and where ill be
light separates the space
i feel the cold against my face

i know ill be there soon
dont worry i saw it too

always passing through
always torn in two
staring straight through the night
while your red eyes said enough

i know ill be there soon
dont worry i saw it too

long way away always
long way away always
long way away always
long way away always

constantly inbetween
home and where ill be
light separates the space
