you aint never heard nothin like this

im on stage black shirt in my timbs

everybody got opinions let it go into my ear and then i block that
put me on stage ima rock that
sayin you the best stop that
phony i am not that yeah
what are yall doin out here what are yall doin out here
maybe you should spend a little less time with the women in your arms and a little bit more with your career
i aint saying im the best but i should be in the top ten give me a list of names ima top them
im just playing with ya i dont care where the top is
leave me at the bottom let me work for it
you aint never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
tell me that he works more nah
you might see me with my hoodie up i aint leaving til i finish
this industry aint nothing but a box but i aint gon climb in it
you put me inside a room full of rappers come back in five minutes
ima be the only one still alive with a note on my chest saying that i did it
you do it for fame we are way different
yall are looking weak we aint cooking in the same kitchen
everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
some of usll never wear it out though lemme get it
i guess i dont understand
this wasnt part of my plan
some of these people theyre thinking cause they heard the name that they really know who i am
bring the beat down
i got no time for these hollywood people id rather give time to my fans
youd rather chill with these women that like you for money
but id rather chill with my fam yeah
