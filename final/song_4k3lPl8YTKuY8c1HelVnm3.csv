you can tell your old man youll do some largemouth fishin another time
you just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
you can always put a rain check in his hand
til you cant

verse 2
you can keep puttin off forever with that girl whos heart you hold
swearin that youll ask someday further down the road
you can always put a diamond on her hand
til you cant

chorus
if you got a chance take it
take it while you got a chance
if you got a dream chase it
cause a dream wont chase you back
if youre gonna love somebody
hold em as long and as strong and as close as you can
til you cant

verse 3
theres a box of greasy parts sittin in the trunk of that sixtyfive
still waitin on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
you can always get around to fixin up that pontiac
til you cant
