walks in the rain talks in the dark
old black and white movies a day at the park
on a blanket on the ground on a sunday afternoon
hanging with friends or off by ourselves
driving around yard sale to yard sale
dropping by the county fair winning you a bear popping balloons

chorus
if youre looking for someone to do that with here i am
someone to be the other half of your plans
dont look any further than in my eyes
it youre looking for that man here i am

verse 2
december nights all cuddled up
warmed by the fire and sharing a cup
of hot cocoa laughing at old photos
spanish guitars sand and the sea
a quiet little table just you and me
sipping margaritas in a little cantina in old mexico

chorus
if youre looking for someone to do that with here i am
someone to be the other half of your plans
dont look any further than in my eyes
it youre looking for that man here i am
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
talking bout life and talking about babies
talking bout us still in love when were eighty

chorus
if youre looking for someone to do that with here i am
someone to be the other half of your plans
dont look any further than in my eyes
it youre looking for that man here i am

outro
here i am
baby here i amembed"
