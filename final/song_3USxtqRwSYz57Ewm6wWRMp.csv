last night all i think about is you
dont stop baby you can walk through
dont want baby think about you
you know that im never gonna lose
road shimmer wigglin the vision
heat heat waves im swimmin in a mirror
road shimmer wigglin the vision

chorus
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now

verse 1
usually i put somethin on tv
so we never think about you and me
but today i see our reflections clearly
in hollywood layin on the screen
you just need a better life than this
you need somethin i can never give
fake water all across the road
its gone now the night has come but
you might also likechorus
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now

verse 2
you cant fight it you cant breathe
you say somethin so lovin but
now i gotta let you go
youll be better off in someone new
i dont wanna be alone
you know it hurts me too
you look so broken when you cry
one more and then i say goodbye

chorus
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now
bridge
i just wonder what youre dreamin of
when you sleep and smile so comfortable
i just wish that i could give you that
that look thats perfectly unsad
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
heat waves been fakin me out

chorus
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now
sometimes all i think about is you
late nights in the middle of june
heat waves been fakin me out
cant make you happier now
