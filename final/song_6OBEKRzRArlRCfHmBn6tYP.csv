i said i know a shrimp boat captain out of galveston
ive been thinking id go down and work for a spell
oh you never can tell it just might suit me fine
spend some time out on the bay
but then theres always cowboy work in colorado
and i was thinking that that just might be the thing
make a little pocket change i figure what the heck
aint nothing standing in my way
but then she smiled at me
looked a while at me

chorus
and that changes everything
thats a whole another deal
that puts a brand new spin
on this ole rolling wheel
thats some powerful stuff
thats a girl in love
and thats one thing
that changes everything

verse 2
well i suppose on second thought this ole town aint so bad
wouldnt hurt me to unload this load of mine
and theres a for sale sign on a little house
i saw just about a mile or so from here
but ive always been the kind for pulling up the stakes
its aint never been like me to put down roots
but now im thinking who am i kidding
i aint going nowhere
when she smiles at me
looks a while at me
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
and that changes everything
thats a whole another deal
that puts a brand new spin
on this ole rolling wheel
thats some powerful stuff
thats a girl in love
and thats one thing
that changes everything

and that changes everything
thats a whole another deal
that puts a brand new spin
on this ole rolling wheel
thats some powerful stuff
thats a girl in love
and thats one thing
that changes everythingembed"
