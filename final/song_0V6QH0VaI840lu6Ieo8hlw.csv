saw you again for the first time
in a long time
it brought out all these feelings that i never knew i had inside seeing you with another girl it didnt sit me with me too well
and im mad at myself cause i love you
and with or without you im going through hell

chorus
i dont think that i could shake ya
so baby can we make up
i know that this is kinda crazy
but baby i wanna make up
i dont think that i could shake you
so baby can we make up
i know that this is kinda crazy
but baby i wanna make up

verse 2
i never knew i could love you
how i love you
i thought that i was through with you
so glad that i could be single
now im gone thinking bout the past
and wish that we could just go back
and im mad at myself cause i love you
and i really want you to come on back

i dont know if im crazy
but all the pain and the heartache you gave me
