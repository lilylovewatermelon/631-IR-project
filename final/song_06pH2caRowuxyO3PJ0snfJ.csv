are you feelin that way
arent you terrified
of wakin up too tired to try again

are you happy now
that youve shut yourself down
are you paralyzed
by all the nonsense thats gone down

i know youre gonna see these things some day

sorryeyed we spent so much of your time
now im tryin to put your riddle to a rhyme
now its up up up im headin for this evenin
and its up up up im headed for the clouds

comin down aint the worst part
it only takes a second
to make a change thats gonna last

i hope youre gonna see these things some day
so dont stop lookin for that light along the way

sorry that weve spent so much of your time
now im tryin to put your riddle to a rhyme
now its up up up and headin for this evenin
and its up up up im headed for the cloudssee the goo goo dolls liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likeembed"
