sui sui

verse 1 crim
they said we wasnt shit now they all want to die
sold souls grow cold with the devil on my side
sippin 4s swervin slow with them 20s on my ride
pussy strong because i glo but all them hos they get denied
nother bitch nother day with another blunt smoked
hit the switches on the lake on my mirror is a rope
suicide til we ashes fifty nine grey bastards
after that just take my urn and fucking dump it on the pastor

bridge mitchell bay
i used to be passive so when i pass please just grab a wrap and roll me up and smoke me im talking bout my ashes
yeah just let me go off

verse 2 ruby da cherry
im from the seventh aint no heaven
in my destination engine revvin aimin for the lake and bettin on how long it takes for me to sink below i go so low so low
aint got no ho i know im dead cause when its cold outside i see no breath
i know im dead because my neck is red from rigor mortis
settlin im settlin down underneath the ground inside the grave that lick keep digging yeah he never finished because death is eternal bitch im infernal internally determined to murder myself

verse 3 mitchell bay
with the pain that ive engraved all up in my subconscious
from the self doubt among a couple other problems
i make my way through the flames
unmasked like kane brimstones in my pocket
there aint shit that you constructed so the fuck down
is where you can sit ridin rround with suicide
in the no on that voodoo tip
when i blow up when i blow uup
gonna cop a necklace that doubles as a belt when i murder myself
please play reservoir dogs at my celebration of life
i dont want a funeral i dont want no crying
tell my mama that im sorry that this is not a final memo
when i spilled the apple juice in the hall
feeding whats eatin at me i will feast until i starve
behaving selfdestructive
hiphop cracked my shell up open
unleashed my soul planted a third eye up on my fore
closing out the openings of stores
when i go off when i go off
feelin like gorilla zoe mixtape a month
i get so lost when im in the booth when i press record
i just might say thank you based god on a song with uicideboy
oh my lord feelin evil lucid i might peel em like im
like im luca magnotta rockin rothco with my papa derek deano bumpin clams casino yeah wrestle with my demons like ricky the dragon steamboat
mitchy man savage carlito i record on an apple with a hawaiian shirt on
rowdy roddy piper mixed with lil rowdy motherfucker off the street
im always spittin one too manyyou might also likeembed"
