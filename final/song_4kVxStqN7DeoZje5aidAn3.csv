from venus to mars back to earth
back to the hbo satellite
its showtime nigga
king geedorah on the boards king geedorah mf doom
and i am mister fantastik

verse 1 mr fantastik  mf doom
expeditiously i be on my grizzly
feds try to creep me somehow always miss me
mr fantastik put the busy in the bee
rock from the bottom straight to the tizzy
who is he he need to get out more
or either get out of here like some dang outlaw
standing like lurch no herb in the record bin
called him for a random search for curbside checkin in
its on nigga on and cracking
like digem lips be smacking
running off at the mouth steady talkin bout us
on some shit they overheard but enough is enough
yeah its neither here nor there black
warfare in your ear clackclackclackclackclack
whats that you hearing things tattattattattat
be wearing your thinking hat

chorus mf doom  mr fantastik
no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
we got king geedorah on the boards with that golden sound
are you serious
of course
they dont know how we get down when were out of town
deadly serious
king geedorah
so when you see us in the streets dont be fuckin around
perfect
you might also likeverse 2 mr fantastik  mf doom
a hundred things on the reup of course im living fat
my mercedes outside nigga where yours at
top down on a good day decatur out on wood way
got cats thinking should i stay fuck what the hood say
niggas wanna rob me now bitches wanna slob me now
hoes didnt holler last year feel sorry now
practice jumpshots reggie mill robert horry now
the nigga that you with played like atari now
lyrically unorthodox i flow continuous
never on a straight path im known to bend and twist
put it down from the suburbs to the tenement
you betting gainst me but wanna wonder where your money went
i get the cash take niggas out like trash
known to stack a mean stash they used to call me pure math
back in the days all i did was stay paid
but as they say in the south bitch give me some head
excuse me mister do she got a sister
who he not to kiss her true she do got a blister
now the movie plot twists like a twizzler
if i needed my meat burnt id go to sizzler
getting paid like a biker with the best crank
spray it like a highranked sniper in the west bank
type to just blank and dont show much pity
when im in the city i always keep a dutch with me
touch her titty til she ask me where the trees is at
or tell me dont squeeze that rats wanna tease a cat
let the dog beg wait up who talking
doom with the hog leg straight up new yorkin
chorus mf doom  mr fantastik
no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
thats correct
we got king geedorah on the boards with that golden sound
king geedorah
they dont know how we get down when were out of town
i just cant stand the guy
so when you see us in the streetsâ€”16embed"
