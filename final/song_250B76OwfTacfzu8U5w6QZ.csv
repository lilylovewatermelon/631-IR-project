i like kicking back on the sofa
flipping through the channels just to see whats on
and i enjoy eating eggs over easy
sopping up with a biscuit til the yellows gone

chorus
but aint nothing like watching a bunch of youngins
run screaming through the sprinkler in their little bare feet
aint nothing like finding twenty dollars
in the pocket of the britches that you wore last week

verse 2
i get into getting out on my mower
in the early morning hours fore the sun gets hot
and i like going down to the kroger
when the carnival comes to the parking lot

chorus
but aint nothing like throwin a hula popper
dragging it across a spot a biggun ought to be
aint nothing like having him for supper
with some good hush puppies and some sweet iced tea

bridge
this old world holds all kinds of treasures
and every day it just keeps gettin better
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 3
cause aint nothing like finding that woman
that you know youre gonna love for the rest of your life
and aint nothing like knowing the lords acoming
back one day to make you wanna do right

chorus
aint nothing like watching a bunch of youngins
run screaming through the sprinkler in their little bare feet
aint nothing like finding twenty dollars
in the pocket of the britches that you wore last week
aint nothing like throwin a hula popper
dragging it across a spot a biggun ought to be
aint nothing like having him for supper
with some good hush puppies and some sweet iced tea2embed"
