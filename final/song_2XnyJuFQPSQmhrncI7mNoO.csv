verse 1 the kid laroi
i hope you know what you did to me
im grateful for what you did for me
you showed me that you aint shit and these bitches is dangerous
now i do em just how you did to me
and i know you see the pain in my eyes every secret and lie
got a reason to cry fore i sleep at night
i need my peace of mind i see you fine
but im far from that so—

prechorus the kid laroi
now ima be savage but you made it happen
and you made a habit i get it now
i wonder what happened
i thought we would last til we turn into ashes
burnin and crashin

i just feel sorry for my next one
