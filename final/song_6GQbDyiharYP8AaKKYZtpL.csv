when it hits the brain like cocaine
spinning around and round
i cant get up without your help
ive fallen down

all i can taste is champagne
another day down the drain
sleeping around and round
we cant make up without your help
its over now

chorus
you want it
you need it
you cant explain
you fight it
you feed it
you can and i can live without you
oh moving on without you oh

love is like novocaine
and it leaves a little stain
the beauty in all this pain is
i cant get away from you
so pull me down
and dont make a sound
you might also likechorus
all i can taste is champagne
dancing away down my veins
spinning around and round
i cant get up without you help
im on the ground

somebody help me
im losing everything when im without you
ohh doing it without you ohh

all i can taste is champagne
another day down the drain
all i can taste is champagne
all i can taste is champagneembed"
