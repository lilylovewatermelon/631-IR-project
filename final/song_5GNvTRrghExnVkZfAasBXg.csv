verse 1
broken hearts rain on our heads til it floods
but i won’t run i’m with you that’s enough
kiss me now so you won’t run

hook
out of breath underwater
girl you can hold on longer
girl you can hold on longer
girl you can hold on longer
long as you want
oh oh oh oh

verse 2
love is an ocean
swimming and try not to drown
right in the waves
praying we don’t go down
in the undertow i’ll pull you out

hook
out of breath underwater
girl you can hold on longer
girl you can hold on longer
girl you can hold on longer
long as you want
oh oh oh ohsee john legend liveget tickets as low as 71you might also like3embed"
