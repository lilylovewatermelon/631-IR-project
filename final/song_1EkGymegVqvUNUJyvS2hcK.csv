first i turned the nile river into blood
then i released the frogs as the city floods
along with lice flies and i diseased your livestock
then i make sure the boils grow on your wife and child
look up at the fucking sky youll see a storm of hail and fire
then i sent out the locusts to swarm your fucking crops
i blacked out the sun and made time stop
next im coming for your firstborn son watch him drop

verse 1 yung plague
bitch im yung plague here to spread the flames
makin it fucking rain alligator fangs
lightin the flame that ignited the revelation of osiris
im risin above the horizon i blackened the diamond
and siphoned all of the water supply of zion
bitch i cut the head clean off of the lion
put it on a spike and all of the sheep became enlightened bitch
im standin right beside poseidon bout to release all the titans
footprints in the sand followed by a herd of rotten bison

bridge pontius pilate
grey grey grey grey
grey grey grey grey
grey grey grey grey
grey grey grey grey
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 pontius pilate
crucify me with the nails in my feet
with the nails in my wrists and that blade in my chest
enlightened by zion im wearin the lion
with teeth on a rope that surrounding my neck
standing in fire im god of the liars
attire is made up of nothin but wire
the choir is singin my praises with phrases that let you all know im the bastard of satan
black in my eyes homicide on my mind
with that blood on my face then i turn it to wine
yung christ the divine make them fall into line
let the planets align as they build me a shrine
the end of the world as you know it
when im up in hell i turn fire to snow bitch
the waters they swell as the polars are broken
evoking the smoke from the bodies thats choking ho80embed"
