i cant help but think of you
oooohhh
since youve been gone away
ive been left feeling blue

no one can take
this pain away
my hours seem to turn to days
as if im out of time
no more to lose
no more to gain
it seems the clouds
cant take the rain
cause it keeps pouring down

but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
again again
you might also likeoooh oooh ohhhh

looking out my window
i cant help but reminisce
the times we shared
ohhhohhh
this memories
of you and me

i look up and
the sky is cold
how could someone
just take your soul so fast
and now your gone
i quit my job
i cant stop smoking
please believe
my heart is broken down
im all alone

but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
but to see my sunshine again
again again
im tired of the dark
in need of the light
i wake up each morning
waiting for the rise
im scared of outside
cause it might wash me away
i wish i could open these curtains
and ill go and see you again
ill see you again
if i could hold you again
if i could feel you again
if i could touch you again

ooooh oohhh

to see my sunshine again
just to see my sunshine again
to see my sunshine again
just to see my sunshine again
to see my sunshine again
just to see my sunshine again
to see my sunshine again
ohhhembed"
