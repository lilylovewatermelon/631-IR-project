send away for a priceless gift
one not subtle one not on the list
send away for a perfect world
one not simply so absurd
in these times of doing what youre told
keep these feelings no one knows

prechorus
whatever happened to the young mans heart
swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart

chorus
and im starin down the barrel of a 45 45
swimmin through the ashes of another life another life
no real reason to accept the way things have changed
starin down the barrel of a 45

verse 2
send a message to the unborn child
keep your eyes open for a while
in a box high up on the shelf
left for you no one else
theres a piece of a puzzle known as life
wrapped in guilt sealed up tight

whatever happened to the young mans heart
swallowed by pain as he slowly fell apart

and im starin down the barrel of a 45 45
swimmin through the ashes of another life another life
no real reason to accept the way things have changed
starin down the barrel of a 45

everyones pointing their fingers
always condemning me
and nobody knows what i believe

chorus
and im starin down the barrel of a 45 45
swimmin through the ashes of another life another life
no real reason to accept the way things have changed
starin down the barrel of a 45
and im starin down the barrel of a 45 woah
and im swimmin through the ashes of another life woah
there is no real reason to accept the way things have changed woah
starin down the barrel of a 45 45
