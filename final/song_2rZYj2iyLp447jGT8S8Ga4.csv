yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
theres always cracks
a crack of sunlight
a crack in the mirror or on your lips
its the morning on a sunset friday
when all conversations twist
its the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
but the ice should be on our heads
we only spun the web to catch ourselves
so we werent left for dead

prechorus
and i was never lookin for approval from anyone but you
and though this journeys over id go back if you ask me to

chorus
im not dead just floating
right between the ink on your tattoo
in the belly of the beast we turned into
im not scared just changing
right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
youre my crack of sunlight
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 2
you can do the math a thousand ways but you cant erase the facts
that others come and others go but you always come back
im the winter flower underground always thirsty for summer rain
and just like the change of seasons
i know youll be back again

chorus
im not dead just floating
underneath the ink of my tattoo
ive tried to hide my scars from you
im not scared just changing
right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
youre my crack of sunlight oh

bridge
im not dead just yet
im not dead im just floating
doesnt matter where im going
ill find you im not scared at all
underneath the cuts and bruises
finally gained what no one loses
ill find you i will find you

outro
im not dead just floating
im not scared just changing
youre my crack of sunlight yeah2embed"
