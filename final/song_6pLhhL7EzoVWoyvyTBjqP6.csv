till you show me what this life is for
round and round im not gonna let you change my mind
till you show me what this life is for

we are afflicted by fiction by fiction
buildin a case for eviction eviction circlin ohohoh ohoh
guarding a tower of ancients of ancients
shootin down arrows of patience impatiently circlin ohohoh ohoh
