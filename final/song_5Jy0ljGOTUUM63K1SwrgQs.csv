mmmm
the flow is toe in precision as an afro trim
all big letters but isnt no acronym
smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
ddt the first bar leave this track back broken
chrome grown men doing business with anglosax and them
lacking swing but that banjos so relaxing
as the wax spin hacking axes in the wind
pretend its just a pen see if you can pencil em in
tense mention men of honor fenced in
census is tens the wheels fall off then its the end
dont get keelhauled in
villain always been feel real genuine ballskin
not to call the whole crowd out
its just a few chumps and you know who you are like a shoutout
place em in your loud mouth and taste em like a pastry
waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully
disappear reappear and disappear again
villain not his hair hes no afroamerican
if thats the case hed be a baldheaded african
taking all the credit and jetted astral traveling
turn a man into a mannequin for aflacn
and being tough actin tinactin bluff jacking
he wears a mask so when he dogs his face
each and every race could absorb the bass
in the place to be dont believe the hyperbole
its like a murder spree get sniped verbally
or beat in the head with lead pipe languages
for street cred leave him for dead in anguishments
the slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses
who came to help the people with they minds in they asses
you set trip and get a grip like spalding
these walls is thin feel genuine ballskinyou might also like8embed"
