i would say any line
id try to get you near to me
but youve never been one
to love being lied to
and this artificial side
just makes me disappear from you

so im gathering up the truth
and im giving it all to you
if its the last thing i do
cause i wont be free till i give it all to you

its not as heavy as it seems
all im saying
you dont have to drag it out
kicking and screaming
when it finally comes
i hope you hear me
then whatever chained us down
becomes whatever sets us free

so im gathering up the truth
and im giving it all to you
if its the last thing i do
cause i wont be free till i give it all to you
you might also likeyeah im gathering up the truth
and im giving it all to you
theres nothing more i can do
cause i wont be free

its not as easy as you make it sound
not even when i try to sound it out
i try my best to make it come around
but its not that easy for meembed"
