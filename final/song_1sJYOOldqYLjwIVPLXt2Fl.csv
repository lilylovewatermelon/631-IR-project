ive been a hat down marlboro red
ive kept my boots right by my bed
so i can take off when i want to
and ive been a long lost desperado
got a pass everywhere that i go
cut from the cloth of a sinner on the back pew
i aint proud of it but thats the truth

chorus
ive hammered down that fast lane
pedal slow dance with the midnight devil
woke up places way to far from home
and ive earned that outlaw reckless lable
never thought id need an angel that could slow down this heart of a rollin stone
yeah ive made mistakes done everything under the sun that a man can do
aw but she still thinks that i hung the moon

verse 2
shes a home town hallelujah
them baby blues will cut right through you
heart of gold and heaven bound
i cant believe shes still around

chorus
as ive hammered down that fast lane
pedal slow dance with the midnight devil
woke up places way to far from home
and ive earned that outlaw reckless label
never thought id need an angel that could slow down this heart of a rollin stone
yeah ive made mistakes done everything under the sun that a man can do
aw but she still thinks that i hung the moon
