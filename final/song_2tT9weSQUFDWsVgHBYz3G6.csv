chorus
is it casual
or are you tryna spend your life with me
i dont mean to pressure you
but i want a man to stand and fight stand and fight for me

verse 1
you dont need to paint me a sweet fantasy
we chill i kick back you roll up my weed
say what you feel dont just say anything
why complicate what could be so easy
leave me alone
if you is a player i dont think ima play with you uhuh
this shit get old
if you wanna lay with her why dont you just stay with her

prechorus
you say you dont want a girlfriend but when we are in person
you always act so different you make it all seem perfect
you hold me when we wake up say you like me with no makeup
im tryin to be patient how am i supposed to take it
