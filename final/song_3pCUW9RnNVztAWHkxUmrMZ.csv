sado potato ate a raw tomato
in the back yard of our first garden
and i didnt know that we could argue over small shit
for so long

chorus
oh eliza
im good n gone im good n gone
oh eliza
she movin on she movin on

verse 2
sado potato ate that raw tomato
and i dont know if they still grow in the old home
we were supposed to get old in
but the last time i saw you
you know that i get choked up where does time go
cause she said onward and upward

chorus
oh eliza
im good n gone im good n gone
oh eliza
she movin on she movin on

outro
sado potato ate a raw tomato
in the backyard of our first garden
but everyones afraid of the times
cause we all get plucked from the vineembed"
