there’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light
in the fine print they tell me what’s wrong and what’s right
and it comes in black and it comes in white
and i’m frightened by those that don’t see it

verse 2
when nothing is owed or deserved or expected
and your life doesn’t change by the man that’s elected
if you’re loved by someone you’re never rejected
decide what to be and go be it

chorus
there was a dream and one day i could see it
like a bird in a cage i broke in and demanded that somebody free it
and there was a kid with a head full of doubt
so i’ll scream til i die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

verse 3
there’s a darkness upon you that’s flooded in light
and in the fine print they tell you what’s wrong and what’s right
and it flies by day and it flies by night
and i’m frightened by those that don’t see it

chorus
there was a dream and one day i could see it
like a bird in a cage i broke in and demanded that somebody free it
and there was a kid with a head full of doubt
so i’ll scream til i die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

chorus
there was a dream and one day i could see it
like a bird in a cage i broke in and demanded that somebody free it
and there was a kid with a head full of doubt
so i’ll scream til i die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

outro
there’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light
in the fine print they tell me what’s wrong and what’s right
there’s a darkness upon me that’s flooded in light
and i’m frightened by those that don’t see it3embed"
