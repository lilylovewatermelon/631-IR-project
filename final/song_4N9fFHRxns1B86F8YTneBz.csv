on and on reckless abandon
somethings wrong this is gonna shock them
nothing to hold on to
well use this song to lead you on

verse 1 tom delonge
i learned a lot today not sure if ill get laid and
not sure if ill fail or pass kissed every girl in class
everybody would waste it all to have a summer that they could call
a memory thats full of fun fucked up when its all done

chorus tom delonge
on and on reckless abandon
somethings wrong this is gonna shock them
nothing to hold on to
well use this song to lead you on

and break the truth with more bad news
we left a scar size extralarge

verse 2 tom delonge
sip a drink of the alcohol end up kneeling in bathroom stalls
eyes are red and my movements slow too high got vertigo
he took a shit in the bathroom tub and fed the dog brownie drugs
tried hard to not get caught he fucked a chick in the parking lot

break a window and bust a wall making fun of your friends mom
turn the music up way too loud charge the pizza to the house
everybody would waste it all to have a summer that they could call
a memory thats full of fun fucked up when its all done
