whats the difference of never knowing at all
when every step i take is always too small
maybe its just something i cant admit
but lately i feel like i dont give a shit

chorus
motivations such an aggravation
accusations dont know how to take them
inspirations getting hard to fake it
concentration never hard to break it
situation never what you want it to be

verse 2
whats the point of never making mistakes
selfindulgence such a hard habit to break
its all just a waste of time in the end
dont care so why should i even pretend

chorus
motivations such an aggravation
accusations dont know how to take them
inspirations getting hard to fake it
concentration never hard to break it
situation never what you wanted

nothings new everythings the same
keeps on draggin me down its getting kind of lame
falling further behind theres nothing to explain
no matter what you say nothings gonna change my mind

bridge
cant depend on doubt until the end
it seems like leaving friends has become this years trend
and though i cant pretend afraid to be this way
its not the same but whos to blame for all those stupid things i never said

chorus
motivations such an aggravation
accusations dont know how to take them
inspirations getting hard to fake it
concentration never hard to break it
motivations such an aggravation
accusations dont know how to take them
inspirations getting hard to fake it
concentration situation never what you want it to be

outro
never what you want it to be
never what you want it to be3embed"
