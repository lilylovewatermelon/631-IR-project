i know where i went wrong when i loved you more then i loved myself
i would have done anything for you aye aye aye aye
and i learned when i realized you didnt love me the way that i loved you but now i know
its hurts inside aye aye aye aye
aye aye aye

chorus
gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
the way it used to be
and the way it used to feel
before i fell in love
fell in love with you
gotta get my heart back to the way it used to love
the way it used to be
and the way it used to feel
before i fell in love
fell in love with you

verse 2
all i want is true love
couldnt tolerate no more loving someone
who couldnt learn to love somebody else

the same road ive seen before
but no one told me that it would hurt this way
and my life wouldnt be the same

ive seen niggas get crossed up cause they the realist
and all the realist niggas in the

it comes from being neglected and im so alone
im in my own zone tryna get my heart back
