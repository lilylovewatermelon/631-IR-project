verse 1
when the sun is burning out
and the night is pouring in
now is the time to run run boy
now is the time to hide

theres nobody out on the beach
theres nobody down in the woods
were gonna do it alone
were gonna do it outside

and i can feel the air its sticking to our skin so tight
and i can feel theres something in this air tonight
i really got it bad

but its still so good so good
that i got it at all and it was

ravishing
and the wind is like a finger

verse 2
and if an angel broke his wings
would he come to you for parts
i need a couple of wings boy boy
i need a reason to soar
and if the devil lost his fire
theres nobody out on the beach
could he count on you for sparks
theres nobody out in the woods
theres something we ought to try now
we ought to try it some more

and theres a chance that well be glowing in the dark tonight

but it still felt good so good
just to get it at all and its so
