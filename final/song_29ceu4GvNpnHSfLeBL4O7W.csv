where would you go
not long ago iâ€™ve been thinking out loud
why so suddenly dddont you know
dont do it what you do oh what you do to me
forever is a long long time
when youve lost your way
trying to follow your ideal
oh sorry but your socalled life
it is such a waste

prechorus
wear your real eyes
no you dont realize
what you say yes to
but you say yes too

chorus
where would you go where would you go
with a lasso
could you run into could you run into
could you go and run into me
where would you go where would you go
tied up to a lasso
could you run into could you run into
could you go and run into me

so lonely so pretty such a lack of diplomacy
you cant get out
ddont you know oh dont do it
what you do well you should do to me
far out so far out such a fallout
not only that youre lonely
dont matter if youre not so well not so well
no youre not so well

chorus
where would you go where would you go
with a lasso
could you run into could you run into
could you go and run into me
where would you go where would you go
tied up to a lasso
could you run into could you run into
could you go and run into me

postchorus
wear your real eyes
no you dont realize
what you say yes to
but you say yes too
outro
tomorrow forever is a long long time
when youve lost your way
tomorrow forever is a long long time
when youve lost your way10embed"
