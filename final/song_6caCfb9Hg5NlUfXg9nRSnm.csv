a break in the narrative old friends in new aspects — the marquis de norpois — bergotte — how i cease for the time being to see gilberte a general outline of the sorrow caused by a parting and of the irregular process of oblivion

    my mother when it was a question of our having m de norpois to dinner for the first time having expressed her regret that professor cottard was away from home and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of swann since either of these might have helped to entertain the old ambassador my father replied that so eminent a guest so distinguished a man of science as cottard could never be out of place at a dinnertable but that swann with his ostentation his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew however slightly was an impossible vulgarian whom the marquis de norpois would be sure to dismiss as — to use his own epithet — a ‘pestilent’ fellow now this attitude on my father’s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation inasmuch as some of us no doubt remember a cottard of distinct mediocrity and a swann by whom modesty and discretion in all his social relations were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy but in his case what had happened was that to the original ‘young swann’ and also to the swann of the jockey club our old friend had added a fresh personality which was not to be his last that of odette’s husband adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct the desire the industry which he had always had he had laboriously constructed for himself a long way beneath the old a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him in this he shewed himself another man since while he continued to go by himself to the houses of his own friends on whom he did not care to inflict odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them it was a new life that he had begun to lead in common with his wife among a new set of people it was quite intelligible that in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure the selfesteem that were to be derived from entertaining them he should have made use as a standard of comparison not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of odette and yet even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives the wallflowers of ministerial ballrooms that he was now anxious to associate it was still astonishing to hear him who in the old days and even still would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to twickenham or to marlborough house proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some assistant undersecretary for something had returned mme swann’s call it will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity and that like certain other israelites my parents’ old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners but the chief reason — and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole — was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them that if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order it takes us by surprise and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play swann in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings and in the pride with which he referred to them was like those great artists — modest or generous by nature — who if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements or who after giving away a canvas cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes

    as for professor cottard we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure much later in the course of our story with the ‘mistress’ mme verdurin in her country house la raspelière for the present the following observations must suffice first of all in the case of swann the alteration might indeed be surprising since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when i used to see gilberte’s father in the champselysées where moreover as he never spoke to me he could not very well have made any display of his political relations it is true that if he had done so i might not at once have discerned his vanity for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one’s eyes and ears my mother for three whole years had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid until one day a streak too much or possibly something else brought about the phenomenon known as supersaturation all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised and my mother in the face of this sudden riot of colour declared in the best combray manner that it was a perfect scandal and almost severed relations with her niece with cottard on the contrary the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of swann to the verdurins was now buried in the past whereas honours offices and titles come with the passage of years moreover a man may be illiterate and make stupid puns and yet have a special gift which no amount of general culture can replace — such as the gift of a great strategist or physician and so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner who had attained in course of time to european celebrity that the rest of his profession regarded cottard the most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert — for a year or two that is to say for fashions being themselves begotten of the desire for change are quick to change also — that if they themselves ever fell ill cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives no doubt they preferred socially to meet certain others who were better read more artistic with whom they could discuss nietzsche and wagner when there was a musical party at mme cottard’s on the evenings when she entertained — in the hope that it might one day make him dean of the faculty — the colleagues and pupils of her husband he instead of listening preferred to play cards in another room yet everybody praised the quickness the penetration the unerring confidence with which at a glance he could diagnose disease thirdly in considering the general impression which professor cottard must have made on a man like my father we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always even if it is often his original character developed or withered attenuated or enlarged it is sometimes the exact opposite like a garment that has been turned except from the verdurins who were infatuated with him cottard’s hesitating manner his excessive timidity and affability had in his young days called down upon him endless taunts and sneers what charitable friend counselled that glacial air the importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt wherever he went save at the verdurins’ where he instinctively became himself again he would assume a repellent coldness remain silent as long as possible be peremptory when he was obliged to speak and not forget to say the most cutting things he had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients who seeing him for the first time were not in a position to make comparisons and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature complete impassivity was what he strove to attain and even while visiting his hospital wards when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone from the house physician to the junior student helpless with laughter he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache

    but who the reader has been asking was the marquis de norpois well he had been minister plenipotentiary before the war and was actually an ambassador on the sixteenth of may in spite of which and to the general astonishment he had since been several times chosen to represent france on extraordinary missions — even as controller of the public debt in egypt where thanks to his great capability as a financier he had rendered important services — by radical cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve and in whose eyes m de norpois in view of his past his connexions and his opinions ought presumably to have been suspect but these advanced ministers seemed to consider that in making such an appointment they were shewing how broad their own minds were when the supreme interests of france were at stake were raising themselves above the general run of politicians were meriting from the journal des débats itself the title of ‘statesmen’ and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment and they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to m de norpois without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee and in this calculation the government of the republic were not mistaken in the first place because an aristocrat of a certain type brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him an asset of whose value his peers or persons of even higher rank can form a fairly exact estimate knows that he can dispense with the efforts since they can in no way enhance his position in which without any appreciable result so many public men of the middle class spend themselves — to profess only the ‘right’ opinions to frequent only the ‘sound’ people anxious on the other hand to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals such as political power a literary or an artistic reputation or a large fortune and so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires after whom all the professional families run helterskelter but of his intimacy with whom were he to profess it a prince would think nothing he will lavish on the politicians who freemasons or worse though they be can advance him in diplomacy or ‘back’ him in an election and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to ‘arrive’ in those departments in which they excel on everyone in fact who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to ‘bring off’ a rich marriage

    but in the character of m de norpois there was this predominant feature that in the course of a long career of diplomacy he had become imbued with that negative methodical conservative spirit called ‘governmental’ which is common to all governments and under every government particularly inspires its foreign office he had imbibed during that career an aversion a dread a contempt for the methods of procedure more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect which are those of an opposition save in the case of a few illiterates — high or low it makes no matter — by whom no difference in quality is perceptible what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit an academician of the kind of legouvé and therefore an upholder of the classics would applaud maxime ducamp’s or mezière’s eulogy of victor hugo with more fervour than that of boileau by claudel a common nationalism suffices to endear barrés to his electors who scarcely distinguish between him and m georges berry but does not endear him to those of his brother academicians who with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind will prefer to him even such open adversaries as m ribot and m deschanel with whom in turn the most loyal monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with maurras or léon daudet although these also are living in the hope of a glorious restoration miserly in the use of words not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve but because words themselves have more value present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts protracted over a decade to bring two countries to an understanding are condensed translated — in a speech or in a protocol — into a single adjective colourless in all appearance but to them pregnant with a world of meaning m de norpois was considered very stiff at the commission where he sat next to my father whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old ambassador unbent to him my father was himself more astonished than anyone for not being as a rule very affable his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow he realised that these overtures were an outcome in the diplomat of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends from which all a man’s intellectual qualities his refinement his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him when at the same time he bores or irritates one than are the mere straightforwardness and goodhumour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous “de norpois has asked me to dinner again it’s quite extraordinary everyone on the commission is amazed as he never has any personal relations with any of us i am sure he’s going to tell me something thrilling again about the ‘seventy war” my father knew that m de norpois had warned had perhaps been alone in warning the emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of prussia and that bismarck rated his intelligence most highly only the other day at the opera during the gala performance given for king theodosius the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that monarch had held with m de norpois “i must ask him whether the king’s visit had any real significance” my father went on for he was keenly interested in foreign politics “i know old norpois keeps very close as a rule but when he’s with me he opens out quite charmingly”

    as for my mother perhaps the ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted i should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession class and period — a period which for that profession and that class might be said not to have altogether passed away — that i sometimes regret that i have not kept any literal record simply of the things that i have heard him say i should thus have obtained an effect of oldfashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the palaisroyal who when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats answered “i do not find my hats i keep them” in a word i suppose that my mother considered m de norpois a trifle ‘outofdate’ which was by no means a fault in her eyes so far as manners were concerned but attracted her less in the region — not in this instance of ideas for those of m de norpois were extremely modern — but of idiom she felt however that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him by confirming in my father’s mind the good opinion that he already had of m de norpois and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence and as she was incapable of deceiving my father she compelled herself to admire the old ambassador so as to be able to praise him with sincerity incidentally she could naturally and did appreciate his kindness his somewhat antiquated courtesy so ceremonious that when as he was walking along the street his tall figure rigidly erect he caught sight of my mother driving past before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted his conversation so elaborately circumspect in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking his promptness in answering a letter which was so astonishing that whenever my father just after posting one himself to m de norpois saw his handwriting upon an envelope his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must unfortunately have crossed in the post which one was led to suppose bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night my mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy so friendly although so much in demand never realising that ‘although’ with such people is invariably an unrecognised ‘because’ and that just as old men are always wonderful for their age and kings extraordinarily simple and country cousins astonishingly wellinformed it was the same system of habits that enabled m de norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest she rated everything that concerned herself below and consequently outside the range of other people’s duties and engagements the letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father’s friend to have written us promptly since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write she excepted from that great number of letters of which actually it was a unit in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was for m de norpois merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life she never guessed that the ambassador had trained himself long ago to look upon diningout as one of his diplomatic functions and to display at table an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us

    the evening on which m de norpois first appeared at our table in a year when i still went to play in the champselysées has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which i at last went to hear berma at a matinée in phèdre and also because in talking to m de norpois i realised suddenly and in a new and different way how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned gilberte swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else

    it was no doubt the sight of the depression in which i was plunged by the approach of the new year holidays in which as she herself had informed me i was to see nothing of gilberte that prompted my mother one day in the hope of distracting my mind to suggest “if you are still so anxious to hear berma i think that your father would allow you perhaps to go your grandmother can take you”

    but it was because m de norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear berma that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life that my father who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time with the added risk of my falling ill again on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling ‘futilities’ was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included in some vague way in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career my grandmother who in renouncing on my behalf the profit which according to her i should have derived from hearing berma had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from m de norpois reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me she now deplored as something disastrous this infringement that i was to make of my rules and in a tone of despair protested “how easily led you are” to my father who replied angrily “what so it’s you that are not for letting him go now that is really too much after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him”

    m de norpois had also brought about a change in my father’s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself my father had always meant me to become a diplomat and i could not endure the thought that even if i did have to stay for some years first at the ministry i should run the risk of being sent later on as ambassador to capitals in which no gilberte dwelt i should have preferred to return to the literary career that i had planned for myself and had been abandoned years before in my wanderings along the guermantes way but my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy refusing even to dignify it with the title of career until the day when m de norpois who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents assured him that it was quite possible by writing to attract as much attention to receive as much consideration to exercise as much influence and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the embassies

    “well well i should never have believed it old norpois doesn’t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing” my father had reported and as he had a certain amount of influence himself he imagined that there was nothing that could not be ‘arranged’ no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who ‘counted’ “i shall bring him back to dinner one of these days from the commission you must talk to him a little and let him see what he thinks of you write something good that you can shew him he is an intimate friend of the editor of the deuxmondes he will get you in there he will arrange it all the cunning old fox and upon my soul he seems to think that diplomacy nowadays ——”

    my happiness in the prospect of not being separated from gilberte made me desirous but not capable of writing something good which could be shewn to m de norpois after a few laboured pages weariness made the pen drop from my fingers i cried with anger at the thought that i should never have any talent that i was not ‘gifted’ that i could not even take advantage of the chance that m de norpois’s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in paris the recollection that i was to be taken to hear berma alone distracted me from my grief but just as i did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence so i should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which swann had told me that she touched the sublime for when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather instead of these other inferior impressions which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of beauty berma in andromaque in les caprices de marianne in phèdre was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired i should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola i glided to the foot of the titian of the frari or the carpaccios of san giorgio dei schiavoni were i ever to hear berma repeat the lines beginning

                                 nous seigneur — —”

    i was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page but my heart beat furiously at the thought — as of the realisation of a longplanned voyage — that i should at length behold them bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold a carpaccio in venice berma in phèdre masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour the dignity attaching to them made so living to me that is to say so indivisible that if i had been taken to see carpaccios in one of the galleries of the louvre or berma in some piece of which i had never heard i should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length with wideopen eyes before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams then while i waited expecting to derive from berma’s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief it would seem to me that whatever greatness whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value instead of what would after all be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web

    finally if i went to hear berma in a new piece it would not be easy for me to judge of her art of her diction since i should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself whereas the old plays the classics which i knew by heart presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls reserved and made ready for my inspection on which i should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which berma would cover them as with frescoes with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration unfortunately for some years now since she had retired from the great theatres to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the ‘star’ she had ceased to appear in classic parts and in vain did i scan the hoardings they never advertised any but the newest pieces written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment when one morning as i stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the new year holidays i saw there for the first time — at the foot of the bill after some probably insignificant curtainraiser whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which i was ignorant — two acts ofphèdre with mme berma and on the following afternoons le demimonde les caprices de marianne names which like that of phèdre were for me transparent filled with light only so familiar were those works to me illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art they seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility mme berma herself when i read in the newspapers after the programme of these performances that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations she was conscious then that certain stageparts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival she regarded them when interpreted by herself as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago or of that which had never yet seen her in them in thus advertising in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening this phèdre a title no longer than any of the rest nor set in different type she added something indescribable as though a hostess introducing you before you all go in to dinner to her other guests were to mention casually amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more and without any change of tone—“m anatole france”

    the doctor who was attending me — the same who had forbidden me to travel — advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre i should only be ill again afterwards perhaps for weeks and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience the fear of this might have availed to stop me if what i had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it but what i demanded from this performance — just as from the visit to balbec the visit to venice for which i had so intensely longed — was something quite different from pleasure a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which i lived which once acquired could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents — even though it were the cause of bodily suffering — of my otiose existence at best the pleasure which i was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths and i hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled i implored my parents who after the doctor’s visit were no longer inclined to let me go to phèdre i repeated all day long to myself the speech beginning

                   “on dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de nous                                    — —”

    seeking out every intonation that could be put into it so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which berma would have found of uttering the lines concealed like the holy of holies beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze behind which i invested her every moment with a fresh aspect according to which of the words of bergotte — in the pamphlet that gilberte had found for me — was passing through my mind “plastic nobility” “christian austerity” or “jansenist pallor” “princess of troezen and of cleves” or “mycenean drama” “delphic symbol” “solar myth” that divine beauty whom berma’s acting was to reveal to me night and day upon an altar perpetually illumined sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind my mind for which not itself but my stern my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine and for all time the perfections of the deity unveiled in the same spot where was now her invisible form and with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image i strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way but when those had at last fallen when my mother — albeit this matinée was actually to coincide with the meeting of the commission from which my father had promised to bring m de norpois home to dinner — had said to me “very well we don’t wish you to be unhappy — if you think that you will enjoy it so very much you must go that’s all” when this day of theatregoing hitherto forbidden and unattainable depended now only upon myself then for the first time being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible i asked myself if it were desirable if there were not other reasons than my parents’ prohibition which should make me abandon my design in the first place whereas i had been detesting them for their cruelty their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of lovingkindness and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad “i would rather not go if it hurts you” i told my mother who on the contrary strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going since that she said would spoil the pleasure that i should otherwise derive fromphèdre and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision but then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome besides if i returned home ill should i be well again in time to be able to go to the champselysées as soon as the holidays were over and gilberte returned against all these arguments i set so as to decide which course i should take the idea invisible there behind its veil of the perfections of berma i cast into one pan of the scales “making mamma unhappy” “risking not being able to go on the champselysées” and the other “jansenist pallor” “solar myth” until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind’s vision ceased to say anything to me lost all their force and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if i had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that i might bring them to an end and be delivered from them once and for all it would have been to fix a term to my sufferings and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction yielding to the attractions of perfection that i would let myself be taken not now to the wise goddess but to the stern implacable divinity featureless and unnamed who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil but suddenly everything was altered my desire to go and hear berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matinée with impatience and with joy having gone to take up in front of the column on which the playbills were my daily station as excruciating of late as that of a stylite saint i had seen there still moist and wrinkled the complete bill of phèdre which had just been pasted up for the first time and on which i must confess the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide but it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and — inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which i read it but from that on which the performance would take place and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise — almost imminent well on the way already to its realisation so that i jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day and at that hour precisely i should be sitting there in my place ready to hear the voice of berma and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself i raced back to the house whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place in my mind of “jansenist pallor” and “solar myth” —“ladies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats the doors will be closed at two o’clock”

    alas that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment my father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre on his way to the commission before leaving the house he said to my mother “see that you have a good dinner for us tonight you remember i’m bringing de norpois back with me” my mother had not forgotten and all that day and overnight françoise rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen — of which she was indeed a pastmaster stimulated moreover by the prospect of having a new guest to feed the consciousness that she would have to compose by methods known to her alone a dish of beef in jelly — had been living in the effervescence of creation since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work she had gone herself to the halles to procure the best cuts of rumpsteak shin of beef calves’feet as michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of julius ii— françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that mamma at the sight of her flaming cheeks was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork like the sculptor of the tombs of the medici in the quarries of pietrasanta and overnight françoise had sent to be cooked in the baker’s oven shielded with breadcrumbs like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust what she called a “nev’york ham” believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words and her own ears less trustworthy the first time that she heard anyone mention york ham she had thought no doubt — feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a ‘york’ and a ‘new york’— that she had misheard what was said and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her and so ever since the word york was preceded in her ears or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement by the affix ‘new’ which she pronounced ‘nev’’ and it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchenmaid “go and fetch me a ham from olida’s madame told me especially to get a nev’york” on that particular day if françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth no doubt so long as i had not yet heard berma speak i still felt some pleasure i felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre in which in two hours’ time the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gaslamps shewed up every detail of their structure before the attendants in the boxoffice the selection of whom their promotion all their destiny depended upon the great artist — for she alone held power in the theatre where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession — who took our tickets without even glancing at us so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of mme berma’s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff lest it was not clearly everywhere understood that the hired applause must never sound for her that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage and every door closed tight the moment that she appeared that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her to make the dust settle and for that matter at any moment now her carriage drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes would be stopping outside the theatre she would alight from it muffled in furs and crossly acknowledging everyone’s salute would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends what the temperature was ‘in front’ who were in the other boxes if the programme sellers were looking smart theatre and public being to her no more than a second an outermost cloak which she would put on and the medium the more or less ‘good’ conductor through which her talent would have to pass i was happy too in the theatre itself since i had made the discovery that — in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination — there was but one stage for everybody i had supposed that i should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators as one is when in the thick of a crowd now i registered the fact that on the contrary thanks to an arrangement which is so to speak symbolical of all spectatorship everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre which explained to me why when françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain my pleasure increased further when i began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly from that world which impenetrable by our eyes yet scrutinised us with its own addressed themselves and to us indubitably in the imperious form of three consecutive hammerblows as moving as any signals from the planet mars and — once this curtain had risen — when on the stage a writingtable and a fireplace in no way out of the ordinary had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be not actors come to recite as i had seen them once and heard them at an evening party but real people just living their lives at home on whom i was thus able to spy without their seeing me — my pleasure still endured it was broken by a momentary uneasiness just as i was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage who must have been very angry with each other for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium where there were at least a thousand people we could hear every word whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men who appear to be quarrelling are saying but at that moment while i sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke presently a laugh here and there i understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the ‘curtainraiser’ had now begun it was followed by an interval so long that the audience who had returned to their places grew impatient and began to stamp their feet i was terrified at this for just as in the report of a criminal trial when i read that some nobleminded person was coming against his own interests to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner i was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him would not shew enough gratitude would not recompense him lavishly and that he in disgust would then range himself on the side of injustice so now attributing to genius in this respect the same qualities as to virtue i was afraid lest berma annoyed by the bad behaviour of so illbred an audience — in which on the other hand i should have liked her to recognise with satisfaction a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance — should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly and i gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter in their insensate rage the rare and fragile impression which i had come to seek the last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of phèdre the heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act and yet as soon as the curtain rose and another curtain of red velvet this time was parted in the middle a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the ‘star’ appeared an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which i had been told were those of berma the cast must therefore have been changed all the trouble that i had taken in studying the part of the wife of theseus was wasted but a second actress now responded to the first i must then have been mistaken in supposing that the first was berma for the second even more closely resembled her and more than the other had her diction both of them moreover enriched their parts with noble gestures — which i could vividly distinguish and could appreciate in their relation to the text while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics — and also with skilful changes of tone now passionate now ironical which made me realise the significance of lines that i had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant but all of a sudden in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary as in a frame appeared a woman and simultaneously with the fear that seized me far more vexing than berma’s fear could be lest someone should upset her by opening a window or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough — in my own fashion still more absolute than berma’s of considering from that moment theatre audience play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice — i realised that the two actresses whom i had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom i had come to hear but at the same time all my pleasure had ceased in vain might i strain towards berma’s eyes ears mind so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her i did not succeed in gathering a single one i could not even as i could with her companions distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations beautiful gestures i listened to her as though i were readingphèdre or as though phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that i was hearing without its appearing that berma’s talent had added anything at all to them i could have wished so as to be able to explore them fully so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful to arrest to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist’s voice every expression of her features at least i did attempt by dint of my mental agility in having before a line came my attention ready and tuned to catch it not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word each gesture occupied and thanks to the intensity of my observation to manage to penetrate as far into them as if i had had whole hours to spend upon them by myself but how short their duration was scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another in one scene where berma stands motionless for a moment her arm raised to the level of a face bathed by some piece of stagecraft in a greenish light before a backcloth painted to represent the sea the whole house broke out in applause but already the actress had moved and the picture that i should have liked to study existed no longer i told my grandmother that i could not see very well she handed me her glasses only when one believes in the reality of a thing making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand i thought now that it was no longer berma at whom i was looking but her image in a magnifying glass i put the glasses down but then possibly the image that my eye received of her diminished by distance was no more exact which of the two bermas was the real as for her speech to hippolyte i had counted enormously upon that since to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which when reading the play at home i had contrived to imagine but she did not attain to the heights which œnone or aricie would naturally have reached she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses even the pupils of an academy could not have missed their effect besides which she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout

    then at last a sense of admiration did possess me provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience i mingled my own with theirs endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that berma in her gratitude should surpass herself and i be certain of having heard her on one of her great days a curious thing by the way was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was as i afterwards learned that in which berma reveals one of her richest treasures it would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive so it is that when any great event occurs when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy or defeated or victorious the vague and conflicting reports which we receive from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised and in which once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation he recognises the popular perception of that ‘aura’ which surrounds momentous happenings and which may be visible hundreds of miles away one learns of a victory either after the war is over or at once from the hilarious joy of one’s hall porter one discovers the touch of genius in berma’s acting a week after one has heard her in the criticism of some review or else on the spot from the thundering acclamation of the stalls but this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others all quite erroneous the applause came most often at wrong moments apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before just as in a storm once the sea is sufficiently disturbed it will continue to swell even after the wind has begun to subside no matter the more i applauded the better it seemed to me did berma act “i say” came from a woman sitting near me of no great social pretensions “she fairly gives it you she does you’d think she’d do herself an injury the way she runs about i call that acting don’t you” and happy to find these reasons for berma’s superiority though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the gioconda or of benvenuto’s perseus a peasant’s gaping “that’s a good bit of work it’s all gold look fine ain’t it” i greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm i felt all the same when the curtain had fallen fer the last time disappointed that the pleasure for which i had so longed had been no greater but at the same time i felt the need to prolong it not to depart for ever when i left the theatre from this strange life of the stage which had for a few hours been my own from which i should be tearing myself away as though i were going into exile when i returned to my own home had i not hoped there to learn a great deal more about berma from her admirer to whom i was indebted already for the permission to go to phèdre m de norpois i was introduced to him before dinner by my father who summoned me into his study for the purpose as i entered the ambassador rose held out his hand bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face as the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him in the days when he still represented france abroad were all more or less even the famous singers persons of note with regard to whom he could tell when he met them that he would be able to say later on when he heard then — names mentioned in paris or in petersburg that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at munich or sofia he had formed the habit of impressing upon them by his affability the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance but in addition to this being convinced that in the life of european capitals in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout europe he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal the government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad but still as soon as anyone was introduced to him his eyes as though they had not yet been informed of their master’s retirement began their fruitful observation while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger’s name was not unknown to him and so all the time while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity and to his own profit as though i had been some exotic custom some historic and instruct tive building or some ‘star’ upon his course and in this way he gave proof at once in his attitude towards me of the majestic benevolence of the sage mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young anacharsis

    he offered me absolutely no opening to the revue des deuxmondes but put a number of questions to me on what i had been doing and reading asked what were my own inclinations which i heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings whereas hitherto i had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them since they attracted me towards literature he did not dissuade me from that course on the contrary he spoke of it with deference as of some venerable personage whose select circle in rome or at dresden one remembers with pleasure and regrets only that one’s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom he appeared to be envying me with an almost jovial smile the delightful hours which more fortunate than himself and more free i should be able to spend with such a mistress but the very terms that he employed shewed me literature as something entirely different from the image that i had formed of it at combray and i realised that i had been doubly right in abandoning my intention until now i had reckoned only that i had not the ‘gift’ for writing now m de norpois took from me the ambition also i wanted to express to him what had been my dreams trembling with emotion i was painfully apprehensive that all the words which i could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what i had felt what i had never yet attempted to formulate that is to say that my words had no clear significance perhaps by a professional habit perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought and who knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands allows the other party to fret to struggle to take his time perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head greek according to himself despite his sweeping whiskers m de norpois while anything was being explained to him would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum until suddenly falling upon you like an auctioneer’s hammer or a delphic oracle the ambassador’s voice as he replied to you would be all the more impressive in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him or what opinion he was about to express

    “precisely” he suddenly began as though the case were now heard and judged and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face “there is the case of the son of one of my friends which mutatis mutandis is very much like yours” he adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal “he too has chosen to leave the quai d’orsay although the way had been paved for him there by his father and without caring what people might say he has settled down to write and certainly he’s had no reason to regret it he published two years ago — of course he’s much older than you you understand — a book dealing with the sense of the infinite on the western shore of victoria nyanza and this year he has brought out a little thing not so important as the other but very brightly in places perhaps almost too pointedly written on the repeating rifle in the bulgarian army and these have put him quite in a class by himself he’s gone pretty far already and he’s not the sort of man to stop half way i happen to know that without any suggestion of course of his standing for election his name has been mentioned several times in conversation and not at all unfavourably at the academy of moral sciences and so one can’t say yet of course that he has reached the pinnacle of fame still he has made his way by sheer industry to a very fine position indeed and success — which doesn’t always come only to agitators and mischiefmakers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take — success has crowned his efforts”

    my father seeing me already in a few years’ time an academician was tasting a contentment which m de norpois raised to the supreme pitch when after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act he handed me his card and said “why not go and see him yourself tell him i sent you he may be able to give you some good advice” plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that next morning i was to embark as cabinboy on board a sailing ship and to go round the world

    my aunt léonie had bequeathed to me together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture with which it was difficult to know what to do almost all her unsettled estate — revealing thus after her death an affection for me which i had hardly suspected in her lifetime my father who was trustee of this estate until i came of age now consulted m de norpois with regard to several of the investments he recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest which he considered particularly sound notably english consols and russian four per cents “with absolutely first class securities such as those” said m de norpois “even if your income from them is nothing very great you may be certain of never losing any of your capital” my father then told him roughly what else he had bought m de norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation like all capitalists he regarded wealth as an enviable thing but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a halfindicated sign of intelligent sympathy on the other hand as he was himself immensely rich he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own he made amends for this by congratulating my father without hesitation on the “composition” of his list of investments selected “with so sure so delicate so fine a taste” you would have supposed to hear him that he attributed to the relative values of investments and even to investments themselves something akin to aesthetic merit of one comparatively recent and still little known which my father mentioned m de norpois like the people who have always read the books of which you imagine you yourself alone have ever heard said at once “ah yes i used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers it was quite interesting” with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already in monthly instalments in his magazine “it would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue it is distinctly attractive they are offering it at a most tempting discount” but when he came to some of the older investments my father who could not remember their exact names which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the ambassador the sight of them enchanted me they were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures like the old romantic editions that i had pored over as a child all the products of one period have something in common the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses and nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of notredame de paris and of various books by gérard de nerval that used to hang outside the grocer’s door at combray than does in its rectangular and flowery border supported by recumbent rivergods a ‘personal share’ in the water company

    the contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that in practice his attitude towards anything that i might do was one of blind indulgence and so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little ‘prose poem’ which i had made up years before at combray while coming home from a walk i had written it down in a state of exaltation which must i felt certain infect everyone who read it but it was not destined to captivate m de norpois for he handed it back to me without a word
    my mother who had the most profound respect for all my father’s occupations came in now timidly to ask whether dinner might be served she was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part and indeed my father was continually reminding the marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the commission speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues — as exclusive in this respect as two young men from the same college — whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience

    but the absolute control over his facial muscles to which m de norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word at last my father became uneasy “i had thought” he ventured after an endless preamble “of asking the advice of the commission    ” then from the face of the noble virtuoso who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part were uttered with an even delivery on a sharp note and as though they were no more than the completion but scored for a different voice of the phrase that my father had begun the words “of which you will not hesitate of course to call a meeting more especially as the present members are all known to you personally and there may be a change any day” this was not in itself a very remarkable ending but the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano silent until then‘takes up at a given moment the violoncello to which one has just been listening in a mozart concerto

    “well did you enjoy your matinée” asked my father as we moved to the diningroom meaning me to ‘shew off’ and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give m de norpois a good opinion of me “he has just been to hear berma you remember we were talking about it the other day” he went on turning towards the diplomat in the same tone of retrospective technical mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the commission

    “you must have been enchanted especially if you had never heard her before your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health which is none too good i am told none too robust but i soon set his mind at rest theatres today are not what they were even twenty years ago you have more or less comfortable seats now and a certain amount of ventilation although we have still a long way to go before we come up to germany or england which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us i have never seen mme berma in phèdre but i have always heard that she is excellent in the part you were charmed with her of course”

    m de norpois a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself must know that hidden truth which i had failed to extract from berma’s playing he knew and would reveal it to me in answering his question i would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted and he would tell me and so justify me in the longing that i had felt to see and hear the actress i had only a moment i must make what use i could of it and bring my crossexamination to bear upon the essential points but what were they fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions with no thought of making m de norpois admire me but only that of learning from him the truth that i had still to discover i made no attempt to substitute readymade phrases for the words that failed me — i stood there stammering until finally in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in berma that was admirable i confessed that i had been disappointed

    “what’s that” cried my father annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on m de norpois “what on earth do you mean you didn’t enjoy it why your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that berma uttered with your eyes starting out of your head that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored beside you”

    “oh yes i was listening as hard as i could trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her of course she’s frightfully good and all that    ”

    “if she is ‘frightfully good’ what more do you want”

    “one of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of mme berma” resumed m de norpois turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother so as not to let her be left out of the conversation and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house “is the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts thus she can always be assured of success and success of the right sort she hardly ever appears in anything trivial look how she has thrown herself into the part of phèdre and then she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes and to her acting in spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in england and america the vulgarity — i will not say of john bull that would be unjust at any rate to the england of the victorian era — but of uncle sam has not infected her no loud colours no rant and then that admirable voice which has been of such service to her with which she plays so delightfully — i should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument”

    my interest in berma’s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality but i felt the need to find explanations for it moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity while berma was on the stage upon everything that she offered in the indivisibility of a living whole to my eyes and ears there was nothing separate or distinct it welcomed accordingly the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity to the good taste of the actress it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption seized hold of them as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion “he is right” i told myself “what a charming voice what an absence of shrillness what simple costumes what intelligence to have chosen phèdre no i have not been disappointed”

    the cold beef spiced with carrots made its appearance couched by the michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly like transparent blocks of quartz

    “you have a chef of the first order madame” said m de norpois “and that is no small matter i myself who have had when abroad to maintain a certain style in housekeeping i know how difficult it often is to find a perfect mastercook but this is a positive banquet that you have set before us”

    and indeed françoise in the excitement of her ambition to make a success for so distinguished a guest of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone and had recaptured her incomparable combray manner
    “that is a thing you can’t get in a chophouse — in the best of them i mean a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots it is admirable allow me to come again” he went on making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly “i should be interested to see how your vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind i should like for instance to see him tackle a boeuf stroganoff”

    m de norpois so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in “the career” quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician an old offender whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images now some monumental epigram of a diplomat sparkling with attic salt but to tell the truth the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which i was in the habit of applying to literature most of the finer shades escaped me the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable he belonged to the class of men who had we come to discuss the books that i liked would have said “so you understand that do you i must confess that i do not understand i am not initiated” but i could have matched his attitude for i did not grasp the wit or folly the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech and the absence of any perceptible reason for one’s being badly and the other’s well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious more obscure to me than any other i could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was in politics the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind when m de norpois made use of certain expressions which were ‘common form’ in the newspapers and uttered them with emphasis one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment

    my mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad but the ambassador after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat and without disclosing to us what he thought of it my mother insisted upon his taking some more which he did but saying only in place of the compliment for which she was hoping “i obey madame for i can see that it is on your part a positive ukase”

    “we saw in the ‘papers that you had a long talk with king theodosius” my father ventured

    “why yes the king who has a wonderful memory for faces was kind enough to remember when he noticed me in the stalls that i had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the court of bavaria at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne — to which as you know he was summoned by a european congress and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race the noblest heraldically speaking in the whole of europe an aidedecamp came down to bid me pay my respects to his majesty whose command i hastened naturally to obey”

    “and i trust you are satisfied with the results of his visit”

    “enchanted one was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact particularly at this highly delicate juncture for my own part i reposed entire confidence in the king’s political sense but i must confess that he far surpassed my expectations the speech that he made at the elysée which according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source was composed from beginning to end by himself was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters it was simply masterly a trifle daring i quite admit but with an audacity which after all has been fully justified by the event traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe very well there is one method of letting in fresh air obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend but one which king theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows which he accordingly did with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother there can be no question that when he spoke of the ‘affinities’ that bound his country to france the expression rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the chancellories was a singularly happy one you see that literary ability is no drawback even in diplomacy even upon a throne” he went on turning for a moment to myself “the community of interests had long been apparent i quite admit and the relations of the two powers were excellent still it needed putting into words the word was what we were all waiting for it was chosen with marvellous aptitude you have seen the effect it had for my part i must confess i applauded openly”

    “your friend m de vaugoubert will be pleased after preparing for the agreement all these years”

    “all the more so that his majesty who is quite incorrigible really in some ways had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise and it did come as a complete surprise incidentally to everyone concerned beginning with the foreign minister himself who — i have heard — did not find it at all to his liking it appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied pretty sharply and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them ‘i have been neither consulted nor informed’ indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences i must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment and i should not go so far as to deny” he went on with a malicious smile “that certain of my colleagues for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia may have been shaken from their habitual repose as for vaugoubert you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with france which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him he is so sensitive such an exquisite nature i can amply testify to that since for all that he is considerably my junior i have had many dealings with him we are friends of long standing and i know him intimately besides who could help knowing him his is a heart of crystal indeed that is the one fault that there is to be found with him it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that still that does not prevent their talking of sending him to rome which would be a fine rise for him but a pretty big plum to swallow between ourselves i fancy that vaugoubert utterly devoid of ambition as he is would be very well pleased and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him for all we know he may do wonders down there he is the chosen candidate of the consulta and for my part i can see him very well placed with his artistic leanings in the setting of the farnese palace and the caracci gallery at least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him but there is a whole camarilla collected round king theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the wilhelmstrasse whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him not only has vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards have been the first to cry quits but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent for a month and more vaugoubert’s enemies had been dancing round him howling for his scalp” m de norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis “but forewarned is forearmed as for their insults he spurned them with his foot” he went on with even more determination and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food “in the words of a fine arab proverb ‘the dogs may bark the caravan goes on’” after launching this quotation m de norpois paused and examined our faces to see what effect it had had upon us its effect was great the proverb being familiar to us already it had taken the place that year among people who ‘really counted’ of “he who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind” which was sorely in need of a rest not having the perennial freshness of “working for the king of prussia” for the culture of these eminent men was an alternate if not a tripartite and triennial culture of course the use of quotations such as these with which m de norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the revue was in no way essential to their appearing solid and wellinformed even without the ornament which the quotations supplied it sufficed that m de norpois should write at a given point as he never failed to write “the court of st james’s was not the last to be sensible of the peril” or “feeling ran high on the singers’ bridge which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the dual monarchy” or “a cry of alarm sounded from montecitorio” or yet again “that everlasting doubledealing which is so characteristic of the ballplatz” by these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carrière but what had made people say that he was something more than that that he was endowed with a superior culture had been his careful use of quotations the perfect example of which at that date was still “give me a good policy and i will give you good finances to quote the favourite words of baron louis“ for we had not yet imported from the far east “victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the otheras the japanese say” this reputation for immense literary gifts combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference had secured the election of m de norpois to the académie des sciences morales and there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the académie française on the famous day when wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the russian alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with great britain he had not hesitated to write “be it clearly understood in the quai d’orsay be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography which appear to be incomplete in this respect be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say ‘if all roads lead to rome nevertheless the way from paris to london runs of necessity through st petersburg’”

    “in short” m de norpois went on addressing my father “vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned he expected you understand a correctly worded speech which after the stormclouds of recent years would have been something to the good but nothing more several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible when one merely reads the speech to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered — when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the king who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning i allowed myself in this connexion to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank boyish charm by which king theodosius has won so many hearts i am assured that just as he uttered that word ‘affinities’ which was of course the startling innovation of the speech and one that as you will see will provoke discussion in the chancellories for years to come his majesty anticipating the delight of our ambassador who was to find in that word the seal the crown set upon all his labours on his dreams one might almost say and in a word his marshal’s baton made a half turn towards vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze so characteristic of the oettingens fired at him that admirably chosen word ‘affinities’ a positive treasuretrove uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances it appears that vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion and i must confess that to a certain extent i can well understand it indeed a person who is entirely to be believed has told me in confidence that the king came up to vaugoubert after the dinner when his majesty was holding an informal court and was heard to say ‘well are you satisfied with your pupil my dear marquis’

    “one thing however” m de norpois concluded “is certain and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together uniting their ‘affinities’ to borrow the picturesque expression of theodosius ii it is no more than a word if you like but look what success it has had how the whole of the european press is repeating it what interest it has aroused what a new note it has struck besides it is distinctly in the young sovereign’s manner i will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day but it is very seldom that in his prepared speeches or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation he does not reveal his character — i was on the point of saying ‘does not affix his signature’— by the use of some incisive word i myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect for i am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology nine times out of ten they are most dangerous”

    “yes i was thinking only the other day that the german emperor’s telegram could not be much to your liking” said my father

    m de norpois raised his eyes to heaven as who should say “oh that fellow” before he replied “in the first place it is an act of ingratitude it is more than a crime it is a blunder and one of a crassness which i can describe only as pyramidal indeed unless some one puts a check on his activities the man who has got rid of bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the bismarckian policy after which it will be a leap in the dark”

    “my husband tells me sir that you are perhaps going to take him to spain one summer that will be nice for him i am so glad”

    “why yes it is an idea that greatly attracts me i amuse myself planning a tour i should like to go there with you my dear fellow but what about you madame have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays”

    “i shall perhaps go with my son to balbec but i am not certain”

    “oh but balbec is quite charming i was down that way a few years ago they are beginning to build some very pretty littlevillas there i think you’ll like the place but may i ask what has made you choose balbec”

    “my son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood and balbec church in particular i was a little afraid that the tiring journey there and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him but i hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires”

    “indeed i must make a note of that for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel”

    “the church at balbec is very beautiful sir is it not” i inquired repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of balbec consisted in its pretty little villas

    “no it is not bad but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the cathedrals of rheims and chartres or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all the saintechapelle here in paris”

    “but surely balbec church is partly romanesque is it not”

    “why yes it is in the romanesque style which is to say very cold and lifeless with no hint in it anywhere of the grace the fantasy of the later gothic builders who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace balbec church is well worth a visit if you are in those parts it is decidedly quaint on a wet day when you have nothing better to do you might look inside you will see the tomb of tourville”

    “tell me were you at the foreign ministry dinner last night” asked my father “i couldn’t go”

    “no” m de norpois smiled “i must confess that i renounced it for a party of a very different sort i was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard the beautiful mme swann” my mother checked an impulsive movement for being more rapid in perception than my father she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her just as bad news from france is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves but she was curious to know what sort of people the swanns managed to entertain and so inquired of m de norpois as to whom he had met there

    “why my dear lady it is a house which or so it struck me is especially attractive to gentlemen there were several married men there last night but their wives were all as it happened unwell and so had not come with them” replied the ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in goodhumour casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice

    “in all fairness” he went on “i must add that women do go to the house but women who belong rather — what shall i say — to the republican world than to swann’s” he pronounced it “svann’s” “circle still you can never tell perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day anyhow they appear to be quite happy as they are indeed i feel that swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly he told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate with a want of reserve of taste almost of tact which i was astonished to remark in so refined a man he kept on repeating ‘we haven’t a free evening’ as though that had been a thing to boast of positively like a parvenu and he is certainly not that for swann had always plenty of friends women as well as men and without seeming overbold without the least wish to appear indiscreet i think i may safely say that not all of them of course nor even the majority of them but one at least who is a lady of the very highest rank would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with mme swann in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead but it seems that there has been no indication on swann’s part of any movement in that direction

    “what do i see a nesselrode pudding as well i declare i shall need a course at carlsbad after such a lucullusfeast as this

    “possibly swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome the marriage — so much is certain — was not well received there has been some talk of his wife’s having money but that is all humbug anyhow the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour and then swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially married to a man who financially speaking is a power not only has she refused to meet mme swann she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same i do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in paris has shewn any actual incivility to mme swann    no a hundred times no quite apart from her husband’s being eminently a man to take up the challenge anyhow there is one curious thing about it to see the immense importance that swann who knows so many and such exclusive people attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed i myself who knew him in the old days must admit that i felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so wellbred as he is so much at home in the best houses effusively thanking the chief secretary to the minister of posts for having come to them and asking him whether mme swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife he must feel something of an exile don’t you know evidently it’s quite a different world i don’t think all the same that swann is unhappy it is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way she would take the child away whenever swann refused her anything poor swann who is as unsophisticated as he is for all that sharp believed every time that the child’s disappearance was a coincidence and declined to face the facts apart from that she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that from the day she attained her object and was safely married nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth instead of which just the opposite has happened people are inclined to laugh at the way in which swann speaks of his wife it’s become a standing joke of course one could hardly expect that conscious more or less of being a —you remember molière’s line he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife and yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine in her own way — which is not perhaps what all husbands would prefer but then between you and me i find it difficult to believe that swann who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool did not know what to expect — there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him i do not say that she is not flighty and swann himself has no fault to find with her for that if one is to believe the charitable tongues which as you may suppose continue to wag but she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her and despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary her temper seems to have become angelic”

    this alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as m de norpois professed to find it odette had not believed that swann would ever consent to marry her each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence or at the most if she were directly to challenge him asking “don’t you think it very nice a very fine thing that he has done for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him” had heard him answer dryly “but i don’t say that there’s anything wrong in it everyone does what he himself thinks right” she came very near indeed to believing that as he used to threaten in moments of anger he was going to leave her altogether for she had heard it said not long since by a woman sculptor that “you cannot be surprised at anything men do they’re such brutes” and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply “after all it’s not impossible in any way it would be just my luck” meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided odette through life “you can do anything with men when they’re in love with you they’re such idiots” a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as “don’t be frightened he won’t break anything” while she waited odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as odette herself had lived with swann and had had no child by him and who was now in a definitely respectable position invited to the balls at the elysée and so forth must think of swann’s behaviour a consultant more discerning than m de norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered odette that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her no irremediable evil and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass namely that a new rule of life the matrimonial would put an end with almost magic swiftness to these painful incidents of daily occurrence but in no sense organic practically everyone was surprised at the marriage and this in itself is surprising no doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love or how it creates so to speak a fresh a third a supplementary person distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself the lover and so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see it would appear none the less that so far as odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if indeed she had never entirely understood swann’s mentality at least she was acquainted with the titles and with all the details of his studies so much so that the name of vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker while as for swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing cherished image and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent an affectionately mocking familiarity such as we ourselves have with them or our relatives have that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection the bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections and among these special traits there were others besides which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character which all the same because they had their roots in the latter odette had been able more easily to discern she complained that when swann turned author when he published his essays these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters or in his conversation where they abounded she urged him to give them a more prominent place she would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings perhaps also she thought that his work if endowed with more vitality so that it ultimately brought him success might enable her also to form what at the verdurins’ she had been taught to value above everything else in the world — a salon

    among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous people who in their own case would ask themselves “what will m de guermantes think what will bréauté say when i marry mlle de montmorency” among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured twenty years earlier swann himself the swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the jockey club and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which by consolidating his position would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in paris only the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need like all visions if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost to receive sustenance from without your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you but if you never hear of him again having removed to some other place your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you if one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the jockey club or the institute the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one now fully as much as retirement illhealth or religious conversion protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old there was not on swann’s part when he married odette any renunciation of his social ambitions for from these ambitions odette had long ago in the spiritual sense of the word detached him besides had he not been so detached his marriage would have been all the more creditable it is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that as a general rule ‘impossible’ marriages are the happiest of all one cannot very well include among the ‘impossible’ marriages those that are made for money there being no instance on record of a couple of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself who have not sooner or later been admitted into society if only by tradition and on the strength of so many precedents and so as not to have two conflicting standards perhaps on the other hand the artistic if not the perverse side of swann’s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself in one of those crossings of species such as mendelians practise and mythology records a creature of a different race archduchess or prostitute from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him there had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with odette that was and from no snobbish motive the duchesse de guermantes with whom odette on the contrary was but little concerned thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own rather than in so vague an empyrean but when swann in his daydreams saw odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her — her and above all her daughter — to call upon the princesse des laumes who was shortly on the death of her fatherinlaw to become duchesse de guermantes he had no desire to introduce them anywhere else but his heart would soften as he invented — uttering their actual words to himself — all the things that the duchess would say of him to odette and odette to the duchess the affection that she would shew for gilberte spoiling her making him proud of his child he enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend supposing they were to win it a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined in so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive so it might be said that if swann married odette it was in order to present her and gilberte without anyone’s else being present without if need be anyone’s else ever coming to know of it to the duchesse de guermantes we shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that swann died in the belief that the duchess would never possibly come to know them we shall see also that on the contrary the duchesse de guermantes did associate with odette and gilberte after the death of swann and doubtless he would have been wiser — seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter — not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future in this connexion but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it the laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect including consequently those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible naturally slow at times is rendered slower still by our impatience which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it and by our very existence and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it — have ceased possibly to live was not swann conscious of this from his own experience had there not been already in his life as it were a préfiguration of what was to happen after his death a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this odette whom he had passionately loved — even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight — whom he had married when he no longer loved her when the creature that in swann had so longed to live had so despaired of living all its life in company with odette when that creature was extinct

    i began next to speak of the comte de paris to ask whether he was not one of swann’s friends for i was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him “why yes” replied m de norpois turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated as in their vital element his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation and “upon my word” he added once more addressing my father “i do not think that i shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which i have always professed for the prince although without you understand maintaining any personal relations with him which would inevitably compromise my position unofficial as that may be if i tell you of a little episode which is not without point no more than four years ago at a small railway station in one of the countries of central europe the prince happened to set eyes on mme swann naturally none of his circle ventured to ask his royal highness what he thought of her that would not have been seemly but when her name came up by chance in conversation by certain signs — imperceptible if you like but quite unmistakable — the prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had in a word been far from unfavourable”

    “but there could have been no possibility surely of her being presented to the comte de paris” inquired my father

    “well we don’t know with princes one never does know” replied m de norpois “the most exalted those who know best how to secure what is due to them are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion even by those for which there is most justification especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves now it is certain that the comte de paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of swann who is for that matter a man of character in spite of it all”

    “and what was your own impression your excellency do tell us” my mother asked from politeness as well as from curiosity

    all the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered “quite excellent”

    and knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place provided that one makes it in a playful tone in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds moistening the old diplomat’s blue eyes and making his nostrils with their network of tiny scarlet veins quiver “she is altogether charming”

    “was there a writer of the name of bergotte at this dinner sir” i asked timidly still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the swanns

    “yes bergotte was there” replied m de norpois inclining his head courteously towards me as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his “do you know him” he went on fastening on me that clear gaze the penetration of which had won the praise of bismarck

    “my son does not know him but he admires his work immensely” my mother explained

    “good heavens” exclaimed m de norpois inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me when i saw that what i valued a thousand thousand times more than myself what i regarded as the most exalted thing in the world was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration “i do not share your son’s point of view bergotte is what i call a fluteplayer one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably although with a great deal of mannerism of affectation but when all is said it is no more than that and that is nothing very great nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction no action — or very little — but above all no range his books fail at the foundation or rather they have no foundation at all at a time like the present when the everincreasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading when the map of europe has undergone radical alterations and is on the eve very probably of undergoing others more drastic still when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians those from without and those from within our borders i am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term ‘art for art’s sake’ but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner not that bergotte’s manner is not now and then quite attractive i have no fault to find with that but taken as a whole it is all very precious very thin and has very little virility i can now understand more easily when i bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for bergotte the few lines that you shewed me just now which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook since you yourself told me in all simplicity that they were merely a childish scribbling” i had indeed said so but i did not think anything of the sort “for every sin there is forgiveness and especially for the sins of youth after all others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day but one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of bergotte you will not of course be surprised when i say that there was in it none of his good qualities since he is a pastmaster in the art — incidentally quite superficial — of handling a certain style of which at your age you cannot have acquired even the rudiments but already there is the same fault that paradox of stringing together finesounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean that is putting the cart before the horse even in bergotte’s books all those chinese puzzles of form all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile given a few fireworks let off prettily enough by an author and up goes the shout of genius works of genius are not so common as all that bergotte cannot place to his credit — does not carry in his baggage if i may use the expression — a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one’s library i do not discover one such in the whole of his work but that does not exclude the fact that with him the work is infinitely superior to the author ah there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books it would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his — more pretentious more pompous less fitted for human society vulgar at some moments at others talking like a book and not even like one of his own but like a boring book which his to do them justice are not — such is your bergotte he has the most confused mind alembicated what our ancestors called a diseur de phébus and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them i forget for the moment whether it is loménie or saintebeuve who tells us that vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity but bergotte has never given us a cinqmars or a cachet rouge certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces”

    paralysed by what m de norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which i had submitted to him and remembering at the same time the difficulties that i experienced when i attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought i felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that i was not born for a literary life doubtless in the old days at combray certain impressions of a very humble order or a few pages of bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value but this state was what my poem in prose reflected there could be no doubt that m de norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what i had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the ambassador had not been taken in by it he had shewn me on the other hand what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when i was judged from outside objectively by the bestdisposed and most intelligent of experts i felt myself to be struck speechless overwhelmed and my mind like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius contracted now was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which m de norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it

    “our first introduction — i speak of bergotte and myself ——” he resumed turning to my father “was somewhat beset with thorns which is after all only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points bergotte — some years ago now — paid a visit to vienna while i was ambassador there he was presented to me by the princess metternich came and wrote his name and expected to be asked to the embassy now being in a foreign country as the representative of france to which he has after all done some honour by his writings to a certain extent let us say to be quite accurate to a very slight extent i was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that i hold of his private life but he was not travelling alone and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion i trust that i am no more of a prude than most men and being a bachelor i was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the embassy a little wider than if i had been married and the father of a family nevertheless i must admit that there are depths of degradation to which i should hesitate to descend while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone not moral merely — let us be quite frank and say moralising — that bergotte takes up in his books where one finds nothing but perpetual and between ourselves somewhat wearisome analyses torturing scruples morbid remorse and all for the merest peccadilloes the most trivial naughtinesses as one knows from one’s own experience while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life to cut a long story short i evaded the responsibility the princess returned to the charge but without success so that i do not suppose that i appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman and i am not sure how far he appreciated swann’s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation one can never tell for really he is not normal indeed that is his sole excuse”

    “and was mme swann’s daughter at the dinner” i asked m de norpois taking advantage to put this question of a moment in which as we all moved towards the drawingroom i could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table where i was held fast in the glare of the lamplight

    m de norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember then “yes you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen yes of course i remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our amphitryon i may tell you that i saw but little of her she retired to bed early or else she went out to see a friend — i forget but i can see that you are very intimate with the swann household”

    “i play with mlle swann in the champselysées and she is delightful”

    “oh so that is it is it but i assure you i thought her charming i must confess to you however that i do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother if i may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot”

    “i prefer mlle swann’s face but i admire her mother too enormously i go for walks in the bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass”

    “ah but i must tell them that they will be highly flattered”

    while he was uttering these words and for a few seconds after he had uttered them m de norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who hearing me speak of swann as an intelligent man of his family as respectable stockbrokers of his house as a fine house imagined that i would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent of other stockbrokers equally respectable of another house equally fine it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad m de norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women that it was a social convention when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour to pretend to think that he was in love with her and to promise to further his designs but in saying that he would speak of me to gilberte and her mother which would enable me like an olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form minerva borrows to penetrate myself unseen into mme swann’s drawingroom to attract her attention to occupy her thoughts to arouse her gratitude for my admiration to appear before her as the friend of an important person to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family this important person who was going to make use in my interests of the great influence which he must have with mme swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that i had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands white and crumpled which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water i even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement but this i supposed that i alone had observed for it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse it is we may suppose to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they ‘touch up’ the wording of a statement already made thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version but it is quite possible that even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race the philosophy of the journalist according to which everything is destined to oblivion is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything in the same newspaper in which the moralist of the ‘paris column’ says to us of an event of a work of art all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her ‘crowded hour’ “who will remember this in ten years’ time” overleaf does not the report of the académie des inscriptions speak often of a fact in itself of smaller importance of a poem of little merit which dates from the epoch of the pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety is it not perhaps just the same in our brief life on earth and yet some years later in a house in which m de norpois who was also calling there had seemed to me the most solid support that i could hope to find because he was the friend of my father indulgent inclined to wish us all well and besides by his profession and upbringing trained to discretion when after the ambassador had gone i was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which i was just going to kiss his hands not only did i colour up to the roots of my hair but i was stupefied to learn how different from all that i had believed were not only the manner in which m de norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory this tittletattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence and i was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which i read for the first time in one of maspero’s books that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts a thousand years before the birth of christ

    “oh sir” i assured m de norpois when he told me that he would inform gilberte and her mother how much i admired them “if you would do that if you would speak of me to mme swann my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude and that life would be all at your service but i feel bound to point out to you that i do not know mme swann and that i have never been introduced to her”

    i had added these last words from a scruple of conscience and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which i did not possess but while i was uttering them i felt that they were already superfluous for from the beginning of my speech of thanks with its chilling ardour i had seen flitting across the face of the ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction and in his eyes that vertical narrow slanting look like in the drawing of a solid body in perspective the receding line of one of its surfaces that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one’s other audience the person whom one has been addressing — myself in this instance — is not meant to hear i realised in a flash that these phrases which i had pronounced which feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me had seemed to me bound to touch m de norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy were perhaps out of all those that could have been chosen with diabolical malice by persons anxious to do me harm the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention indeed when he heard me speak just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging — quite pleasantly — our impressions which we might suppose to be similar to his of the passersby whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly as he runs his hand over his pocket “what a pity i haven’t got my revolver here i could have picked off the lot” m de norpois who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to mme swann and taken to her house and saw that to me on the contrary such favours bore so high a price and were consequently no doubt of great difficulty thought that the desire apparently normal which i had expressed must cloak some different thought some suspect intention some preexistent fault on account of which in the certainty of displeasing mme swann no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me and i understood that this office was one which he would never discharge that he might see mme swann daily for years to come without ever mentioning my name he did indeed ask her a few days later for some information which i required and charged my father to convey it to me but he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring so she would never discover that i knew m de norpois and that i hoped so greatly to be asked to her house and this was perhaps a less misfortune than i supposed for the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy in any event uncertain of the first in odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance a person who knew her who came to see her did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through swann’s windows if i could have written upon it that i knew m de norpois i was convinced that such a message even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me but even if i had been capable of understanding that the mission which m de norpois did not perform must have remained futile nay more than that might even have damaged my credit with the swanns i should not have had the courage had he shewn himself consenting to release the ambassador from it and to renounce the pleasure — however fatal its consequences might prove — of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into gilberte’s presence in her unknown life and home

    after m de norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper i dreamed once more of berma the pleasure which i had found in listening to her required to be made complete all the more because it had fallen far short of what i had promised myself and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment those merits for uir stance which m de norpois had admitted that berma possessed and which my mind had absorbed at one draught like a dry lawn when water is poured on it then my father handed me the newspaper pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows—

    the performance of phèdre given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts as well as the principal critics was for mme berma who played the heroine the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career we shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance which is indeed an event in the history of the stage for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of phèdre which is one of the finest and most studied of racine’s creations and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness

    immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of “the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art” it the idea sped to join the imperfect pleasure which i had felt in the theatre added to it a little of what was lacking and their combination formed something so exalting that i cried out within myself “what a great artist” it may doubtless be argued that i was not absolutely sincere but let us bear in mind rather the numberless writers who dissatisfied with the page which they have just written if they read some eulogy of the genius of chateaubriand or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be by humming to themselves for instance a phrase of beethoven the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions when they think of them once again see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared and hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work say to themselves “after all” without taking into account that into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own but of which in cold fact they are not the authors let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals all those too who are sustained by the alternative hopes either of an incomprehensible survival of death when they think inconsolable husbands of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love or artists of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which from day to day they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents and let us then declare whether in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought a very parasite and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked

    my mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of ‘the career’ for myself i fancy that anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature but “let him alone” my father protested “the main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work he is no longer a child he knows pretty well now what he likes it is not at all probable that he will change and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life” that evening as i waited for the time to arrive when thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me i should or should not begin to be happy in life my father’s words caused me great uneasiness at all times his unexpected kindnesses had when they were manifested prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss above where his beard began his glowing cheeks that if i did not yield to that desire it was simply because i was afraid of annoying him and on that day as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper to employ a fount of type finer perhaps than they deserve i asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity but apart from that when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change he awakened in me two terrible suspicions the first was that at a time when every day i regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning my existence was already begun and that furthermore what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed the second suspicion which was nothing more really than a variant of the first was that i was not situated somewhere outside the realm of time but was subject to its laws just like the people in novels who for that reason used to plunge me in such depression when i read of their lives down at combray in the fastness of my wicker sentrybox in theory one is aware that the earth revolves but in practice one does not perceive it the ground upon which one treads seems not to move and one can live undisturbed so it is with time in one’s life and to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten or twenty or even thirty years at the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope at the foot of the next we meet him again a bowed old man of eighty painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse scarcely replying to what is said to him oblivious of the past in saying of me “he is no longer a child” “his tastes will not change now” and so forth my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in time and caused me the same kind of depression as if i had baen not yet the enfeebled old pensioner but one of those heroes of whom the author in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling says to us at the end of a book “he very seldom comes up now from the country he has finally decided to end his days there”

    meanwhile my father so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest said to my mother “upon my word old norpois was rather ‘typical’ as you call it this evening wasn’t he when he said that it would not have been ‘seemly’ to ask the comte de paris a question i was quite afraid you would burst out laughing”

    “not at all” answered my mother “i was delighted to see a man of his standing and age too keep that sort of simplicity which is really a sign of straightforwardness and goodbreeding”

    “i should think so indeed that does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind i know him well i see him at the commission remember where he is very different from what he was here” exclaimed my father who was glad to see that mamma appreciated m de norpois and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed because a cordial nature exaggerates a friend’s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them “what was it that he said again —‘with princes one never does know’   ”

    “yes that was it i noticed it at the time it was very neat you can see that he has a vast experience of life”

    “the astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the swanns and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there officials even how on earth can mme swann have managed to catch them”

    “did you notice the malicious way he said ‘it is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen’”

    and each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which m de norpois had uttered these words as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of bressant’s voice or of thiron’s in l’aventurière or in thegendre de m poirier but of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by françoise who years afterwards even could not ‘keep a straight face’ if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the ambassador as ‘a chef of the first order’ a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her as a war minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting sovereign after the grand review i as it happened had preceded my mother to the kitchen for i had extorted from françoise who though opposed to war was cruel that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill and i had had no report yet of its death françoise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired and very swiftly “i have never seen a beast like it it died without uttering a word you would have thought it was dumb” being but little versed in the language of beasts i suggested that the rabbit had not perhaps a cry like the chicken’s “just wait till you see” said françoise filled with contempt for my ignorance “if rabbits don’t cry every bit as much as chickens why they are far noisier” she received the compliments of m de norpois with the proud simplicity the joyful and if but for the moment intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art my mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done i had the same pleasure that evening in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that i had had long ago when i learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations “the ambassador” my mother told her “assured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and soufflés as good as yours” françoise with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth agreed but seemed not at all impressed by the title ‘ambassador’ she said of m de norpois with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef “he’s a good old soul like me” she had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived but knowing that mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows and thinking that mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch for françoise saw everywhere nothing but ‘jealousies’ and ‘talebearings’ which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the jesuits or the jews she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window ‘so as not to have words with madame’ and beneath the momentary aspect of m de norpois had ‘thought it was monsieur legrand’ because of what she called his ‘agelity’ and in spite of their having not a single point in common “well” inquired my mother “and how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you — when you choose” “i really couldn’t say how that becomes about” replied françoise who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb ‘to come’ in certain of its meanings at least and the verb ‘to become’ she was speaking the truth if not the whole truth being scarcely more capable — or desirous — of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song their explanations tell us little it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook “they do it in too much of a hurry” she went on alluding to the great restaurants “and then it’s not all done together you want the beef to become like a sponge then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop still there was one of those cafés where i thought they did know a little bit about cooking i don’t say it was altogether my jelly but it was very nicely done and the soufflés had plenty of cream” “do you mean henry’s” asked my father who had now joined us for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the place gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners “oh dear no” said françoise with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt “i meant a little restaurant at that henry’s it’s all very good sure enough but it’s not a restaurant it’s more like a — soupkitchen” “weber’s then” “oh no sir i meant a good restaurant weber’s that’s in the rue royale that’s not a restaurant it’s a drinkingshop i don’t know that the food they give you there is even served i think they don’t have any tablecloths they just shove it down in front of you like that with a take it or leave it” “giro’s” “oh there i should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world” ‘world’ meant for françoise the underworld “lord they need that to fetch the boys in” we could see that with all her air of simplicity françoise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous ‘comrade’ than the most jealous the most infatuated of actresses we felt all the same that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition for she went on “no i mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table it’s a place of some consequence too plenty of custom there oh they raked in the coppers there all right” françoise being an economist reckoned in coppers where your plunger would reckon in gold “madame knows the place well enough down there to the right along the main boulevards a little way back” the restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and goodhumoured tolerance was it turned out the café anglais

    when new year’s day came i first of all paid a round of family visits with mamma who so as not to tire me had planned them beforehand with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship but no sooner had we entered the drawingroom of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours than my mother was horrified to see standing there his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him and this uncle would certainly be hurt he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the madeleine to the jardin des plantes where he lived before stopping at saintaugustin on our way to the rue de l’ecole de médecine

    our visits ended my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her since we were to dine there that evening i ran all the way to the champselysées to give to our own special stallkeeper with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the swanns to buy gingerbread the letter which on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety i had decided to send her at the new year and in which i told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year that i would forget now my old sorrows and disappointments and that from this first day of january it was a new friendship that we were going to cement one so solid that nothing could destroy it so wonderful that i hoped that gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty and to warn me in time as i promised to warn her should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it on our way home françoise made me stop at the corner of the rue royale before an openair stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of pius ix and raspail while for myself i purchased one of berma the innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a ‘change’ this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip the arch of her eyebrows a few other physical peculiarities always the same which when it came to that were at the mercy of a burn or a blow this face moreover could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful but it gave me the idea and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received for which from its page in the album it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze that artificially ingenuous smile for our berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of phaedra longings of which everything even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth must render the gratification so easy to her night was falling i stopped before a column of playbills on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on january 1 a moist and gentle breeze was blowing it was a time of day and year that i knew i suddenly felt a presentiment that new year’s day was not a day different from the rest that it was not the first day of a new world in which i might by a chance that had never yet occurred that was still intact make gilberte’s acquaintance afresh as at the creation of the world as though the past had no longer any existence as though there had been obliterated with the indications which i might have preserved for my future guidance the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old — save one thing my desire that gilberte should love me i realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction round about it of a universe that had not satisfied it before it was because my heart had not altered and i told myself that there was no reason why gilberte’s should have altered either i felt that this new friendship was the same just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them without being able to reach and so to modify them invests unknown to themselves with distinctive names i might dedicate this new year if i chose to gilberte and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature endeavour to stamp new year’s day with the particular image that i had formed of it but in vain i felt that it was not aware that people called it new year’s day that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills i had recognised i had felt reappear the eternal the universal substance the familiar moisture the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years

    i returned to the house i had spent the new year’s day of old men who differ on that day from their juniors not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the new year presents i had indeed received but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure namely a line from gilberte i was young still none the less since i had been able to write her one by means of which i hoped in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing to arouse similar dreams in her the sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters the futility of which their experience has shewn

    after i was in bed the noises of the street unduly prolonged upon this festive evening kept me awake i thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure of the lover the troop it might be of debauchees who would be going to meet berma at the stagedoor after the play that i had seen announced for this evening i was not even able so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night to assure myself that berma was not perhaps thinking about love since the lines that she was reciting which she had long and carefully rehearsed reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing as of course she already knew and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs — only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness — to her astonished audience and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself i lighted my candle again to look once more upon her face at the thought that it was no doubt at that very moment being caressed by those men whom i could not prevent from giving to berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague i felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn as one hears it on the nights of the lenten carnival and often of other public holidays which because it then lacks all poetry is more saddening coming from a toy squeaker than “at evening in the depth of the woods” at that moment a message from gilberte would perhaps not have been what i wanted our desires cut across one another’s paths and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it

    i continued to go to the champselysées on fine days along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed because exhibitions of watercolours were then at the height of fashion in a lightly floating atmosphere it would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses i found more style and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the palais de l’industrie at any rate in the trocadéro plunged in a restless sleep my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling and i had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the rue royale just as i should have been astonished to learn that the portesaintmartin and the portesaintdenis those glories of the age of louis xiv were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names once only one of gabriel’s palaces made me stop for more than a moment that was because night having fallen its columns dematerialised by the moonlight had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta orphée aux enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty

    meanwhile gilberte never came to the champselysées and yet it was imperative that i should see her for i could not so much as remember what she was like the questing anxious exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow and until that word is uttered our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair all these make our observation in the beloved object’s presence too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her perhaps also that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is overindulgent to the thousand forms to the changing fragrance to the movements of the living person whom as a rule when we are not in love we regard as fixed in one permanent position whereas the beloved model does not stay still and our mental photographs of her are always blurred i did not rightly know how gilberte’s features were composed save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me i could remember nothing but her smile and not being able to see again that beloved face despite every effort that i might make to recapture it i would be disgusted to find outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail the meaningless emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barleysugar woman just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world in their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief and i was not far from believing that since i could not recall the features of gilberte i had forgotten gilberte herself and no longer loved her at length she returned to play there almost every day setting before me fresh pleasures to desire to demand of her for the morrow indeed making my love for her every day in this sense a new love but an incident was to change once again and abruptly the manner in which at about two o’clock every afternoon the problem of my love confronted me had m swann intercepted the letter that i had written to his daughter or was gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event and so that i should be more prudent in future a state of things already long established as i was telling her how greatly i admired her father and mother she assumed that vague air full of reticence and kept secrets which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do her walks drives visits — then suddenly expressed it with “you know they can’t abide you” and slipping from me like the undine that she was burst out laughing often her laughter out of harmony with her words seemed as music seems to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane m and mme swann did not require gilberte to give up playing with me but they would have been just as well pleased she thought if we had never begun they did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil this type of unscrupulous young man whom the swanns thought that i resembled i pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved flattering them to their faces but when he was alone with her making fun of them urging her on to disobey them and when once he had completed his conquest not allowing them even to set eyes on her again with these characteristics though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to swann so passionate on the contrary that i never doubted that were he to have the least suspicion of them he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error all that i felt about him i made bold to express to him in a long letter which i entrusted to gilberte with the request that she would deliver it she consented alas so he saw in me an even greater impostor than i had feared those sentiments which i had supposed myself to be portraying in sixteen pages with such amplitude of truth so he had suspected them in short the letter that i had written him as ardent and as sincere as the words that i had uttered to m de norpois met with no more success gilberte told me next day after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs that as he read my letter which she had now brought back to me her father had shrugged his shoulders with “all this means nothing it only goes to prove how right i was” i who knew the purity of my intentions the goodness of my soul was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of swann’s ridiculous error for it was an error of that i had then no doubt i felt that i had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that if swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people

    well perhaps it was simply that swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that i expressed for him simply an effect — and the strongest possible proof — of my love for gilberte by which and not by any subordinate veneration of himself my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled i was unable to share his point of view since i had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity and thus suffering experimentally its consequences i was in despair i was obliged to leave gilberte for a moment françoise had called me i must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis not unlike one of the disused tollhouses of old paris in which had recently been installed what in england they call a lavatory but in france by an illinformed piece of anglomania ‘waterclosets’ the old damp walls at the entrance where i stood waiting for françoise emitted a chill and fusty smell which relieving me at once of the anxieties that swann’s words as reported by gilberte had just awakened in me pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures which leave one more unstable than before incapable of retaining them of possessing them but on the contrary with a consistent pleasure on which i could lean for support delicious soothing rich with a truth that was lasting unexplained and certain i should have liked as long ago in my walks along the guermantes way to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me and remaining there motionless to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an ‘extra’ but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me but the tenant of the establishment an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig was speaking to me françoise thought her ‘very welltodo indeed’ her ‘missy’ had married what françoise called ‘a young man of family’ which meant that he differed more in her eyes from a workman than in saintsimon’s a duke did from a man ‘risen from the dregs of the people’ no doubt the tenant before entering upon her tenancy had met with reverses but françoise was positive that she was a ‘marquise’ and belonged to the saintferréol family this ‘marquise’ warned me not to stand outside in the cold and even opened one of her doors for me saying “won’t you go inside for a minute look here’s a nice clean one and i shan’t charge you anything” perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at gouache’s when we went in there to order something used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells and which alas mamma would never allow me to take perhaps with less innocence like an old florist whom mamma used to have in to replenish her flowerstands who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose in any event if the ‘marquise’ had a weakness for little boys when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love for i have never seen her with any other visitor except an old parkkeeper

    a moment later i said goodbye to the ‘marquise’ and went out accompanied by françoise whom i left to return to gilberte i caught sight of her at once on a chair behind the clump of laurels she was there so as not to be seen by her friends they were playing at hideandseek i went and sat down by her side she had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes giving her the same ‘underhand’ brooding crafty look which i had remarked in her that first time at comb ray i asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father face to face gilberte said that she had suggested that to him but that he had not thought it of any use “look” she went on “don’t go away without your letter i must run along to the others as they haven’t caught me”

    had swann appeared on the scene then before i had recovered it this letter by the sincerity of which i felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right for as i approached gilberte who leaning back in her chair told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me i felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that i said to her “look you try to stop me from getting it we’ll see which is the stronger”

    she thrust it behind her back i put my arms round her neck raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young and we wrestled locked together i tried to pull her towards me she resisted her cheeks inflamed by the effort were as red and round as two cherries she laughed as though i were tickling her i held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which i was trying to climb and in the middle of my gymnastics when i was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game i felt as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort my pleasure express itself in a form which i could not even pause for a moment to analyse immediately i snatched the letter from her whereupon gilberte said goodnaturedly

    “you know if you like we might go on wrestling for a little”

    perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which i had avowed but too dimly to have been able to see that i had attained it and i who was afraid that she had seen and a slight recoil as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded agreed to go on wrestling lest she should suppose that i had indeed no other object than that after which i wished only to sit quietly by her side

    on my way home i perceived i suddenly recollected the impression concealed from me until then towards which without letting me distinguish or recognise it the cold almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me it was that of my uncle adolphe’s little sittingroom at combray which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity but i could not understand and i postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness it struck me however that i did indeed deserve the contempt of m de norpois i had preferred hitherto to all other writers one whom he styled a mere ‘fluteplayer’ and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me not by any important idea but by a mouldy smell

    for some time past in certain households the name of the champselysées if a visitor mentioned it would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have or so they make out seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him people insisted that these gardens were not good for children that they knew of more than one sore throat more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the champs must be held responsible without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of mamma who continued to let me play there several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight

    neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any despite the timehonoured phrase to ‘listening to their insides’ they can hear so many things going on inside themselves by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed that they end by paying no attention to any of them their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help as though from some serious malady when it was merely because snow was coming or because they had to change their rooms that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable although dying of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health one morning bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities from whose constant internal circulation i kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood i had come running into the diningroom where my parents were already at table and — having assured myself as usual that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that for instance one has received a scolding and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain and not that one ought not to eat anything — had taken my place between them when in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet a nausea a giddiness stopped me the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun the symptoms of which had been masked retarded by the ice of my indifference but which obstinately refused the nourishment that i was not in a fit state to absorb then at the same moment the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that i was unwell gave me as the instinct of selfpreservation gives a wounded man the strength to crawl to my own room where i found that i had a temperature of 104 and then to get ready to go to the champselysées through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them my eager thoughts were urging me towards were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner’s base with gilberte and an hour later barely able to keep on my feet but happy in being by her side i had still the strength to enjoy it

    françoise on our return declared that i had been ‘taken bad’ that i must have caught a ‘hot and cold’ while the doctor who was called in at once declared that he ‘preferred’ the ‘severity’ the ‘virulence’ of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs and would be no more than ‘a fire of straw’ to other forms more ‘insidious’ and ‘septic’ for some time now i had been liable to choking fits and our doctor braving the disapproval of my grandmother who could see me already dying a drunkard’s death had recommended me to take as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe beer champagne or brandy when i felt an attack coming these attacks would subside he told me in the ‘euphoria’ brought about by the alcohol i was often obliged so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me instead of dissembling almost to make a display of my state of suffocation on the other hand as soon as i felt an attack coming never being quite certain what proportions it would assume i would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother’s anxiety of which i was far more afraid than of my own sufferings but at the same time my body either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret or because it feared lest in their ignorance of the imminent disaster people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which i finally put a sort of physiological scruple did i perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which i had not previously observed my body was in distress so long as i had not communicated it to my grandmother did she pretend to pay no attention it made me insist sometimes i went too far and that dear face which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past would allow an expression of pity to appear a painful contraction then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery i flung myself into her arms and its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that i felt my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her i protested that this discomfort had been nothing that i was in no sense to be pitied that she might be quite sure that i was now happy my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved and provided that someone knew that it ‘had a pain’ in its right side it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy that was outside its province almost every day during my convalescence i passed through these crises of suffocation one evening after my grandmother had left me comparatively well she returned to my room very late and seeing me struggling for breath “oh my poor boy” she exclaimed her face quivering with sympathy “you are in dreadful pain” she left me at once i heard the outer gate open and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy since there was none in the house presently i began to feel better my grandmother who was rather flushed seemed ‘put out’ about something and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection

    “i shall leave you alone now and let you get the good of this improvement” she said rising suddenly to go i detained her however for a kiss and could feel on her cold cheek something moist but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed next day she did not come to my room until the evening having had she told me to go out i considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare and i had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it

    as my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them my parents asked for a consultation with professor cottard it is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints it is in the long run his instinct his eye that must decide with which despite the more or less similar appearance of them all he has to deal this mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect and a creature of the utmost vulgarity who admires the worst pictures the worst music in whose mind there is nothing out of the common may perfectly well possess it in my case what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms to the first stages of tuberculosis to asthma to a toxialimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency to chronic bronchitis or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered now nervous spasms required to be treated firmly and discouraged tuberculosis with infinite care and with a ‘feedingup’ process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxialimentary dyspnoea this last calling for a strict diet which in return would be fatal to a tuberculous patient but cottard’s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious “purges violent and drastic purges milk for some days nothing but milk no meat no alcohol” my mother murmured that i needed all the same to be ‘built up’ that my nerves were already weak that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse i could see in cottard’s eyes as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural goodhumour to appear he was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one’s tie in his uncertainty and so as whatever he had done to put things right he replied brutally “i am not in the habit of repeating my instructions give me a pen now remember milk later on when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat i should like you to take a little clear soup and then a little broth but always with milk au lait you’ll enjoy that since spain is all the rage just now ollé ollé” his pupils knew this joke well for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet “after that you will gradually return to your normal life but whenever there is any coughing or choking — purges injections bed milk” he listened with icy calm and without uttering a word to my mother’s final objections and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case and would weaken me to no purpose and so they did not make me try it naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the professor and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found then as my health became worse they decided to make me follow out cottard’s prescriptions to the letter in three days my ‘rattle’ and cough had ceased i could breathe freely whereupon we realised that cottard while finding as he told us later on that i was distinctly asthmatic and still more inclined to ‘imagine things’ had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath my sleep and my strength and we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius at last i was able to get up but they spoke of not letting me go any more to the champselysées they said that it was because the air there was bad but i felt sure that this was only a pretext so that i should not see mlle swann and i forced myself to repeat the name of gilberte all the time like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand saying “so little boys don’t tell mamma their troubles any more” and françoise used to come up to me every day with “what a face to be sure if you could just see yourself i anyone would think there was a corpse in the house” it is true that if i had simply had a cold in the head françoise would have assumed the same funereal air these lamentations pertained rather to her ‘class’ than to the state of my health i could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction i decided provisionally that it was social and professional

    one day after the postman had called my mother laid a letter upon my bed i opened it carelessly since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy the name of gilberte with whom i had no relations outside the champselysées and lo at the foot of the page embossed with a silver seal representing a man’s head in a helmet and under him a scroll with the device per viam rectam beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand in which almost every word appeared to be underlined simply because the crosses of the ‘t’s’ ran not across but over them and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above it was indeed gilberte’s signature and nothing else that i saw but because i knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself the sight of it unaccompanied by any belief in it gave me no pleasure for a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me with lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed the fireplace the four walls i saw everything sway as one does when one falls from a horse and i asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one i knew in direct contradiction of it but itself the true existence which being suddenly revealed to me filled me with that hesitation which sculptors in representing the last judgment have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world “my dear friend” said the letter “i hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the champseîysées i hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness but i’m having my friends to tea here every monday and friday mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too as soon as you are well again and we can have some more nice talks here just like the champselysées goodbye dear friend i hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often with all my kindest regards gilberte”

    while i was reading these words my nervous system was receiving with admirable promptitude the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me but my mind that is to say myself and in fact the party principally concerned was still in ignorance such good fortune coming from gilberte was a thing of which i had never ceased to dream a thing wholly in my mind it was as leonardo says of painting cosa mentale now a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once but as soon as i had finished reading the letter i thought of it it became an object of my dreams became it also cosa mentale and i loved it so much already that every few minutes i must read it kiss it again then at last i was conscious of my happiness

    life is strewn with these miracles for which people who are in love can always hope it is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who seeing that for some time past i had lost all interest in life may have suggested to gilberte to write to me just as when i was little and went first to the seaside so as to give me some pleasure in bathing which i detested because it took away my breath she used secretly to hand to the man who was to ‘dip’ me marvellous boxes made of shells and branches of coral which i believed that i myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea however with every occurrence which in our life and among its contrasted situations bears any relation to love it is best to make no attempt to understand it since in so far as these are inexorable as they are unlookedfor they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws when a multimillionaire — who for all his millions is quite a charming person — sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living calls to his aid in his desperation all the resources of wealth and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back it is wiser for him in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress to suppose that fate intends to crush him and to make him die of an affection of the heart than to seek any logical explanation these obstacles against which lovers have to contend and which their imagination overexcited by suffering seeks in vain to analyse are contained as often as not in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves in her stupidity in the influence acquired over her the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know in the kind of pleasures which at the moment she is demanding of life pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover’s wealth can procure for her in any event the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles which her woman’y cunning hides from him and his own judgment falsified by love prevents him from estimating exactly they may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing but without having traced them to their source like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary only they last as a rule longer than love itself and as that is not a disinterested passion the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman neither rich nor virtuous with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her

    now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe when love is in question envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions such as had come to me with gilberte’s letter happy or at least seemingly happy for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more as a rule than dislodge some pain and yet sometimes a respite is granted us and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed

    so far as concerns this letter at the foot of which françoise declined to recognise gilberte’s name because the elaborate capital ‘g’ leaning against the undotted ‘i’ looked more like an ‘a’ while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated and which made me so radiantly happy we may perhaps find that i was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which i should have supposed on the contrary to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the swann family a short while back bloch had come to see me at a time when professor cottard whom now that i was following his instructions we were again calling in happened to be in my room as his examination of me was over and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner bloch was allowed to come in while we were all talking bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that mme swann was very fond of me by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before who was herself very intimate with mme swann i should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken and to establish the fact from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to m de norpois and for fear of mme swann’s taking me for a liar that i did not know her and had never spoken to her but i had not the courage to correct bloch’s mistake because i could see quite well that it was deliberate and that if he invented something that mme swann could not possibly have said it was simply to let us know what he considered flattering to himself and was not true either that he had been dining with one of that lady’s friends and so it fell out that whereas m de norpois on learning that i did not know but would very much like to know mme swann had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me cottard who was her doctor also having gathered from what he had heard bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me concluded that to remark when next he saw her that i was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to odette whenever an opportunity arose

    thus at length i found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that mme swann used though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar disturbing charm that emanated from the life of gilberte the implacable porter transformed into a benevolent eumenid adopted the custom when i asked him if i might go upstairs of indicating to me by raising his cap with a propitious hand that he gave ear to my prayer those windows which seen from outside used to interpose between me and the treasures within which were not intended for me a polished distant and superficial stare which seemed to me the very stare of the swanns themselves it fell to my lot when in the warm weather i had spent a whole afternoon with gilberte in her room to open them myself so as to let in a little air and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side if it was her mother’s ‘at home’ day to watch the visitors arrive who would often raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages greet me with a wave of the hand taking me for some nephew of their hostess at such moments gilberte’s plaits used to brush my cheek they seemed to me in the fineness of their grain at once natural and supernatural and in the strength of their constructed tracery a matchless work of art in the composition of which had been used the very grass of paradise to a section of them even infinitely minute what celestial herbary would i not have given as a reliquary but since i never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits if at least i had been able to have their photograph how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by vinci’s pencil to acquire one of these i stooped — with friends of the swanns and even with photographers — to servilities which did not procure for me what i wanted but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people

    gilberte’s parents who for so long had prevented me from seeing her now — when i entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually more formidable and more to be desired than at versailles of old the apparition of the king the possibility of my encountering them in which too invariably after butting into an enormous hatstand with seven branches like the candlestick in holy writ i would begin bowing confusedly before a footman seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the woodbox whom in the dim light i had mistaken for mme swann — gilberte’s parents if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile and say

    “how d’e do” they both pronounced it in the same clipped way which you may well imagine once i was back at home i made an incessant and delightful practice of copying “does gilberte know you’re here she does then i’ll leave you to her”

    better still the teaparties themselves to which gilberte invited her friends parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines written because i was still a comparative stranger upon sheets that were always different one was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue above a fantastic inscription in english with an exclamation mark after it another was stamped with an anchor or with the monogram g s preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page or else with the name gilberte now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend’s signature and ended in a flourish beneath an open umbrella printed in black now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a chinaman’s hat which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them at last as the series of different writingpapers which gilberte possessed numerous as it might be was not unlimited after a certain number of weeks i saw reappear the sheet that bore like the first letter she had written me the motto per vaim rectam and over it the man’s head in a helmet set in a medallion of tarnished silver and each of them was chosen on one day rather than another by virtue of a certain ritual as i then supposed but more probably as i now think because she tried to remember which of them she had already used so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents of those at least whom she took special pains to please save at the longest possible intervals as on account of the different times of their lessons some of the friends whom gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving while i was still on the stairs i could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which i was to take part long before i had reached the landing broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life so that i did not even remember that i was to take off my muffler as soon as i felt too hot and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home that staircase besides aîl of wood as they were built about that time in certain houses in keeping with that henri ii style which had for so long been odette’s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it and furnished with a placard to which there was no equivalent at home on which one read the words “notice the lift must not be taken downstairs” seemed to me a thing so marvellous that i told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by m swann my regard for the truth was so great that i should not have hesitated to give them this information even if i had known it to be false for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the swanns’ staircase the same respect that i felt myself it was just as when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head but since i had no power of observation since as a general rule i never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes and could understand only that when they were connected with the swanns they must be extraordinary i was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase i was guilty of falsehood it did not seem certain but it must have seemed probable for i felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with “i know those houses i have been in one they are all alike swann just has several floors in one it was berlier built them all” he added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them but that he had changed his mind finding that they were not conveniently arranged and that the landings were too dark so he said but i felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the swanns and to my own happiness and by a stroke of internal authority in spite of what i had just heard i banished for ever from my memory as a good catholic banishes renan’s vie de jésus the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living

    meanwhile on those teaparty days pulling myself up the staircase step by step reason and memory already cast off like outer garments and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes i would arrive in the zone in which the scent of mme swann greeted my nostrils i felt that i could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake encircled by plates heaped with little cakes and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them as required by convention but peculiar to the swanns but this unalterable and governed whole seemed like kant’s necessary universe to depend on a supreme act of free will for when we were all together in gilberte’s little sittingroom suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim

    “i say it’s getting a long time since luncheon and we aren’t having dinner till eight i feel as if i could eat something what do you say”

    and she would make us go into the diningroom as sombre as the interior of an asiatic temple painted by rembrandt in which an architectural cake as gracious and sociable as it was imposing seemed to be enthroned there in any event in case the fancy seized gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of darius better still in proceeding to the demolition of that babylonitish pastry gilberte did not consider only her own hunger she inquired also after mine while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits in the oriental styje she asked me even at what o’clock my parents were dining as if i still knew as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach alas its paralysis was but momentary the cakes that i took without noticing them a time would come when i should have to digest them but that time was still remote meanwhile gilberte was making ‘my’ tea i went on drinking it indefinitely whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twentyfour hours which explains why my mother used always to say “what a nuisance it is he can never go to the swarms’ without coming home ill” but was i aware even when i was at the swanns’ that it was tea that i was drinking had i known i should have taken it just the same for even supposing that i had recovered for a moment the sense of the present that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future my imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which i might have the idea of going to bed and the need to sleep

    gilberte’s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up one’s mind some of them refused tea then gilberte would say using a phrase highly fashionable that year “i can see i’m not having much of a success with my tea” and to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table with “we look just like a wedding breakfast good lord what fools servants are”

    she nibbled her cake perched sideways upon a crosslegged seat placed at an angle to the table and then just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother when mme swann whose ‘day’ coincided as a rule with gilberte’s teaparties had shewn one of her visitors to the door and came sweeping in a moment later dressed sometimes in blue velvet more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace she would say with an air of astonishment “i say that looks good what you’ve got there it makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake”

    “but mamma do we invite you” gilberte would answer

    

    “thank you no my precious what would my visitors say i’ve still got mme trombert and mme cottard and mme bontemps you know dear mme bontemps never pays very short visits and she has only just come what would all those good people say if i never went back to them if no one else calls i’ll come in again and have a chat with you which will be far more amusing after they’ve all gone i really think i’ve earned a little rest i have had fortyfive different people today and fortytwo of them told me about gérôme’s picture but you must come alone one of these days” she turned to me “and take ‘your’ tea with gilberte she will make it for you just as you like it as you have it in your own little ‘studio’” she went on flying off to her visitors as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits such as the habit that i should have had of taking tea had i ever taken it as for my ‘studio’ i was uncertain whether i had one or not that i had come to seek in this mysterious world “when can you come tomorrow we will make you ‘toast’ every bit as good as you get at colombin’s no you are horrid”— for since she also had begun to form a salon she had borrowed mme verdurin’s mannerisms and notably her tone of petulant autocracy ‘toast’ being as incomprehensible to me as ‘colombin’s’ this further promise could not add to my temptation it will appear stranger still now that everyone uses such expressions — and perhaps even at combray they are creeping in — that i had not at first understood of whom mme swann was speaking when i heard her sing the praises of our old ‘nurse’ i did not know any english i gathered however as she went on that the word was intended to denote françoise i who in the champselysées had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make i now learned from mme swann that it was all the things that gilberte had told them about my ‘nurse’ that had attracted her husband and her to me “one feels that she is so devoted to you she must be nice” at once my opinion of françoise was diametrically changed by the same token to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential finally i learned from some words which mme swann let fall with regard to mme blatin whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than i had supposed and would not in any way have improved my standing with the swanns

    if i had now begun to explore with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which against all probability had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches this was still only in my capacity as a friend of gilberte the kingdom into which i was received was itself contained within another more mysterious still in which swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way after taking my hand in theirs when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction but soon i was to penetrate also to the heart of the sanctuary for instance gilberte might be out when i called but m or mme swann was at home they would ask who had rung and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them desiring me to use in one way or another and with this or that object in view my influence over their daughter i reminded myself of that letter so complete so convincing which i had written to swann only the other day and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge i marvelled at the impotence of the mind the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion to solve a single one of those difficulties which in the sequel life without one’s so much as knowing what steps it has taken so easily unravels my new position as the friend of gilberte endowed with an excellent influence over her entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king i had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throneroom swann with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not overburdened with glorious occupations would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me things as to which i had no doubt before seeing them that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the louvre possessed or the national library but at which i found it impossible to look at such moments i should have been grateful to swann’s butler had he demanded from me my watch my tiepin my boots and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir in the admirable words of a popular expression of which as of the most famous epics we do not know who was the author although like those epics and with all deference to wolff and his theory it most certainly had an author one of those inventive modest souls such as we come across every year who light upon such gems as ‘putting a name to a face’ though their own names they never let us learn i did not know what i was doing all the greater was my astonishment when my visit was prolonged at finding to what a zero of realisation to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me but my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze for it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in swann’s library it was the attachment to those objects — which might have been the ugliest in the world — of the particular feeling melancholy and voluptuous which i had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it similarly the multitude of mirrors of silverbacked brushes of altars to saint anthony of padua carved and painted by the most eminent artists her friends counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when mme swann received me for a moment in her own room in which three beautiful and impressive creatures her principal and second and third maids smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets and towards which on the order conveyed to me by the footman in kneebreeches that madame wished to say a few words to me i would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed far and near by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressingroom a fragrance exquisitely sweet

    when mme swann had returned to her visitors we could still hear her talking and laughing for even with only two people in the room and as though she had to cope with all the ‘good friends’ at once she would raise her voice ejaculate her words as she had so often in the ‘little clan’ heard its ‘mistress’ do at the moments when she ‘led the conversation’ the expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which for a time at least we are fondest of using mme swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun in french before an adjective qualifying a person’s name at another time others more plebeian such as “it’s a mere nothing” the favourite expression of one of her friends and used to make room for them in all the stories which by a habit formed among the ‘little clan’ she loved to tell about people she would follow these up automatically with “i do love that story” or “do admit it’s a verygood story” which came to her through her husband from the guermantes whom she did not know

    mme swann had left the diningroom but her husband who had just returned home made his appearance among us in turn’ “do you know if your mother is alone gilberte” “no papa she has still some people” “what still at seven o’clock it’s appalling the poor woman must be absolutely dead it’s odious” at home i had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long ‘o’ like ‘ode’ but m and mme swann made it short as in ‘odd’ “just think of it ever since two o’clock this afternoon” he went on turning to me “and camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people did i say a dozen i believe he told me fourteen no a dozen i don’t remember when i came home i had quite forgotten it was her ‘day’ and when i saw all those carriages outside the door i thought there must be a wedding in the house and just now while i’ve been in the library for a minute the bell has never stopped ringing upon my word it’s given me quite a headache and are there a lot of them in there still” “no only two” “who are they do you know” “mme cottard and mme bontemps” “oh the wife of the chief secretary to the minister of posts” “i know her husband’s a clerk in some ministry or other but i don’t know what he does” gilberte assumed a babyish manner

    “what’s that you silly child you talk as if you were two years old what do you mean ‘a clerk in some ministry or other’ indeed he is nothing less than chief secretary chief of the whole show and what’s more — what on earth am i thinking of upon my word i’m getting as stupid as yourself he is not the chief secretary he’s the permanent secretary”

    “i don’t know i’m sure does that mean a lot being permanent secretary” answered gilberte who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity she may of course have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it

    “i should think it did ‘mean a lot’” exclaimed swann who preferred to this modesty which might have left me in doubt a more explicit mode of speech “why it means simply that he’s the first man after the minister in fact he’s more important than the minister because it is he that does all the work besides it appears that he has immense capacity a man quite of the first rank a most distinguished individual he’s an officer of the legion of honour a delightful man he is and very goodlooking too”

    this man’s wife incidentally had married him against everyone’s wishes and advica because he was a ‘charming creature’ he had what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole a fair silky beard good features a nasal voice powerful lungs and a glass eye

    “i may tell you” he added turning again to me “that i am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present government because they are bontemps of the bontempschenut family typical oldfashioned middleclass people reactionary clerical tremendously straitlaced your grandfather knew quite well — at least by name and by sight he must have known old chenut the father who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha’penny though he was a rich enough man for those days and the baron bréauchenut all their money went in the union générale smash — you’re too young to remember that of course — and gad they’ve had to get it back as best they could”

    “he’s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons in a class a long way below mine the famous ‘albertine’ she’s certain to be dreadfully ‘fast’ when she’s older but just now she’s the quaintest spectacle”

    “she is amazing this daughter of mine she knows everyone”

    “i don’t know her i only used to see her going about and hear them calling ‘albertine’ here and ‘albertine’ there but i do know mme bontemps and i don’t like her much either”

    “you are quite wrong she is charming pretty intelligent in fact she’s quite clever i shall go in and say how d’e do to her and ask her if her husband thinks we’re going to have war and whether we can rely on king theodosius he’s bound to know don’t you think since he’s in the counsels of the gods”

    it was not thus that swann used to talk in days gone by but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman and then ten years later tried to get back into society and found that people were not very willing to call upon her have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores and when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion heard her say “she came to see me only yesterday” or “i live a very quiet life” so that it is superfluous to make a study of manners since we can deduce them all from psychological laws

    the swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends a visit an invitation a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity if bad luck would have it that the verdurins were in london when odette gave a rather smart dinnerparty arrangements were made by which some common friend was to ‘cable’ a report to them across the channel even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by odette the swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves they spoke of them to their friends passed them from hand to hand thus the swanns’ drawingroom reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board

    still people who had known the old swann not merely outside society as i had known him but in society in that guermantes set which with certain concessions to highnesses and duchesses was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar — such people might have been astonished to observe that their old swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it how was it that mme bontemps so common so illnatured failed to exasperate him how could he possibly describe her as attractive the memory of the guermantes set must one would suppose have prevented him as a matter of fact it encouraged him there was certainly among the guermantes as compared with the great majority of groups in society taste indeed a refined taste but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste if it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle of a minister for foreign affairs a republican and inclined to be pompous or of an academician who talked too much their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him swann would condole with mme de guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the embassies and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion that is to say a man of the guermantes kind good for nothing but endowed with the wit of the guermantes some one who was ‘of the same chapel’ as themselves only a grand duchess a princess of the blood should she dine often with mme de guermantes would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also without having any right to be there without being at all so endowed but with the simplicity of people in society from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her swann coming to the rescue of mme de guermantes would say to her after the highness had gone “after all she’s not such a bad woman really she has quite a sense of the comic i don’t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the critique of pure reason still she is not unattractive” “oh i do so entirely agree with you” the duchess would respond “besides she was a little frightened of us all you will see that she can be charming” “she is certainly a great deal less devastating than mme x——” the wife of the talkative academician and herself a remarkable woman “who quotes twenty volumes at you” “oh but there isn’t any comparison between them” the faculty of saying such things as these and of saying them sincerely swann had acquired from the duchess and had never lost he made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house he forced himself to distinguish and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour and not with the distaste of the niceminded he extolled the merits of mme bontemps as he had once extolled those of the princesse de parme who must have been excluded from the guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain highnesses and if when they presented themselves for election no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm we have seen already moreover that swann had always an inclination which he was now putting into practice only in a more lasting fashion to exchange his social position for another which in certain circumstances might suit him better it is only people incapable of analysing in their perception what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one’s position is consolidated with one’s person one and the same man taken at successive points in his life will be found to breathe at different stages on the social ladder in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined whenever in any period of our existence we form or reform associations with a certain environment and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils

    in so far as mme bontemps was concerned i believe also that swann in speaking of her with so much emphasis was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife to tell the truth in our house the names of the people whom mme swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration at the name of mme trombert my mother exclaimed “ah that’s a new recruit and one who will bring in others” and as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary rapid and violent manner in which mme swann acquired her friends as it were by conquest and a colonial expedition mamma went on to observe “now that the tromberts have surrendered the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in” if she had passed mme swann in the street she would tell us when she came home “i saw mme swann in all her warpaint she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the massachutoes or the cingalese or the tromberts” and so with all the new people whom i told her that i had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings mamma would at once divine their origin and speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought would say “brought back from an expedition against the soandso”

    as for mme cottard my father was astonished that mme swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house and said “in spite of the professor’s position i must say that i cannot understand it” mamma on the other hand understood quite well she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others relatively more brilliant with whom she has replaced them therefore she requires an eyewitness who may be allowed to penetrate this new delicious world as a buzzing browsing insect bores its way into a flower and will then as the course of her visits may carry her spread abroad or so at least one hopes with the tidings a latent germ of envy and of wonder mme cottard who might have been created on purpose to fill this part belonged to that special category in a visiting list which mamma who inherited certain facets of her father’s turn of mind used to call the ‘tell sparta’ people besides — apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later — mme swann in inviting this goodnatured reserved and modest friend had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawingroom on her brilliant ‘days’ a traitor or a rival she knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker armed with her plume and cardcase could visit in a single afternoon she knew the creature’s power of dissemination and basing her calculations upon the law of probability was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the verdurins would be bound to hear within two or three days how the governor of paris had left cards upon her or that m verdurin himself would be told how m le hault de pressagny the president of the horse show had taken them swann and herself to the king theodosius gala she imagined the verdurins as informed of these two events both so flattering to herself and of these alone because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which none the less we hope — in a general way — that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit

    mme swann had however met with no success outside what was called the ‘official world’ smart women did not go to her house it was not the presence there of republican ‘notables’ that frightened them away in the days of my early childhood conservative society was to the last degree worldly and no ‘good’ house would ever have opened its doors to a republican the people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an ‘opportunist’— still more a ‘horrid radical’— to their parties was something that would endure for ever like oillamps and horsedrawn omnibuses but like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable and composes a fresh pattern before i had made my first communion ladies on the ‘right side’ in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting while paying calls a smart jewess these new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a ‘change of criterion’ the dreyfus case brought about another at a period rather later than that in which i began to go to mme swann’s and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour everything jewish even the smart lady herself fell out of the pattern and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place the most brilliant drawingroom in paris was that of a prince who was an austrian and ultracatholic if instead of the dreyfus case there had come a war with germany the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction and its pattern reversed the jews having shewn to the general astonishment that they were patriots also would have kept their position and no one would have cared to go any more or even to admit that he had ever gone to the austrian prince’s all this does not however prevent the people who move in it from imagining whenever society is stationary for the moment that no further change will occur just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work castigating the preceding epoch and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged which seem to them to be the last word in corruption but even the work of its artists and philosophers which have no longer the least value in their eyes as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity the one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been ‘great changes’ at the time when i went to mme swann’s the dreyfus storm had not yet broken and some of the more prominent jews were extremely powerful none more so than sir rufus israels whose wife lady israels was swann’s aunt she had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew’s while he since he did not care for her had never much cultivated her society although he was so far as was known her heir but she was the only one of swann’s relatives who had any idea of his social position the others having always remained in the state of ignorance in that respect which had long been our own when from a family circle one of its members emigrates into ‘high society’— which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys — he draws round about himself a zone of shadow a terra incognita which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst there being no news agency to furnish swann’s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted it was before his appalling marriage of course with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another over family dinnertables that they had spent a ‘virtuous’ sunday in going to see ‘cousin charles’ whom regarding him as a ‘poor relation’ who was inclined to envy their prosperity they used wittily to name playing upon the title of balzac’s story le cousin bête lady israels however was letterperfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous her husband’s family which almost equalled the rothschilds in importance had for several generations managed the affairs of the orleans princes lady israels being immensely rich exercised a wide influence and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be ‘at home’ to odette one only had disobeyed her in secret the comtesse de marsantes and then as ill luck would have it odette having gone to call upon mme de marsantes lady israels had entered the room almost at her heels mme de marsantes was on tenterhooks with the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose she did not address a single word to odette who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which moreover was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed in this complete detachment of the faubourg saintgermain odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate ‘light woman’ utterly different from the respectable ladies ‘well up’ in all the minutest points of genealogy who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them and swann for his part continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive for i have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies without his attempting whether from lingering affection for her loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect to correct them it was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at combray and which now had the effect that while he continued to know on his own account at least many highly distinguished people he did not make a point in conversation in his wife’s drawingroom of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance they had indeed less than ever for swann the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced in any case odette’s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the princesse de guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the duchess her cousin “so those ones are princes are they” she would exclaim “why they’ve gone up a step” were anyone to say “the prince” in speaking of the duc de chartres she would put him right with “the duke you mean he is duc de chartres not prince” as for the duc d’orléans son of the comte de paris “that’s funny the son is higher than the father” she would remark adding for she was afflicted with anglomania “thoseroyalties are so dreadfully confusing”— while to someone who asked her from what province the guermantes family came she replied “from the aisne”

    but so far as odette was concerned swann was quite blind not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence more than that whenever odette repeated a silly story swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency a merriment almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered while in the same conversation anything subtle anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by odette with an habitual lack of interest rather curtly with impatience and would at times be sharply contradicted and we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households when we think conversely of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances while they go into ecstasies with the infinite indulgence of love over the feeblest of his witticisms to return to the reasons which prevented odette at this period from making her way into the faubourg saintgermain it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes if not british spies one would therefore for some time to come expect people so at least one supposed to be before anything else in a sound position regular settled accountable odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations and was incidentally to renew them at once for men their natures not altering from day to day seek in every new order a continuance of the old but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster however the scapegoats of that society and odette were too closely alike people who move in society are very shortsighted at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the israelite ladies whom they have known while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives they perceive thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm a new lady an israelite also but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors with what they are convinced that they must abjure she does not ask that they shall respect her god they take her up there was no question of antisemitism at the time when i used first to visit odette but she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished for a while to avoid

    as for swann himself he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance who of course were all of the very highest rank and yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see i noticed that among those whom he had known in the old days the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste partly artistic partly historic that inspired him as a collector and remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation who interested him because she had been the mistress of liszt or because one of balzac’s novels was dedicated to her grandmother as he would purchase a drawing if chateaubriand had written about it i conceived a suspicion that we had at combray replaced one error that of regarding swann as a mere stockbroker who did not go into society by another when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in paris to be a friend of the comte de paris meant nothing at all is not the world full of such ‘friends of princes’ who would not be received in any house that was at all ‘exclusive’ princes know themselves to be princes and are not snobs besides they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and ‘business men’ appear in the depths beneath them to be practically on a level

    but swann went farther than this not content with seeking in society such as it was when he fastened upon the names which inscribed upon its roll by the past were still to be read there a simple artistic and literary pleasure he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements bringing together people taken at hazard here there and everywhere these experiments in the lighter side or what was to swann the lighter side of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction with any regularity that is to say in each of his wife’s friends “i’m thinking of asking the cottards to meet the duchesse de vendôme” he would laughingly say to mme bontemps in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of and intends to try the substitution in a sauce of cayenne pepper for cloves but this plan which was in fact to appear quite humorous in an archaic sense of the word to the cottards had also the power of infuriating mme bontemps she herself had recently been presented by the swanns to the duchesse de vendôme and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural the thought of winning renown from it at the cottards’ when she related to them what had happened had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure but like those persons recently decorated who their investiture once accomplished would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main mme bontemps would have preferred that after herself no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the princess she denounced to herself of course the licentious taste of swann who in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim was obliging her to scatter to the winds at one swoop all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the cottards when she told them about the duchesse de vendôme how was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique and yet if the cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host it is true that the bontemps had been invited for the same reason but swann having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal ‘don juan’ spirit which in treating with two women of no importance makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved had spoken to mme bontemps of the duchesse de vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner “yes we’re determined to have the princess here with the cottards” said mme swann a few weeks later “my husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction” for if she had retained from the ‘little nucleus’ certain habits dear to mme verdurin such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful she made use at the same time of certain expressions such as ‘conjunction’ which were dear to the guermantes circle of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance as the sea is swayed by the moon the attraction though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it “yes the cottards and the duchesse de vendôme don’t you think that might be rather fun” asked swann “i think they’ll be exceedingly illassorted and it can only lead to a lot of bother people oughtn’t to play with fire is what i say” snapped mme bontemps furious she and her husband were all the same invited as was the prince d’agrigente to this dinner which mme bontemps and cottard had each two alternative ways of describing according to whom they were telling about it to one set mme bontemps for her part and cottard for his would say casually when asked who else had been of the party “only the prince d’agrigente it was all quite intimate” but there were others who might alas be better informed once indeed some one had challenged cottard with “but weren’t the bontemps there too” “oh i forgot them” cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil for these the bontemps and cottards had each adopted without any mutual arrangement a version the framework of which was identical for both parties their own names alone changing places “let me see” cottard would say “there were our host and hostess the due and duchesse de vendôme —” with a satisfied smile “professor and mme cottard and upon my soul heaven only knows how they got there for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup m and mme bontemps” mme bontemps would recite an exactly similar ‘piece’ only it was m and mme bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the duchesse de vendôme and the prince d’agrigente while the ‘also ran’ whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves and who completely spoiled the party were the cottards

    when he had been paying calls swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner at that point in the evening six o’clock when in the old days he had felt so wretched he no longer asked himself what odette might be about and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her or had gone out he recalled at times that he had once years ago tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by odette to forcheville but this memory was not pleasing to him and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding if need be a shake of the head which signified “what does it all matter” in truth he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of odette — that this hypothesis which after all was beneficent since so long as his amorous malady had lasted it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary was not the truth that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light and that if odette had loved him better than he supposed she had deceived him more as well formerly while his sufferings were still keen he had vowed that as soon as he should have ceased to love odette and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her simply from his love of truth and as a historical point whether or not she had had forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in and she had written to forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called but this so interesting problem of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided had precisely lost all interest in swann’s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous not immediately however he felt no other jealousy now with regard to odette than what the memory of that day that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the rue la pérouse had continued to excite in him as though his jealousy not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places in certain houses had had for its object not so much odette herself as that day that hour in the irrevocable past when swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn you would have said that that day that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been swann’s and that there alone could he now recapture them for a long time now it had made no matter to him that odette had been false to him and was false still and yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of odette so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day so long ago at six o’clock odette had been in bed with forcheville then that curiosity itself had disappeared without however his abandoning his investigations he continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish — so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it that only the death of her whom he loved death which as will be shewn later on in this story by a cruel example in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy seemed to him capable of making smooth the road then insurmountably barred to him of his life

    but to bring to light some day those passages in the life of odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been swann’s only ambition he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when being no longer in love with odette he should no longer be afraid of her and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred for swann was in love with another woman a woman who gave him — grounds for jealousy no but who did all the same make him jealous because he was not capable now of altering his way of making love and it was the way he had used with odette that must serve him now for another to make swann’s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him at a party for instance where she was presumably enjoying herself that was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love which held swann ever at a distance from what she really was like a yearning to attain the impossible what this young woman really felt for him the hidden longing that absorbed her days the secret places of her heart for between swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions having their cause in odette or in some other perhaps who had preceded odette allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the ‘woman who made him jealous’ in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love often however swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities but then he would remember that he had given odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong and so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes but whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her — of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with odette that had been so necessary to him once of those reprisals he took no more thought with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer and he who when he was suffering at the hands of odette would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love

      

    it was not only in those teaparties on account of which i had formerly had the sorrow of seeing gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual that i was henceforth to take part but the engagements that she had with her mother to go for a walk or to some afternoon party which by preventing her from coming to the champselysées had deprived me of her on those days when i loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses — to these outings m and mme swann henceforth admitted me i had a seat in their landau and indeed it was me that they asked if i would rather go to the theatre to a dancing lesson at the house of one of gilberte’s friends to some social gathering given by friends of her parents what odette called ‘a little meeting’ or to visit the tombs at saintdenis

    on days when i was going anywhere with the swanns i would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner which mme swann called ‘le lunch’ as one was not expected before halfpast twelve while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven it was not until they had risen from the table that i made my way towards that sumptuous quarter deserted enough at any hour but more particularly just then when everyone had gone indoors even on winter days of frost if the weather held tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from charvet’s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty i would roam to and fro among the avenues waiting until twentyseven minutes past the hour i could see from afar in the swanns’ little gardenplot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bareboughed trees it is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them the unusual hour presented the scene in a new light into these pleasures of nature intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with mme swann was infused it did not diminish them but taking command of them trained them to its service so that if at this hour when ordinarily i did not perceive them i seemed now to be discovering the fine weather the cold the wintry sunlight it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs as a patina a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of mme swann and in the heart of which there were by contrast so much warmth so many scents and flowers

    at halfpast twelve i would finally make up my mind to enter that house which like an immense christmas stocking seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights the french name ‘noël’ was by the way unknown to mme swann and gilberte who had substituted for it the english ‘christmas’ and would speak of nothing but ‘christmas pudding’ what people had given them as ‘christmas presents’ and of going away — the thought of which maddened me with grief —‘for christmas’ at home even i should have thought it degrading to use the word ‘noël’ and always said ‘christmas’ which my father considered extremely silly

    i encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawingrooms shewed me into one that was quite small empty its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon i was left alone there in the company of orchids roses and violets which like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal in a basin of white marble over which it spilled now and again its perilous rubies

    i had sat down but i rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened it was only another footman and then a third and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases they departed i found myself alone once that door was shut which mme swann was surely soon going to open of a truth i should have been less ill at ease in a magician’s cave than in this little waitingroom where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in klingsor’s laboratory footsteps sounded afresh i did not rise it was sure to be just another footman it was m swann “what all by yourself what is one to do that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means ten minutes to one she gets later every day and you’ll see she will come sailing in without the least hurry and imagine she’s in heaps of time” and as he was still subject to neuritis and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife who came in so late from the bois forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his selfesteem

    he shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me but my emotion added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour sweeping through my mind left it void so that while able to speak i was incapable of hearing anyhow so far as the works of art in swann’s possession were concerned it was enough for me that they were contained in his house formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon the gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of mme swann’s indoor gowns or her scent bottles

    i continued to wait alone or with swann and often with gilberte come in to keep us company the arrival of mme swann prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions must so it seemed to me be something truly immense i strained my ears to catch the slightest sound but one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral a wave in a storm a dancer’s leap in the air after those liveried footmen suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen mme swann creeping furtively in with a little otterskin coat her veil lowered to cover a nose pinktipped by the cold did not fulfil the promises lavished while i had been waiting upon my imagination

   but if she had stayed at home all morning when she arrived in the drawingroom she would be clad in a wrapper of crêpedechine brightly coloured which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses

    sometimes the swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon and then as we had had luncheon so late very soon i must watch setting beyond the gardenwall the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console a cardtable a cornercupboard a bracket as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation and i went home disappointed as one often is in one’s childhood after the midnight mass

    but my disappointment was scarcely more than mental i was radiant with happiness in this house where gilberte when she was still not with us was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment and for hours to come her speech her smiling and attentive gaze just as i had caught it that first time at combray at the most i was a trifle jealous when i saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above reached by a private staircase obliged myself to remain in the drawingroom like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall ‘in front’ and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes in the greenroom i put to swann with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled but in a tone from which i could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness he explained to me that the place to which gilberte had gone was the linenroom offered himself to shew it to me and promised me that whenever gilberte had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her by these last words and the relief which they brought me swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote at that moment i felt for him an affection which i believed to be deeper than my affection for gilberte for he being the master over his daughter was giving her to me whereas she she withheld herself now and then i had not the same direct control over her as i had indirectly through swann besides it was she whom i loved and could not therefore look upon without that disturbance without that desire for something more which destroys in us in the presence of one whom we love the sensation of loving

    as a rule however we did not stay indoors we went out sometimes before going to dress mme swann would sit down at the piano her lovely hands escaping from the pink or white or often vividly coloured sleeves of her crêpedechine wrapper drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart it was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of vinteuil’s sonata that contained the little phrase of which swann had been so fond but often one listens and hears nothing if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time and yet when later on this sonata had been played over to me two or three times i found that i knew it quite well and so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time if one had indeed as one supposes received no impression from the first hearing the second the third would be equally ‘first hearings’ and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth probably what is wanting the first time is not comprehension but memory for our memory compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening is infinitesimal as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall a minute afterwards what one has just been saying to him of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture but that picture gradually takes shape and with regard to works which we have heard more than once we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning it was only that i had not until then heard a note of the sonata whereas swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void a void from which an hour later when one is not thinking about them will spring of their own accord in one continuous flight the syllables that one has solicited in vain and not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great but even in the content of any such work as befell me in the case of vinteuil’s sonata it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives thus it was that i was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me so that for a long time i made no effort to hear it again from the moment in which mme swann had played over to me its most famous passage i was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in venice before the front of saint mark’s because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes far more than that even when i had heard the sonata played from beginning to end it remained almost wholly invisible to me like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse hence the depression inseparable from one’s knowledge of such works as of everything that acquires reality in time when the least obvious beauties of vinteuil’s sonata were revealed to me already borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility those that i had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape to avoid me since i was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me i never possessed it in its entirety it was like life itself but less disappointing than life is great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best in vinteuil’s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired and for the same reason no doubt namely that they are less different from what one already knows but when those first apparitions have withdrawn there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact and this which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it which has thus been held in reserve for us which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown this comes to us last of all but this also must be the last that we shall relinquish and we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it the time moreover that a person requires — as i required in the matter of this sonata — to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome a symbol one might say of the years the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new so that the man of genius to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world may say to himself that since one’s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them but as it happens any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure they are inevitable the reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary that few other men resemble him it was beethoven’s quartets themselves the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth that devoted half a century to forming fashioning and enlarging a public for beethoven’s quartets marking in this way like every great work of art an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society largely composed today of what was not to be found when the work first appeared that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it what artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art it is essential that the work leaving out of account for brevity’s sake the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit shall create its own posterity for if the work were held in reserve were revealed only to posterity that audience for that particular work would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living halfacentury later in time and so it is essential that the artist and this is what vinteuil had done if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course shall launch it wherever he may find sufficient depth confidently outward bound towards the future and yet this interval of time the true perspective in which to behold a work of art if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good no doubt one can easily imagine by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules whereas that which immediately confronts us be it impressionism a striving after discord an exclusive use of the chinese scale cubism futurism or what you will differs outrageously from all that have occurred before simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance varied of course but taking it as a whole homogeneous in which hugo blends with molière let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find if we did not take into account the future and the changes that it must bring about in a horoscope of our own riper years drawn and presented to us in our youth only horoscopes are not always accurate and the necessity when judging a work of art of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces to our way of thinking something as hazardous and consequently as barren of interest as every prophecy the nonfulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet’s part for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight or although a brilliant psychologist in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen

    if i did not understand the sonata it enchanted me to hear mme swann play her touch appeared to me like her wrappers like the scent of her staircase her cloaks her chrysanthemums to form part of an individual and mysterious whole in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent “attractive isn’t it that vinteuil sonata” swann asked me “the moment when night is darkening among the trees when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth you must admit that it is rather charming it shews all the static side of moonlight which is the essential part it is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking should act on the muscles since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring that is what he expresses so well in that little phrase the bois de boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance by the sea it is even more striking because you have there the faint response of the waves which of course you can hear quite distinctly since nothing else dares to move in paris it is the other way at the most you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there but in vinteuil’s little phrase and in the whole sonata for that matter it is not like that the scene is laid in the bois in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying ‘i can almost see to read the paper’” these words from swann might have falsified later on my impression of the sonata music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it but i understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase in place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it what it recalled now to swann were the leafy boughs arranged wreathed painted round about it which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner their hidden self as it were their soul was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before not having had — feverish and moody as he then was — enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment which as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat it had kept in store for him the charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the bois a charm of which vinteuil’s sonata served to remind him he could not have recaptured by questioning odette although she as well as the little phrase had been his companion there but odette had been merely his companion by his side not as the phrase had been within him and so had seen nothing — nor would she had she been a thousand times as comprehending have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us or at least i was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception can be made externally visible “it is rather charming don’t you think” swann continued “that sound can give a reflection like water or glass it is curious too that vinteuil’s phrase now shews me only the things to which i paid no attention then of my troubles my loves of those days it recalls nothing it has altered all my values” “charles i don’t think that’s very polite to me what you’re saying” “not polite really you women are superb i was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews — to me at least — is not for a moment ‘freewill’ or ‘in tune with the infinite’ but shall we say old verdurin in his frock coat in the palmhouse at the jardin d’acclimatation hundreds of times without my leaving this room the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at armenonville gad it is less boring anyhow than having to go there with mme de cambremer” mme swann laughed “that is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with charles” she explained in the same tone in which shortly before when we were speaking of vermeer of delft of whose existence i had been surprised to find her conscious she had answered me with “i ought to explain that m swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me isn’t that so charles dear” “you’re not to start saying things about mme de cambremer” swann checked her secretly flattered “but i’m only repeating what i’ve been told besides it seems that she’s an extremely clever woman i don’t know her myself i believe she’s very pushing which surprises me rather in a clever woman but everyone says that she was quite mad about you there’s no harm in repeating that” swann remained silent as a deafmute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said and a proof of his own fatuity “since what i’m playing reminds you of the jardin d’acclimatation” his wife went on with a playful semblance of being offended “we might take him there some day in the carriage if it would amuse him it’s lovely there just now and you can recapture your fond impressions which reminds me talking of the jardin d’acclimatation do you know this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom i cut as a matter of fact whenever i possibly can mme blatin i think it is rather crushing for us that she should be taken for a friend of ours just fancy dear dr cottard who never says a harsh word about anyone declares that she’s positively contagious” “a frightful woman the one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like savonarola she is the very image of that portrait of savonarola by fra bartolomeo” this mania which swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible for even what we call individual expression is — as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved — something diffused and general which can be found existing at different periods but if one had listened to swann the processions of the kings of the east already so anachronistic when benozzo gozzoli introduced in their midst various medici would have been even more so since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men contemporaries not of gozzoli but of swann subsequent that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the nativity but by four more to the painter himself there was not missing from those trains according to swann a single living parisian of any note any more than there was from that act in one of sardou’s plays in which out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady and also because it was the fashion all the best known men in paris famous doctors politicians barristers amused themselves each on a different evening by ‘walking on’ “but what has she got to do with the jardin d’acclimatation” “everything” “what you don’t suggest that she’s got a skyblue behind like the monkeys” “charles you really are too dreadful i was thinking of what the cingalese said to her do tell him charles it really is a gem” “oh it’s too silly you know mme blatin loves asking people questions in a tone which she thinks friendly but which is really overpowering” “what our good friends on the thames call ‘patronising’” interrupted odette “exactly well she went the other day to the jardin d’acclimatation where they have some blackamoors — cingalese i think i heard my wife say she is much ‘better up’ in ethnology than i am” “now charles you’re not to make fun of poor me”

    “i’ve no intention of making fun i assure you well to continue she went up to one of these black fellows with ‘good morning nigga’    ” “oh it’s too absurd” “anyhow this classification seems to have displeased the black ‘me nigga’ he shouted quite furious don’t you know to mme blatin ‘me nigga you old cow’” “i do think that’s so delightful i adore that story do say it’s a good one can’t you see old blatin standing there and hearing him ‘me nigga you old cow’” i expressed an intense desire to go there and see these cingalese one of whom had called mme blatin an old cow they did not interest me in the least but i reflected that in going to the jardin d’acclimatation and again on our way home we should pass along that allée des acacias in which i had loved so once to gaze on mme swann and that perhaps coquelin’s mulatto friend to whom i had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her would see me there seated at her side as the victoria swept by

    during those minutes in which gilberte having gone to ‘get ready’ was not in the room with us m and mme swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child and everything that i myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said i remarked that as her mother had told me she had not only for her friends but for the servants for the poor the most delicate attentions carefully thought out a desire to give pleasure a fear of causing annoyance translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her she had done some ‘work’ for our stallkeeper in the champselysées and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands so as not to lose a day “you have no idea how kindhearted she is she won’t let it be seen” her father assured me young as she was she appeared far more sensible already than her parents when swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends gilberte would turn away and remain silent but without any air of reproaching him for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism one day when i had spoken to her of mlle vinteuil she said to me

    “i shall never know her for a very good reason and that is that she was not nice to her father by what one hears she gave him a lot of trouble you can’t understand that any more than i can you i’m sure you could no more live without your papa than i could which is quite natural after all how can one ever forget a person one has loved all one’s life”

    and once when she was making herself particularly endearing to swann as i mentioned this to her when he was out of the room

    “yes poor papa it is the anniversary of his father’s death just now you can understand what he must be feeling you do understand don’t you you and i feel the same about things like that so i just try to be a little less naughty than usual” “but he doesn’t ever think you naughty he thinks you’re quite perfect” “poor papa that’s because he’s far too good himself”

    but her parents were not content with singing the praises of gilberte — that same gilberte who even before i had set eyes on her used to appear to me standing before a church in a landscape of the he de france and later awakening in me not dreams now but memories was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn in the little lane that i took when i was going the méséglise way once when i had asked mme swann and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family curious to know the preferences of a child which among all her playmates gilberte liked the best mme swann replied “but you ought to know a great deal better than i do you are in her confidence her great favourite her ‘chum’ as the english say”

    it appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming it completely hides that ideal absorbing it in itself as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide so that there is but one whereas we would rather so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment preserve for all those separate points of our desire at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves the distinction of being intangible and our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it for it has no longer a clear field the acquaintance that we have made the memory of those first unhopedfor moments the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination they react more forcibly upon our past which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account than upon the form still unshaped of our future i had been able to believe year after year that the right to visit mme swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which i should never attain after i had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawingroom it was the period in which i did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible how was i ever to dream again of her diningroom as of an inconceivable place when i could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity even ino my own most distant past by the lobster à l’américaine which i had just been eating and swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed to coincide and be lost in one another not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed but another still that which his jealous love as inventive as any fantasy of mine had so often depicted to him that dwelling common to odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once on evenings when odette had taken him home with forcheville to drink orangeade with her and what had flowed in to be absorbed for him in the walls and furniture of the diningroom in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhopedfor paradise in which in the old days he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words “is madame ready yet” which i now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with selfsatisfaction no more than probably swann himself could i succeed in knowing my own happiness and when gilberte once broke out “who would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners’ base without daring to speak to her would one day be your greatest friend and you would go to her house whenever you liked” she spoke of a change the occurrence of which i could verify only by observing it from without finding no trace of it within myself for it was composed of two separate states on both of which i could not without their ceasing to be distinct from one another succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time

    and yet this house because it had been so passionately desired by swann must have kept for him some of its attraction if i was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery that singular charm in which i had for so long supposed the life of the swanns to be bathed i had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it i had made it that charm recoil overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger the pariah that i had been to whom now mme swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite hostile scandalised but all round me that charm in my memory i can still distinguish is it because on those days on which m and mme swann invited me to luncheon to go out afterwards with them and gilberte i imprinted with my gaze — while i sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet the sofas the tables the screens the pictures the idea engraved upon my mind that mme swann or her husband or gilberte was about to enter the room is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the swanns and have gradually acquired something of their personal character is it because knowing that the swanns passed their existence among all those things i made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives of those habits of the swanns from which i had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me even when i was allowed the privilege of sharing in them however it may be always when i think of that drawingroom which swann not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife’s taste found so incongruous — because while it was still planned and carried out in the style half conservatory half studio which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known odette she had none the less begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the chinese ornaments which she now felt to be rather gimcrack a trifle dowdy by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old louis xiv silks not to mention the works of art brought by swann himself from his house on the quai d’orléans — it has kept in my memory on the contrary that composite heterogeneous room a cohesion a unity an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us or the most modern alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality for we alone can by our belief that they have an existence of their own give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep which they develop in our minds all the ideas that i had formed of the hours different from those that exist for other men passed by the swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul and must give expression to its singularity all those ideas were rearranged amalgamated — equally disturbing and indefinite throughout — in the arrangement of the furniture the thickness of the carpets the position of the windows the ministrations of the servants when after luncheon we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawingroom while mme swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar i took it was not only the silkcovered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted with the agonising charm that i had long ago felt — first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels — in the name of gilberte the hostility that her parents had shewn to me which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood to have so completely shared that i felt myself unworthy and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion a personality a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o’clock in the afternoon so different from any other light in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands and there was nothing even to the painting by rubens hung above the chimneypiece that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of m swann and that hooded cape the like of which i had so dearly longed to wear whereas now odette would beg her husband to go and put on another so as to appear more smart whenever i did them the honour of driving out with them she too went away to change her dress — not heeding my protestations that no ‘outdoor’ clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crêpedechine or silk old rose cherrycoloured tiepolo pink white mauve green red or yellow plain or patterned in which mme swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off when i assured her that she ought to go out in that costume she laughed either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment she apologised for having so many wrappers explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable and left us to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders and yet among which i was sometimes summoned to decide which of them i preferred that she should put on

    in the jardin d’acclimatation how proud i was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of mme swann while she strolled carelessly on letting her cloak stream on the air behind her i kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile and now were we to meet one or other of gilberte’s friends boy or girl who saluted us from afar i would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot i had envied one of those friends of gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life the part which was not spent in the champselysées

    often upon the paths of the bois or the jardin we passed we were greeted by some great lady who was swann’s friend whom he perchance did not see so that his wife must rally him with a “charles don’t you see mme de montmorency” and swann with that amicable smile bred of a long and intimate friendship bared his head but with a slow sweeping gesture with a grace peculiarly his own sometimes the lady would stop glad of an opportunity to shew mme swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit so thoroughly had swann trained her in reserve she had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society and however smart however stately the lady might be mme swann was invariably a match for her halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing she would introduce us gilberte and myself with so much ease of manner would remain so free so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy that it would have been hard to say looking at them both which of the two was the aristocrat the day on which we went to inspect the cingalese on our way home we saw coming in our direction and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons “ah here is someone who will interest you” said swann the old lady who had come within a few yards of us now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness swann doffed his hat mme swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady who standing there like a winterhalter portrait drew her up again and kissed her cheek “there there will you put your hat on you” she scolded swann in a thick and almost growling voice speaking like an old and familiar friend “i am going to present you to her imperial highness” mme swann whispered swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the jardin d’acclimatation with the princess “that is the princesse mathilde” he told me “you know who’ i mean the friend of flaubert saintebeuve dumas just fancy she’s the niece of napoleon i she had offers of marriage from napoleon iii and the emperor of russia isn’t that interesting talk to her a little but i hope she won’t keep us standing here for an hour    i met taine the other day” he went on addressing the princess “and he told me that your highness was vexed with him” “he’s behaved like a perfect peeg” she said gruffly pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to joan of arc’s contemporary bishop cauchon “after his article on the emperor i left my card on him with p p c on it” i felt the surprise that one feels on opening the correspondence of that duchesse d’orléans who was by birth a princess palatine and indeed princesse mathilde animated by sentiments so entirely french expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the germany of an older generation and was inherited doubtless from her wuerttemberg mother this somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened as soon as she began to smile with an italian languor and the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically ‘second empire’ that — for all that the princess wore it simply and solely no doubt from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young — she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age i whispered to swann to ask her whether she had known musset “very slightly sir” was the answer given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question and of course it was by way of a joke that she called swann ‘sir’ since they were intimate friends “i had him to dine once i had invited him for seven o’clock at halfpast seven as he had not appeared we sat down to dinner he arrived at eight bowed to me took his seat never opened his lips went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice of course he was dead drunk that hardly encouraged me to make another attempt” we were standing a little way off swann and i “i hope this little audience is not going to last much longer” he muttered “the soles of my feet are hurting i cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation when we get home it will be she that complains of being tired and she knows i simply cannot go on standing like this” for mme swann who had had the news from mme bontemps was in the course of telling the princess that the government having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days’ time when the tsar nicholas was to visit the invalides but the princess who in spite of appearances in spite of the character of her circle which consisted mainly of artists and literary people had remained at heart and shewed herself whenever she had to take action the niece of napoleon replied “yes madame i received it this morning and i sent it back to the minister who must have had it by now i told him that i had no need of an invitation to go to the invalides if the government desires my presence there it will not be on the platform it will be in our vault where the emperor’s tomb is i have no need of a card to admit me there i have my keys i go in and out when i choose the government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not but if i do go to the invalides it will be down below there or nowhere at all” at that moment we were saluted mme swann and i by a young man who greeted her without stopping and whom i was not aware that she knew it was bloch i inquired about him and was told that he had been introduced to her by mme bontemps and that he was employed in the minister’s secretariat which was news to me anyhow she could not have seen him often — or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name hardly ‘smart’ enough for her liking of bloch for she told me that he was called m moreul i assured her that she was mistaken that his name was bloch the princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her while mme swann gazed at it with admiring eyes “it is only a fur that the emperor of russia sent me” she explained “and as i have just been to see him i put it on so as to shew him that i’d managed to have it made up as a mantle” “i hear that prince louis has joined the russian army the princess will be very sad at losing him” went on mme swann not noticing her husband’s signals of distress “that was a fine thing to do as i said to him ‘just because there’s been a soldier before in the family that’s no reason’” replied the princess alluding with this abrupt simplicity to napoleon the great but swann could hold out no longer “ma’am it is i that am going to play the prince and ask your permission to retire but you see my wife has not been so well and i do not like her to stand still for any time” mme swann curtseyed again and the princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile which she seemed to have summoned out of the past from among the graces of her girlhood from the evenings at compiègne a smile which glided sweet and unbroken over her hitherto so sullen face then she went on her way followed by the two ladies in waiting who had confined themselves in the manner of interpreters of children’s or invalids’ nurses to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations “you should go and write your name in her book one day this week” mme swann counselled me “one doesn’t leave cards upon these ‘royalties’ as the english call them but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down”

    sometimes in those last days of winter we would go before proceeding on our expedition into one of the small pictureshows that were being given at that time where swann as a collector of mark was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held and in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the south of france and venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime already well advanced and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the grand canal if the weather were inclement we would go to a concert or a theatre and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms there whenever mme swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table or even the waiters who brought our tea to understand she would say it in english as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone as it happened everyone in the place knew english — i only had not yet learned the language and was obliged to say so to mme swann in order that she might cease to make on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it remarks which i guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word

    once in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre gilberte gave me a great surprise it was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather’s death we were to go she and i with her governess to hear selections from an opera and gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do with the comment that it might be anything in the world no matter what provided that it amused me and had her parents’ approval before luncheon her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day this seemed to me only natural gilberte remained impassive but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal still she uttered not a word when m swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear he called gilberte and they went together into the next room we could hear their raised voices and yet i could not bring myself to believe that gilberte so submissive so loving so thoughtful would resist her father’s appeal on such a day and for so trifling a matter at length swann reappeared with her saying “you heard what i said now you may do as you like”

    gilberte’s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon after which we retired to her room then suddenly without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action “two o’clock” she exclaimed “you know the concert begins at half past” and she told her governess to make haste

    “but” i reminded her “won’t your father be cross with you”

    “not the least little bit”

    “surely he was afraid it would look odd because of the anniversary”

    “what difference can it make to me what people think i think it’s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment we feel things for ourselves not for the public mademoiselle has very few pleasures she’s been looking forward to going to this concert i am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion”

    “but gilberte” i protested taking her by the arm “it is not to satisfy public opinion it is to please your father”

    “you are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct i hope” she said sharply plucking her arm away

      

    a favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the jardin d’acclimatation the swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with bergotte which had been at the root of the attraction that i had found in them when before i had even seen gilberte i reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her for me the most passionately enthralling of friends had not the disdain that i was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me in his company to visit the towns that he loved and lo one day came an invitation from mme swann to a big luncheonparty i did not know who else were to be the guests on my arrival i was disconcerted as i crossed the hall by an alarming incident mme swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season and then failing to find support are speedily abandoned as for instance many years before she had had her ‘private hansom’ or now had printed in english upon a card inviting you to luncheon the words ‘to meet’ followed by the name of some more or less important personage often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation take for instance a minute innovation of those days imported from england odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name charles swann was preceded by ‘mr’ after the first visit that i paid her mme swann had left at my door one of these ‘pasteboards’ as she called them no one had ever left a card on me before i felt at once so much pride emotion gratitude that scraping together all the money i possessed i ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to mme swann i implored my father to go and leave a card on her but first quickly to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix ‘mr’ he vouchsafed neither of my prayers i was in despair for some days and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right but this use of ‘mr’ if it meant nothing was at least intelligible not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheonparty but revealed without any indication of its purport at the moment when i was about to step from the hall into the drawingroom the butler handed me a thin oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed in my surprise i thanked him but i eyed the envelope with misgivings i no more knew what i was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a chinese banquet i noticed that it was gummed down i was afraid of appearing indiscreet were i to open it then and there and so i thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it mme swann had written to me a few days before asking me to come to luncheon with ‘just a few people’ there were however sixteen of us among whom i never suspected for a moment that i was to find bergotte mme swann who had already ‘named’ me as she called it to several of her guests suddenly after my name in the same tone that she had used in uttering it in fact as though we were merely two of the guests at her party who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other pronounced that of the sweet singer with the snowy locks the name bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank but instinctively for appearance’s sake i bowed there straight in front of me as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed in their frock coats in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered my salute was returned by a young common little thickset peering person with a red nose curled like a snailshell and a black tuft on his chin i was cruelly disappointed for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man of whom no vestige now remained there was also the beauty of an immense work which i had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that i had constructed like a temple expressly for itself but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure packed tight with bloodvessels bones muscles sinews of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me all the bergotte whom i had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself drop by drop like a stalactite out of the transparent beauty of his books ceased i could see at once to be of any use the moment i was obliged to include in him the snailshell nose and to utilise the little black beard just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure the nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable and all the more aggravating in that while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of bergotte they seemed further to imply to produce to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind alert and selfsatisfied which was not in the picture for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books so intimately familiar to me which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom starting from them i should never have arrived at that snailshell nose but starting from the nose which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face i must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of bergotte i must arrive it would seem at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say “thanks and you” before you have actually inquired of them how they are or else if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective intelligent and uptodate inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities “same here” names are no doubt but whimsical draughtsmen giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes in place of the imagined the visible world which for that matter is not the true world our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture so little indeed that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined but in bergotte’s case my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work to which i was obliged to attach as to the cord of a balloon the man with the little beard without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground it seemed quite clear however that it really was he who had written the books that i had so greatly enjoyed for mme swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension but swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal while his mind was completely occupied by other more real and more important considerations it was only as at some finished episode in his early life as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the duc de guise which he had worn one season at a fancy dress ball that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books which at once began to fall in my estimation dragging down with them the whole value of beauty of the world of life itself until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard i told myself that he must have taken great pains over them but that if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearloysters he would instead have devoted himself to and would have made a fortune out of the pearling trade his work no longer appeared to me so inevitable and then i asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone or whether all that was not rather makebelieve whether the differences between one man’s book and another’s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities

    meanwhile we had taken our places at the table by the side of my plate i found a carnation the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper it embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall which however i had completely forgotten this custom strange as it was to me became more intelligible when i saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats i did as they had done with the air of spontaneity that a freethinker assumes in church who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees another usage equally strange to me but less ephemeral disquieted me more on the other side of my plate was a smaller plate on which was heaped a blackish substance which i did not then know to be caviare i was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth

    bergotte was sitting not far from me and i could hear quite well everything that he said i understood then the impression that m de norpois had formed of him he had indeed a peculiar ‘organ’ there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying the resonance of one’s diphthongs the energy of one’s labials are profoundly affected — in fact one’s whole way of speaking his seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books but the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise at first sight a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker’s literary style at certain pobts in the conversation when bergotte by force of habit began to talk in a way which no one but m de norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant it was a long time before i discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical at those points i could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean and as human speech reflects the human soul though without expressing it as does literary style bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense intoning certain words and if he were secretly pursuing beneath them a single image stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note with a wearisome monotony so that a pretentious emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying and an effect in his conversation of the same power which in his books produced that harmonious flow of imagery i had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments precisely because it was the authentic utterance of bergotte had not the appearance of being bergotte’s it was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas not included in that ‘bergotte manner’ which so many storytellers had appropriated to themselves and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect — made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass — of the fact that when one read a page of bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who nevertheless in newspapers and in books adorned their prose with so many ‘bergottish’ images and ideas this difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by ‘bergottism’ was first and foremost a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything whence it was extracted by that great writer by virtue of his genius and that this extraction and not simply the perpetration of ‘bergottisms’ was my sweet singer’s aim in writing though it must be added he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself and because he was bergotte so that in one sense every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it but if for that reason each of those beauties was related to all the rest and had a ‘family likeness’ yet each remained separate and individual as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day new and consequently different from what was called the bergotte manner which was a loose synthesis of all the ‘bergottisms’ already invented and set forth by him in writing with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery so it is with all great writers the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen it is creative because it is applied to an external object of which and not of their language or its beauty they are thinking to which they have not yet given expression an author of memorials of our time wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like saintsimon might on occasion give us the first line of his portrait of villars “he was a rather tall man dark    with an alert open expressive physiognomy” but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of saintsimon’s next line which begins with “and to tell the truth a trifle mad” the true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward against all reason from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms whereas the purely formal imitation of variety and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style is but a barren uniformity that is to say the very antithesis of variety and cannot in the work of imitators give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves

    and so — just as bergotte’s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of bergotte whereas it was attached to the mind of bergotte at work and in action by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish — so it was because bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive something overrich disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the ‘eternal torrent of forms’ and of the ‘mystic thrills of beauty’ moreover the quality always rare and new of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail to be quite wrong about it to be speaking in paradox so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own besides as all novelty depends upon the elimination first of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed and which has seemed to us to be reality itself every new conversation as well as all original painting and music must always appear laboured and tedious it is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors and this wearies us and gives us the impression of a want of truth after all the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted but he has long since decided that this must be the real universe and so relies confidently upon it so when bergotte — and his figures appear simple enough today — said of cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle always trying to rise to the surface and of brichot that “to him even more than to mme swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation because in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher” one immediately felt the strain and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete meaning by that more ordinary these unintelligible words issuing from the mask that i had before my eyes it was indeed to the writer whom i admired that they must be attributed and yet they could not have been inserted among his books in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which one day when i was repeating to myself certain phrases that i had heard bergotte use i discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style the different elements of which i was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different

    from a less immediate point of view the special way a little too meticulous too intense that he had of pronouncing certain words certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable as for instance the word visage which he always used in preference to figure and enriched with a number of superfluous v’s and s’s and g’s which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which in his prose he brought those favourite words into the light preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged if he were not to make a false quantity to give to each of them its full value and yet one did not find in the speech of bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books as in those of some other writers often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words this was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which thrown open to others by the act of conversation we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves in this respect there were more intonations there was more accent in his books than in his talk an accent independent of the beauty of style which the author himself has possibly not perceived for it is not separable from his most intimate personality it was this accent which at the moments when in his books bergotte was entirely natural gave a rhythm to the words — often at such times quite insignificant — that he wrote this accent is not marked on the printed page there is nothing there to indicate it and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases one cannot pronounce them in any other way it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer and it is what will bear witness to his true nature what will say whether despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle despite all his sensuality sentimental

    certain peculiarities of elocution faint traces of which were to be found in bergotte’s conversation were not exclusively his own for when later on i came to know his brothers and sisters i found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech there was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance something faint and dying at the end of a sad one swann who had known the master as a boy told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips just as much as on his brothers’ and sisters’ those inflexions almost a family type shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a longdrawn melancholy and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part better than any of them in their symphonies alternately deafening and subdued however characteristic it may be the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker but it was not so with the pronunciation of the bergotte family for if it is difficult ever to understand even in the meistersinger how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds yet bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy or fall drop by drop in melancholy sighs there are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton in which later on i was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic ‘brasses’ of the bergotte family but in his own case from the moment in which he transferred them to his books he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech from the day on which he had begun to write — all the more markedly therefore in the later years in which i first knew him — his voice had lost this orchestration for ever

    these young bergottes — the future writer and his brothers and sisters — were doubtless in no way superior far from it to other young people more refined more intellectual than themselves who found the bergottes rather ‘loud that is to say a trifle vulgar irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone at once pretentious and puerile of their household but genius and even what is only great talent springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing and so transforming them to heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible but one of which the current can cease to illuminate can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat to mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors one must have a motor which instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following is capable of converting its speed into ascending force similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest but those who have had the power ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves to make use of their personality as of a mirror m such a way that their life however unimportant it may be socially and even in a sense intellectually speaking is reflected by it genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected the day on which young bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family more intellectual and more distinguished than himself they in their fine rolls royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the bergottes but he with his modest engine which had at last left the ground he soared above their heads

    but there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family but with certain contemporary writers that he must share younger men who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated when they constructed their sentences in the same way spoke in the same quiescent lingering tone by a reaction from the eloquent easy language of an earlier generation perhaps these young men — we shall come across some of whom this may be said — had never known bergotte but his way of thinking inoculated into them had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind a relation which incidentally requires to be traced thus bergotte if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed whom he imitated unconsciously in his conversation but who himself being less gifted had never written any really outstanding book so that if one had been in quest of originality in speech bergotte must have been labelled a disciple a writer at secondhand whereas influenced by his friend only so far as talk went he had been original and creative in his writings doubtless again so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation too fond as it had been of abstractions of weighty commonplaces when bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book what he would bring into prominence what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image some picture that had no rational significance “ah yes” he would exclaim “it is quite admirable there is a little girl in an orange shawl it is excellent” or again “oh yes there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street yes it is excellent” as for style he was not altogether of his time though he remained quite exclusively of his race abominating tolstoy george eliot ibsen and dostoievsky for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was ‘mild’ “yes you know i like chateaubriand better in atalathan in rené he seems to me to be ‘milder’” he said the word like a doctor who when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion answers “but you know it’s very ‘mild’” and it is true that there was in bergotte’s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought

    he would say also with a shy smile of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration “i think it is more or less true more or less accurate it may be of some value perhaps” but he would say this simply from modesty as a woman to whom one has said that her dress or her daughter is charming replies “it is comfortable” or “she is a good girl” but the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers only many years later when he no longer had any talent whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied so as not to have to suppress it as he ought to have done so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat but to himself this time “after all it is more or less accurate it must be of some value to the country” so that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride and the same words which had served bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest

    a kind of austerity of taste which he had a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was ‘mild’ which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist a chiseller of exquisite trifles was on the contrary the secret of his strength for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man and the author who has more than once been patient to attain in the expression of his thoughts to a certain kind of attractiveness in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent just as if he yields too often to pleasure to laziness to the fear of being put to trouble he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue

    if however despite all the analogies which i was to perceive later on between the writer and the man i had not at first sight in mme swann’s drawingroom believed that this could be bergotte the author of so many divine books who stood before me perhaps i was not altogether wrong for he himself did not in the strict sense of the word ‘believe’ it either he did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people and yet he was not a snob of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself of course he had long since learned from the suffrage of his readers that he had genius compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing he had learned that he had genius but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed shortly in becoming an academician whereas the academy and the faubourg saintgermain have no more to do with that part of the eternal mind which is the author of the works of bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of god that also he knew but as a kleptomaniac knows without profiting by the knowledge that it is wrong to steal and the man with the little beard and snailshell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing he was only halfsuccessful one could hear alternating with the speech of the true bergotte that of the other bergotte ambitious utterly selfish who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful rich or noble friends so as to enhance his own position he who in his books when he was really himself had so well portrayed the charm pure as a mountain spring of poverty

    as for those other vices to which m de norpois had alluded that almost incestuous love which was made still worse people said by a want of delicacy in the matter of money if they contradicted in a shocking manner the tendency of his latest novels in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives those vices did not at all prove supposing that they were fairly imputed to bergotte that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere playacting just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due some to an excess others to an insufficiency of tension of secretion and so forth so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength and of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life a general a literary solution as the great doctors of the church began often without losing their virtue by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity so great artists often while being thoroughly wicked make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all it is the vices or merely the weaknesses and follies of the circle in which they live the meaningless conversation the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters the infidelity of their wives or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books without however thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households and this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in bergotte’s time because on the one hand in proportion as society grew more corrupt our notions of morality were increasingly exalted while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom i had so greatly admired at combray sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon — a brazenfaced denial of — the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of bergotte an intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness then a stranger would cite some instance touching since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden of his real depth of feeling he had behaved cruelly to his wife but in a village inn where he had gone to spend the night he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord so that he should not turn the poor creature out but see that she got proper attention perhaps the more the great writer was developed in bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives but at the same time because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own whenever he was obliged for any reason to talk to some person who had been unfortunate that is to say in a casual encounter he would in doing so take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another’s grief with the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude

    above all he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and like a miniature set in the floor of a casket the composing and painting of them in words for a trifle that some one had sent him if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude while shewing none whatever for an expensive present and if he had had to plead before a tribunal he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived

    that first day on which i met him with gilberte’s parents i mentioned to bergotte that i had recently been to hear berma in phèdre and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder — one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause — she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which quite possibly she had never even seen a hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at olympia and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the erechtheum

    “it may be sheer divination and yet i fancy that she visits the museums it would be interesting to ‘establish’ that” ‘establish’ was one of those regular bergotte expressions and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion

    “do you mean the cariatides” asked swann

    “no no” said bergotte “except in the scene where she confesses her passion to oenone where she moves her hand exactly like hegeso on the stele in the ceramic it is a far more primitive art that she revives i was referring to the korai of the old erechtheum and i admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of racine but there are so many things already in phèdre    that one more    oh and then yes she is really charming that little sixth century phaedra the rigidity of the arm the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble’ yes you know it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that there is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling ‘antique’ this year”

    as bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in berma’s acting i tried to picture her again in my mind as she had looked in that scene in which i remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder and i said to myself “there we have the hesperid of olympia there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the acropolis there is indeed nobility in art” but if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of berma’s gesture bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance then while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality i might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture but of berma in that scene all that i retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without at this point mme swann joined in the conversation asking me whether gilberte had remembered to give me what bergotte had written aboutphèdre and adding “my daughter is such a scatterbrain” bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages of no importance “but it is perfectly charming that little pamphlet that little ‘tract’ of yours” mme swann assured him to shew that she was a good hostess to make the rest of us think that she had read bergotte’s essay and also because she liked not merely to flatter bergotte but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote to control his writing and it must be admitted that she did inspire him though not in the way that she supposed but when all is said there is between what constituted the smartness of mme swann’s drawingroom and a whole side of bergotte’s work so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men today as a commentary upon the other

    i let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been often bergotte disagreed but he allowed me to go on talking i told him that i had liked the green light which was turned on when phaedra raised her arm “ah the designer will be glad to hear that he is a real artist i shall tell him you liked it because he is very proud of that effect i must say myself that i do not care for it very much it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour little phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium you will tell me of course that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play that is quite true all the same it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the court of neptune oh yes of course i know the vengeance of neptune does come into the play i don’t suggest for a moment that we should think only of portroyal but after all the story that racine tells us is not the ‘loves of the seaurchins’ still it is what my friend wished to have and it is very well done right or wrong and it’s really quite pretty when you come to look at it yes so you liked that did you you understood what it meant of course we feel the same about it don’t we really it is a trifle unbalanced what he’s done you agree with me but on the whole it is very clever of him” and so when bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own he in no way reduced me to silence to the impossibility of framing any reply as m de norpois would have done this does not prove that bergotte’s opinions were of less value than the ambassador’s far from it a powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it being itself a part of the riches of the universal mind it makes its way into grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute slips in among the ideas already there with the help of which gaining a little ground he completes and corrects it so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion it is to ideas which are not properly speaking ideas at all to ideas which founded upon nothing can find no support no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary that he grappling with something which is not there can find no word to say in answer the arguments of m de norpois in the matter of art were unanswerable simply because they were without reality

    since bergotte did not sweep aside my objections i confessed to him that they had won the scorn of m de norpois “but he’s an old parrot” was the answer “he keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you’re a piece of cake or a slice of cuttlefish” “what’s that” asked swann “are you a friend of norpois” “he’s as dull as a wet sunday” interrupted his wife who had great faith in bergotte’s judgment and was no doubt afraid that m de norpois might have spoken ill of her to us “i tried to make him talk after dinner i don’t know if it’s his age or his indigestion but i found him too sticky for words i really thought i should have to ‘dope’ him” “yes isn’t he” bergotte chimed in “you see he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirtfront down and his white waistcoat up” “i think that bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him” came from swann who took the ‘line’ in his own house of a plain sensible man “i quite see that norpois cannot interest you very much but from another point of view” for swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’ “he is quite remarkable quite a remarkable instance of a lover when he was secretary at rome” he went on after making sure that gilberte could not hear him “he had here in paris a mistress with whom he was madly in love and he found time to make the double journey every week so as to see her for a couple of hours she was as it happens a most intelligent woman and is quite attractive to this day she is a dowager now and he has had any number of others since then i’m sure i should have gone stark mad if the woman i was in love with lived in paris and i was kept shut up in rome nervous men ought always to love as the lower orders say ‘beneath’ them so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them” as he spoke swann realised that i might be applying this maxim to himself and odette and as even among superior beings at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life their personal pride is still basely human he was seized by a violent illwill towards me but this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance he said nothing more to me at the time not that this need surprise us when racine according to a story the truth of which has been exploded though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in parisian life made an illusion to scarron in front of louis xiv the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening it was on the following day only that he fell

    but as a theory requires to be stated as a whole swann after this momentary irritation and after wiping his eyeglass finished saying what was in his mind in these words words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning which i had not had the sense to take “the danger of that kind of love however is that the woman’s subjection calms the man’s jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting after a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night to prevent their escaping and that generally ends in trouble”

    i reverted to m de norpois “you must never trust him he has the most wicked tongue” said mme swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that m de norpois had been ‘saying things’ about her especially as swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke as though to stop her before she went too far

    meanwhile gilberte who had been told to go and get ready for our drive stayed to listen to the conversation and hovered between her mother and her father leaning affectionately against his shoulder nothing at first sight could be in greater contrast to mme swann who was dark than this child with her red hair and golden skin but after looking at them both for a moment one saw in gilberte many of the features — for instance the nose cut short with a sharp unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations — the expression the movements of her mother to take an illustration from another form of art she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of mme swann whom the painter to carry out some whim of colouring had posed in a partial disguise dressed to go out to a party in venetian ‘character’ and as not merely was she wearing a fair wig but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which stripped of its veil of brownness seemed more naked covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun this ‘makeup’ was not just superficial but was incarnate in her gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise this reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had when gilberte was being created to solve the problem of how to reconstruct mme swann piecemeal without any material at her disposal save the skin of m swann and nature had utilised this to perfection like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain the knots of his wood in evidence on gilberte’s face at the corner of a perfect reproduction of odette’s nose the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of m swann it was a new variety ot mme swann that was thus obtained growing there by her side like a white lilactree beside a purple at the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed now and then when gilberte smiled one could distinguish the oval of her father’s cheek upon her mother’s face as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend this oval grew distinct as an embryo grows into a living shape it lengthened obliquely expanded and a moment later had disappeared in gilberte’s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said “keep it to remind yourself of our friendship” but were one to put a question to gilberte to ask her what she had been doing then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment the uncertainty the prevarication the misery that odette used in the old days to shew when swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which in those days drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation as an incurious and prudent husband often in the champselysées i was disturbed by seeing this look on gilberte’s face but as a rule my fears were unfounded for in her a purely physical survival of her mother this look if nothing else had ceased to have any meaning it was when she had been to her classes when she must go home for some lesson that gilberte’s pupils executed that movement which in time past in the eyes of odette had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had during the day opened the door to one of her lovers or was — at that moment in a hurry to be at some trystingplace so one could see the two natures of m and mme swann ebb and flow encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this mélusine

    it is of course common knowledge that a child takes after both itsfather and its mother and yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it indeed the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance of two sisters one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother the other abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar her mother’s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence with the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents it is true that gilberte was an only child but there were at the least two gilbertes the two natures her father’s and her mother’s did more than just blend themselves in her they disputed the possession of her — and yet one cannot exactly say that which would let it be thought that a third gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others whereas gilberte was alternately one and the other and at any given moment no more than one of the two that is to say incapable when she was not being good of suffering accordingly the better gilberte not being able at the time on account of her momentary absence to detect the other’s lapse from virtue and so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind when the other spoke to you from the heart of her father she held broad views you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise you told her so but just as your arrangements were being completed her mother’s heart would already have resumed its control hers was the voice that answered and you were disappointed and vexed — almost baffled as in the face of a substitution of one person for another — by an unworthy thought an insincere laugh in which gilberte saw no harm for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was indeed the disparity was at times so great between these two gilbertes that you asked yourself though without finding an answer what on earth you could have said or done to her last time to find her now so different when she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere not only did she fail to appear and offer no excuse afterwards but whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of themenaechmi you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you had she not shewn signs of an illhumour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation

    “now then run along and get ready you’re keeping us waiting” her mother reminded her

    “i’m so happy here with my little papa i want to stay just for a minute” replied gilberte burying her head beneath the arm of her father who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair

    swann was one of those men who having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude any tenderness towards their benefactors but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which being incarnate in their own name will enable them to remain in the world after their death when there should no longer be any charles swann there would still be a mlle swann or a mme somethingelse néeswann who would continue to love the vanished father indeed to love him too well perhaps swann may have been thinking for he acknowledged gilberte’s caress with a “good girl” in that tone made tender by our apprehension to which when we think of the future we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us to conceal his emotion he joined in our talk about berma he pointed out to me but in a detached a listless tone as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying with what intelligence with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to oenone “you knew it” he was right that intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring berma but it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me her intonation was so ingenious so definite in intention and in its meaning that it seemed to exist by itself so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it it was a fine idea but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally it remained to berma’s credit that she had discovered it but is one entitled to use the word ‘discover’ when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it something that does not belong essentially to one’s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it

    “upon my soul your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation” swann observed to me as though to excuse himself to bergotte for he had formed the habit in the guermantes set of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like play the games or in the country indulge in whatever form of sport they please “it seems to me that we’re talking a great deal of art” he went on “but it’s so nice i do love it” said mme swann throwing me a look of gratitude as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation after this it was to others of the party and principally to gilberte that bergotte addressed himself i had told him everything that i felt with a freedom which had astonished me and was due to the fact that having acquired with him years before in the course of all those hours of solitary reading in which he was to me merely the better part of myself the habit of sincerity of frankness of confidence i was less frightened by him than by a person with whom i should have been talking for the first time and yet for the same reason i was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that i must have been making on him the contempt that i had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which i had begun to read his books in our garden at combray and yet i ought perhaps to have reminded myself that since it was in all sincerity abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts that i had felt on the one hand so intensely in sympathy with the work of bergotte and on the other hand in the theatre a disappointment the reason of which i did not know those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another but must be obedient to the same laws and that that mind of bergotte which i had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it for my intelligence must be a uniform thing perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence in which everyone in the world participates towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes as in a theatre where if everyone has his own separate seat there is on the other hand but a single stage of course the ideas which i was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths bergotte usually sounded in his books but if it were one and the same intelligence which we had he and i at our disposal he must when he heard me express those ideas be reminded of them cherish them smile upon them keeping probably in spite of what i supposed before his mind’s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books an excerpt upon which i had based my imagination of his whole mental universe just as priests having the widest experience of the human heart are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit so genius having the widest experience of the human intelligence can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings i ought to have told myself all this though for that matter it was none too consoling a thought for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer which one finds expressed failing a more intimate association in his books than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving i ought to have told myself all this but i did not i was convinced that i had appeared a fool to bergotte when gilberte whispered in my ear

    “you can’t think how delighted i am because you have made a conquest of my great friend bergotte he’s been telling mamma that he found you extremely intelligent”

    “where are we going” i asked her “oh wherever you like you know it’s all the same to me” but since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather’s death i had begun to ask myself whether gilberte’s character was not other than i had supposed whether that indifference to what was to be done that wisdom that calm that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her selfesteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated as bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents we left the house together in the carriage he spoke to me of my health “our friends were telling me that you had been ill i am very sorry and yet after all i am not too sorry because i can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind and they are probably what mean most to you as to everyone who has known them”

    alas what he was saying how little i felt did it apply to myself whom all reasoning however exalted it might be left cold who was happy only in moments of pure idleness when i was comfortable and well i felt how purely material was everything that i desired in life and how easily i could dispense with the intellect as i made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources of varying depth and permanence i was thinking when the moment came to answer him that i should have liked an existence in which i was on intimate terms with the duchesse de guermantes and often came across as in the old tollhouse in the champselysées a chilly smell that would remind me of combray but in this ideal existence which i dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place

    “no sir the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me it is not them that i seek after indeed i don’t even know that i have ever tasted them”

    “you really think not” he replied “well it may be no wait a minute now yes after all that must be what you like best i can see it now clearly i am certain of it”

    as certainly he did not succeed in convincing me and yet i was already feeling happier less restricted after what m de norpois had said to me i had regarded my moments of dreaming of enthusiasm of selfconfidence as purely subjective and barren of truth but according to bergotte who appeared to understand my case it seemed that it was quite the contrary that the symptom i ought to disregard was in fact my doubts my disgust with myself moreover what he had said about m de norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which i had supposed that no appeal was possible

    “are you being properly looked after” bergotte asked me “who is treating you” i told him that i had seen and should probably go on seeing cottard “but that’s not at all the sort of man you want” he told me “i know nothing about him as a doctor but i’ve met him at mme swann’s the man’s an imbecile even supposing that that doesn’t prevent his being a good doctor which i hesitate to believe it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists for men of intelligence people like you must have suitable doctors i would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves cottard will bore you and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect besides the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any tom dick or harry nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect they need at least a doctor who understands their disease how do you expect that cottard should be able to treat you he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces for gastric trouble but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading shakespeare so that his calculations are inaccurate in your case the balance is upset you see always the little bottleimp bobbing up again he will find that you have a dilated stomach he has no need to examine you for it since he has it already in his eye you can see it there reflected in his glasses” this manner of speaking tired me greatly i said to myself with the stupidity of common sense “there is no more any dilated stomach reflected in professor cottard’s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of m de norpois” “i should recommend you instead” went on bergotte “to consult dr du boulbon who is quite an intelligent man” “he is a great admirer of your books” i replied i saw that bergotte knew this and i decided that kindred spirits soon come together that one has few really ‘unknown friends’ what bergotte had said to me with respect to cottard impressed me while running contrary to everything that i myself believed i was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore i expected of him that thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle after consultation of my entrails and i did not at all require that with the aid of an intellect in which i easily outstripped him he should seek to understand my intellect which i pictured to myself merely as a means of no importance in itself of trying to attain to certain external verities i doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles and i was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind “i’ll tell you who does need a good doctor and that is our friend swann” said bergotte and on my asking whether he was ill “well don’t you see he’s typical of the man who has married a whore and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day from women who refuse to meet his wife or men who were there before him you can see them in his mouth writhing just look any day you’re there at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in to see who’s in the room” the malice with which bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which in that house he had constantly been adopting to speak to them certainly a person like my greataunt for instance would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which i had heard bergotte lavishing upon swann even to the people whom she liked she enjoyed saying disagreeable things but behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened there was nothing less like the social ‘world’ than our society at combray the swanns’ house marked a stage on the way towards it towards its inconstant tide if they had not yet reached the open sea they were certainly in the lagoon “this is all between ourselves” said bergotte as he left me outside my own door a few years later i should have answered “i never repeat things” that is the ritual phrase of society from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance it is what i should have said then and there to bergotte for one does not invent all one’s speeches especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack but i did not yet know the formula what my greataunt on the other hand would have said on a similar occasion was “if you don’t wish it to be repeated why do you say it” that is the answer of the unsociable of the quarrelsome i was nothing of that sort i bowed my head in silence

    men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study whereas i i had now been installed among the friends of the great writer at the first attempt and without any effort like a man who instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre is shewn in at once to the best having entered by a door that is closed to the public if swann had thus opened such a door to me it was doubtless because just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children’s friends into the royal box or on board the royal yacht so gilberte’s parents received their daughter’s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there but at that time i thought and perhaps was right in thinking that this friendliness on swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents i seemed to remember having heard once at combray that he had suggested to them that in view of my admiration for bergotte he should take me to dine with him and that my parents had declined saying that i was too young and too easily excited to ‘go out’ yet my parents no doubt represented to certain other people precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous something quite different from what they were to me so that just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy i should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present i had just received and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous swann who had offered it to me or to them rather without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is in luini’s fresco the charming mage with the arched nose and fair hair to whom it appeared swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance

    unfortunately this favour that swann had done me which as i entered the house before i had even taken off my greatcoat i reported to my parents in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the swanns did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them “swann introduced you to bergotte an excellent friend for you charming society” cried my father ironically “it only wanted that” alas when i had gone on to say that bergotte was by no means inclined to admire m de norpois

    “i dare say” retorted my father “that simply proves that he’s a foolish and evilminded fellow my poor boy you never had much common sense still i’m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether”

    already the mere fact of my frequenting the swanns had been far from delighting my parents this introduction to bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake namely their own weakness in controlling me which my grandfather would have called a ‘want of circumspection’ i felt that i had only in order to complete their ill humour to tell them that this perverse fellow who did not appreciate m de norpois had found me extremely intelligent for i had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone one of my school friends for instance was going astray — as i was at that moment — if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment the evil merely seemed to him more pronounced i could hear him already exclaiming “of course it all hangs together” an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten but since were i not to tell them what bergotte had said of me even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed that this should be made slightly worse mattered little besides they seemed to me so unfair so completely mistaken that not only had i not any hope i had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view at the same time feeling as the words came from my lips how alarmed they would be by the thought that i had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people praise from whom since it seemed to me a thing to be desired would only encourage me in wrongdoing it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that coming to the end of my story i flung them the bouquet of “he told the swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent” just as a poisoned dog in a field rushes without knowing why straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed so i without in the least suspecting it had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to bergotte a prejudice which all the best reasons that i could have urged all the tributes that i could have paid him must have proved powerless to defeat instantly the situation changed

    “oh he said that he found you intelligent” repeated my mother “i am glad to hear that because he is a man of talent”

    “what he said that did he” my father joined in “i don’t for a moment deny his literary distinction before which the whole world bows only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old norpois made a guarded allusion when he was here” he went on not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which i had just repeated the depravity of bergotte’s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment

    but my dear” mamma interrupted “we’ve no proof that it’s true people say all sorts of things besides m de norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world but he’s not always very goodnatured especially about people who are not exactly his sort”

    “that’s quite true i’ve noticed it myself” my father admitted

    “and then too a great deal ought to be forgiven bergotte since he thinks well of my little son” mamma went on stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze

    my mother had not indeed awaited this verdict from bergotte before telling me that i might ask gilberte to tea whenever i had friends coming but i dared not do so for two reasons the first was that at gilberte’s there was never anything else to drink but tea whereas at home mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well i was afraid that gilberte might regard this as ‘common’ and so conceive a great contempt for us the other reason was a formal difficulty a question of procedure which i could never succeed in settling when i arrived at mme swann’s she used to ask me “and how is your mother” i had made several overtures to mamma to find out whether she would do the same when gilberte came to us a point which seemed to me more serious than at the court of louis xiv the use of ‘monseigneur’ but mamma would not hear of it for a moment

    “certainly not i do not know mme swann”

    “but neither does she know you”

    “i never said she did but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything i shall find other ways of being civil to gilberte than mme swann has with you”

    but i was unconvinced and preferred not to invite gilberte

    leaving my parents i went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the swanns’ butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawingroom i was now alone i opened it inside was a card on which i was told the name of the lady whom i ought to have ‘taken in’ to luncheon

    it was about this period that bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness which for that matter were to change later on into possibilities of suffering by assuring me that in contradiction of all that i had believed at the time of my walks along the méséglise way women never asked for anything better than to make love he added to this service a second the value of which i was not to appreciate until much later it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house he had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy but i could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features so that if i owed to bloch — for his ‘good tidings’ that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time — a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil the houses of assignation which i began to frequent some years later — by furnishing me with specimens of beauty by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties that present indeed divine the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect and which we can seek from reality alone an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of mantegna of wagner of siena by studying other painters hearing other composers visiting other cities namely illustrated editions of the history of painting symphonic concerts and handbooks to ‘mediaeval towns’ but the house to which bloch led me and which he himself for that matter had long ceased to visit was of too humble a grade its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities the mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate and was always suggesting others whom one did not want she boasted to me of one in particular one of whom with a smile full of promise as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat she would whisper “she is a jewess doesn’t that make you want to” that by the way was probably why the girl’s name was rachel and with a silly and affected excitement which she hoped would prove contagious and which ended in a hoarse gurgle almost of sensual satisfaction “think of that my boy a jewess wouldn’t that be lovely rrrr” this rachel of whom i caught a glimpse without her seeing me was dark and not good looking but had an air of intelligence and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled with a look of boundless impertinence at the ‘boys’ who were introduced to her and whom i could hear making conversation her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair irregular as though they were outlined in penstrokes upon a washdrawing in indian ink every evening i promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence boasting of her superior intelligence and her education that i would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of rachel whom i had nicknamed “rachel when from the lord” but the first evening i had heard her as she was leaving the house say to the mistress “that’s settled then i shall be free tomorrow if you have anyone you won’t forget to send for me”

    and these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit common to all of them was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned she would simply vary her formula saying indifferently “if you want me” or “if you want anybody”

    the mistress who was not familiar with halévy’s opera did not know why i always called the girl “rachel when from the lord” but failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing and it was always with a wholehearted laugh that she would say to me

    “then there’s nothing doing tonight when am i going to fix you up with ‘rachel when from the lord’ why do you always say that ‘rachel when from the lord’ oh that’s very smart that is i’m going to make a match of you two you won’t be sorry for it you’ll see”

    once i was just making up my mind but she was ‘in the press’ another time in the hands of the hairdresser an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it and i grew tired of waiting even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place working girls they called themselves but they always seemed to be out of work had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which despite the gravity of the subjects discussed the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity i ceased moreover to go to this house because anxious to present a token of my goodwill to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture i had given her several pieces notably a big sofa which i had inherited from my aunt léonie i used never to see them for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home and they were stored in a warehouse but as soon as i discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt’s room at combray became apparent to me tortured by the cruel contact to which i had abandoned them in their helplessness had i outraged the dead i should not have suffered such remorse i returned no more to visit their new mistress for they seemed to me to be alive and to be appealing to me like those objects apparently inanimate in a persian fairytale in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance besides as our memory presents things to us as a rule not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed i remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that many years before i had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins with whom i had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt léonie had left her room

    a whole lot more of my aunt léonie’s things and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate i sold in spite of my parents’ warnings so as to have more money to spend and to be able to send more flowers to mme swann who would greet me after receiving an immense basket of orchids with “if i were your father i should have you up before the magistrate for this” how was i to suppose that one day i might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all of bestowing favours upon gilberte’s parents similarly it was with gilberte in my mind and so as not to be separated from her that i had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad it is always thus impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last that we make our irrevocable decisions i could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in gilberte and from her permeated her parents and her home leaving me indifferent to all things else could be liberated from her could migrate into another person the same substance unquestionable and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me for a single malady goes through various evolutions and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when with the passing of the years the heart’s power of resistance has diminished

    my parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement when i still did not know the swanns i thought that i was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which i was thrown by the impossibility of seeing gilberte when i chose but now that their door stood open to me scarcely had i sat down at my desk than i would rise and run to them and after i had left them and was at home again my isolation was only apparent my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which i had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end sitting alone i continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the swanns and to make this pastime more entertaining i myself took the parts of those absent players i put to myself imagined questions so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them though conducted in silence this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation my solitude a mental society in which it was not i myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words and in which i felt as i formulated in place of the thoughts that i believed to be true those that came easily to my mind and involved no introspection from without that kind of pleasure entirely passive which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion

    had i been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work i should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once but since my resolution was explicit since within twentyfour hours in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because i myself had not yet entered it my good intentions would be realised without difficulty it was better not to select an evening on which i was illdisposed for a beginning for which the following days were not alas to shew themselves any more propitious but i was reasonable it would have been puerile on the part of one who had waited now for years not to put up with a postponement of two or three days confident that by the day after next i should have written several pages i said not a word more to my parents of my decision i preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way unfortunately the morrow was not that vast external day to which i in my fever had looked forward when it drew to a close my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twentyfour hours longer and at the end of several days my plans not having matured i had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once no longer the courage therefore to subordinate everything else to their realisation i began again to keep late hours having no longer to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning i needed before i could recover my creative energy several days of relaxation and the only time that my grandmother ventured in a gentle and disillusioned tone to frame the reproach “well and that work of yours aren’t we even to speak of it now” i resented her intrusion convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves since until i had recovered from that shock i should not feel inclined to begin my work she felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention she apologised kissing me “i am sorry i shall not say anything again” and so that i should not be discouraged assured me that from the day on which i should be quite well again the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength

    besides i said to myself in spending all my time with the swanns am i not doing exactly what bergotte does to my parents it seemed almost as though idle as i was i was leading since it was spent in the same drawingroom with a great writer the life most favourable to the growth of talent and yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself from within himself and can acquire it from some one else is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses merely by dining out often in the company of a physician the person by the way who was most completely taken in by this illusion which misled me as well as my parents was mme swann when i explained to her that i was unable to come that i must stay at home and work she looked as though she were thinking that i made a great fuss about nothing that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what i had said

    “but bergotte is coming isn’t he do you mean that you don’t think it good what he writes it will be better still very soon” she went on “for he is more pointed he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books where he is apt to spread out too much i’ve arranged that in future he’s to do the leading articles in the figaro he’ll be distinctly the ‘right man in the right place’ there” and finally “come he will tell you better than anyone what you ought to do”

    and so just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel it was in the interests of my career and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of ‘getting to know” people that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day to meet bergotte

    and so there was not from the swanns any more than from my parents that is to say from those who at different times had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which i might see gilberte as often as i chose with enjoyment if not with peace of mind there can be no peace of mind in love since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh startingpoint for further desires so long as i had not been free to go to her having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness i could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there once the resistance of her parents was broken and the problem solved at last it began to set itself anew and always in different terms each evening on arriving home i reminded myself that i had things to say to gilberte of prime importance things upon which our whole friendship hung and these things were never the same but at least i was happy and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness one was to appear alas from a quarter in which i had never detected any peril namely from gilberte and myself and yet i ought to have been tormented by what on the contrary reassured me by what i mistook for happiness we are when we love in an abnormal state capable of giving at once to an accident the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur a seriousaspect which that accident by itself would not bear what makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced actually there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises makes conditional only procrastinates but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking sheer agony

    on several occasions i felt that gilberte was anxious to put off my visits it is true that when i was at all anxious to see her i had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her “thanks to them” i used to think “my love is running no risk the moment i have them on my side i can set my mind at rest they have full authority over gilberte” until alas i detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house almost against her will and asked myself whether what i had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure

    the last time that i called to see gilberte it was raining she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her in view of the dampness of the air i had taken rather more caffeine than usual perhaps on account of the weather or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given mme swann as her daughter was leaving the room called her back in the sharpest of tones “gilberte” and pointed to me to indicate that i had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me this ‘gilberte’ had been uttered or shouted rather with the best of intentions towards myself but from the way in which gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes i divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest which was gradually drawing away from me my friend “you don’t need to go out dancing every day” odette told her daughter with a sagacity acquired no doubt in earlier days from swann then becoming once more odette she began speaking to her daughter in english at once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of gilberte as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away in a language that we know we have substituted for the opacity of sounds the perspicuity of ideas but a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false while we standing without desperately alert in our impotence can see can prevent nothing so this conversation in english at which a month earlier i should merely have smiled interspersed with a few proper names in french which did not fail to accentuate to give a point to my uneasiness had when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons the same degree of cruelty left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion at length mme swann left us that day perhaps from resentment against myself the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself perhaps also because guessing her to be angry with me i was precautionally colder than usual with her the face of gilberte divested of every sign of joy bleak bare pillaged seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pasdequatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part and to be defying every living creature beginning with myself to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston she confined herself to exchanging with me now and again on the weather the increasing violence of the rain the fastness of the clock a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables in which i lashed myself on with a sort of desperate rage to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness and on each of our remarks was stamped as it were a supreme harshness by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance which at the same time consoled me for it prevented gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone in vain was my polite “i thought the other day that the clock was slow if anything” she evidently understood me to mean “how tiresome you are being” obstinately as i might protract over the whole length of that rainsodden afternoon the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone i knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as i pretended and that gilberte must be fully aware that if after already saying it to her three times i had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in i should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears when she was like that when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face i cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features her face grown almost livid reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea ebbing far out wearies one with its faint shimmering everywhere the same fixed in an immutable and low horizon at length as i saw no sign in gilberte of the happy change for which i had been waiting now for some hours i told her that she was not being nice “it is you that are not being nice” was her answer “oh but surely ——” i asked myself what i could have done and finding no answer put the question to her “naturally you think yourself nice” she said to me with a laugh and went on laughing whereupon i felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other less perceptible plane of her mind which her laughter indicated it seemed that laughter to mean “no no i’m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say i know you’re madly in love with me but that leaves me neither hot nor cold for i don’t care a rap for you” but i told myself that after all laughter was not a language so well defined that i could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant and gilberte’s words were affectionate “but how am i not being nice” i asked her “tell me i will do anything you want” “no that wouldn’t be any good i can’t explain” for a moment i was afraid that she thought that i did not love her and this was for me a fresh agony no less keen but one that required treatment by a different conversational method “if you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me” but this pain which had she doubted my love for her must have rejoiced her seemed instead to make her more angry then realising my mistake making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said letting her without bothering to believe her assure me “i do love you indeed i do you will see one day” that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear and which for some mysterious reason never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken i had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me

    grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter even when it is interpolated among preoccupations occupations pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it but when such a grief has its birth — as was now happening — at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else the sharp depression that then affects our spirits sunny hitherto sustained and calm lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end the tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that i made my way home baffled battered feeling that i could recover my breath only by retracing my steps by returning upon whatever pretext into gilberte’s presence but she would have said to herself “back again evidently i can go to any length with him he will come back every time and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he’ll be” besides i was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought and those alternative orientations that mad careering between them of the compassneedle within me persisted after i had reached home and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to gilberte which i began to draft

    i was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life and which for all that there has been no change in our character in our nature that nature which itself creates our loves and almost creates the women whom we love even to their faults we do not face in the same way on each occasion that is to say at every age at such moments our life is divided and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all in one there is our desire not to displease not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard so that she shall not have that sense of her own indispensability which may turn her from us in the other scale there is a feeling of pain — and one that is not localised and partial only — which cannot be set at rest unless abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her we go at once to find her when we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the willpower which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow then instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at oneandtwenty it is the other grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced that crushes us down at fifty all the more because situations while repeating themselves tend to alter and there is every likelihood that in middle life or in old age we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence repressed by other demands upon it less master of itself has never known

    i had just written gilberte a letter in which i allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation a moment later the wind having changed they were phrases full of love that i addressed to her chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions those ‘nevermores’ so touching to those who pen them so wearisome to her who will have to read them whether she believe them to be false and translate ‘nevermore’ by ‘this very evening if you want me’ or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love but since we are incapable while we are in love of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become and who will then be in love no longer how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow the same speeches that she would make if she loved us when we come to examine the thoughts the actions of a woman whom we love we are as completely at a loss as must have been face to face with the phenomena of nature the world’s first natural philosophers before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown or worse still we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists a person who would be incapable therefore of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream of course i made efforts to emerge from this incoherence to find reasons for things i tried even to be ‘objective’ and to that end to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which gilberte had in my eyes and that not only which i had in hers but which she herself had in the eyes of other people a disproportion which had i failed to remark it would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend’s part for a passionate avowal and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face but i was afraid also of falling into the contrary error in which i should have seen in gilberte’s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility i tried to discover between these two perspectives equally distorting a third which would enable me to see things as they really were the calculations i was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because i had made them give me the answer that i desired i made up my mind that next day i would go to the swanns’ happy but happy in the same way as people who having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes and since while one is hesitating the bare idea of a possible resolution unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution develops like a seed in the ground the lineaments every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action i told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that i should not see gilberte again as if i had really been about to put that suggestion into practice and that since on the contrary i was to end by returning to her side i might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances but this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the swanns’ not because their butler who was really fond of me told me that gilberte had gone out a statement the truth of which was confirmed as it happened the same evening by people who had seen her somewhere but because of the manner in which he said it “sir the young lady is not at home i can assure you sir that i am speaking the truth if you wish to make any inquiries i can fetch the young lady’s maid you know very well sir that i would do everything in my power to oblige you and that if the young lady was at home i would take you to her at once” these words being of the only kind that is really important that is to say spontaneous the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points at any rate of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech proved that in gilberte’s household there was an impression that i bothered her with my visits and so scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which i preferred to make him rather than gilberte the victim he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that i might have had for my friend freed from these complications thanks to his words my love subsisted alone but his words had at the same time shewn me that i must cease for the present to attempt to see gilberte she would be certain to write to me to apologise in spite of which i should not return at once to see her so as to prove to her that i was capable of living without her besides once i had received her letter gilberte’s society was a thing with which i should be more easily able to dispense for a time since i should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever i chose all that i needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered whether she had not promised herself to another left paris been taken away by force the days that followed resembled the first week of that old new year which i had had to spend alone without gilberte but when that week had dragged to its end then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the champselysées i should be seeing her as before i had been sure of that for another thing i had known with no less certainty that so long as the new year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the champselysées which meant that during that miserable week which was already ancient history i had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope now on the other hand it was the latter of these which almost as much as my fear of what might happen rendered intolerable the burden of my grief not having had any letter from gilberte that evening i had attributed this to her carelessness to her other occupations i did not doubt that i should find something from her in the morning’s post this i awaited every day with a beating heart which subsided leaving me utterly prostrate when i had found in it only letters from people who were not gilberte or else nothing at all which was no worse the proofs of another’s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference i transferred my hopes to the afternoon post even between the times at which letters were delivered i dared not leave the house for she might be sending hers by a messenger then the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the swanns’ could possibly appear that night i must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest and thus because i believed that my sufferings were not destined to last i was obliged so to speak incessantly to renew them my disappointment was perhaps the same but instead of just uniformly prolonging as in the old days an initial emotion it began again several times daily starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended — it so purely physical so instantaneous a state — by becoming stabilised so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened there was no longer a single minute in the day in which i was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour so my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those new year holidays long ago because this time there was in me instead of the acceptance pure and simple of that punishment the hope at every moment of seeing it come to an end and yet at this state of acceptance i ultimately arrived then i understood that it must be final and i renounced gilberte for ever in the interests of my love itself and because i hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me indeed from that moment so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover’s spite on my part when she made appointments for me to see her i used often to accept them and then at the last moment write to her that i was prevented from coming but with the same protestations of my disappointment that i should have made to anyone whom i had not wished to see these expressions of regret which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter would do more i imagined to persuade gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love when better than by mere words by a course of action indefinitely repeated i should have proved to her that i had no appetite for seeing her perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me alas i was doomed to failure to attempt by ceasing to see her to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever first of all because when it began to revive if i wished it to last i must not give way to it at once besides the most agonising hours would then have passed it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me and i should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage by the act of seeing me again would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer what a moment ago it would still have been nor the thought of putting an end to it a motive towards surrender reconciliation further meetings and then again later on when i should at last be able safely to confess to gilberte so far would her liking for me have regained its strength my liking for her the latter not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation would have ceased to exist gilberte would have become immaterial to me i knew this but i could not explain it to her she would have assumed that if i was pretending that i should cease to love her if i remained for too long without seeing her that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once in the meantime what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her whenever i knew beforehand that gilberte would not be in the house was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner i went to see mme swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when i had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and on days when the latter was not coming to the champselysées used to repair to the allée des acacias in this way i should be hearing about gilberte and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me and in terms which would shew her that i was not interested in her and i found as all those who suffer find that my melancholy condition might have been worse for being free at any time to enter the habitation in which gilberte dwelt i constantly reminded myself for all that i was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease i was not unhappy save only from day to day and even that is an exaggeration how many times in an hour but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel before i had gone again to the swanns’ did i not repeat to myself the words of the letter which one day soon gilberte would surely send would perhaps even bring to me herself the perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness with women who do not love us as with the ‘missing’ the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news we live on tenterhooks starting at the slightest sound the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment long after the fact of his having perished has been established striding into the room saved by a miracle and in the best of health and this strain of waiting according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs either helps her on her journey through the years at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more to forget gradually and to survive his loss or else it kills her

    on the other hand my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it each visit that i paid to mme swann without seeing gilberte was a cruel punishment but i felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that gilberte had of me

    besides if i always took care before going to see mme swann that there should be no risk of her daughter’s appearing that arose it is true from my determination to break with her but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her very few of such intentions are absolute at least in a continuous form in this human soul of ours one of whose laws confirmed by the unlookedfor wealth of illustration that memory supplies is intermittence and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel as for that hope i saw clearly how far it was chimerical i was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that at any moment a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune we are all of us obliged if we are to make reality endurable to nurse a few little follies in ourselves now my hope remained more intact — while at the same time our separation became more effectual — if i refrained from meeting gilberte if i had found myself face to face with her in her mother’s drawingroom we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final killed my hope and on the other hand by creating a fresh anxiety reawakened my love and made resignation harder

    ever so long ago before i had even thought of breaking with her daughter mme swann had said to me “it is all very well your coming to see gilberte i should like you to come sometimes for my sake not to my ‘kettledrums’ which would bore you because there is such a crowd but on the other days when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late” so that i might be thought when i came to see her to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past and very late in the afternoon when it was quite dark almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner i would set out to pay mme swann a visit in the course of which i knew that i should not see gilberte and yet should be thinking only of her in that quarter then looked upon as remote of a paris darker than paris is today where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses the lamps of a drawingroom situated on the ground level or but slightly raised above it as were the rooms in which mme swann generally received her visitors were enough to lighten the street and to make the passerby raise his eyes connecting with their glow as with its apparent though hidden cause the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams this passerby was led to believe not without a certain emotion that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause when he saw one of the carriages begin to move but it was merely a coachman who afraid of his horses’ catching cold started them now and again on a brisk walk all the more impressive because the rubbertired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit

    the ‘wintergarden’ of which in those days the passerby generally caught a glimpse in whatever street he might be walking if the drawingroom did not stand too high above the pavement is to be seen today only in photogravures in the giftbooks of p j stahl where in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the louis xvi drawingrooms now in fashion — a single rose or a japanese iris in a longnecked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second — it seems because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration it suggested to one only on a larger scale in the houses of those days those tiny portable hothouses laid out on new year’s morning beneath the lighted lamp — for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight — among all the other new year’s presents but the loveliest of them all consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil and even more than those little houses themselves those wintergardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time portrayed in a delightful book another of their presents and one which for all that it was given not to them but to mlle lili the heroine of the story enchanted them to such a pitch that even now when they are almost old men and women they ask themselves whether in those fortunate years winter was not the loveliest of the seasons and inside there beyond the wintergarden through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children’s playthings pictured or real the passerby drawing himself up on tiptoe would generally observe a man in a frock coat a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole standing before a seated lady both vaguely outlined like two intaglios cut in a topaz in the depths of the drawingroom atmosphere clouted by the samovar — then a recent importation — with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still today but to which if it does we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it mme swann attached great importance to her ‘tea’ she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man “you will find me at home any day fairly late come to tea” so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of english accent and which her listener duly noted bowing solemnly in acceptance as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention there was another reason apart from those given already for the flowers’ having more than a merely ornamental part in mme swann’s drawingroom and this reason pertained not to the period but in some degree to the former life of odette a great courtesan such as she had been lives largely for her lovers that is to say at home which means that she comes in time to live for her home the things that one sees in the house of a ‘respectable’ woman things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan the culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see but that in which she undresses herself for a man she must be as smart in her wrapper in her nightgown as in her outdoor attire other women display their jewels but as for her she lives in the intimacy of her pearls this kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret that is to say which comes near to being disinterested mme swann extended this to include her flowers there was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with parma violets or with long white daisypetals scattered upon the water which seemed to be testifying in the eyes of the arriving guest to some favourite and interrupted occupation such as the cup of tea which mme swann would for her own amusement have been drinking there by herself an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by — and so perhaps what was still in the mind of odette and unlike the book the flowers were living things it was annoying when one entered the room to pay mme swann a visit to discover that she was not alone or if one came home with her not to find the room empty so prominent a place in it enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for odette’s visitors but as it were forgotten there by her had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing the secret of which one tried in vain to read fastening one’s eyes on the moist purple the still liquid watercolour of the parma violets by the end of october odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea which was still known at that time as ‘fiveo’clock tea’ having once heard it said and being fond of repeating that if mme verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour she imagined that she herself had one also of the same kind but freer senza rigore as she used to say she saw herself figuring thus as a sort of lespinasse and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men notably swann himself who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement accordingto a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends ignorant of what had passed though without convincing herself but certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten on days on which mme swann had not left the house one found her in a wrapper of crêpedechine white as the first snows of winter or it might be in one of those long pleated garments of moussettnedesoie which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals and would be regarded today as hardly suitable for winter though quite wrongly for these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman — in the stifling warmth of the drawingrooms of those days with their heavily curtained doors rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were ‘exquisitely cushioned’— the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side despite the winter in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity as though it were already spring by reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat the lady of the house not being apprised of your entry as she is today would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic that charm of a sort of secret discovery which we find today in the memory of those gowns already out of fashion even then which mme swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of henry gréville’s tales odette had at this time in her drawingroom when winter began chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as swann in the old days certainly never saw in her drawingroom in the rue la pérouse my admiration for them — when i went to pay mme swann one of those melancholy visits during which prompted by my sorrow i discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow “your friend came to see me yesterday”— sprang no doubt from my sense that rosepale like the louis xiv silk that covered her chairs snowwhite like her crêpedechine wrapper or of a metallic red like her samovar they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another a supplementary scheme of decoration as rich as delicate in its colouring but one which was alive and would last for a few days only but i was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than one might almost say lasting when i compared them with the tones as pink as coppery which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a november afternoon and which after seeing them before i had entered the house fade from the sky i found again inside prolonged transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling they invited me those chrysanthemums to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that ‘teatime’ the too fleeting joys of november of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory alas it was not in the conversations to which i must listen that i could hope to attain to that glory they had but little in common with it even with mme cottard and although it was growing late mme swann would assume her most caressing manner to say “oh no it’s not late really you mustn’t look at the clock that’s not the right time it’s stopped you can’t possibly have anything else to do now why be in such a hurry” as she pressed a final tartlet upon the professor’s wife who was gripping her cardcase in readiness for flight

    “one simply can’t tear oneself away from this house” observed mme bontemps to mme swann while mme cottard in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words exclaimed “why that’s just what i always say myself what i tell my own little judge in the court of conscience” winning the applause of the gentlemen from the jockey club who had been profuse in their salutations as though confounded at such an honour’s being done them when mme swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman who kept herself when confronted with odette’s brilliant friends in reserve if not on what she herself called ‘the defensive’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings “i should never have suspected it” was mme swann’s comment “three wednesdays running you’ve played me false” “that’s quite true odette it’s simply ages it’s an eternity since i saw you last you see i plead guilty but i must tell you” she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty for although a doctor’s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys” that i have had a lot of little troubles as we all have i dare say and besides that i’ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics i’m sure i’m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies still i’ve been obliged just to make an example you know to give my vatel notice i believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place but his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry my own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer oh we have had some homeric scenes however i held fast to the reins through thick and thin the whole affair’s been a perfect lesson which won’t be lost on me i can tell you i’m afraid i’m boring you with all these stories about servants but you know as well as i do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one’s household

    “aren’t we to see anything of your delicious child” she wound up “no my delicious child is dining with a friend” replied mme swann and then turning to me “i believe she’s written to you asking you to come and see her tomorrow and your babies” she went on to mme cottard i breathed a sigh of relief these words by which mme swann proved to me that i oould see gilberte whenever i chose gave me precisely the comfort which i had come to seek and which at that time made my visits to mme swann so necessary “no i’m afraid not i shall write to her anyhow this evening gilberte and i never seem to see one another now” i added pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency which gave me a further illusion of being in love supported as well by the affectionate way in which i spoke of gilberte and she of me “you know she’s simply devoted to you” said mme swann “really you won’t come tomorrow” suddenly my heart rose on wings the thought had just struck me —“after all why shouldn’t i since it’s her own mother who suggests it” but with the thought i fell back into my old depression i was afraid now lest when she saw me again gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation during these asides mme bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians’ wives for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words and to deplore her husband’s official position “do you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors’ wives like that one after the other” she exclaimed to mme cottard who unlike her was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect “ah you’re a lawabiding woman you see in my case’ at the ministry don’t you know i simply have to keep it up of course it’s too much for me i can tell you you know what those officials’ wives are like it’s all i can do not to put my tongue out at them and my niece albertine is just like me you really wouldn’t believe the impudence that girl has last week on my ‘day’ i had the wife of the under secretary of state for finance who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking ‘but surely ma’am’ my niece chipped in with her most winning smile ‘you ought to know everything about it after all the dishes your father had to wash’” “oh i do love that story i think it’s simply exquisite” cried mme swann “but certainly on the doctor’s consultation days you should make a point of being ‘at home’ among your flowers and books and all your pretty things” she urged mme cottard “straight out like that bang right in the face bang she made no bones about it i can tell you and she’d never said a word to me about it the little wretch she’s as cunning as a monkey you are lucky to be able to control yourself i do envy people who can hide what is in their minds” “but i’ve no need to do that mme bontemps i’m not so hard to please” mme cottard gently expostulated “for one thing i’m not in such a privileged position” she went on slightly raising her voice as was her custom as though she were underlining the point of her remark whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband “and besides i’m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the professor”

    “but my dear it isn’t what one’s glad to do it’s what one is able to do i expect you’re not nervous do you know whenever i see the war minister’s wife making faces i start copying her at once it’s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine”

    “to be sure yes” said mme cottard “i’ve heard people say that she had a twitch my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position and it’s only natural when gentlemen get talking together    ”

    “and then don’t you know it’s just the same with the chief of the registry he’s a hunchback whenever he comes to see me before he’s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump my husband says i’ll cost him his place what if i do a fig for the ministry yes a fig for the ministry i should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper i can see i am shocking you you’re so frightfully proper but i must say there’s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then life would be dreadfully monotonous without it” and she went on talking about the ministry all the time as though it had been mount olympus to change the conversation mme swann turned to mme cottard “but you’re looking very smart today redfern fecit”

    “no you know i always swear by rauthnitz besides it’s only an old thing i’ve had done up” “not really it’s charming”

    “guess how much    no change the first figure”

    “you don’t say so why that’s nothing it’s given away three times that at least i should have said” “you see how history comes to be written” apostrophised the doctor’s wife and pointing to a neckribbon which had been a present from mme swann “look odette do you recognise this”

    through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party it was swann “odette the prince d’agrigente is with me in the study he wants to know if he may pay his respects to you what am i to tell him” “why that i shall be delighted” odette would reply secretly flattered but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always even in her ‘fast’ days been accustomed to entertain men of fashion swann disappeared to deliver the message and would presently return with the prince unless in the meantime mme verdurin had arrived when he married odette swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan he had several good reasons for this stipulation though had he had none he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception and proves that every ‘gobetween’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested he had conceded only that odette and mme verdurin might exchange visits once a year and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful’ indignant at the insult offered to the ‘mistress’ who for so many years had treated odette and even swann himself as the spoiled children of her house for if it contained false brethren who ‘failed’ upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from odette ready in the event of discovery with the excuse that they were anxious to meet bergotte although the mistress assured them that he never went to the swanns’ and even if he did had no vestige of talent really — in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts to quote one of her favourite expressions to ‘attract’ him the little group had its ‘diehards’ also and these though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else would have wished mme verdurin but had never managed to prevail upon her to sever all connection with odette and thus deprive odette of the satisfaction of saying with a mocking laugh “we go to the mistress’s very seldom now since the schism it was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor but when one is married you know it isn’t always so easy    if you must know m swann can’t abide old ma verdurin and he wouldn’t much like the idea of my going there regularly as i used to and i as a dutiful spouse don’t you see   ” swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when mme verdurin came to call and so if the ‘mistress’ was in the drawingroom the prince d’agrigente would enter it alone alone too he was presented to her by odette who preferred that mme verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests and so might seeing more than one strange face in the room be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy a device which proved so far successful that mme verdurin said to her husband that evening with profound contempt “charming people her friends i met all the fine flower of the reaction” odette was living with respect to mme verdurin under a converse illusion not that the latter’s salon had ever begun at that time to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become mme verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one’s big parties where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold as odette was not to be long now in doing mme verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of ‘society’ as her final objective but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted and moreover so remote from that in which odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal of breaking the line of defence that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the ‘mistress’ was elaborating and it was with the most perfect sincerity that odette when anyone spoke to her of mme verdurin as a snob would answer laughing “oh no quite the opposite for one thing she never gets a chance of being a snob she doesn’t know anyone and then to do her justice i must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone no what she likes are her wednesdays and people who talk well” and in her heart of hearts she envied mme verdurin for all that she did not despair of having herself in so eminent a school succeeded in acquiring them those arts to which the ‘mistress’ attached such paramount importance albeit they did but discriminate between shades of the nonexistent sculpture the void and were properly speaking the arts of nonentity to wit those in the lady of a house of knowing how to ‘bring people together’ how to ‘group’ to ‘draw out’ to ‘keep in the background’ to act as a ‘connecting link’

    in any case mme swann’s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own in an inseparable setting of her guests amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested summarised assembled packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the ‘mistress’ the hostess turned visitor muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawingroom embowered in which mme verdurin was a drawingroom in herself the more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire and using the plural as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time “odette” they murmured “we are going to leave you” they envied mme cottard whom the ‘mistress’ called by her christian name “can i drop you anywhere” mme verdurin asked her unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room “oh but this lady has been so very kind as to say she’ll take me” replied mme cottard not wishing to appear to be forgetting when approached by a more illustrious personage that she had accepted the offer which mme bontémps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman “i must say that i am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles it is a regular godsend to me who have no automedon” “especially” broke in the ‘mistress’ who felt that she must say something since she knew mme bontémps slightly and had just invited her to her wednesdays “as at mme de crécy’s house you’re not very near home oh good gracious i shall never get into the way of saying mme swann” it was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan among those who were not overendowed with wit to pretend that they could never grow used to saying ‘mme swann’ “i have been so accustomed to saying mme de crécy that i nearly went wrong again” only mme verdurin when she spoke to odette was not content with the nearly but went wrong on purpose “don’t you feel afraid odette living out in the wilds like this i’m sure i shouldn’t feel at all comfortable coming home after dark besides it’s so damp it can’t be at all good for your husband’s eczema you haven’t rats in the house i hope” “oh dear no what a horrid idea” “that’s a good thing i was told you had i’m glad to know it’s not true because i have a perfect horror of the creatures and i should never have come to see you again goodbye my dear child we shall meet again soon you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you you don’t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water” she went on as she prepared to leave the room mme swann having risen to escort her “they are japanese flowers you must arrange them the same way as the japanese” “i do not agree with mme verdurin although she is the law and the prophets to me in all things there’s no one like you odette for finding such lovely chrysanthemums or chrysanthema rather for it seems that’s what we ought to call them now” declared mme cottard as soon as the ‘mistress’ had shut the door behind her “dear mme verdurin is not always very kind about other people’s flowers” said odette sweetly “whom do you go to odette” asked mme cottard to forestall any further criticism of the ‘mistress’ “lemaître i must confess the other day in lemaître’s window i saw a huge great pink bush which made me do something quite mad” but modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush and she said merely that the professor “and you know he’s not at all a quicktempered man” had ‘waved his sword in the air’ and told her that she “didn’t know what money meant” “no no i’ve no regular florist except debac” “nor have i” said mme cottard “but i confess that i am unfaithful to him now and then with lachaume” “oh you forsake him for lachaume do you i must tell debac that” retorted odette always anxious to shew her wit and to lead the conversation in her own house where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan “besides lachaume is really becoming too dear his prices are quite excessive don’t you know i find his prices impossible” she added laughing

    meanwhile mme bontemps who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the verdurins’ delighted at being asked to the famous wednesdays was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible she was not’ aware that mme verdurin liked people not to miss a single one also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought who when a hostess invites them to a series of parties do not accept and go to them without more ado like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third imagining that their absence will be noticed and save themselves up for the second and fourth unless it should happen that having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party they reverse the original order assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately we had another engagement last week” so mme bontemps was calculating how many wednesdays there could still be left before easter and by what means she might manage to secure one extra and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess she relied upon mme cottard whom she would have with her in the carriage going home to give her a few hints “oh mme bontemps i see you getting up to go it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that you owe me some compensation for not turning up last thursday    come sit down again just for a minute you can’t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner really you won’t let yourself be tempted” went on mme swann and as she held out a plate of cakes “you know they’re not at all bad these little horrors they don’t look nice but just taste one i know you’ll like it” “on the contrary they look quite delicious” broke in mme cottard “in your house odette one is never short of victuals i have no need to ask to see the trademark i know you get everything from rebattet i must say that i am more eclectic for sweet biscuits and everything of that sort i repair as often as not to bourbonneux but i agree that they simply don’t know what an ice means rebattet for everything iced and syrups and sorbets they’re past masters as my husband would say they’re the ne plus ultra” “oh but we just make these in the house you won’t really” “i shan’t be able to eat a scrap of dinner” pleaded mme bontemps “but i will just sit down again for a moment you know i adore talking to a clever woman like you” “you will think me highly indiscreet odette but i should so like to know what you thought of the hat mme trombert had on i know of course that big hats are the fashion just now all the same wasn’t it just the least little bit exaggerated and compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day the one she had on just now was microscopic” “oh no i am not at all clever” said odette thinking that this sounded well “i am a perfect simpleton i believe everything people say and worry myself to death over the least thing” and she insinuated that she had just at first suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like swann who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her meanwhile the prince d’agrigente having caught the words “i am not at all clever” thought it incumbent on him to protest unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee “tut tut tut tut” cried mme bontemps “not clever you” “that’s just what i was saying to myself —‘what do i hear’” the prince clutched at this straw “my ears must have played me false” “no i assure you” went on odette “i am really just an ordinary woman very easily shocked full of prejudices living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant” and then in case he had any news of the baron de charlus “have you seen our dear baronet” she asked him “you ignorant” cried mme bontemps “then i wonder what you’d say of the official world all those wives of excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks    listen to this my friend not more than a week ago i happened to mention lohengrin to the education minister’s wife she stared at me and said ‘lohengrin oh yes the new review at the foliesbergères i hear it’s a perfect scream’ what do you say to that eh you can’t help yourself when people say things like that it makes your blood boil i could have struck her because i have a bit of a temper of my own what do you say sir” she turned to me “was i not right” “listen” said mme cottard “people can’t help answering a little off the mark when they’re asked a thing like that point blank without any warning i know something about it because mme verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head” “speaking of mme verdurin” mme bontemps asked mme cottard “do you know who will be there on wednesday oh i’ve just remembered that we’ve accepted an invitation for next wednesday you wouldn’t care to dine with us on wednesday week we could go on together to mme verdurin’s i should never dare to go there by myself i don’t know why it is that great lady always terrifies me” “i’ll tell you what it is” replied mme cottard “what frightens you about mme verdurin is her organ but you see everyone can’t have such a charming organ as mme swann once you’ve found your tongue as the ‘mistress’ says the ice will soon be broken for she’s a very easy person really to get on with but i can quite understand what you feel it’s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country” “won’t you dine with us too” said mme bontemps to mme swann “after dinner we could all go to the verdurins’ together ‘do a verdurin’ and even if it means that the ‘mistress’ will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again once we are there we’ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk i’m sure that’s what i should like best” but this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful for mme bontemps went on to ask “who do you think will be there on wednesday week what will they be doing there won’t be too big a crowd i hope” “i certainly shan’t be there” said odette “we shall just look in for a minute on the last wednesday of all if you don’t mind waiting till then ——” but mme bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal

    granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio one must suppose since swann found mme bontemps attractive that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them and if this be true men like nations must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence one of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind to our weaknesses an encouragement to us to yield to them that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine who listen to him and offer incense at which a man or woman of mark who is living entirely for love will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress it was the age too at which swann in so far as he had become the husband of odette enjoyed hearing mme bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one’s house but duchesses concluding from that quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the verdurins’ that she was a good creature extremely sensible and not at all a snob and telling her stories which made her ‘die laughing’ because she had not heard them before although she always ‘saw the point’ at once liked flattering her for his own amusement “then the doctor is not mad about flowers like you” mme swann asked mme cottard “oh well you know my husband is a sage be practises moderation in all things yet i must admit he has a passion” her eye aflame with malice joy curiosity “and what is that pray” inquired mme bontemps quite simply mme cottard answered her “reading” “oh that’s a very restful passion in a husband” cried mme bontemps suppressing an impish laugh “when the doctor gets a book in his hands you know” “well that needn’t alarm you much    ” “but it does for his eyesight i must go now and look after him odette and i shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door talking of eyesight have you heard that the new house mme verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity i didn’t get that from my own little secret service you know but from quite a different source it was the electrician himself mildé who told me you see i quote my authorities even the bedrooms he says are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light it is evidently a charming luxury for those who can afford it but it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it’s the only one of its kind in the world just fancy the sisterinlaw of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house she can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors i confess that i’ve made the most barefaced stratagems to get permission to go there one day just to speak into the instrument it’s very tempting but more in a friend’s house than at home i don’t think i should like to have the telephone in my establishment once the first excitement is over it must be a perfect racket going on all the time now odette i must be off you’re not to keep mme bontemps any longer she’s looking after me i must absolutely tear myself away you’re making me behave in a nice way i shall be getting home after my husband”

    and for myself also it was time to return home before i had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope these pleasures had not appeared and yet mme swann did not look as though she expected anything more she allowed the servants to carry away the teathings as who should say “time please gentlemen” and at last she did say to me “really must you go very well goodbye” i felt that i might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them were they to be found then situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure but rather upon some crossroad unknown to me along which i ought to have digressed at least the object of my visit had been attained gilberte would know that i had come to see her parents when she was not at home and that i had as mme cottard had incessantly assured me “made a complete conquest first shot of mme verdurin” whom she added she had never seen ‘make so much’ of anyone “you and she must have hooked atoms” she would know that i had spoken of her as was fitting with affection but that i had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which i believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings i had told mme swann that i should not be able to see gilberte again i had said this as though i had finally decided not to see her any more and the letter which i was going to send gilberte would be framed on those lines only to myself to fortify my courage i proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort lasting a few days only i said to myself “this is the last time that i shall refuse to meet her i shall accept the next invitation” to make our separation less difficult to realise i did not picture it to myself as final but i knew very well that it would be

    the first of january was exceptionally painful to me that winter so no doubt is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy but if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past there was added to this in my case the unexpressed hope that gilberte having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation and discovering that i had not taken them had been waiting only for the excuse of new year’s day to write to me saying “what is the matter i am madly in love with you come and let us explain things properly i cannot live without seeing you” as the last days of the old year went by such a letter began to seem probable it was perhaps nothing of the sort but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire the need that we have for it suffices the soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time capable of being indefinitely prolonged will be allowed him before the bullet finds him the thief before he is taken men in general before they have to die that is the amulet which preserves people — and sometimes peoples — not from danger but from the fear of danger in reality from the belief in danger which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave it is confidence of this sort and with as little foundation that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation upon a letter for me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that i should have ceased to wish for one however unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves one attributes to her a series of thoughts though their sumtotal be indifference the intention to express those thoughts a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention but to imagine what was going on in gilberte’s mind i should have required simply the power to anticipate on that new year’s day what i should feel on the first day of any of the years to come when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and i should not dream should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me when we are in love our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us it radiates towards the beloved object finds in her a surface which arrests it forcing it to return to its startingpoint and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other’s regard for ourselves and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves new year’s day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from gilberte and as i received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season on the third and fourth of january i hoped still but my hope grew hourly more faint upon the days that followed i gazed through a mist of tears this undoubtedly meant that having been less sincere than i thought in my renunciation of gilberte i had kept the hope of a letter from her for the new year and seeing that hope exhausted before i had had time to shelter myself behind another i suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach but perhaps also in my case — and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements — the hope that i entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind’s eye once again the image of gilberte had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence the sight of her her way of treating me had aroused in me before the immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook the faculty of resignation neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters read no newspapers they imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves and similarly lovers who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind who have not begun yet to make trial of it are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation

    in consequence of the violence of my palpitations my doses of caffeine were reduced the palpitations ceased whereupon i asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that i had felt when i came near to quarrelling with gilberte an anguish which i had attributed on every recurrence of it to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same illhumour but if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly not that there would be anything extraordinary in that seeing that among lovers the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living it had been in that sense like the philtre which long after they have drunk of it continues to bind tristan to isolde for the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps — if it had not created it — at any rate contrived to render more acute

    only as the middle of the month of january approached once my hopes of a letter on new year’s day had been disappointed once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm it was my old sorrow that of ‘before the holidays’ which began again what was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that i myself was its architect unconscious wilful merciless and patient the one thing that mattered my relations with gilberte it was i who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend not indeed her indifference but what would come to the same thing in the end my own it was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was gilberte’s lover that i was goading myself with untiring energy with a clear sense not only of what i was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future i knew not only that after a certain time i should cease to love gilberte but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now no longer because i loved her too well but because i should certainly be in love with some other woman whom i should continue to desire to wait for through hours of which i should not dare to divert any particle of a second to gilberte who would be nothing to me then and no doubt at that very moment in which since i was determined not to see her again unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now i had already lost gilberte and loved her more than ever and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when spending all my afternoons in her company or as many as i chose i believed that no peril threatened our friendship — no doubt at that moment the idea that i should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me for that idea carried me away beyond the range of gilberte my love and my sufferings my love my sufferings in which through my tears i attempted to discern precisely what gilberte was and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would sooner or later be some other woman’s portion so that — or such at least was my way of thinking then — we are always detached from our fellowcreatures when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names but may be born again in the future may have been born already in the past for another and not for her and in the time when he is not in love if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not at the moment of speaking feel and therefore did not know knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment that future in which i should not love gilberte which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it certainly there would still have been time to warn gilberte that it was gradually taking shape that its coming was if not imminent at least inevitable if she herself gilberte did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference how often was i not on the point of writing or of going to gilberte to tell her “take care my mind is made up what i am doing now is my supreme effort i am seeing you now for the last time very soon i shall have ceased to love you” but to what end by what authority should i have reproached gilberte for an indifference which not that i considered myself guilty on that count i too manifested towards everything that was not herself the last time to me that appeared as something of immense significance because i was in love with gilberte on her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country an offer which like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect the time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains

    besides what good would it have done if i had spoken to gilberte she would not have understood me we imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears our own mind that are listening my words would have come to her only in a distorted form as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend unrecognisable giving a foolish sound having no longer any kind of meaning the truth which one puts into one’s words does not make a direct path for itself is not supported by irresistible evidence a considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves then the political opponent who despite all argument every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make selfevident the proofs of its excellence while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece but too late for the author to learn of their discovery similarly in love the barriers do what one may cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage if i had come to gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it she would have assumed from my action that my love for her the need that i had of her were even greater than i had supposed and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased and incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me to foresee more clearly than she herself could the end of that love and yet some such warning i might perhaps have addressed by letter or with my own lips to gilberte after a long enough interval which would render her it is true less indispensable to me but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable unfortunately certain persons — of good or evil intent — spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request whenever i thus learned that cottard my own mother even m de norpois had by a few illchosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that i had just been making wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me wrongly the appearance of having emerged from it i was doubly angry in the first place i could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had unknown to me interrupted and so brought to nothing and not only that i should have less pleasure in seeing gilberte who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me i cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service for no reason for talking’s sake often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence and because they are indiscreet as we ourselves are do us at a crucial moment so much harm it is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the other of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled but against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune cottards of this world for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself

    meanwhile since on almost every occasion of my going to see her mme swann would invite me to come to tea another day with her daughter and tell me to reply directly to her i was constantly writing to gilberte and in this correspondence i did not choose the expressions which might i felt have won her over sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears for like desire regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied when one begins to love one spends one’s time not in getting to know what one’s love really is but in making it possible to meet next day when one abandons love one seeks not to know one’s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving one says the things which one feels the need of saying and which the other will not understand one speaks for oneself alone i wrote “i had thought that it would not be possible alas i see now that it is not so difficult” i said also “i shall probably not see you again” i said it while i continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected and the words as i wrote them made me weep because i felt that they expressed not what i should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen for at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me i should have again as i had now the courage not to yield and what with one refusal and another i should gradually come to the moment when by virtue of not having seen her again i should not wish to see her i wept but i found courage enough to sacrifice i tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day a day when alas my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me even the supposition albeit so far from likely that at this moment as she had pretended during the last visit that i had paid her she loved me that what i took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility to a feint of indifference analogous to my own only rendered my decision less painful it seemed to me that in years to come when we had forgotten one another when i should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which i was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere she would answer “what you really did love me did you if you had only known how i waited for that letter how i hoped that you were coming to see me how i cried when i read it” the thought while i was writing it immediately on my return from her mother’s house that i was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding that thought by the sadness in which it plunged me by the pleasure of imagining that i was loved by gilberte gave me the impulse to continue my letter

    if at the moment of leaving mme swann when her teaparty ended i was thinking of what i was going to write to her daughter mme cottard as she departed had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order on her little ‘tour of inspection’ she had not failed to congratulate mme swann on the new ‘pieces’ the recent ‘acquisitions’ which caught the eye in her drawingroom she could see among them some though only a very few of the things that odette had had in the old days in the rue la pérouse for instance her animals carved in precious stones her fetishes

    for since mme swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word ‘dowdy’— which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered ‘smart’— all those things had one after another followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums innumerable boxes of sweets from giroux’s and the coroneted notepaper not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces which even before she had come to know swann a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice moreover in the artistic disorder the studiolike confusion of the rooms whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the whiteenamelled drawingrooms in which a little later you were to find mme swann installed the far east recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century and the cushions which to make me ‘comfortable’ mme swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with louis xv garlands and not as of old with chinese dragons in the room in which she was usually to be found and of which she would say “yes i like this room i use it a great deal i couldn’t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time this is where i do my work ——” though she never stated precisely at what she was working was it a picture a book perhaps for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to ‘do something’ not to be quite useless she was surrounded by dresden pieces having a fancy for that sort of porcelain which she would name with an english accent saying in any connexion “how pretty that is it reminds me of dresden flowers” and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flowerpots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate every now and then the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which swann the most courteous and considerate of masters looked on without being shocked not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming rarely nowadays was it in one of those japanese wrappers that odette received her familiars but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom and in which she immersed herself looked solemn splashed and sported with such an air of comfort of a cool skin and longdrawn breath that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative a mere setting for herself but as necessary in the same way as her ‘tub’ or her daily ‘outing’ to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene she used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up ‘art’ and ‘having nice things about her’ and that the burning of the ‘gioconda’ would distress her infinitely more than the destruction by the same element of ‘millions’ of the people she knew theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends but made her pass among them as a superior woman and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the belgian minister so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere — at the verdurins’ for instance — she was reckoned a fool it was this vivacity of expression that made mme swann prefer men’s society to women’s but when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan’s standpoint singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men a lumpy figure a bad complexion inability to spell hairy legs foul breath pencilled eyebrows but towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient especially if this woman were now in trouble she would defend her warmly saying “people are not fair to her i assure you she’s quite a nice woman really”

    it was not only the furniture of odette’s drawingroom it was odette herself that mme cottard and all those who had frequented the society of mme de crécy would have found it difficult if they had not seen her for some little time to recognise she seemed to be so much younger no doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter was in better condition seemed at once calmer more cool more restful and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder and into which her eyes and profile formerly too prominent seemed now to have been reabsorbed but another reason for this change lay in the fact that having reached the turningpoint of life odette had at length discovered or invented a physiognomy of her own an unalterable ‘character’ a ‘style of beauty’ and on her incoherent features — which for so long exposed to every hazard every weakness of the flesh borrowing for a moment at the slightest fatigue from the years to come a sort of flickering shadow of anility had furnished her well or ill according to how she was feeling how she was looking with a countenance dishevelled inconstant formless and attractive — had now set this fixed type as it were an immortal youthfulness

    swann had in his room instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife in all of which the same cryptic victorious expression enabled one to recognise in whatever dress and hat her triumphant face and figure a little old daguerreotype of her quite plain taken long before the appearance of this new type so that the youth and beauty of odette which she had not yet discovered when it was taken appeared to be missing from it but it is probable that swann having remained constant or having reverted to a different conception of her enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features caught in a pose between rest and motion a more botticellian charm for he still liked to recognise in his wife one of botticelli’s figures odette who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her what might perhaps to an artist express her ‘character’ but in her woman’s eyes were merely blemishes would not have that painter mentioned in her presence swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk blue and pink which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by our lady in the magnificat but mme swann refused to wear it once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies cornflowers forgetmenots and campanulas like that of the primavera and sometimes in the evening when she was tired he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving quite unconsciously to her pensive hands the uncontrolled almost distraught movement of the virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word ‘magnificat’ but he added “whatever you do don’t say anything about it to her if she knew she was doing it she would change her pose at once”

    save at these moments of involuntary relaxation in which swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of botticelli odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure wholly confined within a line which following the contours of the woman had abandoned the winding paths the capricious reentrants and salients the radial points the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days but also where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it was able to rectify by a bold stroke the errors of nature to make up along a whole section of its course for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element the pads the preposterous ‘bustle’ had disappeared as well as those tailed corsets which projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone had so long amplified odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together the vertical fall of fringes the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned but mme swann had chosen had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them when in the evening finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends i paid a surprise visit to her parents i used often to find mme swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which of one of those rich dark colours bloodred or orange which seemed always as though they meant something very special because they were no longer the fashion was crossed diagonally though not concealed by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day when on a still chilly afternoon in spring she had taken me before my rupture with her daughter to the jardin d’acclimatation under her coat which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm the dogtoothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some nonexistent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear some years earlier when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations and her scarf — of that same ‘scotch tartan’ to which she had remained faithful but whose tones she had so far softened red becoming pink and blue lilac that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon’sbreast taffetas which were the latest novelty — was knotted in such a way under her chin without one’s being able to make out where it was fastened that one could not help being reminded of those bonnetstrings which were — now no longer worn she need only ‘hold out’ like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say “mme swann is quite a period in herself isn’t she” as in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them so in mme swann’s attire those halfhinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets sometimes a tendency at once repressed towards the ‘all aboard’ or even a distant and vague allusion to the ‘chase me’ kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other older forms which you would not have succeeded now in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered and enwrapped mme swann in a cloak of nobility — perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady’s wardrobe which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness one felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation

    when gilberte who as a rule gave her teaparties on the days when her mother was ‘at home’ had for some reason to go out and i was therefore free to attend mme swann’s ‘kettledrum’ i would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns some of which were of taffeta others of grosgrain or of velvet or of crêpedechine or satin or silk gowns which not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them gave to her stayathome laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic and no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet an easygoing good humour in the white taffeta and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had in order to become visible put on the appearance dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices of the black crêpedechine but at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose something detached pensive secret in harmony with the melancholy which mme swann never failed to shew at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands beneath the profusion of sapphire charms enamelled fourleaf clovers silver medals gold medallions turquoise amulets ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be on the dress itself some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own some row of little satin buttons which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness the discretion of a delicate reminder and these as well as the trinkets had the effect — for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence — of disclosing a secret intention being a pledge of affection keeping a secret ministering to a superstition commemorating a recovery from sickness a granted wish a love affair or a ‘philippine’ and now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of ‘slashes’ in the henri ii style in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which if it was in the sleeves just below the shoulders made one think of the ‘leg of mutton’ sleeves of 1830 or if on the other hand it was beneath the skirt with its louis xv paniers gave the dress a just perceptible air of being ‘fancy dress’ and at all events by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past blended with the person of mme swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance and if i were to draw her attention to this “i don’t play golf” she would answer “like so many of my friends so i should have no excuse for going about as they do in sweaters”

    in the confusion of her drawingroom on her way from shewing out one visitor or with a plateful of cakes to ‘tempt’ another mme swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment “i have special instructions from gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after tomorrow as i wasn’t sure of seeing you here i was going to write to you if you hadn’t come” i continued to resist and this resistance was costing me steadily less and less because however much one may love the poison that is destroying one when one has compulsorily to do without it and has had to do without it for some time past one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know to the absence of emotion and suffering if one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her for no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant what one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing how infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams in which she who in reality does not love one seems far from that to be making protestations of her love for one when one is by oneself that memory which one can contrive by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires to render as pleasing as one may choose how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one’s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness unlookedfor violence we know all of us when we no longer love that forgetfulness that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an illstarred love it was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation i preferred without acknowledging it to myself the reposeful tranquillity

    moreover whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in gilberte’s estimation which in view of my deliberate abstention must it seemed to me be steadily increasing in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which i did not see her coming one after the other without interruption continuing too without prescription unless some busybody were to meddle in my affairs was a day not lost but gained gained to no purpose it might be for presently they would be able to pronounce that i was healed resignation modulating our habits allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased those — so wretchedly inadequate — that i had had to support my grief on the first evening of my rupture with gilberte had since multiplied to an incalculable power only the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days for how many months even we have been able and might still be able to abstain and often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it so one day when mme swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to gilberte to see me thus putting the happiness of which i had now for so long been depriving myself as it were within arm’s length i was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure and i could hardly wait until next day when i had made up my mind to take gilberte by surprise in the evening before dinner

    what helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that i had made from the moment in which everything was forgotten in which i was reconciled to gilberte i no longer wished to visit her save as a lover every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew and if mme swann albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers i should find other gifts more precious and less frequent my parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things i thought of a big bowl of old chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt léonie and of which mamma prophesied daily that françoise would come running to her with an “oh it’s all come to pieces” and that that would be the end of it would it not be wiser in that case to part with it to sell it so as to be able to give gilberte all the pleasure i could i felt sure that i could easily get a thousand francs for it i had it tied up in paper i had grown so used to it that i had ceased altogether to notice it parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like i took it with me as i started for the swanns’ and giving the driver their address told him to go by the champselysées at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things who knew my father greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl i took the notes with rapture every day for a whole year i could smother gilberte in roses and lilac when i left the shop and got into my cab again the driver naturally enough since the swanns lived out by the bois instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the avenue des champselysées he had just passed the end of the rue de berri when in the failing light i thought i saw close to the swanns’ house but going in the other direction going away from it gilberte who was walking slowly though with a firm step by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing but whose face i could not distinguish i stood up in the cab meaning to tell the driver to stop then hesitated the strolling couple were already some way away and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the elysian gloom a moment later i had reached gilberte’s door i was received by mme swann “oh she will be sorry” was my greeting “i can’t think why she isn’t in she came home just now from a lesson complaining of the heat and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl” “i fancy i passed her in the avenue des champselysées” “oh i don’t think it can have been anyhow don’t mention it to her father he doesn’t approve of her going out at this time of night must you go goodbye” i left her told my driver to go home the same way but found no trace of the two walking figures where had they been what were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially

    i returned home desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that gilberte whom now i had made up my mind never to see again no doubt my call at the dealer’s had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future whenever i saw my friend she would be pleased with me and grateful but if i had not called there if my cabman had not taken the avenue des champselysées i should not have seen gilberte with that young man thus a single action may have two contradictory effects and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one there had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens we desire some pleasure and the material means of obtaining it are lacking “it is a mistake” labruyère tells us “to be in love without an ample fortune” there is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure in my case however the material means had been forthcoming but at the same moment if not by a logical effect at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success my pleasure had been snatched from me

    as for that matter it seems as though it must always be as a rule however not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible usually we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer but the pleasure can never be realised if we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances nature at once shifts the battleground placing it within ourselves and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain and if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change nature does not on that account despair of conquering us in a manner more gradual it is true more subtle but no less efficacious it is then at the last moment that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us or rather it is that very possession which nature with diabolical cleverness uses to destroy our happiness after failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action it is a final incapacity the mental incapacity for happiness that nature creates in us the phenomenon of happiness either fails to appear or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions

    i put my ten thousand francs in a drawer but they were no longer of any use to me i ran through them as it happened even sooner than if i had sent flowers every day to gilberte for when evening came i was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom i did not love as for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to gilberte i no longer thought of that to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings even the sight of gilberte which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday would no longer have sufficed me for i should have been miserable all the time that i was not actually with her that is how a woman by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us increases often quite unconsciously her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her with each injury that she does us she encircles us more and more completely doubles our chains — but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind only yesterday had i not been afraid of annoying gilberte i should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings which now would no longer have contented me and for which i should now have substituted quite different terms for in this respect love is not like war after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated provided always that we are still in a position to give battle this was not my position with regard to gilberte also i preferred at first not to see her mother again i continued it is true to assure myself that gilberte did not love me that i had known this for ever so long that i could see her again if i chose and if i did not choose forget her in course of time but these ideas like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which i kept on seeing traced by gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the avenue des champselysées this was a fresh misfortune which like the rest would gradually lose its force a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind’s eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one’s cigarette without fear of an explosion meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me without alteration the figure of gilberte walking in the dusk to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory i had toiling effectively on the other side imagination the former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the champselysées and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past as for instance gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me but the other force working upon the canvas of my hopes outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which after all was so restricted for one minute in which i saw gilberte’s sullen face how many were there in which i planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation perhaps even towards our betrothal it is true that this force which my imagination was concentrating upon the future it was drawing for all that from the past i was still in love with her whom it is true i believed that i detested but whenever anyone told me that i was looking well or was nicely dressed i wished that she could have been there to see me i was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses and refused all their invitations there was a scene at home because i did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the bontemps were to be present with their niece albertine a young girl still hardly more than a child so it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another we scornfully decline because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account to see another who is of no account today with whom we shall be in love tomorrow with whom we might perhaps had we consented to see her now have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings bringing others it is true in their place mine were steadily growing less i had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day another the next generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to gilberte to the gilberte whom i kept within me i ought to have reminded myself that the other the real gilberte was perhaps entirely different from mine knew nothing of the regrets that i ascribed to her was thinking probably less about me not merely than i was thinking about her but that i made her be thinking about me when i was closeted alone with my fictitious gilberte wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself

    during those periods in which our bitterness of spirit though steadily diminishing still persists a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories some cutting speech some word in a letter that we have had from her the various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair for the present it must suffice to say that of these two kinds the former is infinitely the less cruel that is because our conception of the person since it dwells always within ourselves is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow it must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love prolong it and prevent our recovery just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence but if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic it is not so with those special memories those cutting words that inimical letter i received only one that could be so described from gilberte you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments few and scattered as they were and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole because the letter has not — as the image of the beloved creature has — been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret we have read it devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune sorrows of this sort come to us in another way from without and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart the picture of our friend in our mind which we believe to be old original authentic has in reality been refashioned by her many times over the cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture it is of another age it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past but inasmuch as this past continues to exist save in ourselves who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled those memories those letters carry us back to reality and cannot but make us feel by the sudden pang they give us what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same though that does indeed happen at times there are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound only in their case as we never loved them we have never counted the years spent apart from them and this instance which would invalidate our whole argument we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not ‘come true’

    but after a time absence may prove efficacious the desire the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us only we must allow time now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing for one thing time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end and then too the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal or to seem worth attaining this idea however that it will be attainable that what when it no longer spells any good fortune to us we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune this idea embodies a part but a part only of the truth our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it but the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when very probably it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate people are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest the friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love overtures which strike us in our indifference to her as excessive would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love those tender speeches that invitation or acceptance we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed which we should as likely as not simply by our avidity for them have precluded from ever happening so that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late when we are no longer in love is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us at one time so unhappy there is only one person who could decide that our ego of those days he is no longer with us and were he to reappear no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune — whether identical or not — vanish

    pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which i should not when the time came be greatly interested by dint of my having to invent as in the days when i still hardly knew gilberte speeches letters in which she implored my forgiveness swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of gilberte and the young man which had nothing now to feed upon at this point i should perhaps have resumed my visits to mme swann but for a dream that came to me in which one of my friends who was not however one that i could identify behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that i had been treacherous to him abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me and finding that it persisted after i was awake i turned my thoughts back to the dream racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom i had seen in my sleep the sound of whose name — a spanish name — was no longer distinct in my ears combining joseph’s part with pharaoh’s i set to work to interpret my dream i knew that when one is interpreting a dream it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us the person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer from mine i learned that though transformed while i was asleep into a young man the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was gilberte i remembered then that the last time i had seen her on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancinglesson she had whether in sincerity or in makebelieve declined laughing in a strange manner to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her and by association this memory brought back to me another long before that it had been swann who would not believe in my sincerity nor that i was a suitable friend for gilberte in vain had i written to him gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh she had not returned it to me at once i remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels as soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral gilberte’s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street and avoids obvious dangers but there are others that take effect within us the accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking from inside from the heart gilberte’s words “if you like we might go on wrestling” made me shudder i imagined her behaving like that at home perhaps in the linenroom with the young man whom i had seen escorting her along the avenue des champselysées and so just as when a little time back i had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness it had been fatuous in me now that i had abandoned all thought of happiness to take for granted that at least i had grown and was going to remain calm for so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed when that happiness has vanished when we have suffered and later when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep the thing then that is as elusive as precarious as ever our happiness was is our calm mine returned to me in the end for the cloud which lowering our resistance tempering our desires has penetrated in the train of a dream the enclosure of our mind is bound in course of time to dissolve permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world not even to grief besides those whose suffering is due to love are as we say of certain invalids their own physicians as consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief and as their grief is an emanation from that person it is there in their grief itself that they must in the end find a remedy which it will disclose to them at a given moment for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved the regretted creature at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope but even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm i no longer wished — except just occasionally — to visit mme swann in the first place because among those who love and have been forsaken the state of incessant — even if unconfessed — expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation and while to all appearance unchanged substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite the first were the consequences of — a reaction from — the painful incidents which had upset us the tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear all the more since we desire at such moments should no message come to us from her whom we love to act for ourselves and are none too confident of the success of a step which once we have taken it we may find it impossible to follow up but presently without our having noticed any change this tension which still endures is sustained we discover no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future from that moment it is almost pleasant besides the first state by continuing for some time has accustomed us to living in expectation the suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still but is already lulled to sleep we are in no haste to arouse it especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now the possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess which is bound to remain whatever happens since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions an irreducible quantity

    another final reason came later on to reinforce this and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to mme swann this reason slow in revealing itself was not that i had now forgotten gilberte but that i must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible no doubt now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled my visits to mme swann had become once again for what sorrow remained in me the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first but what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible namely that with these visits the memory of gilberte was intimately blended the distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of gilberte no longer nourished thoughts interests passions in which gilberte should have no part these states of consciousness to which the person whom we love remains a stranger then occupy a place which however small it may be at first is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul we must seek to encourage these thoughts to make them grow while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul until at last the victory is complete i decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed and i was still young enough still courageous enough to undertake the attempt to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that whatever time one may devote to the effort it will prove successful in the end the reason i now gave in my letters to gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding wholly fictitious which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself and as to which i had hoped at first that gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation but as a matter of fact never even in the most insignificant relations in life does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure untruthful incriminating sentence has been written on purpose so that he shall protest against it and is only too glad to feel when he reads it that he possesses — and to keep in his own hands — the initiative in the coming operations for all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations in which love is endowed with so much eloquence indifference with so little curiosity gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding it became for me a real entity to which i referred anew in every letter and there is in these baseless situations in the affectation of coldness a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them by dint of writing “now that our hearts are sundered” so that gilberte might answer “but they are not do explain what you mean” i had gradually come to believe that they were by constantly repeating “life may have changed for us it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another” in the hope of hearing myself one day say “but there has been no change the feeling is stronger now than ever it was” i was living with the idea that life had indeed changed that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed as certain neurotics from having at first pretended to be ill end by becoming chronic invalids now whenever i had to write to gilberte i brought my mind back to this imagined change which being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies would in future subsist between us then gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it she too adopted my point of view and as in the speeches at official banquets when the foreign sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the sovereign who is entertaining him whenever i wrote to gilberte “life may have parted us the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure” she never failed to respond “life may have parted us it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both” though we should have found it hard to say why or how ‘life’had parted us or what change had occurred my sufferings were no longer excessive and yet one day when i was telling her in a letter that i had heard of the death of our old barleysugar woman in the champselysées as i wrote the words “i felt at once that this would distress you in me it awakened a host of memories” i could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when i saw that i was speaking in the past tense as though it were of some dead friend now almost forgotten of this love of which in spite of myself i had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive or one that at least might be born again nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more gilberte’s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which i used to write to people who did not matter and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her

    but as time went on every refusal to see her disturbed me less and as she became less dear to me my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which i found in thinking of florence or of venice i regretted at such moments that i had abandoned the idea of diplomacy and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence in order not to be separated from a girl whom i should not see again and had already almost forgotten we construct our house of life to suit another person and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come presently she is dead to us and we live on a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her if venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off and its climate treacherous it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself and settle down at balbec but to do that i should have had to leave paris to forego those visits thanks to which infrequent as they were i might sometimes hear mme swann telling me about her daughter besides i was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which gilberte had no part

    when spring drew round and with it the cold weather during an icy lent and the hailstorms of holy week as mme swann began to find it cold in the house i used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape both of ermine which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter more persistent than the rest which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting and the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawingroom which soon i should be entering no more by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness that for example of the guelderroses clustering at the summits of their tall bare stalks like the rectilinear trees in preraphaelite paintings their balls of blossom divided yet composite white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons for the mistress of tansonville knew that april even an icebound april was not barren of flowers that winter spring summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the towndweller who until the first hot day imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain that mme swann was content with the consignments furnished by her combray gardener that she did not by the intervention of her own ‘special’ florist fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious mediterranean shore i do not for a moment suggest nor did it worry me at the time it was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which mme swann kept her hands the guelderrose snowballs which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose on the advice of bergotte a ‘symphony in white’ with her furniture and her garments reminded me that what the good friday music in parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year if one had the sense to look for it and assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom which although their names were unknown to me had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round combray made mme swann’s drawingroom as virginal as candidly ‘in bloom’ without the least vestige of greenery as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by tansonville

    but it was still more than i could endure that these memories should be recalled to me there was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for gilberte besides albeit i no longer felt the least distress during these visits to mme swann i extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible at most since i continued not to go out of paris i allowed myself an occasional walk with her fine weather had come at last and the sun was hot as i knew that before luncheon mme swann used to go out every day for an hour and would stroll for a little in the avenue du bois near the etoile — a spot which at that time because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the ‘swells’ whom they knew only by name was known as the ‘shabbygenteel club’— i persuaded my parents on sundays for on weekdays i was busy all morning to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs until a quarter past one and go for a walk before it during may that year i never missed a sunday for gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country i used to reach the arc de triomphe about noon i kept watch at the entrance to the avenue never taking my eyes off the corner of the sidestreet along which mme swann who had only a few yards to walk would come from her house as by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon those who remained were few in number and for the most part fashionably dressed suddenly on the gravelled path unhurrying cool luxuriant mme swann appeared displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same but which i remember as being typically mauve then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk just at the moment when her radiance was most complete the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown a whole troop of people escorted her swann himself four or five fellows from the club who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street and their black or grey agglomeration obedient to her every gesture performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which odette was framed gave to this woman in whose eyes alone was there any intensity the air of looking out in front of her from among all those men as from a window behind which she had taken her stand and made her emerge there frail but fearless in the nudity of her delicate colours like the apparition of a creature of a different species of an unknown race and of almost martial strength by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort smiling rejoicing in the fine weather in the sunshine which had not yet become trying with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides certain that her clothes — even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them — were the smartest anywhere to be seen she wore them for herself and for her friends naturally without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose keeping their own rhythm provided that they accompanied her where she led the way and even upon her mauve parasol which as often as not she had not yet ‘put up’ when she appeared on the scene she let fall now and then as though upon a bunch of parma violets a gaze happy and so kindly that when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object her eyes still seemed to smile she thus kept open she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity not without shewing a certain deference as of profane visitors to a shrine an admission of their own ignorance an interval over which they recognised that their friend had as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take or a mother over her children’s education a competent jurisdiction no less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe’ the passersby mme swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress like the turn that one takes up and down one’s own garden of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool the indoor shade but for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth all the more because being assured in my own mind that in accordance with the liturgy with the ritual in which mme swann was so profoundly versed her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique i felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat the babyribbons upon her dress had been even more naturally born of the month of may than the flowers in gardens and in woods and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season i had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol open and outstretched like another a nearer sky round clement mobile blue for these rites if they were of sovereign importance subjugated their glory and consequently mme swann her own in condescending obedience to the day the spring the sun none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter of a thinner fabric suggesting to me by the opening of its collar and sleeves the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed — in a word had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country whom everyone even the most plebeian knows yet makes a point of donning for the occasion suitable attire on her arrival i would greet mme swann she stop me and say in english ‘good morning’ and smile we would walk a little way together and i learned then that these canons according to which she dressed it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them as though yielding to a superior wisdom of which she herself was high priestess for if it should happen that feeling too warm she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up i would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm i would see i would drink in slowly for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer some exquisite detail a deliciously tinted strip a lining of mauve satinette which ordinarily concealed from every eye was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts like those gothic carvings on a cathedral hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground as perfect as are the basreliefs over the main porch and yet never seen by any living man until happening to pass that way upon his travels an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them to stroll in the open air sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze between the soaring towers

    what enhanced this impression that mme swann was walking in the avenue as though along the paths of her own garden was — for people ignorant of her habit of ‘taking exercise’— that she had come there on foot without any carriage following she whom once may had begun they were accustomed to see behind the most brilliant ‘turnout’ the smartest liveries in paris gently and majestically seated like a goddess in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs on foot mme swann had the appearance — especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun — of having yielded to curiosity of committing an ‘exclusive’ breach of all the rules of her code like those crowned heads who without consulting anyone accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience so between mme swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are the faubourg saintgermain may have its barriers also but these are less ‘telling’ to the eyes and imagination of the ‘shabbygenteel’ these latter when in the presence of a real personage more simple more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man less remote from the people will not feel the same sense of their own inequality almost of their unworthiness as dismays them when they encounter mme swann of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled as the crowd are by the brilliance of their apparel they have ceased to pay any attention to it but only because they have grown used to it that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways so that the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material easily verified slowly acquired the lack of it hard to compensate if such women place a passerby in the lowest rank of society it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest that is to say instinctively at first sight and without possibility of appeal perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like lady israels who mixed with the women of the aristocracy and mme swann who was to get to know them later on that intermediate class inferior to the faubourg saintgermain since it ‘ran after’ the denizens of that quarter but superior to everything that was not of the faubourg saintgermain possessing this peculiarity that while already detached from the world of the merely rich it was riches still that it represented but riches that had been canalised serving a purpose swayed by an idea that was artistic malleable gold chased with a poetic design taught to smile perhaps that class — in the same form at least and with the same charm — exists no longer in any event the women who were its members would not satisfy today what was the primary condition on which they reigned since with advancing age they have lost — almost all of them — their beauty whereas it was just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that mme swann majestic smiling kind as she advanced along the avenue du bois saw like hypatia beneath the slow tread of her feet worlds revolving various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her especially since having been introduced only once at the most to swann they were afraid that he might not remember them was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats and they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds asking themselves whether the gesture so bold so sacrilegious a tempting of providence would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down upon them the vengeance of a jealous god it provoked only like the winding of a piece of clockwork a series of gesticulations from little responsive bowing figures who were none other than odette’s escort beginning with swann himself who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy which he had acquired in the faubourg saintgermain but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn its place was now taken as though he had been to some extent permeated by odette’s prejudices at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife’s knowing so many people a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side “whatl another upon my word i can’t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up” meanwhile having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously mme swann turned to me “then it’s all over” she put it to me “you aren’t ever coming to see gilberte again i’m glad you make an exception of me and are not going to ‘drop’ me straight away i like seeing you but i used to like also the influence you had over my daughter i’m sure she’s very sorry about it too however i mustn’t bully you or you’ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again” “odette sagan’s trying to speak to you” swann called his wife’s attention and there indeed was the prince as in some transformation scene at the close of a play or in a circus or an old painting wheeling his horse round so as to face her in a magnificent heroic pose and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and so to speak allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for woman were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know and at every moment recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her mme swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the avenue men from the clubs the names of whom which meant only celebrities to the public antoine de castellane adalbert de montmorency and the rest — were for mme swann the familiar names of friends and as the average span of life the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered long after the sorrows that i once felt on gilberte’s account have faded and vanished there has survived them the pleasure that i still derive — whenever i close my eyes and read as it were upon the face of a sundial the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o’clock in the month of may — from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with mme swann beneath her parasol as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower2embed"
