some say a storm is coming
some say the end is near
some think its all so hazy
i think its all so clear

if it all ends tomorrow
if it all disappears
where do you think youre going
anywhere else but here

if the world stops spinning tomorrow
id never shed a tear
id rather be anywhere anywhere
anywhere but here
