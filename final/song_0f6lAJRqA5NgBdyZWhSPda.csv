—not a word says joe i was up at that meeting in the city arms

in inisfail the fair there lies a land the land of holy michan there rises a watchtower beheld of men afar there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept warriors and princes of high renown a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters fishful streams where sport the gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots silvery fishes crans of herrings drafts of eels codlings creels of fingerlings purple seagems and playful insects and heroes voyage from afar to woo them from eblana to slievemargy the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruahans land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle princes the sons of kings

and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for oconnell fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields flaskets of cauliflowers floats of spinach pineapple chunks rangoon beans strikes of tomatoes drums of figs drills of swedes spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale york and savoy and trays of onions pearls of the earth and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries pulpy and pelurious and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes

i dare him says he and i doubledare him come out here geraghty you notorious bloody hill and dale robber
and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwoods and storesheep and cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling cackling roaring lowing bleating bellowing rumbling grunting champing chewing of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond from the mgillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds various in size the agate with this dun

so we turned into barney kiernans and there sure enough was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink

—there he is says i in his gloryhole with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers working for the cause

the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog im told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence

—stand and deliver says he

—thats all right citizen says joe friends here

—pass friends says he

then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he

—whats your opinion of the times

doing the rapparee and rory of the hill but begob joe was equal to the occasion

—i think the markets are on a rise says he sliding his hand down his fork

so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says

—foreign wars is the cause of it
and says joe sticking his thumb in his pocket

—its the russians wish to tyrannise

—arrah give over your bloody codding joe says i ive a thirst on me i wouldnt sell for half a crown

—give it a name citizen says joe

—wine of the country says he

—whats yours says joe

—ditto macanaspey says i

—three pints terry says joe and hows the old heart citizen says he

—never better a chara says he what garry are we going to win eh

and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him

the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble

he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut his nether extremities were encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the ardri malachi art macmurragh shane oneill father john murphy owen roe patrick sarsfield red hugh odonnell red jim macdermott soggarth eoghan ogrowney michael dwyer francy higgins henry joy mcracken goliath horace wheatley thomas conneff peg woffington the village blacksmith captain moonlight captain boycott dante alighieri christopher columbus s fursa s brendan marshal macmahon charlemagne theobald wolfe tone the mother of the maccabees the last of the mohicans the rose of castile the man for galway the man that broke the bank at monte carlo the man in the gap the woman who didnt benjamin franklin napoleon bonaparte john l sullivan cleopatra savourneen deelish julius caesar paracelsus sir thomas lipton william tell michelangelo hayes muhammad the bride of lammermoor peter the hermit peter the packer dark rosaleen patrick w shakespeare brian confucius murtagh gutenberg patricio velasquez captain nemo tristan and isolde the first prince of wales thomas cook and son the bold soldier boy arrah na pogue dick turpin ludwig beethoven the colleen bawn waddler healy angus the culdee dolly mount sidney parade ben howth valentine greatrakes adam and eve arthur wellesley boss croker herodotus jack the giantkiller gautama buddha lady godiva the lily of killarney balor of the evil eye the queen of sheba acky nagle joe nagle alessandro volta jeremiah odonovan rossa don philip osullivan beare a couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone

so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid o as true as im telling you a goodlooking sovereign

—and theres more where that came from says he

—were you robbing the poorbox joe says i

—sweat of my brow says joe twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze

—for the old woman of princes street says the citizen the subsidised organ the pledgebound party on the floor of the house and look at this blasted rag says he look at this says he the irish independent if you please founded by parnell to be the workingmans friend listen to the births and deaths in the irish all for ireland independent and ill thank you and the marriages

and lo as they quaffed their cup of joy a godlike messenger came swiftly in radiant as the eye of heaven a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage fairest of her race

little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barneys snug squeezed up with the laughing and who was sitting up there in the corner that i hadnt seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob doran i didnt know what was up and alf kept making signs out of the door and begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon denis breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him unfortunate wretched woman trotting like a poodle i thought alf would split

—hurry up terry boy says alf

terence oryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless leda for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil those cunning brothers lords of the vat

then did you chivalrous terence hand forth as to the manner born that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted the soul of chivalry in beauty akin to the immortals

but he the young chief of the obergans could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port scion of the house of brunswick victoria her name her most excellent majesty by grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the british dominions beyond the sea queen defender of the faith empress of india even she who bore rule a victress over many peoples the wellbeloved for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof the pale the dark the ruddy and the ethiop

—whats that bloody freemason doing says the citizen prowling up and down outside

—whats that says joe

begob he was what you might call flabbergasted

in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr l ya or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels in reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana alavatar hatakalda wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power it was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was we greet you friends of earth who are still in the body mind c k doesnt pile it on it was ascertained that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher manager of messrs h j oneills popular funeral establishment a personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to cullens to be soled only as the heels were still good he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known

assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction

he is gone from mortal haunts odignam sun of our morning fleet was his foot on the bracken patrick of the beamy brow wail banba with your wind and wail o ocean with your whirlwind

—there he is again says the citizen staring out

—who says i

—bloom says he hes on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes

and begob i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again

little alf was knocked bawways faith he was

—good christ says he i could have sworn it was him

and says bob doran with the hat on the back of his poll lowest blackguard in dublin when hes under the influence

—who said christ is good

—i beg your parsnips says alf

—is that a good christ says bob doran to take away poor little willy dignam

—ah well says alf trying to pass it off hes over all his troubles

but bob doran shouts out of him

—hes a bloody ruffian i say to take away poor little willy dignam

terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didnt want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises and bob doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam true as youre there

—the finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character

the tear is bloody near your eye talking through his bloody hat fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married mooney the bumbailiffs daughter mother kept a kip in hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour

—the noblest the truest says he and hes gone poor little willy poor little paddy dignam

and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven

old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round the door

—come in come on he wont eat you says the citizen

so bloom slopes in with his cods eye on the dog and he asks terry was martin cunningham there

—o christ mkeown says joe reading one of the letters listen to this will you

and he starts reading out one

7 hunter street liverpool to the high sheriff of dublin dublin

honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i hanged

—show us joe says i

— private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in pentonville prison and i was assistant when

—jesus says i

— billington executed the awful murderer toad smith

the citizen made a grab at the letter

—hold hard says joe i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he cant get out hoping to be favoured i remain honoured sir my terms is five ginnees
h rumbold master barber

—and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen

—and the dirty scrawl of the wretch says joe here says he take them to hell out of my sight alf hello bloom says he what will you have

so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldnt and he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well hed just take a cigar gob hes a prudent member and no mistake

—give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe

and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it

—theyre all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses

and he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull

in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so saith the lord

so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time im told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i dont know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on

—theres one thing it hasnt a deterrent effect on says alf

—whats that says joe

—the poor buggers tool thats being hanged says alf

—that so says joe

—gods truth says alf i heard that from the head warder that was in

kilmainham when they hanged joe brady the invincible he told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker

—ruling passion strong in death says joe as someone said

—that can be explained by science says bloom its only a natural phenomenon dont you see because on account of the

and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon

the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis

so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get so of course bob doran starts doing the bloody fool with him

—give us the paw give the paw doggy good old doggy give the paw here give us the paw

arrah bloody end to the paw hed paw and alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a jacobs tin he told terry to bring gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel

and the citizen and bloom having an argument about the point the brothers sheares and wolfe tone beyond on arbour hill and robert emmet and die for your country the tommy moore touch about sara curran and shes far from the land and bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face phenomenon the fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley time they were stopping up in the city arms pisser burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didnt near roast him its a queer story the old one blooms wife and mrs odowd that kept the hotel jesus i had to laugh at pisser burke taking them off chewing the fat and bloom with his but dont you see and but on the other hand and sure more be token the lout im told was in powers after the blenders round in cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment phenomenon

—the memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at bloom

—ay ay says joe

—you dont grasp my point says bloom what i mean is

—sinn fein says the citizen sinn fein amhain the friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us

the last farewell was affecting in the extreme from the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance the deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle a torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons a posse of dublin metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the york street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by speranzas plaintive muse special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents considerable amusement was caused by the favourite dublin streetsingers lnhn and mllgn who sang the night before larry was stretched in their usual mirthprovoking fashion our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies the children of the male and female foundling hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the days entertainment and a word of praise is due to the little sisters of the poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat the viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by their excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the friends of the emerald isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite the delegation present in full force consisted of commendatore bacibaci beninobenone the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane monsieur pierrepaul petitépatant the grandjoker vladinmire pokethankertscheff the archjoker leopold rudolph von schwanzenbadhodenthaler countess marha virága kisászony putrápesthi hiram y bomboost count athanatos karamelopulos ali baba backsheesh rahat lokum effendi senor hidalgo caballero don pecadillo y palabras y paternoster de la malora de la malaria hokopoko harakiri hi hung chang olaf kobberkeddelsen mynheer trik van trumps pan poleaxe paddyrisky goosepond prhklstr kratchinabritchisitch borus hupinkoff herr hurhausdirektorpresident hans chuechlisteuerli nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor kriegfried ueberallgemein all the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness an animated altercation in which all took part ensued among the f o t e i as to whether the eighth or the ninth of march was the correct date of the birth of irelands patron saint in the course of the argument cannonballs scimitars boomerangs blunderbusses stinkpots meatchoppers umbrellas catapults knuckledusters sandbags lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged the baby policeman constable macfadden summoned by special courier from booterstown quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties the readywitted ninefooters suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted constable macfadden was heartily congratulated by all the fotei several of whom were bleeding profusely commendatore beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair it was explained by his legal adviser avvocato pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses the objects which included several hundred ladies and gentlemens gold and silver watches were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme

administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater his cassock above his hoary head and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication hand by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously as he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office on a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers messrs john round and sons sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim the housesteward of the amalgamated cats and dogs home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem the nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake the hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly sheila my own encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park she brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment that monster audience simply rocked with delight but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time a fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage a most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in albions history placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds nay even the ster provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel tomkinmaxwell ffrenchmullan tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion with his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone

—god blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when i sees her cause i thinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down limehouse way

so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speak their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of ireland antitreating is about the size of it gob hed let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the lord would call him before youd ever see the froth of his pint and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolagh entertainment dont be talking ireland sober is ireland free and then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt

so howandever as i was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by joe and me id train him by kindness so i would if he was my dog give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldnt blind him

—afraid hell bite you says the citizen jeering

—no says i but he might take my leg for a lamppost

so he calls the old dog over

—whats on you garry says he

then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera such growling you never heard as they let off between them someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws

all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances owen garry the exhibition which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprises among other achievements the recitation of verse our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient celtic bards we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather as a contributor d o c points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye we subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication the metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if owens verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour

the curse of my curses
seven days every day
and seven dry thursdays
on you barney kiernan
has no sup of water
to cool my courage
and my guts red roaring
after lowrys lights

so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off and joe asked him would he have another

—i will says he a chara to show theres no ill feeling

gob hes not as green as hes cabbagelooking arsing around from one pub to another leaving it to your own honour with old giltraps dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators entertainment for man and beast and says joe

—could you make a hole in another pint

—could a swim duck says i

—same again terry says joe are you sure you wont have anything in the way of liquid refreshment says he

—thank you no says bloom as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet martin cunningham dont you see about this insurance of poor dignams martin asked me to go to the house you see he dignam i mean didnt serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee cant recover on the policy

—holy wars says joe laughing thats a good one if old shylock is landed so the wife comes out top dog what

—well thats a point says bloom for the wifes admirers

—whose admirers says joe

—the wifes advisers i mean says bloom

then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagees right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act he was bloody safe he wasnt run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal hungarian privileged lottery true as youre there o commend me to an israelite royal and privileged hungarian robbery

so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little willy thats dead to tell her choking with bloody foolery and shaking blooms hand doing the tragic to tell her that shake hands brother youre a rogue and im another

—let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as i hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour but should i have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness

—no rejoined the other i appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup

—then suffer me to take your hand said he the goodness of your heart i feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were i to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech

and off with him and out trying to walk straight boosed at five oclock night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the bobby 14a blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups and calling himself a frenchy for the shawls joseph manuo and talking against the catholic religion and he serving mass in adam and eves when he was young with his eyes shut who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and smugging and the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another how is your testament have you got an old testament only paddy was passing there i tell you what then see him of a sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady jack mooneys sister and the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples gob jack made him toe the line told him if he didnt patch up the pot jesus hed kick the shite out of him

so terry brought the three pints

—here says joe doing the honours here citizen

—slan leat says he

—fortune joe says i good health citizen

gob he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already want a small fortune to keep him in drinks

—who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty alf says joe

—friend of yours says alf

—nannan says joe the mimber

—i wont mention any names says alf

—i thought so says joe i saw him up at that meeting now with william field m p the cattle traders

—hairy iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own

so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue because he was up one time in a knackers yard walking about with his book and pencil heres my head and my heels are coming till joe cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier mister knowall teach your grandmother how to milk ducks pisser burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with mrs odowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her couldnt loosen her farting strings but old cods eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it whats your programme today ay humane methods because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesnt cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently gob hed have a soft hand under a hen

—anyhow says joe field and nannetti are going over tonight to london to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons

—are you sure says bloom the councillor is going i wanted to see him as it happens

—well hes going off by the mailboat says joe tonight

—thats too bad says bloom i wanted particularly perhaps only mr field is going i couldnt phone no youre sure

—nannans going too says joe the league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding irish games in the park what do you think of that citizen the sluagh na heireann

mr cowe conacre multifarnham nat arising out of the question of my honourable friend the member for shillelagh may i ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition

mr allfours tamoshant con honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house i feel i cannot usefully add anything to that the answer to the honourable members question is in the affirmative

mr orelli oreilly montenotte nat have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play irish games in the phoenix park

mr allfours the answer is in the negative

mr cowe conacre has the right honourable gentlemans famous mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the treasury bench o o

mr allfours i must have notice of that question

mr staylewit buncombe ind dont hesitate to shoot

ironical opposition cheers

the speaker order order

the house rises cheers

—theres the man says joe that made the gaelic sports revival there he is sitting there the man that got away james stephens the champion of all ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot what was your best throw citizen

—na bacleis says the citizen letting on to be modest there was a time i was as good as the next fellow anyhow

—put it there citizen says joe you were and a bloody sight better

—is that really a fact says alf

—yes says bloom thats well known did you not know that

so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that and of course bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rowers heart violent exercise was bad i declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom look at bloom do you see that straw thats a straw declare to my aunt hed talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady

a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of brian ociarnains in sraid na bretaine bheag under the auspices of sluagh na heireann on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture as understood in ancient greece and ancient rome and ancient ireland for the development of the race the venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions after an instructive discourse by the chairman a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic forefathers the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue mr joseph mcarthy hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes practised morning and evening by finn maccool as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages l bloom who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis evergreen verses happily too familiar to need recalling here a nation once again in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself the irish carusogaribaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it his superb highclass vocalism which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions the proceedings then terminated

amongst the clergy present were the very rev william delany s j l l d the rt rev gerald molloy d d the rev p j kavanagh c s sp the rev t waters c c the rev john m ivers p p the rev p j cleary o s f the rev l j hickey o p the very rev fr nicholas o s f c the very rev b gorman o d c the rev t maher s j the very rev james murphy s j the rev john lavery v f the very rev william doherty d d the rev peter fagan o m the rev t brangan o s a the rev j flavin c c the rev m a hackett c c the rev w hurley c c the rt rev mgr mmanus v g the rev b r slattery o m i the very rev m d scally p p the rev f t purcell o p the very rev timothy canon gorman p p the rev j flanagan c c the laity included p fay t quirke etc etc

—talking about violent exercise says alf were you at that keoghbennett match

—no says joe

—i heard so and so made a cool hundred quid over it says alf

—who blazes says joe

and says bloom

—what i meant about tennis for example is the agility and training the eye

—ay blazes says alf he let out that myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time

—we know him says the citizen the traitors son we know what put english gold in his pocket

—true for you says joe

and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood asking alf

—now dont you think bergan

—myler dusted the floor with him says alf heenan and sayers was only a bloody fool to it handed him the father and mother of a beating see the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping god he gave him one last puck in the wind queensberry rules and all made him puke what he never ate

it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns handicapped as he was by lack of poundage dublins pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft the final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions the welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pets nose and myler came on looking groggy the soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of bennetts jaw the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him with a left hook the body punch being a fine one the men came to handigrips myler quickly became busy and got his man under the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes myler punishing him the englishman whose right eye was nearly closed took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in jigtime it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it the two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high the referee twice cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch after a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponents mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to battling bennetts stomach flooring him flat it was a knockout clean and clever amid tense expectation the portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennetts second ole pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight

—he knows which side his bread is buttered says alf i hear hes running a concert tour now up in the north

and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity the daughter of the skies the virgin moon being then in her first quarter it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law there master courtenay sitting in his own chamber gave his rede and master justice andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday vintner deceased versus livingstone an infant of unsound mind and another and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer and he sat him there about the hour of five oclock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar for every tribe one man of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian there being in all twelve good men and true and he conjured them by him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss the book and they rose in their seats those twelve of iar and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor

—those are nice things says the citizen coming over here to ireland filling the country with bugs

so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe telling him he neednt trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to mr crawford and so joe swore high and holy by this and by that hed do the devil and all

—a dishonoured wife says the citizen thats whats the cause of all our misfortunes

—and here she is says alf that was giggling over the police gazette with terry on the counter in all her warpaint

—well says the citizen whats the latest from the scene of action what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the irish language

onolan clad in shining armour low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen how that the grave elders of the most obedient city second of the realm had met them in the tholsel and there after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal had taken solemn counsel whereby they might if so be it might be bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided gael

—its on the march says the citizen to hell with the bloody brutal sassenachs and their patois

so j j puts in a word doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the nelson policy putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation and bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation

—their syphilisation you mean says the citizen to hell with them the curse of a goodfornothing god light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores gets no music and no art and no literature worthy of the name any civilisation they have they stole from us tonguetied sons of bastards ghosts

—conspuez les anglais perfide albion

he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and uttering his tribal slogan lamh dearg abu he drank to the undoing of his foes a race of mighty valorous heroes rulers of the waves who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods

—whats up with you says i to lenehan you look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner

—an imperial yeomanry says lenehan to celebrate the occasion

—half one terry says john wyse and a hands up terry are you asleep

—yes sir says terry small whisky and bottle of allsop right sir

hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public picture of a butting match trying to crack their bloody skulls one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate and another one black beast burned in omaha ga a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him gob they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job

—but what about the fighting navy says ned that keeps our foes at bay

—ill tell you what about it says the citizen hell upon earth it is read the revelations thats going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at portsmouth a fellow writes that calls himself disgusted one

so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out howling for his ma and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun

—a rump and dozen says the citizen was what that old ruffian sir john beresford called it but the modern gods englishman calls it caning on the breech

and says john wyse

—tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance

then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder

—thats your glorious british navy says the citizen that bosses the earth

the fellows that never will be slaves with the only hereditary chamber on the face of gods earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons thats the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs

—on which the sun never rises says joe

—and the tragedy of it is says the citizen they believe it the unfortunate yahoos believe it

they believe in rod the scourger almighty creator of hell upon earth and in jacky tar the son of a gun who was conceived of unholy boast born of the fighting navy suffered under rump and dozen was scarified flayed and curried yelled like bloody hell the third day he arose again from the bed steered into haven sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid

—but says bloom isnt discipline the same everywhere i mean wouldnt it be the same here if you put force against force

didnt i tell you as true as im drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp hed try to downface you that dying was living

—well put force against force says the citizen we have our greater ireland beyond the sea they were driven out of house and home in the black 47 their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as redskins in america even the grand turk sent us his piastres but the sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro ay they drove out the peasants in hordes twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships but those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage and they will come again and with a vengeance no cravens the sons of granuaile the champions of kathleen ni houlihan

—perfectly true says bloom but my point was

—we are a long time waiting for that day citizen says ned since the poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at killala

—ay says john wyse we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us against the williamites and they betrayed us remember limerick and the broken treatystone we gave our best blood to france and spain the wild geese fontenoy eh and sarsfield and odonnell duke of tetuan in spain and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria teresa but what did we ever get for it

—the french says the citizen set of dancing masters do you know what it is they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland arent they trying to make an entente cordiale now at tay pays dinnerparty with perfidious albion firebrands of europe and they always were

—conspuez les français says lenehan nobbling his beer

—and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians says joe havent we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch thats dead

jesus i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her blind drunk in her royal palace every night of god old vic with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about ehren on the rhine and come where the boose is cheaper

—well says j j we have edward the peacemaker now

—tell that to a fool says the citizen theres a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo edward guelphwettin

—and what do you think says joe of the holy boys the priests and bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic majestys racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode the earl of dublin no less

—they ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself says little alf

—considerations of space influenced their lordships decision

—will you try another citizen says joe

—yes sir says he i will

—you says joe

—beholden to you joe says i may your shadow never grow less

—repeat that dose says joe

bloom was talking and talking with john wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about

—persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it perpetuating national hatred among nations

—but do you know what a nation means says john wyse

—yes says bloom

—what is it says john wyse

—a nation says bloom a nation is the same people living in the same place

—by god then says ned laughing if thats so im a nation for im living in the same place for the past five years

so of course everyone had the laugh at bloom and says he trying to muck out of it

—or also living in different places

—that covers my case says joe

—what is your nation if i may ask says the citizen

—ireland says bloom i was born here ireland

the citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and gob he spat a red bank oyster out of him right in the corner

—after you with the push joe says he taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry

—here you are citizen says joe take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words

the muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient irish facecloth attributed to solomon of droma and manus tomaltach og macdonogh authors of the book of ballymote was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration no need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces the acme of art wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol a bogoak sceptre a north american puma a far nobler king of beasts than the british article be it said in passing a kerry calf and a golden eagle from carrantuohill the scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the barmecides glendalough the lovely lakes of killarney the ruins of clonmacnois cong abbey glen inagh and the twelve pins irelands eye the green hills of tallaght croagh patrick the brewery of messrs arthur guinness son and company limited lough neaghs banks the vale of ovoca isoldes tower the mapas obelisk sir patrick duns hospital cape clear the glen of aherlow lynchs castle the scotch house rathdown union workhouse at loughlinstown tullamore jail castleconnel rapids kilballymacshonakill the cross at monasterboice jurys hotel s patricks purgatory the salmon leap maynooth college refectory curleys hole the three birthplaces of the first duke of wellington the rock of cashel the bog of allen the henry street warehouse fingals cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time

—show us over the drink says i which is which

—thats mine says joe as the devil said to the dead policeman

—and i belong to a race too says bloom that is hated and persecuted also now this very moment this very instant

gob he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar

—robbed says he plundered insulted persecuted taking what belongs to us by right at this very moment says he putting up his fist sold by auction in morocco like slaves or cattle

—are you talking about the new jerusalem says the citizen

—im talking about injustice says bloom

—right says john wyse stand up to it then with force like men

thats an almanac picture for you mark for a softnosed bullet old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun gob hed adorn a sweepingbrush so he would if he only had a nurses apron on him and then he collapses all of a sudden twisting around all the opposite as limp as a wet rag

—but its no use says he force hatred history all that thats not life for men and women insult and hatred and everybody knows that its the very opposite of that that is really life

—what says alf

—love says bloom i mean the opposite of hatred i must go now says he to john wyse just round to the court a moment to see if martin is there if he comes just say ill be back in a second just a moment

whos hindering you and off he pops like greased lightning

—a new apostle to the gentiles says the citizen universal love

—well says john wyse isnt that what were told love your neighbour

—well joe says i your very good health and song more power citizen

—hurrah there says joe

—the blessing of god and mary and patrick on you says the citizen

and he ups with his pint to wet his whistle

—we know those canters says he preaching and picking your pocket what about sanctimonious cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of drogheda to the sword with the bible text god is love pasted round the mouth of his cannon the bible did you read that skit in the united irishman today about that zulu chief thats visiting england

—whats that says joe

so the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out

—a delegation of the chief cotton magnates of manchester was presented yesterday to his majesty the alaki of abeakuta by gold stick in waiting lord walkup of walkup on eggs to tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of british traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions the delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the british chaplain the reverend ananias praisegod barebones tendered his best thanks to massa walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between abeakuta and the british empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of god and the secret of englands greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the royal donor the alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast black and white from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty kakachakachak surnamed forty warts after which he visited the chief factory of cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands

—widow woman says ned i wouldnt doubt her wonder did he put that bible to the same use as i would

—same only more so says lenehan and thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly

—is that by griffith says john wyse

—no says the citizen its not signed shanganagh its only initialled p

—and a very good initial too says joe

—thats how its worked says the citizen trade follows the flag

—well says j j if theyre any worse than those belgians in the congo free state they must be bad did you read that report by a man whats this his name is

—casement says the citizen hes an irishman

—yes thats the man says j j raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them

—i know where hes gone says lenehan cracking his fingers

—who says i

—bloom says he the courthouse is a blind he had a few bob on throwaway and hes gone to gather in the shekels

—is it that whiteeyed kaffir says the citizen that never backed a horse in anger in his life

—thats where hes gone says lenehan i met bantam lyons going to back that horse only i put him off it and he told me bloom gave him the tip bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on hes the only man in dublin has it a dark horse

—hes a bloody dark horse himself says joe

so anyhow when i got back they were at it dingdong john wyse saying it was bloom gave the ideas for sinn fein to griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling irish industries robbing peter to pay paul gob that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show give us a bloody chance god save ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout mr bloom with his argol bargol and his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds old methusalem bloom the robbing bagman that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds loans by post on easy terms any amount of money advanced on note of hand distance no object no security gob hes like lanty machales goat thatd go a piece of the road with every one

—well its a fact says john wyse and theres the man now thatll tell you all about it martin cunningham

sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton pensioner out of the collector generals an orangeman blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the country at the kings expense

our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys

—ho varlet cried he who by his mien seemed the leader of the party saucy knave to us

so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice

mine host came forth at the summons girding him with his tabard

an instantaneous change overspread the landlords visage

—cry you mercy gentlemen he said humbly an you be the kings messengers god shield his majesty you shall not want for aught the kings friends god bless his majesty shall not go afasting in my house i warrant me

—then about cried the traveller who had not spoken a lusty trencherman by his aspect hast aught to give us

mine host bowed again as he made answer

—what say you good masters to a squab pigeon pasty some collops of venison a saddle of veal widgeon with crisp hogs bacon a boars head with pistachios a bason of jolly custard a medlar tansy and a flagon of old rhenish

—gadzooks cried the last speaker that likes me well pistachios

—off with you says

martin to the jarvey

the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set the spinnaker to larboard a many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and clinging to the sides of the noble bark they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair even so did they come and set them those willing nymphs the undying sisters and they laughed sporting in a circle of their foam and the bark clave the waves

but begob i was just lowering the heel of the pint when i saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door puffing and blowing with the dropsy and he cursing the curse of cromwell on him bell book and candle in irish spitting and spatting out of him and joe and little alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him
