sometime in the summer of 96
i was off on a road trip
a couple hundred bucks and a case of beer
outside panama city limits is where it all begins

verse 2
200 am i saw hazard lights
appeared to be a dame distressed in the night
she was 56 and damn she was built
i slammed on the brakes and got sideways and told her to get in

verse 3
she said where you headed to the city
i said yeah im gonna have some fun
she tossed her hair back in confidence
and said mind if i come

verse 4
two days later we aint left the room
did all in there that we could think to do
i could see she was restless so we hit the town
ended up at a place where the windows read
tattoos piercings belly rings here
tattoos piercings belly rings here

into the back she went and disappeared
reappeared an hour late cheesing ear to ear
i thought hell i need to try and get back there
when she unzipped her pants and said looky here

chorus
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
the blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
and the red is for the color were bout to paint this town
ooh i gotta new tattoo

verse 5
one week passed woke up a day late for work
i found my goodtime gone and she took my shirt
drove by all the places that we had been
there was one where the windows read
tattoos piercings belly rings here
tattoos piercings belly rings here

prechorus
into the back i went and disappeared
reappeared an hour later cheesing ear to ear
chorus
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
the blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
and the red is for the color were bout to paint this town
oooh i gotta new tattoo

prechorus
and i cannot forget
that smile when she said

chorus
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
i got a brand new tattoo
all the colors in it remind me of you
the blue is for the bruise that you left in my heart
and the red is for the color were bout to paint this town
oooh i gotta new tattoo
