something to chief to something to chief to bro smoked out
chiefin on a blunt smellin like indo smoked out
sit back relax and chill and meditate smoked out
rolling in my city making cheese feeling straight smoked out

chiefin on a blunt smellin like indo smoked out
sit back relax and chill and meditate smoked out
rolling in my city making cheese feeling straight smoked out

verse 1 cut throat van gogh
ayy its that north north player boy these pills aint no bayer smoked out
and this weed like an onion you can smell it in the air smoked out
cutthroat van gogh licky the picture painter smoked out
my ho want me to save her but at best i might betray her
i was never one to fit in why would i bring a kid in smoked out
this world fucked up and hard enough to just exist in smoked out
riding around with that glock thinking should i blow my tizzop smoked out
one last way to ball kill myself while getting mizzouth smoked out

crim is fucking sober but i smoke enough weed for the both of us smoked out
honey games my lungs are stained just numb my brain i cant focus smoked out
suppressing my emotions turn em into concrete smoked out
let em sink to the bottom of the ocean
matter fact ill turn em into raw meat let the sharks eat smoked out
gut the gar please i need to smoke fuck again im losing focus smoked out
hit the weed so i can go to sleep i hate having dreams smoked out
theyre always fucked up and i wake up trying to breathe smoked out
