the sound that leads me home again
it sparks up the fire a flame that still burns
to you i will always return

i know the road is long but where you are is home
wherever you stay ill find the way
ill run like the river ill follow the sun
i fly like an eagle to where i belong

i cant stand the distance i cant dream alone
i cant wait to see you yes im on my way home

and now i know its true
my every road leads to you
and in the hour of darkness
your light gets me through

you run like the river you shine like the sun yeah
you fly like an eagle
yeah you are the one
ive seen every sunset
and with all that ive learned
