i cant live another life
spend another time
i cant spit another rhyme on gaia
guns and wars wont stop the fights
not inside your mind
love and communion theres nothing better
your cheeks get redder
theres nothing better
even in rough weather
its raining knives like all the time
and im alive irayo eywa were alive

chorus
marceline im coming to get you girl
were flying so high catch a ride on lady unicorn
marceline i know youre not real in this dimension i mean
oh

verse 2
whats up with your dad up in the nightosphere
your tears theyre cleansing all my spheres
you touch my hair im playing on your bass
but we dont care were messing up your space
you got nowhere to live but youll go back to space
huh take me with you
im sick of mildew
im sick of all of these humans telling me what to do
they make you stupid but we are from nibiru
remember your cosmic roots
