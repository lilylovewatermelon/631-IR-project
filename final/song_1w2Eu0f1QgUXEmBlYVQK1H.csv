im feeling lonely
i need you closer
your heart is distant
and will not listen
what will it take to reach you
ill travel beyond
the weakened threshold
to keep you safe from
your suffering

verse 2
you always told me
you wanted closure
with no resistance
i said its over
release my feelings from your mind
the nightmares ending
i will not suffer
this place is home now
i let you goyou might also like1embed"
