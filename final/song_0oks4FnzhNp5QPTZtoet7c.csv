when i was fifteen sixteen when i really started to play guitar
i definitely wanted to become a musician
it was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
that i didnt see any chance because
i was living in a little town was studying
and when i finally broke away from school and became a musician
i thought well now i may have a little bit of a chance
because all i really wanted to do is music
and not only play music but compose music
at that time in germany in 69 70 they had already discotheques
so i would take my car would go to a discotheque
sing maybe thirty minutes
i think i had about seven eight songs
i would partially sleep in the car
because i didnt want to drive home and that helped me for about
almost two years to survive in the beginning
i wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s
the sounds of the 60s of the 70s
and then have a sound of the future
and i said wait a second i know the synthesizer
why dont i use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future
and i didnt have any idea what to do
but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the 24track
which then was synced to the moog modular
i knew that could be a sound of the future
but i didnt realize how much the impact would be
my name is giovanni giorgio
but everybody calls me giorgio

spoken word giorgio moroder
once you free your mind about a concept of
harmony and of music being correct
you can do whatever you want
so nobody told me what to do
and there was no preconception of what to do40embed"
