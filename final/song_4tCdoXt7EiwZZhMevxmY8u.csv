in the south land theres a city
way down on the river
where the women are very pretty
and all the men deliver
they got music its always playin
start in the day time go all through the night
when you hear that music playin
hear what im saying and make ya feel alright

chorus
grab somebody come on down
bring your paintbrush were paintin the town
oh theres some sweetness goin round
catch it down in new orleans

verse 2
we got magic good and bad
make you happy or make you real sad
get everything you want or lose what you had
down here in new orleans

chorus
hey partner dont be shy
come on down here and give us a try
you wanna do some livin before you die
do it down in new orleans
you might also likeoutro
stately homes and mansions
of the sugar barons and the cotton kings
rich people poor people all got dreams
dreams do come true in new orleansembed"
