earl on the beat

chorus
im only getting in where i fit in
this is a twoseater you cannot sit in
i got a dub in the rear end
i got caught when i fucked her friend
say i wouldnt do it and did it again
i got some dogs who want me to win
went to the lot and bought a new benz
i hit the gas im gone with the wind
im only getting in where i fit in
this is a twoseater you cannot sit in
i got a dub in the rear end
i got caught when i fucked her friend
say i wouldnt do it and did it again
i got some dogs who want me to win
went to the lot and bought a new benz
i hit the gas im gone with the wind

verse 1
i had a carbon i was fifteen
we tryna steal and rob everything
i cant even talk about what i seen
im never telling the laws a thing
made it out alive cant even lie that shit was awesome nigga
shootouts i aint had no bullets i had to call some niggas
lost lil juan in the middle of the summer that shit was awful nigga
as soon as we found out some witness who tell us who did it we gon off them nigga
had to cut off a couple niggas i thought was with me tried to cross a nigga
these niggas think they can just come and kick shit in my city its gon cost them niggas
jumped in the game and went got me some millions no cap
i made a wave for us
them bitches werent fucking with me when i didnt have no money now they cant wait to fuck
every one of my lil buddies mama know we thuggin thats why they pray for us
i was in the back of the bach like rosa parks
me and my dogs on tec a four or more
grind every day like it aint no tomorrow
i was just broke aint going back
ima run mines up to the max
i want the cheese aint fuckin with rats

if she dont give me head aint texting her back
im a dog i go deep in the cat

putting on for the hood like im white boy marco or something
super fast car super bad broad everybody know a nigga getting money
couple homies switched up on me when i blowed up now i look at them funny
i put the four on my back with no shirt on
i let the homies get bags for the low low
we sending bricks out the spot this the ozone
im the man rest in peace shawty lo
i take the whole gang on the road
long way from in front of the store
they dont wanna fly they wanna hit the road
they wanna take pistols to all of my shows
we thuggin in public wherever we go
i did some shit that dont nobody know
