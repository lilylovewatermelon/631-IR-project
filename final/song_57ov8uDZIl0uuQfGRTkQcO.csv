the principal issue in this appeal is whether the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions authorize the exercise of the eminent domain power in furtherance of a significant economic development plan that is projected to create in excess of 1000 jobs to increase tax and other revenues and to revitalize an economically distressed city including its downtown and waterfront areas the plaintiffs2 owners of certain real property in the city of new london appeal3 from the judgment of the trial court denying their request for permanent injunctive relief to prevent the defendants the city of new london city a municipal corporation and the new london development corporation development corporation a private nonprofit economic development corporation from exercising eminent domain authority to condemn the plaintiffs properties located on parcel 3 of the development corporations municipal development plan development plan the defendants cross appeal4 from the judgment of the trial court granting the plaintiffs request for permanent injunctive relief with respect to those properties located on parcel 4a of the development plan

on appeal the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that 1 the taking of the plaintiffs land was authorized under chapter 132 of the general statutes 2 economic development constitutes a valid public use under the takings clauses of the state and federal constitutions and that these takings will sufficiently benefit the public and bear reasonable assurances of future public use 3 the delegation of the eminent domain power to the development corporation was not unconstitutional 4 the taking of the plaintiffs land on parcel 3 was reasonably necessary to the development plan and 5 the development corporation by allowing a private social club but not the plaintiffs properties to remain on parcel 3 did not violate the plaintiffs federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws we affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to the claims presented in the plaintiffs appeal

on their cross appeal the defendants contend that the trial court improperly concluded that 1 the condemnation of the plaintiffs properties on parcel 4a was not reasonably necessary to accomplish the development plan and 2 the citys general power to widen and alter its roadways did not justify the taking of the plaintiffs properties on parcel 4a we reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the defendants cross appeal

the record reveals the following background facts and procedural history as aptly set forth in the trial courts comprehensive memorandum of decision in 1978 the development corporation was established to assist the city in planning economic development in january 1998 the state bond commission authorized bonds to support planning activities in the fort trumbull area of the city and property acquisition to be undertaken by the development corporation in support of the project and other money toward the ultimate creation of a state park at fort trumbull in february 1998 pfizer inc pfizer announced that it was developing a global research facility on the    new london mills site which is adjacent to the fort trumbull area in april 1998 the new london city council gave initial approval to prepare a development plan for the fort trumbull area and the development corporation began holding informal neighborhood meetings regarding the development plan process in may 1998 the city council authorized the development corporation to proceed under chapters 130 132 andor 588 l of the general statutes

the state bond commission approved more funds for the development corporation activity in june 1998 the city formally conveyed the new london mills site to pfizer in july 1998 a consulting team was appointed for the state environmental protection act process and to prepare the development plan six alternative plans for the project area were considered as part of the required environmental impact evaluation

the development plan area is approximately ninety acres in size and is located on the thames river in new london adjacent to the proposed fort trumbull state park and the pfizer global research facility which opened in june 2001 see appendix to this opinion it presently includes residential and commercial areas and is comprised of approximately 115 land parcels the development plan area also includes the presently closed united states naval undersea warfare center which is thirtytwo acres and also the regional water pollution control facility

in its preface to the development plan the development corporation stated that its goals were to create a development that would complement the facility that pfizer was planning to build create jobs increase tax and other revenues encourage public access to and use of the citys waterfront and eventually build momentum for the revitalization of the rest of the city including its downtown area

the development plan itself is divided into seven parcels of land parcel 1 will include a waterfront hotel and conference center along with marinas for both transient tourist boaters and commercial fishing vessels parcel 1 also will include a public walkway along the waterfront parcel 2 will provide for approximately eighty new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development plan including the fort trumbull state park space will be reserved at the southern end of parcel 2 for the united states coast guard museum museum which will be moved to the development plan area from the nearby united states coast guard academy

parcel 3 is projected to have at least 90000 square feet of high technology research and development office space and parking5 this office space would be located close to other research and development facilities including those of pfizer the location of parcel 3 allows for direct vehicular access to the development therein obviating the need for that traffic to pass through the rest of the development area parcel 3 also will retain the existing italian dramatic club a private social organization with its own building four properties owned by three of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 3

parcel 4 is subdivided into two smaller parcels 4a and 4b parcel 4a is designated for park support it will provide parking or retail services for the adjacent state park parcel 4b will include a marina which will be a renovation of an existing marina and include slips for both recreational boating and commercial fishing operations the walkway will be continued through these parcels eleven properties owned by four of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 4a
parcel 5 also is subdivided into three separate parcels which cumulatively will include 140000 square feet of office space parking and retail space parcel 6 will be developed for a variety of waterdependent commercial uses parcel 7 is small and will be used for additional office or research and development use

according to admiral david goebel chief operating officer of the development corporation the development corporation will own the land located within the development area the development corporation will enter into ground leases of various parcels to private developers those leases will require the developer to comply with the terms of the development plan at the time of trial the development corporation was negotiating with corcoran jennison a developer with the intention of entering into a ninetynine year ground lease of parcels 1 2 and 3 with the developer under the lease corcoran jennison will pay the development corporation rent of 1 per year corcoran jennison will actually develop the parcels a process that includes marketing for and locating tenants

the development corporation estimated that the development plan which is a composite of the most beneficial features of six alternate development plans that it had considered6 would have a significant socioeconomic impact on the new london region the development plan is expected to generate approximately between 1 518 and 867 construction jobs 2 718 and 1362 direct jobs and 3 500 and 940 indirect jobs the composite parcels of the development plan also are expected to generate between 680544 and 1249843 in property tax revenues for the city in which 54 percent of the land area is exempt from property taxes these gains would occur in a city that with the exception of the new pfizer facility adjacent to the development plan area that now employs approximately 2000 people recently has experienced serious employment declines particularly with the loss of approximately 1900 government sector positions and the closure of the united states naval undersea warfare center in 1996 which transferred more than 1000 positions to newport rhode island7 indeed the state office of policy and management has designated the city a distressed municipality

the development corporation board approved the development plan in early 2000 the city council also approved it shortly thereafter8 when it approved the development plan in january 2000 the city council also had authorized the development corporation to acquire properties within the development area thereafter in october 2000 the development corporation voted to use the power of eminent domain to acquire properties within the development area whose owners had not been willing to sell them in november 2000 the development corporation filed the condemnation proceedings that gave rise to the actions presently on appeal thereafter in december 2000 the plaintiffs brought the present action challenging the condemnations

the trial court noted in its memorandum of decision that each of the plaintiffs testified and said they wished to remain in their homes for a variety of personal reasons two of the people referred to the fact that their families have lived in their homes for decades they all testified that they loved their homes and the fort trumbull area several have put a lot of work into their property and all of them appeared    to be sincerely attached to their homes one owner susette kelo loved the view her house afforded her and the fact that it was close to the water all testified that they were not opposed to new development in the fort trumbull area also two of the plaintiffs own their property as business investments—the rental of apartments these two people have put much time money and effort into renovating their properties one has owned his property for seventeen years the other for about eight years

after a seven day bench trial the court granted permanent injunctive relief to and dismissed the pending eminent domain actions against the four plaintiffs who live on parcel 4a of the development plan the court however upheld the takings of the parcel 3 properties9 this appeal and cross appeal followed additional facts and procedural history will be set forth in greater detail as necessary for the resolution of this appeali

whether chapter 132 of the general statutes applies to nonvacant landsand therefore authorized the taking of the plaintiffs landthe plaintiffs first claim is that the trial court improperly determined that the development corporation has the authority to condemn the plaintiffs property under chapter 132 of the general statutes10 the plaintiffs contend that chapter 132 general statutes § 8186 et seq applies only to unified land and water areas and vacated commercial plants and that their homes fit neither of those categories because under the language and legislative history of chapter 132 the statutory term unified land and water areas refers only to undeveloped land the defendants claim in response that in the context of the statutory language of the entire chapter the term unified land and water areas includes developed land and moreover to conclude otherwise would frustrate the declared legislative purpose of restoring the states economic health we agree with the defendants

we begin our analysis by reviewing the conclusions of the trial court on this issue the trial court noted that it was undisputed that the development corporation attempted to exercise its eminent domain powers pursuant to only chapter 132 of the general statutes and stated that it would construe the eminent domain statutes strictly against the condemning authority the trial court rejected the plaintiffs arguments that chapter 132 applies only to 1 multimunicipality districts and 2 undeveloped land other than vacated commercial plants the court conducted a thorough analysis of the chapters language and legislative history and concluded that references throughout the chapter to structures and demolition as well as the requirement in general statutes § 8189 f that a plan exist for relocating project area occupants indicated that the chapter applies to developed land as well as vacant land in so concluding the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that the subsequent addition of vacated commercial plants to the chapter was necessary because otherwise the statute would apply only to vacant land11

we first set forth the applicable standard of review and the process by which we interpret statutes statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary internal quotation marks omitted grondin v curi 262 conn 637 649 817 a2d 61 2003 the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature    in other words we seek to determine in a reasoned manner the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of the case including the question of whether the language actually does apply in seeking to determine that meaning we look to the words of the statute itself to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment to the legislative policy it was designed to implement and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter12 internal quotation marks omitted commissioner of social services v smith 265 conn 723 734 830 a2d 228 2003

we begin our analysis of this claim by reviewing the language of the relevant sections of chapter 132 of the general statutes the chapter begins with general statutes § 818613 which is the legislative declaration of policy recognizing that the states economic welfare is dependent on the growth of industry and business     section 8186 provides inter alia that permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes    are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination14 emphasis added general statutes § 818715 is the chapters definitions section providing most significantly that real property means land subterranean or subsurface rights structures any and all easements air rights and franchises and every estate right or interest therein     emphasis added general statutes § 8187 9 general statutes § 818916 describes the requirements that the development agency must follow in preparing the mandatory project plan which include providing a plan for relocating projectarea occupants     general statutes § 8189 f general statutes § 819317 permits the development agency to acquire real property within the project area including through the exercise of the eminent domain power as authorized by the city council general statutes § 819818 provides for the promulgation of regulations to carry out the provisions of chapter 132 finally general statutes § 819919 provides that all actions taken by the development agency are taken in the name of the municipality

the statutory term whose meaning is in dispute is unified land and water areas general statutes § 8186 a phrase that is not defined expressly in any section of chapter 132 of the general statutes thus in construing the term we look to its commonly approved usage an inquiry that often is enhanced by the examination of dictionary definitions see eg hasselt v lufthansa german airlines 262 conn 416 425 815 a2d 94 2003 utilizing merriamwebsters collegiate dictionary definition to construe statutory term including see also general statutes § 11 a merriamwebsters third new international dictionary defines unified as the adjective form of unify which means make into a coherent group or whole     accordingly we conclude that as used in § 8186 of chapter 132 a unified land and water area is one that exists because of the combination of separate land parcels into a unitary development scheme20 a definition that undisputedly fits the fort trumbull development plan in the present case this definition however does not resolve the issue of whether a unified land and water area under chapter 132 is limited to vacant land accordingly we must continue our analysis by examining the term in the context of both the language of the chapter as a whole and the legislative history

we conclude that the term unified land and water areas in § 8186 is not limited to vacant land the language and legislative history of chapter 132 of the general statutes in its entirety are replete with references that compel this conclusion for example § 8187 9 the chapters definition of real property includes structures expressly within its ambit see footnote 15 of this opinion moreover the legislative history indicates that § 8187 9 was enacted as public acts 1980 no 8018 to clarify the meanings of the terms land and real property as used in chapter 132 and to make them consistent with the definitions provided in chapter 130 of the general statutes the urban renewal statutes21 see 23 hr proc pt 2 1980 sess p 453 remarks of representative joseph j farricielli this bill would attempt to remove confusing language defining land and the real property in chapter 132 as compared to chapter 130 of the general statutes it would clarify the meaning of real property as applied to state assisted municipal industrial development rights see also 23 s proc pt 3 1980 sess pp 66061 remarks of senator sanford cloud jr same even more significantly § 8193 a which provides authorization for the acquisition of real property by eminent domain see footnote 17 of this opinion does not include or exclude any specific type of real property leaving us only to conclude that the power applies to real property as broadly defined in § 8187 9

another probative definition is that of development project which is defined as a project conducted by a municipality for the assembly improvement and disposition of land or buildings or both to be used principally for industrial or business purposes and includes vacated commercial plants     emphasis added general statutes § 8187 4 this definition is significant because the use of the word includes in the phrase includes vacated commercial plants indicates firmly that vacated commercial plants are not the only structures contemplated by the legislature as potentially present in a development area see hasselt v lufthansa german airlines supra 262 conn 42425 court construed general statutes § 31307a c which imposes liability on the second injury fund to reimburse employers for adjustments including lumpsum payments     construing the word including according to its ordinary usage however must mean that the fund is required as well to reimburse employers for something other than those retroactive cost of living adjustments paid in a lump sum citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted
moreover § 8189 which describes the requirements that the development agency must follow in preparing the required project plan requires the agency to provide a plan for relocating projectarea occupants     general statutes § 8189 f see footnote 16 of this opinion this is a requirement that by definition contradicts the plaintiffs argument that unified land and water areas is limited to vacant land it is axiomatic that vacant land has no occupants to relocate

furthermore the commissioners regulations promulgated pursuant to § 8198 support the conclusion that unified land and water areas under chapter 132 of the general statutes include occupied and indeed residential land section 819810 of the regulations of connecticut state agencies22 the regulation providing for the determination of funding for development grants provides that the amount of funds available to a municipality for development grants is based on a percentage of the net project cost the net project cost is the total project cost less the estimated income from the project regs conn state agencies § 819810 a we note that one factor that may be calculated into project cost is relocation expenses regs conn state agencies § 819810 a 7 and that another factor that may be calculated into project income is income gained from the temporary use of land residences or businesses prior to their dispositions     regs conn state agencies § 819810 b 2 these regulations are particularly probative in light of the well established proposition that unless administrative regulations are shown to be inconsistent with the authorizing statute they have the force and effect of a statute internal quotation marks omitted  andersen consultingllp v gavin 255 conn 498 520 n15 767 a2d 692 2001 we particularly are persuaded by the fact that the commissioner responsible for the implementation of chapter 132 has implemented regulations pursuant to that chapter that consider expressly residences and their relocation as factors for calculating the funding of development grants cf  macdermid inc v dept of environmental protection  257 conn 128 138 778 a2d 7 2001 it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement internal quotation marks omitted

the plaintiffs claim that the text and legislative history of chapter 132 of the general statutes indicate that unified land and water areas do not include land already developed with business and residences specifically they contend that a construction of unified land and water areas that includes developed or occupied land renders the subsequent addition of vacated commercial plants superfluous they also contend that the legislative genealogy and history indicates that the legislature did not intend the term unified land and water areas to include occupied land because references within the chapter pertinent to occupied land such as those of demolition and rehabilitation were added only after the vacated commercial plant provision was enacted in 1972 finally the plaintiffs contend that construing unified land and water areas to include occupied land would be excessively broad in light of the strict construction given to eminent domain statutes we disagree with these contentions and address each in turn

we first conclude that construing unified land and water areas as including occupied land does not render the vacated commercial plants provision of § 8186 superfluous indeed the legislative history indicates that in enacting chapter 132 of the general statutes the legislature envisioned two different types of economic development plans one aimed at developing unified land areas or combinations of multiple parcels of land and the other intended to revitalize underutilized commercial buildings in introducing the bill that was enacted as public acts 1972 no 87 which added the vacant commercial plant language to chapter 132 senator lawrence j denardis stated that this bill will allow municipalities through their development agencies to acquire improve and rehabilitate vacant commercial plants at present municipalities can acquire and improve unified land areas as it is worded in the present statutes they also have the power to clear repair operate and insure real property this bill would add the additional power of rehabilitation to the list and furthermore it would add vacated commercial plants to the areas that can be dealt with or the matters that could be dealt with    the intent of this bill is to improve the economic climate of the state by furthering industry and thereby creating jobs emphasis added 15 s proc pt 2 1972 sess p 78523 put differently chapter 132 does not require that a vacated commercial plant be located within a unified land and water area they merely present two different opportunities for economic development accordingly we conclude that a construction of the term unified land and water areas in § 8186 that includes developed or occupied land does not render the 1972 addition of vacated commercial plants superfluous

we also reject the plaintiffs contention that the legislative genealogy of § 8186 indicates that the legislature did not intend unified land and water areas to include occupied land because references within chapter 132 of the general statutes pertinent to occupied land such as those to demolition and rehabilitation were added only after the vacated commercial plant provision was enacted in 1972 our reading of the legislative history and particularly the original 1967 public act contradicts the plaintiffs construction of the chapter the plaintiffs note correctly that rehabilitate was not added to the development agencys powers under § 8193 b until 1972 see public acts 1972 no 87 § 3 and that the power to demolish vacated commercial plants was not added until 1974 see public acts 1974 no 74184 § 6 b24 both of which occurred after vacated commercial plants were added to the scope of the chapter our reading however of the original 1967 public act which only provided for the development of unified land and water areas reveals that the legislature contemplated unified land and water areas as including occupied land indeed § 8189 f which requires the development agency to submit a plan for relocating projectarea occupants was included in the 1967 act25 see public acts 1967 no 760 § 4 f accordingly we disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the legislative history of § 8186 necessarily indicates that the legislature intended unified land and water areas to be limited to vacant land

we next address the plaintiffs contention that construing unified land and water areas to include occupied land would be excessively broad in light of the strict construction applied to eminent domain statutes we are mindful of the well established proposition that the authority to condemn is to be strictly construed in favor of the owner of the property taken and against the condemnor      state v mccook  109 conn 621 630 147 a 126 1929 we also note however that the statute    should be enforced in such a way as to effectuate the purpose for which it was enacted internal quotation marks omitted  pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport  259 conn 592 601602 790 a2d 1178 2002 we conclude that construing the ambiguous term unified land and water areas in § 8186 as including occupied land is not impermissibly broad indeed the language of other provisions in chapter 132 of the general statutes compels this conclusion and our review of the legislative history reveals nothing to contradict it moreover a construction limiting the application of the unified land and water areas provisions of chapter 132 to vacant land would undercut severely the chapters declared purpose of promoting economic development particularly as the states stock of vacant land diminishes this construction largely would limit the applicability of chapter 132 in urban and suburban areas to vacated commercial plants standing alone the presence of a structure in the project area that does not meet the definition of vacated commercial plant would disrupt the entire economic development plan because it would need to be built around this would make the parcels unattractive for investment by developers and would therefore thwart the declared purpose of chapter 132 see general statutes § 8186 accordingly we conclude that the trial court properly construed the term unified land and water areas in § 8186 of chapter 132 as not excluding developed or occupied landii

whether economic development is a public use under the state and federal constitutionswe next address the principal issue in this appeal which is the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the use of eminent domain for economic development does not violate the public use clauses of the state and federal constitutions specifically the plaintiffs contend that 1 economic development as contemplated in chapter 132 of the general statutes is not a public use under the state and federal constitutions 2 even if economic development is a public use the condemnations in the present case do not promote sufficient public benefit to pass constitutional muster and 3 the condemnation of parcels 3 and 4a lack a reasonable assurance of future public use because private parties retain control over the parcels use we address each contention in turnawhether economic development is a public use under the state and federal constitutionsthe plaintiffs first contention is that the trial court improperly concluded that economic development under chapter 132 of the general statutes namely the development plan in the present case is a public purpose that satisfies the public use clauses of article first § 11 of the connecticut constitution26 and the fifth amendment to the united states constitution27 specifically they claim that the condemnation of property for economic development by private parties is inconsistent with this courts prior public use decisions because 1 the new owner will not provide a public service or utility and 2 the condemnation will not remove blight conditions that are in and of themselves harmful to the public in response the defendants contend that by concluding that economic development is by itself a public use justifying the exercise of the eminent domain power the trial court properly deferred to state and municipal legislative determinations we conclude that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs increasing tax and other revenues and contributing to urban revitalization satisfy the public use clauses of the state and federal constitutions28

we begin by setting forth the applicable statutory framework the legislative determination at issue in the present case is provided by § 8186 which provides that as a matter of legislative finding and declarationthat the economic welfare of the state depends upon the continued growth of industry and business within the state that the acquisition and improvement of unified land and water areas and vacated commercial plants to meet the needs of industry and business should be in accordance with local regional and state planning objectives that such acquisition and improvement often cannot be accomplished through the ordinary operations of private enterprise at competitive rates of progress and economies of cost that permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes    are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determinationemphasis added

the trial court concluded that this language did not violate the public use clauses of either the state or the federal constitutions in so concluding the trial court relied on decisions from this court and the united states supreme court but especially  hawaii housing authority v midkiff  467 us 229 23940 104 s ct 2321 81 l ed 2d 186 1984  berman v parker  348 us 26 3132 75 s ct 98 99 l ed 27 1954  katz v brandon  156 conn 521 53234 245 a2d 579 1968  gohld realty co v hartford  141 conn 135 14143 104 a2d 365 1954 and  olmstead v camp  33 conn 532 546 1866 after reviewing the authorities the trial court concluded that both this court and the united states supreme court consistently have taken a broad purposive view of the concept of public use and accordingly have taken a deferential approach to legislative pronouncements of public use the trial court however also emphasized that the public use question is ultimately a judicial inquiry ultimately the trial court concluded that the purpose of chapter 132 of the general statutes as expressed in § 8186 see footnote 13 of this opinion was an appropriate public use that passed muster under both state and federal constitutions stating that economic growth and its encouragement especially in distressed municipalities is a valid public use because it obviously confers a benefit to all members of the public accordingly the trial court concluded that the language of chapter 132 authorizing the use of eminent domain power for the purpose of accomplishing economic development in designative project areas is not violative of the federal or state eminent domain clauses of their respective constitutions

we note that the trial court approached the plaintiffs general claim about whether economic development is a constitutional public use in the context of a facial attack on the provisions of chapter 132 of the general statutes that authorize the use of eminent domain although the plaintiffs do not argue expressly that these statutory provisions are unconstitutional we will address this particular claim as a facial attack on the constitutionality of chapter 132 inasmuch as it authorizes the use of eminent domain for private economic development accordingly we proceed from the well recognized jurisprudential principle that the party attacking a validly enacted statute    bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statutes constitutionality    the burden of proving unconstitutionality is especially heavy when as at this juncture a statute is challenged as being unconstitutional on its face citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted  state v ball  260 conn 275 28081 796 a2d 542 2002

moreover in light of the somewhat confusing constitutional posture of their principal and reply briefs29 we also take the opportunity to clarify the scope of our review of the plaintiffs constitutional claims in the present case inasmuch as the relevant public use language of the state and federal constitutions is virtually identical see footnotes 26 and 27 of this opinion the plaintiffs have not stated expressly that the connecticut constitution offers them greater protection and their claim presents an issue of first impression for this court we will address simultaneously their federal and state claims see  donahue v southington  259 conn 783 794 n7 792 a2d 76 2002 if a party does not provide an independent analysis asserting the existence of greater protection under the state constitutional provision than its federal counterpart    we will not of our own initiative address that question    accordingly the federal equal protection standard is considered prevailing for the purposes of our review of both the state and federal equal protection claims in this case internal quotation marks omitted

we now turn to the substance of the plaintiffs claims this court long has taken a flexible approach to construction of the connecticut public use clause indeed our analysis begins in 1866 when this court in  olmstead v camp supra  33 conn 532 first addressed the constitutional concept of public use in olmstead the owner of a water powered mill used for the grinding of grain petitioned the court pursuant to the flowage act for permission to make improvements to the pond and dam that powered his mill id these alterations necessarily would have resulted in flooding his neighbors land and the neighbor had refused to accept compensation from the mill owner for the privilege of flooding his land30 id 53233

this court concluded that the mill owner should be permitted to flood his neighbors land id 552 in interpreting connecticuts public use clause the court rejected a strict construction that the term public use means possession occupation direct enjoyment by the public id 546 instead it concluded that such a limitation of the intent of this important clause would be entirely different from its accepted interpretation and would prove as unfortunate as novel one of the most common meanings of the word use as defined by websters dictionary is usefulness utility advantage productive of benefit public use may therefore well mean public usefulness utility or advantage or what is productive of general benefit so that any appropriating of private property by the state under its right of eminent domain for purposes of great advantage to the community is a taking for public use such it is believed is the construction which has uniformly been put upon the language by courts legislatures and legal authorities31 emphasis added id
moreover the court in olmstead laid the foundation for our deferential approach to legislative declarations of public use stating that the question is asked with great pertinence and propriety what then is the limit of the legislative power under the clause which we have been considering and what is the exact line between public and private uses our reply is that which has heretofore been quoted from the nature of the case there can be no precise line the power requires a degree of elasticity to be capable of meeting new conditions and improvements and the ever increasing necessities of society the sole dependence must be on the presumed wisdom of the sovereign authority supervised and in cases of gross error or extreme wrong controlled by the dispassionate judgment of the courts emphasis added id 551 accord  new york nh  h r co v offield  77 conn 417 421 59 a 510 1904 in taking for railroad improvements court held that the uses to be furthered are public is a question the decision of which by the legislative department while not absolutely conclusive upon the judicial department    is entitled to very great weight

this court has continued to afford the public use clause a broad construction and repeatedly has embraced the purposive formulation first articulated in  olmstead v camp supra  33 conn 54632 in  gohld realty co v hartford supra  141 conn 139 the owner of commercial real estate challenged the constitutionality of the eminent domain provisions of the redevelopment act under which land in blighted urban areas could be taken cleared and sold or leased to redevelopers the property owner contended that use of eminent domain in this manner violated the public use clause of the state constitution id 141 utilizing the purposive definition of public use from  olmstead v camp supra  33 conn 546 this court relied on express legislative findings about the deleterious effects of urban blight and concluded that there can be no doubt that the elimination of such substandard insanitary deteriorated slum or blighted areas    is for the public welfare private property taken for the purpose of eradicating the conditions which obtain in such areas is taken for a public use  gohld realty co v hartford supra  143 moreover with respect to the provisions of the act allowing the taken land to be sold or leased to private developers the court concluded that if the public use which justifies the exercise of eminent domain in the first instance is the use of the property for purposes other than slums that same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons the public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished emphasis added id 14344

gohld realty co was followed by  katz v brandon supra  156 conn 52133 in katz a property owner brought an action to determine the validity of the taking of his home pursuant to a redevelopment plan in hartford id 523 a manufacturing corporation had a plant with an employee parking lot near the plaintiffs home id 525 the state had condemned this parking lot for the construction of an interstate highway id the corporation had offered to build a parking garage in the area should the city approve a redevelopment plan in the area id 52526 subsequently the redevelopment agency approved a redevelopment plan in the area which included the plaintiffs land id 525 the city then met with the corporation and other local manufacturers to discuss the redevelopment area which was found by the city and the agency to be blighted and unsafe id 52627 the city did not enter into an agreement with the corporation to purchase or lease any of the land the city was of the opinion that the project was necessary with or without the corporations participation id 52728 subsequently the city approved the redevelopment project and acquired title to all properties in the area by purchase or eminent domain including those of the plaintiff id 52931 the plaintiff brought an action and contended that the takings were invalid because they were taken for the private purpose of inducing the corporation to remain in hartford by providing a parking lot for its employees rather than for a public purpose id 531

this court relying on  gohld realty co v hartford supra  141 conn 143 rejected the plaintiffs argument and emphasized that the public use was the clearing of the blighted land  katz v brandon supra  156 conn 534 indeed the court in katz further broadened our approach to public use citing  barnes v new haven  140 conn 8 1516 98 a2d 523 1953 a public spending case see footnote 32 of this opinion indeed this court stated in katz thata public use defies absolute definition for it changes with varying conditions of society new appliances in the sciences changing conceptions of the scope and functions of government and other differing circumstances brought about by an increase in population and new modes of communication and transportation   courts as a rule instead of attempting judicially to define a public as distinguished from a private purpose have left each case to be determined on its own peculiar circumstances promotion of the public safety and general welfare constitutes a recognized public purpose    the modern trend of authority is to expand and liberally construe the meaning of public purpose the test of public use is not how the use is furnished but rather the right of the public to receive and enjoy its benefit citations omitted emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted  katz v brandon supra  5323334barnes v new haven supra  15 accordingly the court in katz rejected the plaintiffs argument that the redevelopment plan violated the public use requirement  katz v brandon supra 534

the united states supreme court has afforded similarly broad treatment to the federal public use clause in  berman v parker supra  348 us 2829 the supreme court addressed the constitutionality of the district of columbias redevelopment act in which congress had declared as a matter of public policy the acquisition of property necessary to eliminate blight conditions the act allowed the redevelopment agency once it acquired the property to transfer it to redevelopment companies or individuals to carry out the plan indeed private enterprise was preferred over public agencies for execution of the plan id 30 the owner of a department store in the rehabilitation area challenged the taking of his property pursuant to the plan and contended that it was unconstitutional because 1 his property was not slum housing and 2 it would be redeveloped and managed by private and not public agencies for private and not public use id 31

the supreme court concluded that the redevelopment act was a valid exercise of the police power that congress exercises over the district of columbia id 34 the court adopted the broad purposive view of eminent domain and held that the police power while generally undefinable is essentially the product of legislative determinations addressed to the purposes of government purposes neither abstractly nor historically capable of complete definition subject to specific constitutional limitations when the legislature has spoken the public interest has been declared in terms wellnigh conclusive in such cases the legislature not the judiciary is the main guardian of the public needs to be served by social legislation whether it be congress legislating concerning the district of columbia    or the states legislating concerning local affairs    this principle admits of no exception merely because the power of eminent domain is involved the role of the judiciary in determining whether that power is being exercised for a public purpose is an extremely narrow one citations omitted emphasis added id 32

moreover the court stated that once the object is within the authority of congress the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear for the power of eminent domain is merely the means to the end id 33 accordingly the court concluded that because the taking was for the public purpose of clearing blighted areas the means of redevelopment through private enterprise did not violate the public use clause35 id indeed the court also adopted a highly deferential approach to agency determination of necessity allowing the agency to take the building despite the fact that it was itself not blighted id 3334 if the agency considers it necessary in carrying out the redevelopment project to take full title to the real property involved it may do so it is not for the courts to determine whether it is necessary for successful consummation of the project that unsafe unsightly or insanitary buildings alone be taken or whether title to the land be included any more than it is the function of the courts to sort and choose among the various parcels selected for condemnation id 36 ultimately the court concluded that the rights of these property owners are satisfied when they receive that just compensation which the fifth amendment exacts as the price of the taking id

the broad purposive approach to the interpretation of the federal public use clause reached its zenith in 1984 with the supreme courts decision in  hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra  467 us 23940 in that case the hawaii state legislature had attempted to address economic problems created by severely overconcentrated land ownership that remained as a vestige of the feudal land tenure scheme developed by the original polynesian settlers id 23233 the legislature concluded that concentrated land ownership was responsible for skewing the states residential fee simple market inflating land prices and injuring the public tranquility and welfare id 232

in response to this property crisis the hawaii legislature had enacted legislation that created a mechanism for the condemnation of residential land tracts by the hawaii housing authority with subsequent transfer of the condemned fees simple to existing lessees id 233 the act provided for a hearing process to ensure that the condemnation would further the public purpose of the act id once the housing authority acquired the land and paid compensation to the landowners it was authorized to sell the land to the tenant residing there36 or to sell or lease it to other prospective purchasers id 234 the act prohibited the sale or lease of more than one lot to the same person id landowners whose land had been condemned pursuant to the act after a hearing brought an action to have the law declared unconstitutional id 235

the supreme court concluded with no trouble that the act was a constitutional exercise of the hawaii legislatures police powers because regulating oligopoly and the evils associated with it is a classic exercise of a states police powers id 24142 the court relied on  berman v parker supra  348 us 3133 and concluded that the public use requirement is thus coterminous with the scope of a sovereigns police powers  hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra  467 us 240 accordingly the court stated that where the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose this court has never held a compensated taking to be proscribed by the public use clause id 241 as applied the court concluded that the act was a comprehensive and rational approach to identifying and correcting market failure37 id 242

moreover in midkiff the supreme court reemphasized the berman theme of judicial deference to the legislative public use determination stating that the courts role in reviewing a legislatures judgment of what constitutes a public use even when the eminent domain power is equated with the police power    is    extremely narrow     internal quotation marks omitted id 240 in short the court has made clear that it will not substitute its judgment for a legislatures judgment as to what constitutes a public use unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation38 emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted id 241 the court emphasized that this deference applies equally to determinations made by both congress and the state legislatures and that judicial deference is required because in our system of government legislatures are better able to assess what public purposes should be advanced by an exercise of the taking power    thus if a legislature state or federal determines there are substantial reasons for an exercise of the taking power courts must defer to its determination that the taking will serve a public use citation omitted emphasis added id 244

our analysis of the foregoing cases reveals that this states well established approach to judicial review of legislative public use determinations first articulated more than 125 years ago in olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 54651 is in harmony with the approach of the federal courts as enunciated in hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 23940 and berman v parker supra 348 us 3132 both federal and state courts place an overwhelming emphasis on the legislative purpose and motive behind the taking and give substantial deference to the legislative determination of purpose accordingly with this standard in mind we turn to the plaintiffs specific claim which is that economic development is not by itself a public use under either the united states or connecticut constitutions

under this broad and deferential constitutional rubric we conclude that an economic development plan that the appropriate legislative authority rationally has determined will promote significant municipal economic development constitutes a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under both the federal and connecticut constitutions indeed the courts of several of our sister states using the same deferential and purposive approach to which we adhere have arrived at the same conclusion see oakland v oakland raiders 32 cal 3d 60 6972 646 p2d 835 183 cal rptr 673 1982 concluding that city was not barred as matter of law from taking professional football franchise by eminent domain in order to keep it from moving to another city remanding for complete determination of public benefit involved shreveport v chanse gas corp 794 so 2d 962 973 la app 2001 relying on berman midkiff and relevant legislative declarations to conclude that economic development in the form of a convention center and headquarters hotel satisfies the public purposes and public necessity requirement of state constitution cert denied 805 so 2d 209 la 2002 prince georges county v collington crossroads inc 275 md 171 191 339 a2d 278 1975 concluding in condemnation for industrial park that projects reasonably designed to benefit the general public by significantly enhancing the economic growth of the state or its subdivisions are public uses under state constitution at least where the exercise of the power of condemnation provides an impetus which private enterprise cannot provide poletown neighborhood council v detroit 410 mich 616 63335 304 nw2d 455 1981 a landmark case relying on legislative and redevelopment agency declarations and upholding under the state constitution the taking of private homes for the construction of a major car manufacturing assembly plant the power of eminent domain is to be used in this instance primarily to accomplish the essential public purposes of alleviating unemployment and revitalizing the economic base of the community the benefit to a private interest is merely incidental39 duluth v state 390 nw2d 757 76164 council legislative determination to conclude that construction of large privately operated paper mill that would alleviate unemployment and contribute to citys economic revitalization was public purpose justifying use of eminent domain under federal and state public use clauses kansas city v hon 972 sw2d 407 414 mo app 1998 airport expansion is public use that will be furthered by subsequent transfer of land to private aviation related corporation vitucci v new york city school construction authority 289 app div 2d 479 481 735 nys2d 560 2001 condemnee not entitled to right of first refusal when condemnor sold land to private party for new public purpose the expansion of the facilities of a major employer and economic force in the area if a municipality determines that a new business may create jobs provide infrastructure and stimulate the local economy those are legitimate public purposes which justify the use of the power of eminent domain jamestown v leevers 552 nw2d 365 369 374 nd 1996 the stimulation of commercial growth and removal of economic stagnation sought by state urban redevelopment act allowing acquisition of nonblighted urban property in furtherance of economic development are objectives satisfying the public use and purpose requirement of federal and state public use clauses reversing and remanding because trial court made no finding whether the primary object of this development project is for the economic welfare of downtown jamestown and its residents rather than for the benefit of private interests see also armendariz v penman 75 f3d 1311 1321 9th cir 1996 stating in dicta that if the city council    had by ordinance declared that a shopping center on the plaintiffs property would serve a public use by for example increasing legitimate business traffic in the area and providing jobs for neighborhood residents the city might have been able to acquire plaintiffs property through the payment of just compensation under the power of eminent domain40 99 cents only stores v lancaster redevelopment agency 237 f sup 2d 1123 112930 cd cal 2001 redevelopment agencys admitted use of eminent domain solely to satisfy private expansion demands of major anchor retailer violated federal public use clause even under deferential analysis court rejected as speculative argument that prevention of future blight upon departure of retailer was public use appeal dismissed and remanded 60 fed app 123 9th cir 2003

this line of cases is wholly consistent with the broad41 view of the public use clause that connecticut and the federal courts follow accordingly we find them persuasive and we conclude that economic development plans that the appropriate legislative authority rationally has determined will promote municipal economic development by creating new jobs increasing tax and other revenues and otherwise revitalizing distressed urban areas constitute a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under either the state or federal constitution

the plaintiffs contend that the connecticut blight and substandard housing clearance cases such as katz v brandon supra 156 conn 53334 and gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14344 are inapposite because in those cases the private sector economic development was secondary to the primary purpose of the redevelopment act under which the applicable public use was the removal of harmful urban blight or substandard conditions the plaintiffs also cite a competing line of sister state cases notably southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc 199 ill 2d 225 24041 768 ne2d 1 cert denied 537 us 880 123 s ct 88 154 l ed 2d 135 2002 and urge this court to follow them and conclude that economic development is not by itself a public use that justifies the use of eminent domain we address each of these contentions in turn

we first address the plaintiffs contention that the blight and substandard housing clearance cases namely katz v brandon supra 156 conn 533 and gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14344 are inapplicable specifically they contend that in the present case the primary legislative purpose is to transfer the property to private entities which will become the primary beneficiary of the taking accordingly any benefit to the public from the taking is merely secondary their arguments contrast this scenario with that of the blight cases wherein this court concluded that the primary purpose of the takings was the clearance of harmful urban conditions with any benefit to private entities being secondary katz v brandon supra 534 gohld realty co v hartford supra 14344 we disagree with the plaintiffs contentions because we already have determined that municipal economic development can be in and of itself a constitutionally valid public use under the well established broad purposive approach that we take on this issue under both the federal and state constitutions accordingly we also conclude that private benefit from such economic development is just as in the blight and substandard housing clearance cases secondary to the public benefit that results from significant economic growth and revitalized financial stability in a community

we next address the plaintiffs analysis of the sister state cases particularly southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 23541 that they cite in support of their contention that economic development projects do not by themselves constitute public use we acknowledge that the courts of arkansas florida kentucky maine new hampshire south carolina and washington have using a narrow42 view of their public use clauses ruled that economic development is by itself not public use for eminent domain purposes see little rock v raines 241 ark 1071 108384 411 sw2d 486 1967 utilizing narrow definition of public use and noting lack of express legislative eminent domain authorization in concluding that taking for industrial park did not satisfy public use clause baycol inc v downtown development authority 315 so 2d 451 45658 fla 1975 condemnation of land for construction of parking garage for private shopping mall not public use solely because of economic benefits describing public benefit from garage construction as incidental and insufficient as a basis for public necessity justifying eminent domain owensboro v mccormick 581 sw2d 3 58 ky 1979 using narrow view of public use under state constitution to strike statute granting city or other governmental unit unconditional right to condemn private property which was to be conveyed by the local industrial development authority for private development for industrial or commercial purposes the constitutional provisions involved clearly require that finding of public purpose does not satisfy the requirement of a finding of public use  opinion of the justices 152 me 440 447 131 a2d 904 1957 advisory opinion following narrow view of state public use clause and concluding that statute authorizing city to use eminent domain for development of industrial park is unconstitutional merrill v manchester 127 nh 234 23739 499 a2d 216 1985 using narrow public use analysis under state constitution and requiring direct public use in light of declared legislative policy of preserving open lands enjoining taking of plaintiffs open lands for industrial park construction karesh v city council 271 sc 339 34245 247 se2d 342 1978 adhering to narrow view of public use under state constitution and concluding that city could not condemn land and lease it to developer for parking garage and convention center project noting that guarantee that the public will enjoy the use of the facilities so necessary to the public use concept is absent in re seattle 96 wash 2d 616 62729 638 p2d 549 1981 using narrow view of state public use clause without deference to legislature and concluding retail shopping center contemplated a predominantly private rather than public use noting that a beneficial use is not necessarily a public use43

we address separately and in greater detail the illinois supreme courts recent decision in southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 23738 because the plaintiffs rely heavily on that case and its analysis is distinct from the aforementioned decisions of the other states in that case the state legislature had created a regional economic development authority to promote industrial and economic development within a geographic project area id 22728 under its enabling statute the plaintiff had the authority to issue bonds and to exercise eminent domain id 228

a successful and popular racetrack in the plaintiffs region desired to expand its seating and parking capacities id 229 to increase parking it wished to acquire a large parcel of land from an adjacent metal recycling center owned by the defendant id the defendant refused to discuss the matter and the racetrack never had offered to purchase the land id instead the racetrack had asked the plaintiff to use its eminent domain powers to take the land and transfer it to the racetrack with the racetrack paying all expenses for the taking id 22930 thereafter the county legislative body issued the required approval for the plaintiffs use of its eminent domain powers concluding that expanded parking would be beneficial for the public safety and also would increase the regions tax revenues id 230 the plaintiff followed with a similar resolution id both the plaintiff and the racetrack continued to negotiate with the defendant for the purchase of the property the negotiations failed and the plaintiff then filed a condemnation petition which the trial court granted44 id 231

on appeal the illinois supreme court reversed the determination of the trial court the supreme court cited berman v parker supra 348 us 26 and hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 24344 and undertook initially a generally broad purposive police power analysis of the plaintiffs exercise of its eminent domain powers southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 23536 the court however then qualified these statements by stating that a distinction still exists between public use and public purpose id 237 indeed the court emphasized that the public must be to some extent entitled to use or enjoy the property not as a mere favor or by permission of the owner but by right internal quotation marks omitted id 238 moreover the court stated that while it has also recognized that economic development is an important public purpose    to constitute a public use something more than a mere benefit to the public must flow from the contemplated improvement45 citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted id 239

ultimately the court concluded that the taking violated the public use clauses of both federal and state constitutions id 235 240 the court did not require a brightline test to find that this taking bestows a purely private benefit and lacks a showing of a supporting legislative purpose    members of the public are not the primary intended beneficiaries of this taking    this condemnation clearly was intended to assist the racetrack in accomplishing their goals in a swift economical and profitable manner citations omitted id 240 the court stated that the plaintiffs true intentions were not clothed in an independent legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use46 id it further noted the plaintiffs responsiveness to the racetracks demands as well as the lack of planning studies and consideration of other alternatives such as construction of a parking garage on the existing racetrack property47 id 241

we disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the southwestern illinois development authority stands for the proposition that economic development is never a constitutionally valid public use indeed despite its use of a more restrictive public use standard than the purely purposive formulation followed by this court and the united states supreme court hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 24344 olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 54651 the illinois decision strikes us more as an illustration of when a court determines that an economic development plan cannot be said to be for the publics benefit in our view the facts of southwestern illinois development authority merely demonstrate the far outer limit of the use of the eminent domain power for economic development indeed that decision did not strike the statute allowing the agency to use eminent domain it merely assailed the agencys exercise of that power within a particularly egregious set of facts see southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 24041 clearly the foundation of this taking is rooted not in the economic and planning process with which the plaintiff has been charged accordingly the illinois decision simply does not persuade us to abandon our conclusion that an economic development plan that the legislature rationally has determined will have the public benefits of increasing employment tax and other revenues and spurring the revitalization of a distressed city constitutes a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under either the state or federal constitution

moreover beyond the case law we observe that many commentators within the academic community also have addressed the issue of whether economic development satisfies the constitutional public use requirement support for both sides of the issue of course may be found within this array of law review articles we note that most however tend to express alarm at what they consider to be a situation rife with the potential for abuse of the eminent domain power see eg j lazzarotti public use or public abuse 68 umkc l rev 49 74 1999 cautioning against overexpansive interpretation of terms public use or public purpose noting if the only limit on meeting the public purpose requirement is what one can conceive or rationalize the process is extremely vulnerable to abuse s jones note trumping eminent domain law an argument for strict scrutiny analysis under the public use requirement of the fifth amendment 50 syracuse l rev 285 28889 2000 maintaining that private property rights are fundamental and proposing an analytical framework whereby the condemnation authority must demonstrate a compelling socioeconomic need in transferring land to private interests48 we however conclude that responsible judicial oversight over the ultimate public use question does much to quell the opportunity for abuse of the eminent domain power we of course acknowledge the existence of particularly egregious cases such as armendariz v penman supra 75 f3d 132021 see footnote 40 of this opinion 99 cents only stores v lancaster redevelopment agency supra 237 f sup 2d 112930 and southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 225 such cases however would be outliers under the formulation that we adopt herein which requires public economic benefit in order for the use of eminent domain for economic development to pass constitutional muster as such those cases are readily distinguishable from projects such as the carefully considered development plan at issue in the present case49 we therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the provisions of chapter 132 of the general statutes authorizing the use of eminent domain are facially unconstitutional when used in furtherance of an economic development plan such as the development plan in the present casebwhether the public will benefit sufficiently from the condemnationsthe plaintiffs next claim that even if we were to assume that economic development constitutes a valid public use the condemnations at issue in the present case do not serve that purpose because the motives of the development corporation and the city aside the effects of those condemnations primarily will benefit private entities namely the development corporation corcoran jennison and pfizer50 the plaintiffs claim that any public benefit is incidental and insignificant when compared to the private benefit to those entities that will result from the condemnations the defendants contend in response that the public purpose is not defeated by the transfer of land to private entities especially when successful achievement of the public purpose of economic development necessarily requires private sector involvement we agree with the defendants

we set forth the following additional facts that are relevant to the disposition of this claim as stated previously the development corporation will own the property after the condemnation it will then lease the property to corcoran jennison for 1 per year for a term of ninetynine years with respect to pfizer the plaintiffs point out that it is in the words of james hicks the executive vice president of rkg associates the firm that assisted the development corporation in the preparation of the development plan the 10000 pound gorilla and a big driving point behind the development project specifically the plaintiffs point out that pfizers requirements51 had been met namely the inclusion within the development plan of a hotel for its clients and business associates upscale housing for its employees office space for its contractors and other upgrades to the infrastructure of the general area

the trial courts memorandum of decision however reveals that although a great deal of consideration was given to the various demands and needs created by the new pfizer facility this consideration was given for the purpose of making the development plan more beneficial to the city indeed hicks testified that pfizers announcement was key because it was unusual for a major employer to move into an urban area especially into a brown site    that has environmental problems they tend to go to suburban areas tend to go to green fields finding them coming there just offered a unique property for new london to take advantage of a number of things that would happen at that site for development52

hicks testified that he toured pfizers facilities during the development plan preparation process in order to gain a better understanding of its needs and the demands that it created pfizer did not tell him what details to add to the development plan although he had been told that there was a need for a hotel as a result of pfizers arrival in the city hicks testified however that he was never told that pfizer would not come to the city if the hotel was not built53

the trial court also noted the testimony of william longa senior corporate counsel for pfizer longa testified that pfizers only conditions for relocating its global development facility to the city were that 1 the adjacent wastewater treatment facility be upgraded 2 the state park be restored and 3 its significant local investment be leveraged into a benefit for the entire city he stated that pfizer did make suggestions about certain functions that the company was involved in that were natural stepping stones that the community could use to its benefit to leverage the investment that the company had made in its own site he stated that pfizer had informed the development corporation of certain needs and demands that it had created such as the companys guests who would need hotel space and employees who would need places to live54

longa did testify that pfizer never made specific demands about the locations of uses within the development plan pfizer will not have an ownership or management interest in any of the facilities located within the development plan area the trial court also observed that the team who had drafted the development plan considered alternatives that did not fit the needs communicated by pfizer indeed the development plan itself does not mention pfizers desires in the section describing its reasoning for choosing the final of the six alternatives

the trial court acknowledged an october 21 1998 email to george milne president of pfizers research division from james serbia a pfizer employee involved in the development and management of company facilities in the email serbia indicated that he had left milne with some concept drawings because of some confusion about pfizers expectations regarding the development of the fort trumbull area the email stated that serbia thought the issue boils down to    whether or not pfizer is flexible regarding the development plans—i believe the answer is yes per all our previous discussions on this—as long as some key components are included it listed attractive residences hotel and conference space and upgrades to the wastewater treatment plant state park and commercial space as key components serbia then asked milne whether the following items would fit with his expectations— seventy to eighty upscale residential units and a 250 unit hotel the trial court noted that the development plan incorporates these features55

the trial court relied on katz v brandon supra 156 conn 53134 and bugryn v bristol 63 conn app 98 107108 774 a2d 1042 cert denied 256 conn 927 776 a2d 1143 cert denied 534 us 1019 122 s ct 544 151 l ed 2d 422 2001 to begin with the proposition that a taking of land is impermissible if it is made primarily to benefit private interests in other words the primary purpose of the taking must be to serve the public interest benefits to private entities must be incidental to this public purpose the trial court also relied on merrill v manchester supra 127 nh 237 for the use of a net benefit test under which the benefits of the proposed project and the benefits of the eradication of any harmful characteristics of the property in its present form are reduced by the social costs of the loss of the property in its present form if the social costs exceed the probable benefits then the project cannot be said to be built for a public use

the trial court considered the facts in the context of these principles and concluded that viewed in the context of the severe economic distress faced by the city with its rising unemployment and stagnant tax revenues the benefits to the city will outweigh those to pfizer the court noted that the hotel with many of its rooms subsidized by pfizer will employ many people at a variety of skill levels which would tie into the citys desire to rejuvenate its downtown area the court did note that the concentrated high end housing would not likely have a multiplier effect but would increase the tax rolls

with respect to parcels 3 and 4a the trial court noted that pfizer did not press for the development of these parcels or demand office space thus with respect to these parcels pfizer would only tangentially benefit from their development the court therefore concluded that the primary motivation for the city and the development corporation was to take advantage of pfizers presence56 and that the primary motivation and effect of the development plan and its condemnations was to benefit the distressed city not pfizer

moreover with respect to private entities besides pfizer the trial court concluded that there is nothing in the record to indicate that as regards this project as a whole or considering parcel 3 and its planned office building separately    the city or the development corporation was motivated by a desire to aid particular private entities the trial court noted that tenants for the office space had not been chosen corcoran jennison was selected as developer from a group of applicants and that the project was linked to the rejuvenation of the downtown area although the trial court acknowledged the social cost57 of the implementation of the development plan the court ultimately failed to see a relevant constitutional distinction between redevelopment cases and a situation such as this where the very fact of permitting economic development by private entities permits an economically struggling city to attempt to rejuvenate its downtown area increase its job market improve its housing stock and give it sufficient tax money to meet its needs

a trial courts determination that the legislative authority primarily intended a taking to benefit the public interest rather than a private entity is a question of fact that we review pursuant to the clearly erroneous standard of review bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 103 applying clearly erroneous standard to trial courts determination that benefiting local manufacturer was not primary purpose for taking it is well established that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it    or when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted dimartino v richens 263 conn 639 661 822 a2d 205 2003

we begin our review of the trial courts finding with the proposition that the power of eminent domain must be used for a public use or purpose and not primarily for the benefit of private entities moreover where the public use which justifies the taking of the area in the first instance exists    that same public purpose continues even though the property is later transferred to private persons internal quotation marks omitted bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 104 quoting broadriver inc v stamford 158 conn 522 53334 265 a2d 75 1969 cert denied 398 us 938 90 s ct 1841 26 l ed 2d 270 1970 see also gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14344 although the courts afford great deference to the legislatures public use or purpose determination hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 244 olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 the public use question remains ultimately a judicial question new york nh  h r co v offield supra 77 conn 421 that element of judicial review however deferential would be hollow in the absence of a standard by which the courts can determine intelligently whether the public interest is paramount accordingly we agree with the trial courts utilization of a purposive standard that also takes into account the actual public benefit from the taking58

thus we conclude that an exercise of the eminent domain power would be an unreasonable violation of the public use clause if the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the taking was primarily intended to benefit a private party rather than primarily to benefit the public see katz v brandon supra 156 conn 534 there is nothing in the record to indicate that any conveyance of land has been made to a manufacturing corporation or that any agreement or understanding exists which would provide it with any advantage which is not available to others who may be interested as redevelopers bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 104 even if the taking for an industrial park an undisputed public use would later provide a site for a major local company a consequence that would be neither undesirable to the defendants nor adverse to the goals that the park plan seeks to achieve that fact would not support the plaintiffs claim of private taking in light of the ample evidence in the record concerning the plan as a whole wilmington parking authority v land with improvements 521 a2d 227 232 del 1986 a primary purpose determination in a constitutional context will normally turn upon the consequences and effects of a proposed project however    a reviewing court may consider evidence concerning the underlying purpose of a public authority in proposing a project59 jamestown v leevers supra 552 nw2d 367 recognizing economic development as public use but remanding for finding as to whether the primary object of the development project was for the economic welfare of downtown jamestown and its residents rather than for the primary benefit of private interests

applying this standard to the present case we conclude that the trial courts finding that the takings were not primarily intended to benefit a private party namely pfizer is not clearly erroneous the trial courts finding derives ample support from the record particularly the fact that pfizers requirements complained of by the plaintiffs do not impact parcels 3 and 4a moreover the testimony of hicks longa and james mahoney executive director of the development corporation supports the trial courts conclusion that pfizer did not dictate the form of the development plan although it is undisputed that pfizers presence spurred many of the plans within the development plan we view this factor as did the trial court pfizers arrival in the city afforded the development corporation an opportunity to create an economic development plan that would go a long way toward the rejuvenation of a distressed city indeed had the development corporation failed to consider demands created by the new pfizer facility its planning would have been unreasonable

moreover the trial court correctly identified the ample public benefits that the development plan once implemented was projected to provide assuming them to be correct60 the development plan projected the generation of hundreds of construction jobs approximately 1000 direct jobs and hundreds of indirect jobs moreover the property tax revenues are expected to be between 680544 and 1249843 this would be a significant increase for an area that presently produces 325000 in property taxes most importantly as the trial court astutely observed these gains would occur in a city that with the exception of the new pfizer facility that employs approximately 2000 people recently has experienced serious employment declines because of the loss of thousands of government and military positions as the trial court noted the citys unemployment rate is close to double that of the rest of the state indeed as the trial court observed the citys regional labor market was up 17 percent in comparison to 45 percent for the region and 40 percent for the state as a whole in light of these staggering economic figures we conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it found that the development plan primarily was intended to benefit the public interest rather than private entities

the plaintiffs claim that the purpose put forward by the defendants for these condemnations is that greater taxes will be generated if plaintiffs homes are replaced by office buildings that is true of nearly every home in the country if greater tax revenues alone becomes a sufficient basis for condemnations in connecticut then connecticut homeowners will lack any constitutional protection against eminent domain any home will be up for grabs to any private business that wants the property this claim while somewhat incalescent affords us the opportunity to reiterate that an exercise of the eminent domain power is unreasonable in violation of the public use clause if the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the taking specifically is intended to benefit a private party thus we emphasize that our decision is not a license for the unchecked use of the eminent domain power as a tax revenue raising measure rather our holding is that rationally considered municipal economic development projects such as the development plan in the present case pass constitutional mustercassurances of future public usethe plaintiffs next contend that the condemnations of the properties on parcels 3 and 4a lack reasonable assurances of future public use61 before we turn to the specifics of the plaintiffs claim we note that both the plaintiffs briefs and our research reveal no primary or secondary authorities that actually utilize the term reasonable assurances of future public use nevertheless the plaintiffs relying primarily on casino reinvestment development authority v banin 320 nj super 342 35458 727 a2d 102 1998 contend specifically that there is no assurance that the acquired properties will be used in accordance with the purposes of the development plan because the development corporation owns the property the city will not be a party to the development agreement with corcoran jennison and the ultimate property uses will thus be chosen by private entities the plaintiffs also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that supervision of the development corporation by the department pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes will assure the future use of the property in accordance with the development plan because that supervision is financial and does not extend to the use of eminent domain finally the plaintiffs claim solely in regard to parcel 4a that it is impossible to find reasonable assurances of future public use when the condemnor does not know what it is going to do with that parcel the defendants contend in response that 1 the development plan contains land use restrictions that assure future uses will be consistent with its purpose and 2 land projects such as the development plan require time to complete in other words that fort trumbull will not be built in a day we agree with the defendants

we first set forth the standard of review a trial courts determination that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to provide reasonable assurances of future public use is a question of fact and our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous powers v olson 252 conn 98 105 742 a2d 799 2000 it is well established that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it    or when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted dimartino v richens supra 263 conn 66162

in the present case the trial court concluded that the citys lack of future involvement does not mean that the development corporation and the developers are not bound to use the property in accordance with the terms of the development plan the trial court stated that the state functioning through the department is a signatory to the development agreement it provides the funding without which nothing goes forward63 the court then discussed several provisions of the development plan that assure that future land use will be on the terms contained therein namely 1 the durational clause providing that the development plan andor any modification hereof shall be in full force and effect for a period of thirty years from the date of first approval of this development plan by the city council of the city and 2 other land use restrictions contained therein64 the trial court concluded that were a developer to violate these provisions the development corporation could turn to the courts for relief should the development corporation refuse to do so the city could then terminate its arrangement with the development corporation and appoint a new development agency

we conclude that the trial court properly determined that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to assure that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan we agree with the trial court that the terms of the development plan providing parcelspecific land uses to which private developers participating in the project must adhere provide significant control over the destiny of the parcels see footnote 64 of this opinion we also conclude that the trial court properly determined that the significant state involvement in this project mandated by chapter 132 of the general statutes functions to provide a level of governmental oversight beyond that provided by the development corporation see footnote 63 of this opinion finally we conclude that despite the lack of formal commitments to the use of parcel 4a there are sufficient assurances that the public use of the development plan will be carried out we therefore reject the plaintiffs claim that the existence of the development agreement requiring that the property be primarily developed in accordance with the development plan which is in effect for thirty years is no assurance because only the development corporation may enforce it65

accordingly the plaintiffs reliance on casino reinvestment development authority v banin supra 320 nj super 342 is misplaced in that case the casino development authority had sought to take properties by eminent domain for the declared purpose of providing parking green space and roadway access to an adjacent renovated hotel and casino complex owned by trump plaza associates trump id 347 after the taking the land would be transferred to trump for redevelopment id the court concluded that the primary consequence and effect of the taking was to benefit trump because there was no adequate assurance that the property would be used by trump for those purposes declared as justifications for the taking66 id 35556 in so concluding the court noted that the agreements between the casino authority and trump did not 1 impose time restrictions on changes in the land use or 2 require expressly that trump use the acquired properties solely for the purpose for which they were taken rather they used the language hotel development project and appurtenant facilities id 356

the new jersey court interpreted the overbroad term of hotel development project and appurtenant facilities as allowing trump to eliminate the park and fill the entire block with an expanded casino hotel    without casino development authority approval id the court therefore concluded that the casino development authoritys determination that the takings fulfilled a public purpose was unreasonable because in looking at the consequences and effects of these condemnation actions the court must conclude that under the circumstances present here any potential public benefit is overwhelmed by the private benefit received by trump in the form of assemblage and future control over development and use of parcels of prime real estate in atlantic city67 id 358 see also vicksburg v thomas 645 so 2d 940 943 miss 1994 the taking of property for the construction of a riverboat casino was impermissible when the city failed to provide conditions restrictions or covenants in its contract with the casino to ensure that the property will be used for the purpose of gaming enterprise or other related establishments in fact testimony indicates that the casino may do anything it wishes with the defendants property    

thus we conclude that the plaintiffs reliance on casino reinvestment development authority v banin supra 320 nj super 342 is misplaced because of the previously discussed controls that exist by statute and under the development plan in the present case particularly when compared to the flexibility that impermissibly was afforded to the private entities in that case and in vicksburg v thomas 645 so 2d 943 the oversight and rigorous land use restrictions that are present with the development plan simply did not exist in casino reinvestment development authority68iii

whether the delegation of the eminent domain power to the development corporation was unconstitutionalthe plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the citys delegation of the eminent domain power to the development corporation was constitutionally valid specifically the plaintiffs contend that in concluding that the delegation was constitutional the trial court incorrectly determined that the development corporation satisfied the test for the constitutionality of delegations set forth in connecticut college v calvert 87 conn 421 427 88 a 633 1913 and gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14445 the defendants claim in response that the delegation in the present case is constitutionally valid because the development corporation is the citys statutorily authorized agent for the implementation of the development plan a constitutionally valid public purpose and is not acting to further its own operations we agree with the defendants

the record reveals the following additional undisputed facts relevant to the disposition of the plaintiffs delegation claim the development corporation is a connecticut nonprofit private economic development corporation that originally was formed in 1978 and reactivated in 1997 in may 1998 pursuant to general statutes § 818869 the city council had adopted a resolution approving the designation of the development corporation as the citys development agency or implementing agency thereafter in january 2000 the city council approved the development plan as conceived by the development corporation70 and appointed the development corporation to implement the development plan71 the january 2000 resolution also expressly had authorized the development corporation in the citys name pursuant to § 8193 a to use the power of eminent domain within the project area if necessary to acquire properties for development see footnote 71 of this opinion subsequently in october 2000 the development corporation enacted a resolution that exercised its power of eminent domain to acquire in the citys name certain properties within the project area including those of the plaintiffs72 indeed we note that the development corporation resolution emphasized specifically the citys approval of the use of eminent domain pursuant to § 8193

the trial court concluded that from the perspective of political control over the development corporation by the citys legislative body it can hardly be said that the development corporation visavis that entity is some freewheeling private body attendant to its own affairs and acting as only it sees fit73 the trial court then cited the analysis of connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 427 430 as discussed in gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 144 for the proposition that the exercise of eminent domain by the government itself or a public agency thereof is different from its exercise by a private person to whom the government has granted the power and in the second place the basis of the decision is    that when a private person is granted the power to appropriate property it must be for a use to which the public will have a common right upon equal terms independently of the will or caprice of the corporation the trial court then stated that this court in gohld realty co seemed to presume without actually ruling that an urban redevelopment agency is a public agency before it concluded that blight removal was a public use in and of itself regardless of the subsequent transfer to private developers id 145 on the basis of its analysis of the statutory framework governing the operation of the development corporation see general statutes §§ 8188 8189 and 8193 a the trial court then concluded that it did not accept the plaintiffs delegation argument because 1 it deemed the development corporation more a public agency than a private entity and 2 the public use prong of the test was more appropriately analyzed in the context of whether economic development was a public use

we first set forth the appropriate standard of review the plaintiffs claim involves only the trial courts application of the constitutional standard of connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 427 430 to the undisputed facts our review of this question of law therefore is plenary see eg cunha v colon 260 conn 15 18 n6 792 a2d 832 2002

our analysis begins with a brief review of this courts decision in connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 42730 in connecticut college the petitioner had challenged an act whereby the legislature had granted the right of eminent domain to a private educational corporation id 423 the court accepted and endorsed the legislative declaration that the higher education of women is in its nature a public use stating however that the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand id 428 the court relied on evergreen cemetery assn v beecher 53 conn 551 55253 5 a 353 1886 in which this court refused to permit a private cemetery association to take land by eminent domain for cemetery purposes74 and stated that the fundamental inquiry in cases of the delegation to private parties is whether it appears that the public will have a common right upon equal terms independently of the will or caprice of the corporation to the use and enjoyment of the property sought to be taken emphasis added connecticut college v calvert supra 430 the court expanded further stating thatthe right of eminent domain cannot constitutionally be delegated to a private person or corporation unless for a use which is governmental in its nature and unless the public has or can acquire a common right on equal terms to the use or benefit of the property taken except only that the use or right of use by the public may be dispensed with when a public benefit results from the taking which cannot otherwise be realized and which continues to exist although the public has no use or benefit of the property taken

emphasis added id 435

the court applied this principle and concluded that even having accepted the colleges argument that the higher education of women is a matter of great public utility id 436 the public would not necessarily have the right to enjoy the benefits of the land because the college did not have a legal obligation to admit to its courses of instruction all qualified candidates to the extent of its capacity without religious racial or social distinction id 43536 the court relied on a series of sister state public spending cases that distinguished private colleges like connecticut college from public universities open to all qualified candidates ultimately concluding that the grant of the eminent domain power was unconstitutional because of the exclusively private benefits from that grant of the eminent domain power to a private condemnor id 43839

we most recently restated the rule of connecticut college in carofano v bridgeport 196 conn 623 632 495 a2d 1011 1985 wherein this court rejected a claim that general statutes § 7473c the mandatory binding arbitration statute was an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power because the arbitrators are not public officials accountable to the electorate the court in carofano discussed inter alia delegations of the eminent domain power and cited connecticut college as standing for the proposition thatthe delegation of the governmental power of eminent domain to private persons rather than to public officials has frequently been approved where a public purpose is thereby advanced and where the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public

emphasis added id 633 indeed this court perceived no inherent vice that should preclude enlistment by the legislature of private individuals or agencies to achieve a public purpose by the exercise of a governmental power so long as adequate safeguards are provided although elected officials and those appointed by them as public officers may be more directly answerable to the electorate for their doings the principle of accountability remains viable in the ability of legislators to terminate or modify any delegation of legislative power that has been made and in the ultimate authority of the people to change the law by electing those amenable to the public will id 63334

although carofano v bridgeport supra 196 conn 63334 is not an eminent domain case we find persuasive its rearticulation of the connecticut college formulation that is applicable when the eminent domain authority has been delegated to a private entity its emphasis on public purpose and benefit is more harmonious with the well established purposive approach that we follow presently in resolving questions of public use than the claim that connecticut college requires actual access by the public see eg olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 indeed this court implicitly recognized this in gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14344 when the court concluded that the rule of connecticut college did not apply because if the public use which justifies the exercise of eminent domain in the first instance is the use of the property for purposes other than slums that same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons the public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished moreover the carofano approach to delegation analysis is especially compatible with the concept that many governmental endeavors such as economic development or urban renewal may be accomplished more expeditiously when governmental authorities are afforded the opportunity to utilize the expertise and resources of the private sector accordingly we conclude that carofano sets forth the appropriate standard to apply to the eminent domain delegation in the present case

we now apply the connecticut college standard as articulated in carofano v bridgeport supra 196 conn 63334 to the delegation in the present case75 at the outset we note that it is undisputed that the development corporation is a private entity we next turn to the second prong which itself is bifurcated into two factors 1 whether a public purpose is thereby advanced and 2 where the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public id 633 accordingly we also note that we previously have concluded that the development plan in the present case constitutes an economic development plan that is by itself a public use or purpose under either the federal or state constitution see part ii a of this opinion the advancing a public purpose factor therefore is satisfied because the delegation effectuates the public purpose directly by giving the development corporation the power to acquire real property for the implementation of the development plan

a more complex inquiry in the present case however is whether the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public carofano v bridgeport supra 196 conn 633 the plaintiffs claim that under connecticut college availability to the general public requires public entrance into or the benefits of tenancy in the office buildings planned for construction on parcel 3 they further claim that such direct benefit is unavailable because the tenants will be selected solely by corcoran jennison and not the development corporation or the city76 the defendants contend in response that direct access is not required because the public use of economic development necessarily requires the development corporation to turn the property over to private developers and their tenants and that the development corporation is unlike the college in connecticut college not acting in furtherance of its own benefit we agree with the defendants

we note that the connecticut college rule as stated in carofano requires only that the benefit of the taking be available to the general public id we conclude that the public benefit of the taking in the present case is the dramatic economic benefit that the development plan is expected to have for the public in the newlondon community namely the massive projected growths in employment and tax and other revenues indeed the rule of gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 144 is particularly applicable because in the present case the public use and benefit in the first instance is the economic revitalization accordingly that same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons the public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished id 14344

moreover in the present case the development corporation is not acting exclusively for its own benefit unlike in connecticut college wherein the college sought to acquire property to further its own operations connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 42324 in the present case the development corporation is acting to implement a development plan whose property acquisition provisions already have been accepted by the city itself indeed as the city resolved in january 2000 after approving the development plan the development corporation acquired the properties in the name of the city pursuant to § 8193 a77 accordingly we conclude that the delegation of the eminent domain authority to the development corporation was not unconstitutionaliv

parcel 3 reasonable necessity claimsawhether the taking of the properties on parcel 3 was reasonably necessarythe plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the taking of the four homes located on parcel 3 was reasonably necessary to achieve the intended public use because keeping the homes there would make the marketing and development of the intended office space more difficult specifically they claim that expert testimony introduced at trial indicated that there were alternatives available that would permit the office space intended for parcel 3 to be constructed exactly as planned without taking the homes the defendants contend in response that the trial court properly deferred to the legislative determination of necessity with respect to the parcel 3 properties because there was no evidence that the takings were unreasonable the product of bad faith or an abuse of the power conferred we agree with the defendants

the record and the trial courts memorandum of decision reveal the following additional facts and procedural history the trial court began its review of the necessity of taking the properties on parcel 3 by stating that it would follow the deferential approach articulated in gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 and would review the legislative determination of necessity to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred the court reviewed the governing legal principles and the competing testimony submitted by the parties planning experts the trial court then began its factual analysis by discussing the testimony of the plaintiffs expert john mullin a professor of economic and industrial development at the university of massachusetts78 mullin testified that he had reviewed the development plan and had visited the fort trumbull area and that the plaintiffs four properties occupied slightly more than three quarters of one acre of parcel 3 he testified that it is uncommon for land and housing to be cleared entirely for new development in urban waterfront areas mullin testified that in his opinion the taking of the four homes on parcel 3 was not reasonably necessary to carry out the goals of the development plan in that parcel which included offices parking and the retention of the italian dramatic club he testified that retaining the homes was a nobrainer because of the small amount of land that they occupy as well as their location on the parcel in reasonable clusters three homes together in a row and one immediately adjacent to the italian dramatic club

mullin then discussed an alternate proposal that he had created in conjunction with an architectural firm he testified that this proposal provided the same parking and office space as the present development plan without taking the plaintiffs homes but also added new homes on crossexamination mullin testified that his plan would have located the office buildings and new homes overlooking a sewage treatment plant a location that ideally was better suited for parking than these structures although such uses could be mixed79 mullin testified that in his opinion the development plan was a good plan with the exception of its treatment of the existing housing

the court then discussed the defendants evidence which consisted chiefly of the testimony of hicks from rkg associates80 which is the real estate planning and economic development consulting firm that aided the development corporation in preparing the development plan hicks stated that the team that prepared the plan primarily had wished to take advantage of pfizers unique decision to build a major facility in the city81

hicks discussed the six alternate plans that were considered see footnote 6 of this opinion and testified that although two of the plans provided for the retention of existing housing they were unworkable because it is difficult to turn residential properties into office space which would frustrate the plans goal of economic development hicks then explained how clearing all of the parcels was necessary to the success of the development plan stating that rkg associates had recommended this approach to the development corporation because it would make the area far more attractive for the crucial private sector investment and development moreover hicks testified that even if retaining the homes under a plan like mullins was feasible in his professional opinion it would make it much much more difficult for the development corporation and probably would lead to a situation that certain parts of the site would probably have a much higher degree of difficulty in being developed82

the trial court also reviewed the deposition testimony of marty jones the president of corcoran jennison83 she testified that in early 1999 the development corporation selected corcoran jennison through a competitive bidding process to develop parcels 1 2 and 3 of the development plan a full development agreement between corcoran jennison and the development corporation still was being negotiated at the time of trial there would however be a ground lease of the fort trumbull development area land from the development corporation to corcoran jennison for nominal rent such as 1 per year while the agreement was being negotiated between the development corporation the department and corcoran jennison with the city being intimately involved the development corporation and corcoran jennison had been working cooperatively under a letter of intent

corcoran jennisons architectural staff has created site plans that comply with the terms of the development plan for the actual development of the parcels84 with respect to parcel 3 the trial court credited jones testimony that it would be difficult for corcoran jennison to attract a commercial tenant to these commercial office buildings without a full site available for the development of an office building and the associated parking85

after reviewing the testimony86 and the relevant exhibits the trial court credited the effort that went into the creation and formatting of the development plan the court stated that although it did not conclude there is an absolute necessity to take the property at the present time it believes and at the least has no basis to doubt the reasonableness of the testimony of    hicks and    jones that development would be more difficult if these residences were allowed to remain the trial court concluded that accepting the plaintiffs argument would result in it choosing an alternative to development different from the alternative chosen by the agency appointed to prepare the development plan and stated ultimately that the decision on which the necessity for the takings as set forth in the development plan and the present need for the takings of these particular properties involve the weighing of factors for which courts are not well equipped and which reflect broad legislative type judgments which are best left to the appointed agencies of legislative bodies at state and local level and experienced state agencies all of which were involved and are involved in this taking process and the decisions which have led to it accordingly the trial court denied the plaintiffs request for permanent injunctive relief against the condemnation of their properties located in parcel 3 although it did grant temporary injunctive relief pending the appellate resolution of this case

we begin by setting forth the standard of review as an initial matter the question of whether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is in the end a judicial question to be resolved by the courts    but in resolving it great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature citation omitted gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 141 in part ii of this opinion we concluded that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs increasing tax and other revenues and contributing to urban revitalization namely the development plan in the present case satisfy the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions

the level of judicial review applicable to a development agencys determination of what land is reasonably necessary for the effectuation of an economic development plan such as the development plan in this case presents a matter of first impression for this court the appellate court however in bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 107108 has concluded that the deferential standards of review applicable to that determination by a redevelopment agency in a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the general statutes see eg pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 599601 gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 also apply to the use of eminent domain in an economic development case under chapter 132 of the general statutes thus it is well settled that the determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is under our constitution a matter for the exercise of the legislative power when the legislature delegates the making of that determination to another agency the decision of that agency is conclusive it is open to judicial review only to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred gohld realty co v hartford supra 146 bugryn v bristol supra 107 we agree with the appellate court and we conclude that this is the appropriate standard to apply during judicial review of the implementation of an economic development plan moreover under this standard it is the plaintiff who has the burden of establishing that the taking    was unreasonable in bad faith or an abuse of power hall v weston 167 conn 49 66 355 a2d 79 1974 accord pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 598 gohld realty co v hartford supra 146

the trial court of course makes the first judicial assessment of the legislative or agency determination of necessity thus as a reviewing court we are bound to determine whether the courts factual determination that the defendants did not act unreasonably in seeking to acquire all of the plaintiffs property was clearly erroneous emphasis added bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 108 whether the legislative body acted in bad faith or    abused    the power conferred also are questions of fact for the trial court that an appeals court reviews for clear error internal quotation marks omitted id 107 cf avalonbay communities inc v orange 256 conn 557 565 57980 775 a2d 284 2001 municipalitys project plan was pretext    to thwart affordable housing the record fully supported the trial courts finding that the chapter 132 project plan was hastily assembled poorly envisioned and incomplete it is well established that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it    or when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted dimartino v richens supra 263 conn 661

furthermore the governing principles for our standard of review as it pertains to a trial courts discretion to grant or deny a request for an injunction are a party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law    a prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the courts ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion    therefore unless the trial court has abused its discretion or failed to exercise its discretion    the trial courts decision must stand citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 598

we conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error in upholding as a factual matter the development corporations determination that the parcel 3 takings were reasonably necessary to effectuate the goals of the development plan noting that there is no evidence credible or otherwise that the condemnations in parcel 3 as originally envisaged in the development plan or at the time of the taking were done in bad faith or not with an honest motive or based on any pretext given any reasonable definition of the word the court recognized that economic development planning is not the province of the courts and thus properly deferred to the development corporations necessity determination emphasis added the trial courts determination with respect to parcel 3 derives ample support from the record particularly as it credited the testimony of goebel hicks and jones as they described the deliberative process that ultimately produced the development plan accordingly we conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it determined that the development corporations reasonable necessity determination was not the product of bad faith unreasonableness or an abuse of the power conferred the court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiffs the injunctive relief requested

we note that the plaintiffs rely on our reasoning in pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 592 and contend that the taking of their property is not reasonably necessary just because that taking will make it easier for corcoran jennison to market the office buildings to potential tenants specifically the plaintiffs refer to our statements in pequonnock yacht club inc a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the general statutes quoting the trial court as stating that just because the property may be desirable to the defendants does not justify its taking by eminent domain internal quotation marks omitted id 606 and that the city provided no specific reasons other than to enhance desirability of the area to investors as to why the plaintiffs property which both parties stipulated to be in good condition is essential to the accomplishment of the redevelopment plan id 605

the plaintiffs reliance on pequonnock yacht club inc however is misplaced because our holding in that case specifically was based on general statutes § 8125 b87 which provides that nonblighted property located in a blighted area may be taken by eminent domain when the property is essential to complete a development id 604605 as well as case law establishing that a redevelopment agency must make reasonable efforts to negotiate and consider the integration of the property that is not substandard into the overall redevelopment plan id 603 in pequonnock yacht club inc the plaintiffs property was in good condition but was surrounded by a blighted area with deteriorating properties id 604 the city however had refused to negotiate or correspond with the yacht club or to consider integrating the yacht clubs property into the plan despite the yacht clubs expressed willingness to be incorporated into the final redevelopment plan which included making changes to its property if necessary id 605606 we concluded that the trial court properly ordered the city to reconvey the property back to the yacht club because the defendants acted unreasonably when they failed to consider or even discuss integration of the plaintiffs property into the redevelopment plan and that the defendants had failed to establish that taking of the plaintiffs property by eminent domain was therefore necessary and essential to the redevelopment plan id 606

we conclude that the present case is readily distinguishable from pequonnock yacht club inc first pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 599600 is a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the general statutes in such cases the public use is blight clearance thus the public use in such cases is accomplished as soon as the blighted conditions are cleared regardless of the lands subsequent attractiveness to investors see eg gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 14344 thus nonblighted property located in blighted areas is subject to the essentiality requirement of § 8125 b a statutory requirement that does not exist under chapter 132 of the general statutes see pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 603606 in contrast in the present case the public use is by itself the economic revitalization of the city see part ii of this opinion thus for the development corporation to ignore considerations of investment and marketability would frustrate the effectuation of its projects public purpose and would be an unreasonable and arbitrary legislative act we therefore conclude that our decision in pequonnock yacht club inc does not require us to hold that the parcel 3 taking in the present case was not reasonably necessarycwhether the parcel 3 takings are for reasonably foreseeable needsthe plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the parcel 3 development was not impermissibly speculative because the office buildings will not be constructed unless a market develops for them the defendants contend in response that the trial court properly concluded that the development of parcel 3 was not impermissibly speculative because of the logical progression that such longterm development projects necessarily follow we agree with the defendants

the record reveals the following additional facts relevant to the disposition of this claim a market analysis completed in january 1999 by rkg associates for the preparation of the development plan stated that at that time rent levels for class a office buildings had stabilized and that real estate conditions in the city have shown signs of modest recovery as evidenced by a greater than 90 percent occupancy rate in those buildings it acknowledged that those rent levels remain below the level needed to support new speculative construction and that the historic sales values of class a office space created by the past imbalances in the market have not recovered sufficiently to justify new construction except for an enduser it did state however that by 2010 a shortage of office and research and development space is expected within the fort trumbull area and that land area at fort trumbull should be reserved for the future development of office buildings

in addition to the development plan the trial court also considered a report entitled marketing plan for commercial development space report which was presented by jones to other corcoran jennison officers in january 2001 the report echoed the development plans analysis and concluded that then current market conditions do not justify the construction of new commercial space at fort trumbull on a speculative basis in the short term the report recommended the renovation of building 2 which is an existing office building constructed in 1991 and located at the closed united states naval undersea warfare center the report however stated that longterm commercial development would have a target market of newly recruited companies evidencing pfizerrelated demand whether it is for general office use or biotechbioscience use this demand will most likely come from outofregion companies that contract with pfizer and value proximity to pfizers global development facility

the trial court noted that a major goal of the development plan is to capitalize on the presence of pfizer and that the report and the development plan both were prepared prior to the construction and occupancy of the new global research facility the court then credited the testimony of bruce hyde the citys director of real estate development and planning who testified that although the market for office space in the city was on the softer side since the pfizer announcement in 1998 there had been increased interest in real estate development in the city88 the court also noted hicks testimony that pfizers business associates likely would occupy future office space in the fort trumbull area

finding no connecticut authority directly on point the trial court relied on sister state authority for the proposition that there need not be an immediate need for the property taken planning for the future and changes in public needs are permissible so long as the public use will be accomplished within a reasonable period of time the trial court noted that whether the effort is speculative in a particular case depends to a great extent on the nature of the public use involved and that the legislatures assessment of whether a need is speculative receives the same judicial deference as other legislative necessity determinations thus the court will only disturb it if it is the product of bad faith unreasonableness or an abuse of discretion

applying these standards the court concluded that at least that in selected cases cities like new london given its economic situation should be given time to develop a site which has builtin features that would be attractive to users—here we have a city just beginning to come out of the economic doldrums with a major international company alighting in its midst that has the ability to attract other businesses     noting the prediction of a demand for space by 2010 and that substantial state and local resources and funds already had been spent on preparing the fort trumbull area for economic development the court concluded that it could not say that under the circumstances of this case that the planned development of parcel 3 is too speculative given the purpose of the development plan—economic development of an economically distressed community

we will review the trial courts decision as we do other reasonable necessity determinations for clear error in determining the existence of bad faith unreasonableness or abuse of power on the part of the legislature in making the initial determination of whether the need is speculative and therefore not reasonably foreseeable see pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 599601 gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 adams v greenwich water co 138 conn 205 21314 83 a2d 177 1951 bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 107108

we begin our analysis of the trial courts conclusion by reviewing the applicable legal principles a taking that is purely speculative is not reasonably necessary new haven water co v russell 86 conn 361 36970 85 a 379 1912 population growth and increasing demand justify taking of streams by water company we note however that on the question of the necessity of a taking needs which will arise in the reasonably foreseeable future must be taken into consideration adams v greenwich water co supra 138 conn 214 considering ten year water demand projections and stating that it was reasonably necessary for water company to create reservoir by damming river accord phoenix v mccullough 536 p2d 230 236 ariz app 1975 the condemning authority may in acquiring private property for public use take not only such property as is necessary to satisfy present needs but may acquire such additional property as will be put to public use within a reasonable time thereafter in determining what constitutes a reasonable time the surrounding circumstances must be considered grand rapids board of education v baczewski 340 mich 265 27172 65 nw2d 810 1954 school board could not justify taking property thirty years before its need was anticipated solely on basis of saving future taxpayers money

several sister state cases also considered by the trial court in its memorandum of decision have expanded upon these basic principles for example in an airport expansion case the florida court of appeals has stated that the condemning authority need not present evidence pinpointing the need for the specific property rather it is sufficient to show that the taking is necessary for the accomplishment of an overall plan of development    funds need not be on hand nor do plans and specifications need be prepared for a condemnor to determine the necessity of a taking in fact it is the duty of public officials to look to the future and plan for the future    thus there need not be an immediate need for the property sought to be taken citations omitted emphasis added test v broward county 616 so 2d 111 113 fla app 1993 cf alsip park district v d  m partnership 252 ill app 3d 277 286 625 ne2d 40 a condemning authority should anticipate the future increased demands for the public use to which the land is to be devoted    the advance acquisition of parkland is practical in a society with a growing population and changing recreational needs citation omitted cert denied 152 ill 2d 553 622 ne2d 1199 1993 but see phoenix v mccullough supra 536 p2d 237 if the condemning body is uncertain when future use shall occur the future use becomes unreasonable speculative and remote as a matter of law and defeats the taking

the condemnors right to acquire land for future expansion however is tempered by the need for a suitable investigation to inform its assessment of future needs in re pittsburgh school district condemnation case 430 pa 566 57374 244 a2d 42 1968 indeed the pennsylvania court emphasized that the acquisition of land may not be for real estate speculation and future sale but rather must be in the intelligent informed judgment of the condemnor in furtherance of an authorized public use     id 574 see also kansas city v hon supra 972 sw2d 415 deferring to citys necessity conclusion that it needs to acquire the land now so that it can compete with other cities for the location of aviationrelated facilities

with these principles and the clearly erroneous standard of review to guide our inquiry we turn to the trial courts decision in the present case we conclude that the trial courts determination that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative was not clearly erroneous although the class a office building market was less than conducive to development and new construction at the time that the development plan was created the trial courts deference to the legislative determination nevertheless was amply supported by the projections of future demand as a result of the new pfizer facility numerous market studies were available and considered by the development corporation indeed the trial court astutely observed that at the time of the trial the pfizer facility had just opened it therefore did not have the opportunity to create demand moreover the report formulated by rkg associates for the development plan predicted demand in the fort trumbull area by 2010 which is less than seven years away which certainly is reasonably foreseeable temporally compare adams v greenwich water co supra 138 conn 214 ten year water demand projections acceptable for foreseeability with grand rapids board of education v baczewski supra 340 mich 27172 taking unjustified when school board anticipated need for property thirty years after time of taking in light of our previous conclusion that the trial court properly had found that the reasonable necessity determination was not the product of bad faith unreasonableness or an abuse of power we also conclude that the trial court properly determined that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative

the plaintiffs rely on the holding in phoenix v mccullough supra 536 p2d 237 in support of their contention that the parcel 3 takings are impermissibly speculative their reliance on mccullough is misplaced we acknowledge that the arizona court concluded that if the condemning body is uncertain when future use shall occur the future use becomes unreasonable speculative and remote as a matter of law and defeats the taking internal quotation marks omitted id in mccullough the arizona court arrived at that standard after applying a reasonableness standard to a fact pattern wherein the city sought to acquire the plaintiffs property for airport expansion purposes but did not have a reasonably accurate time line for that expansion the city planners estimates for the date of use varied from fifteen to fortysix years id 23637 moreover the city in mccullough had admitted that it did not have a specific plan for the use of the plaintiffs properties within that expansive time frame id

we conclude that the reasoning of mccullough is inapposite to the present case because it developed out of a vastly different set of facts in contrast to the airport expansion plans in mccullough the development plan in the present case contains carefully considered predictions of development and market growth spurred by the opening of pfizers major facility it also projects demand for space by 2010 which is less than ten years from now and thus presents a dramatically different time frame than the uncertain fifteen to fortysix year gap of mccullough89 we therefore conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it deferred to the legislative necessity determination and concluded that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative

accordingly we further conclude that because the trial courts decision regarding reasonable necessity was not the product of a legal error or an abuse of its discretion we must uphold its denial of permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiffs with respect to those properties that are located on parcel 3 see pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 59899v

equal protection claimsthe plaintiffs next claim that the condemnation of the properties located on parcel 3 violated the equal protection clauses of the connecticut90 and united states91 constitutions because the development corporation spared the italian dramatic club club that also was located on that parcel specifically they contend that the trial court improperly concluded that 1 the club and the homes were not similarly situated and 2 even if the club and the homes were similarly situated the trial court utilized an improper legal standard by focusing on the defendants subjective motivation in making the condemnation decision rather than on whether the decision itself was arbitrary or irrational the defendants claim in response that the trial court properly determined that the condemnations did not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because 1 the homes and the club are not similarly situated under the terms of the development plan or the relevant zoning laws and 2 the development corporations distinction between the two uses had a rational basis92 we agree with the defendants and we conclude that the development corporation did not violate the plaintiffs equal protection rights by condemning their properties but not the clubs building

the trial courts memorandum of decision reveals the following additional facts relevant to our resolution of this claim the club is a longstanding private social organization93 in the fort trumbull area its building is located on parcel 3 of the development plan originally the clubs building had been slated for acquisition and demolition in the development plan as approved by the city in january 2000 in october 2000 however the development corporation determined that the clubs building could remain on parcel 3

the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs did not satisfy the preliminary step of establishing that they and the club were similarly situated94 the court therefore concluded that it did not need to proceed further with the equal protection analysis the trial court based this conclusion on the properties locations within the parcel it concluded that the clubs building was on the border while two of the plaintiffs properties were within the interior and ultimately would lack roadway access the trial court also cited the previously credited testimony of hicks and jones that retaining the residences would pose problems for the future development of the parcel while the clubs building would not

nevertheless the trial court did not end its equal protection analysis with the similarly situated issue it went on to assume hypothetically that the properties were similarly situated and it addressed the plaintiffs claim that their right to equal protection was violated because the development corporations decision was the irrational95 result of politically motivated favoritism toward the club the court analyzed the record and testimony with respect to the development plans process of creation and approval and concluded that it was being asked to rely on speculation and conjecture by parties who    have the burden of proof96 the court therefore rejected the plaintiffs equal protection claim

the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike internal quotation marks omitted thomas v west haven 249 conn 385 392 734 a2d 535 1999 cert denied 528 us 1187 120 s ct 1239 146 l ed 2d 99 2000 thus we ordinarily would have to address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded as a preliminary matter that they were not similarly situated with the clubs building in light of the trial courts comprehensive memorandum of decision and the parties thorough briefing however we will assume without deciding97 that the plaintiffs homes and the club are similarly situated for equal protection purposes98 accordingly we now will proceed to determine whether the trial court properly determined that the development corporations decision had a rational basis and therefore did not violate the plaintiffs equal protection rights we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that there was a rational basis for the development corporations condemnation decision

whether the development corporations action sparing the clubs building but not the plaintiffs residences from condemnation violated the equal protection clause must be gauged under the rational basis test in the context of an equal protection challenge to social and economic legislation that does not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group the classification drawn by the statute will not violate the equal protection clause if it is rationally related to a legitimate public interest nordlinger v hahn 505 us 1 8 112 s ct 2326 120 l ed 2d 1 1992 cleburne v cleburne living center inc 473 us 432 43941 105 s ct 3249 87 l ed 2d 313 1985   

the united states supreme court has recently summarized the rational basis test as applied to social and economic legislation that does not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group nordlinger v hahn supra 505 us 1112 in general the equal protection clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification see united states railroad retirement board v fritz 449 us 166 174 179 101 s ct 453 66 l ed 2d 368 1980 reh denied 450 us 960 101 s ct 1421 67 l ed 2d 385 1981 the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker see minnesota v clover leaf creamery co 449 us 456 464 101 s ct 715 66 l ed 2d 659 reh denied 450 us 1027 101 s ct 1735 68 l ed 2d 222 1981 and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational see cleburne v cleburne living center inc supra 473 us 446 nordlinger v hahn supra 11   therefore the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that the classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it    miller v heffernan 173 conn 506 50910 378 a2d 572 1977 appeal dismissed 434 us 1057 98 s ct 1226 55 l ed 2d 758 1978    johnson v meehan 225 conn 528 53537 626 a2d 244 1993 furthermore when a court determines whether a legislative classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against a particular class the challenger must establish that the legislature selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of not merely in spite of its adverse effects upon an identifiable group personnel administrator of massachusetts v feeney 442 us 256 279 99 s ct 2282 60 l ed 2d 870 1979 citations omitted emphasis altered internal quotation marks omitted stafford higgins industries inc v norwalk 245 conn 551 56769 715 a2d 46 1998 accord city recycling inc v state 257 conn 429 44546 778 a2d 77 2001armed with these well established principles we now turn to whether the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs failed to prove that there was no conceivable rational basis for the development corporations decision to spare the clubs building but not the plaintiffs residential properties from condemnation at the outset we note that the parties do not dispute that this is a pure question of law accordingly we will engage in plenary review of the trial courts conclusion

the plaintiffs contend that in determining whether there was a rational basis for the development corporations decision the trial court utilized an improper legal standard by focusing on the defendants subjective motivation in making the condemnation decision rather than on whether the decision itself was arbitrary or irrational the plaintiffs also contend that the defendants did not provide to the trial court a rational justification for its differential treatment between the property owners the defendants claim in response that the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proof and that the decision to retain the clubs building was rationally related to the achievement of the urban mixeduse community atmosphere of the development plan as a whole we address each contention in turn

we first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court applied an improper legal standard in its rational basis determination specifically the plaintiffs contend that the trial court incorrectly had focused on the fact that they did not demonstrate adequately an improper or political motivation for the retention of the clubs building in violation of the united states supreme courts holding in willowbrook v olech 528 us 562 565 120 s ct 1073 145 l ed 2d 1060 2000 as adopted by this court in city recycling inc v state supra 257 conn 447 we disagree and we conclude that the trial court did in fact apply the correct legal standard in evaluating the plaintiffs claims

in willowbrook v olech supra 528 us 564 the united states supreme court concluded that our cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a class of one where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment    in so doing we have explained that the purpose of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment is to secure every person within the states jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted the court concluded that allegations of irrational and wholly arbitrary treatment by village officials quite apart from the villages subjective motivation were sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis99 id 565

we discussed the principles set forth in willowbrook in city recycling inc v state supra 257 conn 429 in that case the commissioner of environmental protection commissioner had refused to process a recycling facilitys application to expand its existing facility id 431 the commissioners refusal was pursuant to general statutes § 22a208a a as amended by no 97300 § 2 of the 1997 public acts pa 97300 which prohibited the commissioner    from approving for a city with a population of greater than 100000 the establishment or construction of a new volume reduction plant or transfer station located or proposed to be located within onequarter mile of a child day care center     the statute also excepts from its purview existing volume reduction facilities and transfer stations without regard to their location city recycling inc v state supra 43132

after reviewing the extensive factual findings and the relevant legislative history this court concluded in city recycling inc that under the principles of our equal protection jurisprudence we conclude that pa 97300 § 2 is unconstitutional as applied because it is violative of the plaintiffs equal protection rights the factual findings of the trial court negate any rational basis of which we can conceive the most obvious of which is that the expansion of the plaintiffs facility would have some negative impact on children in the day care center located within onequarter mile of the facility the plaintiffs equal protection claim is particularly compelling in light of the legislative history of pa 97300 § 2 which demonstrates that the legislation was aimed solely at the plaintiffs permit application id 449

our review of the trial courts memorandum of decision in the present case indicates that as the plaintiffs claim the court did in fact devote a great deal of analysis to the evidence of the process by which the decisions to condemn properties and later to spare the clubs building were made the memorandum states however that the court did so because the plaintiffs strenuously argued that the true and only motive of the decision to allow the club to remain while the same right was not extended to the plaintiffs was based not on any purpose to accomplish the development plans goals but to placate important political interests represented by the club its supporters and members our review indicates that the trial courts analysis and discussion of the decisional process supports its conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proving that the development corporation acted arbitrarily or irrationally in making its decision to spare the clubs building

moreover our review of the record including the plaintiffs trial briefs and the trial courts memorandum of decision indicates that beyond claims of preferential treatment for the club the plaintiffs failed to offer arguments in support of the determinative proposition that the development corporations decision to spare the club completely lacked any conceivable rational basis indeed the trial court expressly found that the clubs social functions were related to the community and social aspects of the development plan including the hotel the court also found that with respect to the goal of tying the development plan to other development in the downtown new london area it cannot say that it is beyond the realm of rational consideration to want to have a social club of admittedly some political clout with members and guests from outside the fort trumbull area remain in that area

the plaintiffs also claim that the defendants did not provide to the trial court a rational justification for its differential treatment between the property owners the plaintiffs misstate the applicable burden of proof indeed as the trial court noted they bear the burden of proving that there is no conceivable rational basis for the retention of the clubs building see eg city recycling inc v state supra 257 conn 446 indeed the plaintiffs principal brief to this court discusses the applicable legal standard but does not attempt to negative all conceivable reasons for keeping the clubs building but not their properties moreover the city offers as a rational basis for the decision that the clubs social functions are consistent with the social elements and community atmosphere of the development plan as a whole although the plaintiffs attack this determination in their reply brief as not worthy of being taken seriously when engaging in analysis under the rational basis standard of review we are constrained by the well established proposition that the equal protection clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification    the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker    and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational     citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted id 445 thus the rational basis proffered by the city in combination with the plausible reasons found by the trial court and the plaintiffs failure to carry their high burden of proof compel us to conclude that the plaintiffs rights to the equal protection of the laws have not been violated by the development corporations decision to retain the clubs building but not their propertiesvi

cross appeal whether the taking of parcel 4a was reasonably necessarywe now turn to the defendants cross appeal wherein they contend inter alia that the trial court improperly concluded that the takings of the plaintiffs properties on parcel 4a were not reasonably necessary and therefore improperly granted the plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief specifically the defendants claim that the trial courts conclusion that the properties on parcel 4a were not reasonably necessary because proposals but no definite plan were yet in place for the use of that parcel was the product of an improperly broad review that did not afford the appropriate deference to the legislative necessity determination the development corporation also contends that the trial court incorrectly allocated the burden of proof to the defendants the plaintiffs contend in response that the trial court 1 utilized the correct legal standard in its inquiry and 2 correctly concluded that the properties on parcel 4a were not reasonably necessary because unlike with parcel 3 the trial court did not have sufficient information before it to pass on the necessity of those properties to the development as a result of the lack of plans for parcel 4 development we agree with the defendants and we conclude that the trial court did not utilize the correct legal standard in evaluating the plaintiffs parcel 4a claims and therefore improperly granted the plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief

we begin by setting forth the standard of review applicable to a legislative or agency determination of reasonable necessity as an initial matter the question of whether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is in the end a judicial question to be resolved by the courts    but in resolving it great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature citation omitted gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 141 in part ii of this opinion we concluded that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs increasing tax and other revenues and contributing to urban revitalization namely the development plan in the present case satisfy the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions

once this court concludes that the enabling statutes support a public purpose however our review becomes much more limited in scope the determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is under our constitution a matter for the exercise of the legislative power when the legislature delegates the making of that determination to another agency the decision of that agency is conclusive    the agencys decision however is open to judicial review only to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 600 gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 accord adams v greenwich water co supra 138 conn 21314 bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 107108 moreover under this standard it is the plaintiff who has the burden of establishing that the taking    was unreasonable in bad faith or an abuse of power emphasis added hall v weston supra 167 conn 66 accord pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 598 gohld realty co v hartford supra 146

as stated in part iv a of this opinion on appeal this court will apply the clearly erroneous standard of review to the trial courts underlying factual determination of whether the legislative or agency determination of necessity was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 bugryn v bristol supra 63 conn app 107 it is well established that a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it    or when although there is evidence to support it the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed internal quotation marks omitted dimartino v richens supra 263 conn 661

furthermore the governing principles for our standard of review as it pertains to a trial courts discretion to grant or deny a request for an injunction are a party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law    a prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the courts ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion    therefore unless the trial court has abused its discretion or failed to exercise its discretion    the trial courts decision must stand citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 598

the record reveals the following additional facts relevant to our resolution of this claim as mentioned previously in this opinion parcel 4 is subdivided into two smaller parcels 4a and 4b eleven properties owned by four of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 4a they occupy 076 acres out of the 24 acre parcel under the development plan parcel 4a is designated for park support or marina support     there is no development commitment or formal site plan in place for parcel 4a

although the development plan does not define the term park support expressly100 in describing the parcels intended use it states that a portion of parcel 4a will be redeveloped for uses that support the state park such as parking or for uses such as retail that will serve park visitors and members of the community as the trial court correctly noted the development plan later describes an alternative use for parcel 4a which is the development of support facilities for a marina or a marina training facility to be developed to the south on parcel 4b and the fort trumbull state park to the east any development of ancillary buildings that may be located on these two parcels shall be oriented to help define their edges     surface parking developed on either of these parcels shall be appropriately screened101

claire gaudiani president of the development corporation testified that the development corporation also was working with the united states coast guard to explore the possibility of placing its museum on parcel 4a102 the development corporation has not however obtained a commitment from the coast guard for museum development on parcel 4a because the coast guard was still choosing sites indeed the museum also had been considered for parcel 2 as well gaudiani testified that to her personal knowledge parcel 4a was the preferred and more likely site for the museum103

the trial court began its analysis with the proposition that it is not necessary that the officials proceed to make immediate use of the property thus acquired or that they have plans and specifications prepared and all other preparations necessary for immediate construction before it the county can determine the necessity for taking private property for public purpose carlor co v miami 62 so 2d 897 902 emphasis added fla 1953 wright v dade county 216 so 2d 494 496 fla app 1968 cert denied 225 so 2d 527 fla 1969 cert denied 396 us 1008 90 s ct 565 24 l ed 2d 500 1970 the trial court then stated that when the florida court applied this proposition in miami beach v broida 362 so 2d 19 20 fla app 1978 cert denied 372 so 2d 466 fla 1979 it had noted that there was a partially completed plan in place that justified taking the condemnees property for a convention center the trial court then cited state highway commission v yost farm co 142 mont 239 24344 384 p2d 277 1963 and krauter v lower big blue natural resources district 199 neb 431 439 259 nw2d 472 1977104 for the proposition that the condemnor must in the first instance produce sufficient evidence to establish facts indicating the taking is necessary

the trial court then stated that under these standards the statements in the development plan regarding parcel 4a are too vague and uncertain to allow it to conclude that the takings here are necessary and would not be reasonable it concluded that the hopes of placing the museum on the parcel were too speculative to justify the condemnations and that the other plans were too vague to allow it to engage in a necessity analysis in other words even if the court were prepared to give the legislative agency all the deference in the world under these circumstances    the court just cannot make the requisite constitutionally required necessity determination based on the information before it on the basis of this conclusion the court granted permanent injunctive relief against the demolition of the plaintiffs properties located on parcel 4a and ordered that the statements of compensation and certificates of taking with respect to those properties be dismissed

on the basis of our review of the record and the trial courts memorandum of decision we conclude that the trial courts review of the parcel 4a taking utilized a legal standard that permitted review far in excess of that provided for by our well established case law more specifically although the trial court did acknowledge nominally the judicial deference owed to the legislative necessity determination our review of its analysis particularly the inclusion of the montana and nebraska cases indicates that it did not utilize the proper legal standard as set forth in pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 598601 and gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 in reviewing the parcel 4a takings

the trial court cited state highway commission v yost farm co supra 142 mont 24344 and krauter v lower big blue natural resources district supra 199 neb 439 for the proposition that the condemnor must in the first instance produce sufficient evidence to establish facts indicating the taking is necessary as the development corporation correctly contends this proposition improperly interposes burdens of production and persuasion that are dramatically different than the burden our state applies in cases wherein the necessity of a taking is attacked in connecticut it is not the condemnor but rather the plaintiff who has the burden of establishing that the taking    was unreasonable in bad faith or an abuse of power emphasis added hall v weston supra 167 conn 66 accord pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 598 gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146

we note further that the montana and nebraska decisions followed by the trial court utilize an approach to the necessity determination that is dramatically different from the deferential standard that our state applies in cases wherein the necessity of a taking is attacked unlike connecticut these courts consider necessity to be a question of fact for the judiciary for example in state highway commission v yost farm co supra 142 mont 24344 the court stated the foregoing statutes and cases clearly reflect that under montanas eminent domain statutory provisions the trial judge not only has the power to determine the question of necessity but has been directed to make a finding that the public interest requires the taking of the lands before he has power to issue an order of condemnation105 in connecticut to the contrary a trial court is limited to the factual determination of whether the legislative or agency determination of necessity was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 despite acknowledging this deferential standard of review and properly applying it in its review of the necessity of the taking of parcel 3 properties the trial court improperly conducted a necessity review that went beyond the scope of review permitted and based its decision to grant permanent injunctive relief on an incorrect statement of the law with respect to the parcel 4a properties106 accordingly its decision to grant permanent injunctive relief to those plaintiffs who own property located on parcel 4a was an abuse of its discretion107

furthermore we note that the plaintiffs claim only that the trial court properly determined that the taking of parcel 4a was not reasonably necessary as previously discussed this argument is premised on the trial court applying a standard of review that is not applicable in connecticut the plaintiffs did not claim that the development corporations decision violated the proper standard utilized in connecticut for reviewing such decisions—whether the decision was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 in reviewing the plaintiffs parcel 3 claim we affirmed the trial courts determination that there is no evidence credible or otherwise that the condemnations in parcel 3 as originally envisaged in the development plan or at the time of the taking were done in bad faith or not with an honest motive or based on any pretext given any reasonable definition of the word     see part iv a of this opinion similarly our review of the record as it concerns the development corporations necessity determination for parcel 4a reveals that it was not the product of bad faith unreasonableness or an abuse of the power conferred compare avalonbay communities inc v orange supra 256 conn 565 57980 municipalitys project plan was pretext    to thwart affordable housing the record fully supported the trial courts finding that the chapter 132 project plan was hastily assembled poorly envisioned and incomplete

while there was no development commitment or formal site plan in place for parcel 4a this is not necessarily indicative of bad faith unreasonableness or abuse of power as the trial court stated master planning is a process that evolves over time and must be flexible and subject to change as conditions warrant108 similarly this court has rejected a challenge to a towns condemnation based upon the towns lack of a detailed plan designating exactly what part of the defendants land it needed for what purpose west hartford v talcott 138 conn 82 91 82 a2d 351 1951 cf american trading real estate properties inc v trumbull 215 conn 68 79 574 a2d 796 1990 land is indeed held for public use even when a municipality is not presently making use of the land but is simply holding it for development at some later time furthermore the development plan reveals that intended uses of parcel 4a include parking for a state park or retail that will serve visitors and members of the community or support facilities for a marina or a marina training facility these intended uses while not subject to definite commitments do demonstrate that the development corporation has given reasonable attention and thought to the potential use of parcel 4a accordingly under our deferential standard of review the record does not support a finding that the development corporation acted in bad faith unreasonably or in abuse of its power when it decided that parcel 4a was necessary to accomplish the objectives of the development plan see berman v parker supra 348 us 3536 it is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a particular project area once the question of the public purpose has been decided the amount and character of land to be taken for the project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 necessity determination open to judicial review only to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred

the judgment is affirmed with respect to the parcel 3 takings the judgment is reversed with respect to the parcel 4a takings and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendantsin this opinion borden palmer and vertefeuille js concurred

zarella j with whom sullivan c j and katz j join concurring in part and dissenting in partanother court observed in a different context a mans home may be his castle but that does not keep the government from taking it hendler v united states 952 f2d 1364 1371 fed cir 1991 that is because as an incident to its sovereignty the government has the authority to take private property for a public purpose1 id at the time that our federal constitution was written a government taking meant just that namely a taking for a government purpose such as for a public building id as the population grew and the collective needs of our society changed however the takings power was construed more broadly governmental authorities condemned private properties not just for a public use but also to achieve a public benefit such as the elimination of urban blight today an even more expansive interpretation of public use in certain jurisdictions permits the taking of property for private economic development to many this represents a sea change in the evolution of the law of takings because it blurs the distinction between public purpose and private benefit and cannot help but raise the specter that the power will be used to favor purely private interests this case therefore presents the court with a rare and timely opportunity to address a constitutional issue of great significance that is whether there are limits to the governments authority to take private property by eminent domain when the public purpose is private economic development and if so how those limits should be defined and enforced

i believe that the majority reaches the wrong result with respect to the plaintiffs properties in part because it overlooks the fact that private economic development differs in many important respects from how we have defined a public use in the past accordingly although i concur in parts i2 iii and v3 of the majority opinion regarding the applicability of chapter 132 of the general statutes4 to nonvacant land the constitutionality of delegating the eminent domain power to the new london development corporation development corporation and the plaintiffs equal protection claims respectively i disagree with the majoritys conclusions in parts ii iv and vi pertaining to private economic development5 as a public use under the connecticut and federal constitutions and the taking of the plaintiffs properties on parcels 3 and 4a

i begin by noting that because this is a case of first impression this court has not considered prior to today many of the issues raised by the parties to this appeal including whether chapter 132 of the general statutes is constitutional i further note that this court has not examined for nearly a century the authority of the state to exercise its power of eminent domain for the public benefit when accompanied by a corresponding benefit to private interests6 see connecticut college v calvert 87 conn 421 42428 88 a 633 1913 evergreen cemetery assn v beecher 53 conn 551 553 5 a 353 1886 thus it is important to undertake a review of property rights the eminent domain power and the evolution of the public use requirement before addressing the issues raised by the plaintiffs in this appeal

part i a of this dissent briefly explores from a historical standpoint both the nature of the sovereigns taking authority and the development of the concept of private property rights part i b examines the historical development of the takings clauses of the state and federal constitutions with particular emphasis on the changing concept of public use

part ii examines the degree of deference due to the legislature in its determination of what constitutes a public use as well as the appropriate role of the court in ensuring that the condemnees constitutional rights under the state and federal constitutions are not infringed this part of the opinion also addresses whether different levels of judicial review are required depending on the nature of the public use under consideration

part iii applies the principles enunciated in part ii to the specific facts of this case as found by the trial court part iv summarizes my concerns expressed throughout this opinion as to the use of the eminent domain power in furtherance of private economic development

in summary i conclude that the legislature should be accorded great deference in determining what constitutes a public use that the courts have a limited role in reviewing that determination that chapter 132 of the general statutes is facially constitutional that as the category of public use changes from one of direct public use to indirect public benefit in the form of private economic development the level of judicial inquiry must increase in order to protect the legitimate interests of the condemnee and finally that the taking of homes on parcels 3 and 4a as described in the development plan was not warranted on the basis of the facts found by the trial court and the principles set forth in this opinioni

historical development of private property rights eminent domain and the public use clauseaprivate property rights and eminent domaini agree with this courts observation that a public use defies absolute definition for it changes with varying conditions of society new appliances in the sciences changing conceptions of the scope and functions of government and other differing circumstances brought about by an increase in population and new modes of communication and transportation internal quotation marks omitted katz v brandon 156 conn 521 532 245 a2d 579 1968 i also recognize that the concept of public use has evolved over the course of our nations history from the taking of private property for actual use by the public to the taking of property to further the public good or to secure some public benefit see 2a p nichols eminent domain 3d ed rev 2003 j sackman ed § 7011 p 716 i believe however that when this court is called upon to decide claims arising under chapter 132 of the general statutes it must be ever mindful not only of a sovereigns historical power to acquire private property for a public use but also of our nations longheld commitment shared by this state to protect private property from unnecessary takings see j lazzarotti public use or public abuse 68 umkc l rev 49 55 1999 see also pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport 259 conn 592 601 790 a2d 1178 2002 authority to condemn strictly construed against taking party

private property rights developed as a legal concept in europe during the demise of feudalism see j lazzarotti supra 68 umkc l rev 53 the magna carta recognized the necessity of protecting private property rights in 1225 in providing that no freeman shall be    desseised of his freehold    but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land magna carta c xxix 1225 the text of our federal constitution reflects a similar intent that private property rights be fully protected see eg us const amends v and xiv the idea that the protection of private property is a principal aim of our society was affirmed by former united states representative john a bingham drafter of the fourth amendment when he declared that natural or inherent rights which belong to all men irrespective of all conventional regulations are by this constitution guarantied by the broad and comprehensive word person    guarding those sacred rights which are as universal and indestructible as the human race that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property but by due process of law nor shall private property be taken without just compensation cong globe 35th cong 2d sess p 983 1859 bingham also declared that the absolute equality of all and the equal protection of each are principles of our constitution     it protects not only life and liberty but also property the product of labor cong globe 34th cong 3d sess app p 140 1857 in connecticut private property rights were so firmly entrenched by the time of the state constitutional convention in 1818 that the takings clause of the new constitution which provided that the property of no person shall be taken for public use without just compensation therefor conn const 1818 art i § 11 was adopted without debate w horton the connecticut state constitution a reference guide 1993 p 70

nevertheless the right of the sovereign to condemn private property also has deep historical roots purportedly dating back to the romans l berger the public use requirement in eminent domain 57 or l rev 203 204 1978 the term eminent domain was used in the seventeenth century work de jure belli et pacis in which hugo grotius a renowned legal scholar discussed the governments authority to take private property for reasons of extreme necessity or public utility upon payment of compensation id in our own country the taking of private property for a public use was a well accepted principle in colonial times 2a p nichols supra § 7013 p 717 eminent domain was employed to support mills to create roads to build canals and bridges id § 7073 p 72001 and to drain private lands id § 7013 p 717 as the power was used more frequently however controversy ensued id pp 717 through 718 beginning with pennsylvania and vermont in 1776 and 1777 states sought in their early constitutions to place specific limitations on the power of eminent domain id p 718 since that time courts have sought and sometimes struggled to interpret the public use clause in light of state regulations and changes in the nations economy that have transformed our society in unforeseen waysbevolution of the public use requirementa review of the law on takings reveals that the definition of public use when considered in the context of the eminent domain power has no precise or fixed meaning id § 7021 p 724 some courts have narrowly construed the public use clause to mean that property acquired by eminent domain actually must be used by the public or that the public must have the opportunity to use the acquired property id § 7022 p 726 see eg rockingham county light  power co v hobbs 72 nh 531 534 58 a 46 1904 under a narrow reading of the term public use includes public buildings utilities schools and roads pocantico waterworks co v bird 130 ny 249 259 29 ne 246 1891 2a p nichols supra § 7026 p 7361

other courts have construed the public use clause more broadly to include a use that furthers the public good or the general welfare or one that secures some public benefit 2a p nichols supra § 7011 pp 715 through 716 see id § 7023 p 729 see also olmstead v camp 33 conn 532 546 1866 public use may    mean public usefulness utility or advantage or what is productive of general benefit under this more expansive interpretation of the term the united states supreme court has held that the scope of eminent domain is coterminous with the scope of a sovereigns police powers7 hawaii housing authority v midkiff 467 us 229 240 104 s ct 2321 81 l ed 2d 186 1984 historically the most dramatic example of takings under a broad construction of the public use clause is the acquisition of property for the redevelopment of blighted areas whereby the stated public purpose is to reduce the menace to the public health safety morals and welfare of the community by eliminating substandard insanitary deteriorated deteriorating slum or blighted conditions    and preventing recurrence of such conditions in the area     general statutes § 8124

private economic development pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes can be distinguished in at least two important respects from previous notions of public use first traditional takings almost always are followed by an immediate or reasonably foreseeable public benefit see eg gohld realty co v hartford 141 conn 135 13839 104 a2d 365 1954 condemnation of properties followed soon thereafter by relocation of project area residents and demolition of substandard structures olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 land taken by flooding contemporaneously with continuous operation of grist mill in contrast largescale private economic development projects authorized under chapter 132 of the general statutes may not be completed for decades in the present case the municipal development plan development plan by its own terms will be in full force and effect for a period of thirty years8 accordingly there may be much more uncertainty as to when and how the public may benefit when property is condemned for private economic development

second the public benefit derived from a conventional taking typically flows from the actions of the taking party see eg hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 229 public benefit achieved as result of housing authoritys transfer of title from lessors to lessees gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 142 public benefit achieved by redevelopment agencys elimination of substandard structures and other evidence of blight on condemned properties olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 public benefit achieved by private property owners operation of grist mill in contrast takings for private economic development require the taking party to transfer ownership of the condemned land to private developers who subsequently execute a plan to accomplish the public purpose because public agencies must work hand in glove with private developers to achieve plan objectives the taking agency may employ the power to favor purely private interests see eg southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc 199 ill 2d 225 24041 768 ne2d 1 taking of property for expansion of private parking facility deemed not for public purpose cert denied 537 us 880 123 s ct 88 154 l ed 2d 135 2002 the trial court in the present case recognized this problem when it stated in its memorandum of decision that powerful business groups or companies may exercise their influence to gain their ends with    little corresponding benefit to the public the majority makes a similar observation see part ii a of the majority opinion recognizing potential for abuse of the eminent domain power

a direct comparison of the statutory provisions on redevelopment and the corresponding provisions pertaining to private economic development illustrates the unique constitutional problem that may arise when the taking of private property for a public purpose also bestows significant benefits on private developers under chapter 130 of the general statutes9 the redevelopment scheme an area in need of revitalization is identified properties are acquired structures are demolished as necessary to eliminate blighted conditions and site improvements are made prior to the disposition of the cleared and improved land see generally general statutes § 8124 et seq the declaration of public policy contained in chapter 130 expressly provides that the disposition of property is incidental to the elimination of blight and the activities surrounding the elimination of blight enumerated in the statute10 which are public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the power of eminent domain exercised     general statutes § 8124 consequently the public benefit in a redevelopment project is clearly defined and well understood it also can be accomplished relatively quickly and with a high degree of certainty because a public agency funded with public money is charged with bringing it about

in contrast municipal development projects undertaken pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes involve the expenditure of funds to acquire and to improve land water and vacated commercial plants for the far more abstract and illdefined goals of promoting the continued growth of industry and business within the state and meeting the needs of industry and business    11 general statutes § 8186 the statutory scheme contains no clear description of how those goals are to be accomplished except by conveyance of the properties to private parties disposition of the properties is thus essential rather than incidental to achieving the public purpose although the properties once conveyed are subject to land use restrictions and in some cases oversight by state agencies there is no statutory assurance that the public will benefit from the development to follow or that the development even will occur as the trial court observed the very nature of economic developmenttype projects is such that their accomplishment is based on financial predictions and possibilities that cannot be certain and is dependent on equally uncertain competitive factors

the underlying uncertainty as to whether the public benefit will be achieved as planned in private economic development projects is expressly recognized in general statutes § 8200 b that statute provides that a development plan may be abandoned within three years of its approval and that any properties acquired thereunder may be conveyed free of the plans restrictions if they cannot be conveyed to a private party at fair market value pursuant to the plan12 general statutes § 8200 b the statutory scheme dealing with redevelopment contains no similar provision and need not because the public purpose of eliminating blight is accomplished at the time of the taking whatever occurs thereafter is irrelevant to the takings issue accordingly under chapter 132 of the general statutes the possibility that a project may be abandoned after properties have been taken by eminent domain when combined with the inherent uncertainty that the expected public benefit will be achieved in any particular case raises serious concerns regarding the limits of the takings power that cannot be ignored

recent developments in the law of certain jurisdictions that permit condemnations for private economic development have caused one commentator to remark that most observers believe that the public use limitation on the power of eminent domain is a dead letter t merrill the economics of public use 72 cornell l rev 61 61 1986 critics question the propriety of condemning private property merely because a newly proposed use promises a greater public benefit than an existing use see eg poletown neighborhood council v detroit 410 mich 616 647 676 304 nw2d 455 1981 ryan j dissenting they note that any business enterprise produces benefits to society at large and consequently there is virtually no limit to the use of condemnation to aid private businesses id 644 fitzgerald j dissenting thus it is not surprising as the majority concedes that many express alarm at what they consider to be a situation rife with the potential for abuse of the eminent domain power part ii a of the majority opinion in its memorandum of decision the trial court acknowledged the danger of rendering the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions meaningless and ignoring the private values of home and property by allowing free rein to expanding capital markets ironically the controversy has developed notwithstanding the existence of well established law advising that the authority to condemn is to be strictly construed in favor of the owner and against the condemnor pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 601 accord state v mccook 109 conn 621 630 147 a 126 1929 see also 3 p nichols supra § 9023 pp 919 through 920

growing fears regarding the potential abuse of the eminent domain power cannot be dismissed as idle speculation on the part of commentators as municipalities increasingly struggle to provide public services with limited financial resources governmental authorities are encouraging more intensive economic development to generate additional tax revenue to create new jobs and to jump start local economies accordingly there is a gathering storm of public debate as to whether the use of eminent domain to acquire property for private economic development in nonblighted areas is justified i believe that such debate is essential to clarify the role of the legislature in making determinations of public use and the corresponding role of the courts in safeguarding the rights of private property owners who fear that the takings power will be used solely to benefit private interests the complementary roles of the legislature and the judiciary as interpreters and guardians of the takings power thus require further examinationii

judicial deference to legislative determinations of public useadeterminations by state legislaturesthe suggestion frequently is made that courts have abdicated their role as interpreter of the law by showing unusual deference to legislative determinations of public use see eg s jones note trumping eminent domain law an argument for strict scrutiny analysis under the public use requirement of the fifth amendment 50 syracuse l rev 286 301 2000 proper consideration of the issue however requires that a distinction be made between public use determinations by state legislative bodies and determinations by local public authorities that specific properties should be condemned

it is well established that judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislatures is appropriate eg berman v parker 348 us 26 32 75 s ct 98 99 l ed 27 1954 subject to specific constitutional limitations when the legislature has spoken the public interest has been declared in terms wellnigh conclusive see hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 241 the logic behind this principle is that the power to take property is a function of the principle of consent inherent in a representative government m harrington  public use and the original understanding of the socalled takings clause 53 hastings lj 1245 1247 2002 legislatures are better able to assess what public purposes should be advanced by an exercise of the taking power hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 244

nevertheless judicial deference to legislative declarations of public use does not require complete abdication of judicial responsibility id 240 there is    a role for courts to play in reviewing a legislatures judgment of what constitutes a public use     but    it is an extremely narrow one internal quotation marks omitted olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 the sole dependence must be on the presumed wisdom of the sovereign authority supervised and in cases of gross error or extreme wrong controlled by the dispassionate judgment of the courts in fact the last connecticut case to address the issue recognized that the question of whether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is in the end a judicial question to be resolved by the courts    but in resolving it great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature citation omitted gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 141 accordingly i agree with the majority that judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislative bodies is appropriate but emphasize that the courts are empowered to resolve disputes when such determinations are challengedbdeterminations by local public agenciesthe majority notes with respect to the decisions of local public authorities regarding specific condemnations that the determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is under our constitution a matter for the exercise of the legislative power internal quotation marks omitted part iv a of the majority opinion accord gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 146 the majority further notes that connecticut courts typically defer to the legislative determination of necessity and limit their review to whether the decision of the taking agency was unreasonable had been made in bad faith or constituted an abuse of power see part iv a of the majority opinion see also gohld realty co v hartford supra 146 adams v greenwich water co 138 conn 205 21314 83 a2d 177 1951 water commissioners v johnson 86 conn 151 159 84 a 727 1912

for example when a local legislative body determines that a new road is required the court must defer to the local determination as to where the prospective road should be located and which properties should be taken to accomplish that purpose in the absence of unreasonableness fraud or abuse of power the determination regarding the location of the prospective road falls within the discretion of the local legislative body the fact that there may be another possible road location that would accomplish the same objective will not avail a property owner who seeks to challenge the taking because local legislative determinations concerning what constitutes a public use and what properties need to be taken to effectuate that use are entitled to judicial deference i agree with the majority with respect to these principles

where i part company from the majority is on the issue of whether the actual use to be implemented will serve the public purpose described in the development plan at issue in the present case the trial court and the majority frame the issue as whether there are reasonable assurances of a future public use they treat the matter as one of control over development of the property following its disposition and focus on the statutory and contractual constraints in place to ensure that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan the majority concludes that the terms of the development plan regarding parcelspecific uses and continuing state oversight during the development process will provide sufficient assurances that the properties will be developed in accordance with the plans objectives

i submit that such an analysis must focus not only on the possible statutory contractual and planning constraints that would ensure a public use but also on the temporal question of whether there is any reasonable prospect that the expected development will in fact occur moreover in determining whether the actual use to be implemented will serve a public purpose i would follow the standard established in two earlier cases and grant no deference to the legislative authority because such a determination lies within the province of the trial court see eg connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 428

in connecticut college this court accepted and endorsed the legislative declaration that the higher education of women is in its nature a public use for which the eminent domain power may be exercised id the court reserved for itself however the authority to resolve questions regarding the implementation of the claimed public use in any specific case see id 42324 428 it is for the legislature to say whether any given use is governmental in its nature or not subject to review by the courts only in exceptional cases of extreme wrong     but the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand emphasis added id 428

in making the foregoing distinction the court relied on evergreen cemetery assn v beecher supra 53 conn 551 in which the court sustained a demurrer to a petition for the appointment of appraisers in condemnation proceedings brought under state law concerning the taking of property for the establishment of cemeteries id 55253 see connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 42829 the court in connecticut college noted in the course of its opinion the court in evergreen cemetery assn pointed out that although the establishment of cemeteries was a use which was public in its nature    the petition was insufficient because it did not appear that the petitioners cemetery was one in which the public had or could acquire the right to bury their dead     connecticut college v calvert supra 429 see evergreen cemetery assn v beecher supra 553 that precedent which the majority sub silentio overrules today stands for the proposition that a trial court charged with determining whether the actual use of the property taken will in fact be for a public or private purpose need not defer to the views of the local legislative body13 see connecticut college v calvert supra 428

connecticut is not alone in concluding that courts may inquire into the actual purpose for which property is to be condemned even when it is claimed that the condemnation is for a public purpose see 27 am jur 2d 11213 eminent domain § 555 1996 in state ex rel tacoma industrial co v white river power co 39 wash 648 82 p 150 1905 the respondent power company was authorized to build and operate watergenerated power plants that supply electricity to inter alia public users in designated cities in the state of washington id 661 the power company filed a petition seeking to condemn certain private property id at a preliminary hearing on the matter the lower court found that the proposed use was public in nature and ordered a jury impaneled to assess the damages owed to the property owners id in reviewing the lower courts order the washington supreme court concluded that the grounds of public benefit upon which the taking is proposed are vague and the use which the public is to have of the property or how the public is to be benefited by the use of it    is by no means fixed and definite   

it is not claimed that there is a present demand for the 50000 electrical horse power it is not claimed that the power company has a franchise to enter any of the cities or towns mentioned or that it will or can obtain one it does not appear that there are any street or other railways to utilize its product it is not under contract or obligation to furnish electricity to any person or for any purpose id 667 the court determined that the proposed condemnation was not for a public purpose and therefore reversed the lower courts order id 67071

significantly the washington supreme court did not rely merely on the stated purpose of the taking in reaching its conclusion but rather examined all of the available evidence to determine whether the actual use would in fact be for a public or private purpose see id 66771 many other courts have adopted similar reasoning see kessler v indianapolis 199 ind 420 426 157 ne 547 1927 courts not limited to consideration of whether use described in condemnation proceedings is public but may consider surrounding facts and circumstances tending to show what is the actual principal and real use to be made of the property emphasis added see also walker v shasta power co 160 f 856 860 9th cir 1908 corporations right of eminent domain is not tested solely by description of public uses and private purposes contained in articles of incorporation but may be determined by evidence aliunde showing the actual purpose in view emphasis added wilton v st johns 98 fla 26 47 123 so 527 1929 courts have the ultimate power and duty to determine    whether    condemnation in any given case is in fact for a public or a private use emphasis added brown v gerald 100 me 351 357 61 a 785 1905 actual purpose of taking authorized by power companys charter was open to judicial inquiry kirkwood v venable 351 mo 460 46668 173 sw2d 8 1943 inasmuch as evidence indicated that condemned property was needed for public park was suitable for public park and would be used by city for public park court determined that condemnation was for public use kansas city v liebi 298 mo 569 591 593 252 sw 404 1923 evidence established that protective ordinance restricting use of and condemning rights to property would prevent overcrowding and make city more attractive thereby promoting health general welfare growth and general prosperity of city and that considerable part of community would actually use or benefit from contemplated improvement charlotte v heath 226 nc 750 754 756 40 se2d 600 1946 evidence established that intended use of rightofway allowing property owners living outside city limits to connect to sewer lines would be public state ex rel harlan v centraliachehalis electric ry  power co 42 wash 632 63940 85 p 344 1906 in determining question of public use in case in which power company sought to condemn land court was not confined to    the description of those objects and purposes as set forth in the companys articles of incorporation but could consider evidence aliunde    showing the actual business proposed to be conducted emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted cf linggi v garovotti 45 cal 2d 20 27 286 p2d 15 1955 private party authorized by statute to acquire easement by eminent domain for sewer connection to existing public sewer system must make strong evidentiary showing establishing that taking will benefit public accordingly judicial review to determine whether a particular use will in fact be for a public or private purpose has been an accepted practice for nearly a century

the importance of judicial review in determining whether property taken by eminent domain for private economic development will in fact be used for a public purpose cannot be underestimated economic growth is a far more indirect and nebulous benefit than the building of roads and courthouses or the elimination of urban blight indeed plans for future hotels and office buildings that purportedly will add jobs and tax revenue to the economic base of a community are just as likely to be viewed as a bonanza to the developers who build them as they are a benefit to the public furthermore in the absence of statutory safeguards to ensure that the public purpose will be accomplished there are too many unknown factors such as a weak economy that may derail such a project in the early and intermediate stages of its implementation

the economic conditions that existed when this court rendered its earliest decision regarding a taking for private economic development14 olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 532 were very different in nature from the economic conditions that now define our world the petitioner in that case samuel e olmstead was a grocery merchant in a manufacturing community in which the public relied on olmsteads store for all of their supplies including ground feed for pigs poultry cows and other domestic animals id 536 reporters case summary olmstead owned land upon which he had erected a water mill for the purpose of grinding the flour and feed that were sold at his store and for doing custom work such as is usually done in a country mill    15 id 533 reporters case summary the land also contained a mill pond and a dam id olmstead found it necessary to raise the dam and flood the property of the respondent samuel rp camp in order to ensure the proper operation of the mill id olmstead petitioned the court under the flowage act of 186416 to grant him the right to flood camps land and to determine the damages owed id 532 reporters case summary

a courtappointed committee concluded that the flooding of camps property was for a public use id 534 reporters case summary the committee determined that olmstead could raise the dam had a right to keep and to maintain it permanently and consequently owed certain damages to camp id camp appealed from the committees decision

on appeal this court upheld the committees decision and found in favor of olmstead id 552 the court characterized the issue to be decided as one involving the rights of property guaranteed by the fundamental law and    the interests of business and the prosperity of the state id 545 the court concluded from the first settlement of the country gristmills of this description have been in some sense peculiar institutions invested with a general interest towns have procured them to be established and maintained the state has regulated their tolls in many instances they have been not merely a convenience but almost a necessity in the community id 552

the court thus observed that grist mills played an integral part in the subsistence of the local community because they ground the feed and flour upon which the economic lifeblood of the community depended the court described the proper functioning of grist mills not only as consonant with the public interest but in certain instances as essential to the communitys continued viability accordingly the raising of the height of the dam and the taking of camps property were akin to the taking of property today for use by a public utility see eg connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 426 characterizing public use for which land was taken in olmstead as governmental in nature because of great advantage to community in stark contrast the private development contemplated under chapter 132 of the general statutes only can be described as governmental in nature if the benefits of increased tax revenue and new jobs are actually realized

i therefore submit that just as the taking of nonblighted property in a blighted area is subject to additional scrutiny to determine whether the taking is essential to the redevelopment plan see pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 605 so too should a heightened standard of judicial review be required to ensure that the constitutional rights of private property owners are protected adequately when property is taken for private economic development under chapter 132 of the general statutes justice demands no lesscheightened judicial reviewother jurisdictions with similar concerns have attempted to create more exacting standards of judicial scrutiny in the context of takings for private economic development in poletown neighborhood council v detroit supra 410 mich 616 in which property was to be acquired for the construction of a general motors assembly plant id 628 the majority adopted a standard of heightened scrutiny requiring substantial proof of a clear and significant public benefit in determining whether the contemplated use constituted a legitimate public purpose id 63435 finding that standard insufficient one of the two dissenting justices in poletown neighborhood council proposed a stricter standard of review that would require a showing of 1 public necessity of the extreme sort 2 continuing accountability to the public and 3 selection of land according to facts of independent public significance emphasis in original id 67475 ryan j dissenting more recently the suggestion has been made that property rights should be elevated to the status of a fundamental right and that a strict scrutiny analysis should be conducted when property is taken for private economic development see s jones note supra 50 syracuse l rev 314

in its memorandum of decision the trial court in the present case declared that there are in fact limits on the constitutional propriety of using the power of eminent domain for    pure economic development     the trial court rejected a standard of heightened scrutiny however on the basis of bugryn v bristol 63 conn app 98 774 a2d 1042 cert denied 256 conn 927 776 a2d 1143 cert denied 534 us 1019 122 s ct 544 151 l ed 2d 422 2001 in which the appellate court stated that our supreme court has not applied a heightened standard of review in previous disputes concerning the nature of a taking     id 102 n7 the present case therefore provides this court with an opportunity to consider the heightened standard of judicial review that the court in bugryn identified as lacking

i submit that judicial review of the condemnations in the present case should consist of a four step process in which the burden of proof is shifted between the respective parties at various stages in the analysis see eg potter v chicago pneumatic tool co 241 conn 199 23537 694 a2d 1319 1997 setting forth evidentiary framework through which burden of proof is shifted between parties in product liability action judicial review should begin with consideration of whether the statutory scheme is facially constitutional in light of well established judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislative bodies the party opposing the taking should bear the initial burden of proving that the contemplated public use of private economic development is unconstitutional should that party succeed in meeting its difficult burden the inquiry should end and no taking should be permitted

if the court concludes however that the proposed economic development is a valid public use the party opposing the taking should bear the additional burden of proving in accordance with the deferential standard of review afforded to legislative determinations of public use that the primary intent of the particular economic development plan is to benefit private rather than public interests should that burden also be met any taking pursuant to the plan should be deemed unconstitutional and the inquiry should end

in the event that the court concludes that the plan is constitutional the burden should shift to the taking party to prove that the specific economic development contemplated by the plan will in fact result in a public benefit17 the burden of proof properly rests upon the party who must establish the affirmative proposition to whose case the fact in question is essential who has the burden of pleading a fact who has readier access to knowledge about the fact or whose contention departs from what would be expected in the light of everyday experience albert mendel  son inc v krogh 4 conn app 117 124 n6 492 a2d 536 1985 accordingly shifting the burden of proof is appropriate at this point in the inquiry because the taking party has greater access than the opposing party to information regarding developer interest in the properties and the progress of negotiations relating to the disposition of the properties

the level of proof necessary to meet the burden of establishing that the anticipated economic development will result in a public benefit should be clear and convincing evidence the clear and convincing standard traditionally applies in civil cases to protect particularly important individual interests     internal quotation marks omitted state v rizzo 266 conn 171 211 n22 833 a2d 363 2003 quoting addington v texas 441 us 418 424 99 s ct 1804 60 l ed 2d 323 1979 in cases governed by this burden because society regards the individual interests involved to be very important and because society imposes most of the risk of error on the party so burdened we also require a very high degree of subjective certitude for the burden to be satisfied the fact finder must be persuaded to a high degree of probability18 state v rizzo supra 211 n22 in other words the party must prove that the evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist    the clear and convincing standard is a very demanding standard that should operate as a weighty caution upon the minds of all judges and it forbids relief whenever the evidence is loose equivocal or contradictory citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted durso v vessichio 79 conn app 112 123 828 a2d 1280 2003

in civil cases involving property disputes differing levels of proof are required depending on the type of claim under consideration for example clear and convincing evidence is required to prove a claim that land has been taken by adverse possession eg wildwood associates ltd v esposito 211 conn 36 42 557 a2d 1241 1989 this is because title becomes absolute in the adverse possessor if that standard of proof is satisfied takings for private economic development resemble takings by adverse possession because property owners in both situations lose title to their land accordingly it is consistent with existing law to place the burden on the taking party and to require that the standard of proof be clear and convincing evidence when property is taken by eminent domain for private economic development

i also believe that the clear and convincing standard is compelled in this context because of the tremendous social costs of the takings costs that are difficult to quantify but that are nonetheless real the fact that certain families have lived in their homes for decades and wish to remain should not in my view be summarily dismissed as part of a costbenefit analysis typically performed by the legislature at a minimum the distress suffered by the plaintiffs because of their relocation to another neighborhood that lacks the same comforting familiarity and associations as their old neighborhood should be considered as additional justification for a higher level of proof i therefore believe that the best way to protect the rights of property owners in cases involving takings for private economic development is to require that the taking party prove by clear and convincing evidence that development prospects are such that the condemned property will in fact be used for the intended public purpose

courts and legislatures have employed the clear and convincing standard of proof in other constitutional legislative and commonlaw contexts involving important questions of fact miller v commissioner of correction 242 conn 745 796 700 a2d 1108 1997 for example when constitutional rights are at stake as in the present case a nonparent petitioning for visitation pursuant to general statutes § 46b59 must prove the requisite relationship and the harm that would result from the denial of visitation by clear and convincing evidence in order to protect the parents liberty interests in the care custody and control of their children roth v weston 259 conn 202 228 232 789 a2d 431 2002 due process also requires that the clear and convincing test be applied to the termination of parental rights because it is the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship with all its rights and responsibilities between the child and his parent     emphasis in original id 231 in still another context we have held that in order to protect a criminal defendants constitutional right of confrontation the state must prove a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victims testimony state v jarzbek 204 conn 683 704 529 a2d 1245 1987 cert denied 484 us 1061 108 s ct 1017 98 l ed 2d 982 1988 by establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants presence would seriously call into question the trustworthiness of the victims testimony id 704705 i submit that the taking of private property for private economic development is equally deserving of this very demanding standard of proof for all of the foregoing reasons19 especially in light of the fact that such projects may be abandoned within three years of their approval if market conditions change and the plan of development cannot be implemented see general statutes § 8200 b

the trial courts subsidiary findings as to the actual future use of the properties taken are findings of fact that should not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous see eg state v pinder 250 conn 385 420 736 a2d 857 1999 state v atkinson 235 conn 748 759 670 a2d 276 1996 in light of the constitutional interests at stake however the issue of whether the properties actually will be used for a public purpose is an ultimate issue that should be reviewed by this court on the basis of its own scrupulous examination of the record state v pinder supra 420 this is necessary to ensure that judicial review comports with constitutional standards of due process internal quotation marks omitted state v hafford 252 conn 274 298 746 a2d 150 trial courts finding that confession was voluntary closely scrutinized to protect defendants constitutional rights cert denied 531 us 855 121 s ct 136 148 l ed 2d 89 2000

finally if the trial court concludes that the condemned property will be used for a public purpose it should be incumbent upon the party opposing the taking on the basis of the deferential standard of review that we accord to legislative determinations of public use to prove that the specific condemnation at issue is not reasonably necessary to implement the plan

the shifting of the burden of proof as suggested is not unusual in circumstances in which we have deemed constitutional interests to be extremely significant for example a burden shifting analysis has been adopted in employment discrimination cases mcdonnell douglas corp v green 411 us 792 802805 93 s ct 1817 36 l ed 2d 668 1973 after complainant establishes prima facie case of discrimination employer must articulate legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for adverse employment action and complainant then must prove employer engaged in intentional discrimination see also reeves v sanderson plumbing products inc 530 us 133 14243 120 s ct 2097 147 l ed 2d 105 2000 board of education v commission on human rights  opportunities 266 conn 492 505506 832 a2d 660 2003 the burden of proof also is shifted to the decisionmaking party in affordable housing land use appeals general statutes § 830g in administrative appeal from decision to deny application burden on local commission to prove that decision is supported by sufficient evidence in record see quarry knoll ii corp v planning  zoning commission 256 conn 674 733 780 a2d 1 2001 see also west hartford interfaith coalition inc v town council 228 conn 498 514 636 a2d 1342 1994 legislature placed the burden of proof on the commission    and not as in traditional land use appeals on the applicant internal quotation marks omitted claims that a prosecutor has used peremptory challenges in violation of the equal protection clause are treated in a similar manner see eg batson v kentucky 476 us 79 9798 106 s ct 1712 90 l ed 2d 69 1986 following defendants prima facie showing that prosecutor exercised peremptory challenge on basis of race burden shifts to prosecutor to articulate raceneutral explanation for striking juror after which burden shifts to defendant to show that prosecutors articulated reasons are insufficient or merely pretextual see also state v dehaney 261 conn 336 34445 803 a2d 267 2002 cert denied 537 us 1217 123 s ct 1318 154 l ed 2d 1070 2003 harmless error analysis involves a comparable approach when the alleged impropriety is of constitutional magnitude in that the burden to prove that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the state eg state v francis 267 conn 162 188 836 a2d 1191 2003 state v cavell 235 conn 711 720 670 a2d 261 1996 accordingly the adoption of a burden shifting analysis in cases involving the taking of property for private economic development is consistent with our approach in other contexts in which a constitutional right is at stake

the adoption of a burden shifting analysis also is consistent with the takings procedure followed in other jurisdictions that do not place the burden of attacking a routine taking on the property owner as connecticut does see generally 27 am jur 2d 45 supra § 479 general statutes § 4823 provides in relevant part when under the provisions of any statute authorizing the condemnation of land in the exercise of the right of eminent domain an appraisal of damages has been returned to the clerk of the superior court    and when the amount of appraisal has been paid or secured to be paid or deposited with the state treasurer    any judge of the superior court may upon application and proof of such payment or deposit order such clerk to issue an execution commanding a state marshal to put the parties entitled thereto into peaceable possession of the land so condemned20 the procedure for taking property by eminent domain in connecticut is less hospitable to the property owner than in most other jurisdictions because the party to whom is delegated the right to determine whether particular land is necessary for a public use need only allege in his application to the court that he has so determined leaving the burden of attack upon the adverse party bridgeport hydraulic co v rempsen 124 conn 437 442 200 a 348 1938 see also hall v weston 167 conn 49 63 355 a2d 79 1974 burden of attacking towns statutory authority to condemn land rested upon the property owner the primary means available to challenge the condemnation are 1 an action to enjoin the taking eg bridgeport hydraulic co v rempsen supra 442 or 2 a request that the court review the statement of compensation filed by the taking party see general statutes § 8132

in contrast the most common method of condemning land in other jurisdictions is for the taking party to file in court a petition to take the property 27 am jur 2d 45 supra § 479 after the property owner and all other persons having an interest in the land sought to be condemned are joined in the action a hearing is held at which the condemnor first must establish its right to condemn the land and in some jurisdictions the necessity of the taking id if the court is satisfied that the taking is justified damages are assessed and a final award is rendered id in jurisdictions that follow this procedure the burden therefore is not on the property owner to attack the condemnation but rather on the condemnor to establish its right to condemn see id a similar approach has been adopted for use in the federal courts pursuant to rule 71a of the federal rules of civil procedure the condemning party files a complaint identifying the property to be taken fed r civ p 71a c 2 if the property owner objects to the taking he may file an objection or defense and the issue subsequently may be tried to the court or a jury fed r civ p 71a e and h accordingly shifting the burden of proof as proposed in this opinion is consistent with the allocation of the burden of proof in other jurisdictionsiii

judicial review of the condemnationsapplying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case i agree with the majority that the legislative determination of public use as expressed in chapter 132 of the general statutes is constitutional i also agree that the primary purpose of the takings is to benefit the public i do not agree however that the condemnations are constitutional in light of the fact that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to establish that the properties actually will be developed to achieve a public purpose the foregoing conclusion being dispositive of this appeal the court need not reach the issue of whether the condemnations are reasonably necessary to implement the development planathe facial constitutionality of chapter 132 of the general statutesthe first issue to be addressed under the proposed standard of review is whether chapter 132 of the general statutes—§ 8186 in particular—is facially constitutional insofar as it authorizes the use of the eminent domain power for private economic development the majority explains that its analysis of this issue will be guided by the principle that the challenging party must prove the unconstitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt eg state v ball 260 conn 275 28081 796 a2d 542 2002 and that it will review the statutory scheme pursuant to the well settled standard of substantial deference to the legislatures determination of public use see part ii a of the majority opinion after examining the relevant case law of our state our sister states and the united states supreme court the majority ultimately concludes that private economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes which create new jobs increase tax revenue and contribute to urban revitalization satisfy the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions see id

i agree with the conclusion of the majority but do not agree entirely with the majoritys analysis although the plaintiffs must prove the unconstitutionality of the statutory scheme beyond a reasonable doubt the proper standard for reviewing the underlying claim is whether the state legislature rationally could have believed that the statute would promote its objective emphasis in original western  southern life ins co v state board of equalization 451 us 648 672 101 s ct 2070 68 l ed 2d 514 1981 accord hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 242 see also housing authority v higginbotham 135 tex 158 165 143 sw2d 79 1940 legislative declaration of particular use is binding upon the courts unless such use is clearly and palpably of a private character internal quotation marks omitted 26 am jur 2d 503 eminent domain § 61 1996

in hawaii housing authority the united states supreme court declared that the public use requirement is    coterminous with the scope of a sovereigns police powers hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 240 as was previously noted see footnote 7 of this opinion the police power is commonly understood as the states power to preserve and to promote the general welfare and    whatever affects the peace security safety morals health and general welfare of the community     16a am jur 2d 251 constitutional law § 315 1998 see also reid v zoning board of appeals 235 conn 850 855 670 a2d 1271 1996 raybestosmanhattan inc v planning  zoning commission 186 conn 466 471 442 a2d 65 1982 guided by the principle of judicial deference to the legislative determination of public use i therefore conclude like the majority that takings for private economic development are facially constitutional because connecticut and federal courts have embraced for more than a century a broad construction of the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions

almost 140 years ago this court expressly rejected a narrow interpretation of the term public use as possession occupation    or direct enjoyment    by the public olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 546 and determined instead that the term means public usefulness utility or advantage or what is productive of general benefit     id the court in olmstead also advocated an interpretation of public use that could include private economic development when it made the following remarks about the farreaching regional and even national effects of the water powered grist mill it would be difficult to conceive a greater public benefit than garnering up the waste waters of innumerable streams and rivers and ponds and lakes and compelling them with a gigantic energy to turn machinery and drive mills and thereby build up cities and villages and extend the business the wealth the population and the prosperity of the state it is obvious that those sections of the country which afford the greatest facilities for the business of manufacturing and the mechanic arts must become the workshops and warehouses of other vast regions not possessing these advantages     it is of incalculable importance to this state to keep pace with others in the progress of improvements and to render to its citizens the fullest opportunity for success in an industrial competition id 551

the courts broad definition of public use in olmstead was reaffirmed in gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 141 public use means public usefulness utility or advantage or what is productive of general benefit and later echoed in katz v brandon supra 156 conn 53233 the modern trend of authority is to expand and liberally construe the meaning of public purpose the test of public use is    the right of the public to receive and enjoy its benefit internal quotation marks omitted

in hawaii housing authority the united states supreme court determined that a compensated taking is not proscribed by the takings clause when it is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose     hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 241 accordingly the definition of public use in general statutes § 8186 namely the continued growth of industry and business within the state survives the plaintiffs facial constitutional challenge inasmuch as our legislature rationally could have concluded that the taking of private property for such a purpose would be of general benefit to the public21bwhether the primary purpose of the condemnations is to serve the public interestthe next step in the analysis is to consider under the deferential standard of review whether the primary purpose of the condemnations is to serve the public interest with private benefits being incidental thereto or whether private interests are paramount and the public purpose is incidental in its discussion of this issue the majority characterizes the trial courts determination that the takings were intended primarily to benefit the public as a finding of fact to be reviewed by this court under the clearly erroneous standard see part ii b of the majority opinion the majority then concludes that the trial courts finding that the takings primarily were intended to serve the public interest with private benefits being incidental thereto was not clearly erroneous see id

i agree with the majority that the takings were intended primarily to benefit the public i disagree however that the trial courts determination regarding the public purpose of the condemnations is a factual finding subject to deferential review

the question of what is a public use is always one of law 2 t cooley constitutional limitations 8th ed 1927 p 1141 accord poletown neighborhood council v detroit supra 410 mich 639 fitzgerald j dissenting or as in the present case a mixed question of fact and law because the trial courts determination as to public use rests on numerous factual findings regarding the goals motives and interests of the public officials and private parties associated with the project see egstate v silva 65 conn app 234 255 738 a2d 7 mixed questions of fact and law involve application of legal standard to historical fact determinations cert denied 258 conn 929 783 a2d 1031 2001 accordingly we review the trial courts factual findings for clear error but review de novo the courts legal determination that the takings primarily were intended to serve the public interest see eg state v gibbs 254 conn 578 592 758 a2d 327 2000

the line of demarcation between a use that is public and one that is strictly and entirely private is a line not easily    drawn internal quotation marks omitted olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 547 this is especially true in the present case in which private interests potentially stand to gain significant financial benefits under the development plan i nonetheless agree with the majority that the evidence in the record supports a finding that the condemnations of the plaintiffs properties primarily were intended to serve the public interest and that the development plan on its face and the goals and objectives set forth therein are in accord with chapter 132 of the general statutes accordingly there is no need to repeat in detail all of the facts upon which the majority relies

the record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended primarily to serve the interests of pfizer inc or any other private entity but rather to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs generating a significant increase in tax revenue encouraging spinoff economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront furthermore the proposed project is being undertaken in an economically distressed municipality in need of a stimulus to invigorate the local economy accordingly the goals of the development plan are consistent with the important public interest described in general statutes § 8186 of promoting the economic welfare of the state through the growth of industry and business within the state and meeting the needs of industry and business     nevertheless the conclusion that the development plan was intended primarily to benefit the public per se is insufficient to justify the takingscwhether the development plan will result in a public benefitin my view the development plan as a whole cannot be considered apart from the condemnations because the constitutionality of condemnations undertaken for the purpose of private economic development depends not only on the professed goals of the development plan but also on the prospect of their achievement accordingly the taking party must assume the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the anticipated public benefit will be realized the determination of whether the taking party has met this burden of proof involves an independent evaluation of the evidence by the court with no deference granted to the local legislative authority in the present case the evidence fails to establish that the foregoing burden has been met22

the record contains scant evidence to suggest that the predicted public benefit will be realized with any reasonable certainty to the contrary the evidence establishes that at the time of the takings there was no signed agreement to develop the properties the economic climate was poor and the development plan contained no conditions pertaining to future development agreements that would ensure achievement of the intended public benefit if development were to occur

the development plan calls for a hotel and conference center on parcel 1 residential dwellings on parcel 2 commercial office space on parcel 3 parking and marina support on parcel 4a marina and waterrelated uses on parcel 4b commercial office and retail space on parcels 5a 5b and 5c waterfront commercial uses on parcel 6 and additional office space on parcel 7 despite extensive negotiations however no development agreement which the trial court described as a necessary engine to start any development project had been signed at the time of the takings in fact marty jones president of corcoran jennison the designated developer for parcels 1 2 and 3 testified at a deposition that she could not even predict when such an agreement would be signed although she was optimistic that it would be soon without an agreement however it is impossible to determine whether future development of the area primarily will benefit the public or even benefit the public at all several key project participants expressly recognized the importance of an agreement to such a determination in correspondence regarding the project and anticipated lawsuit23

nevertheless some minimal evidence was admitted as to the terms of a proposed agreement24 and insofar as those terms provide for the leasing of parcels 1 2 and 3 to corcoran jennison by the development corporation at a rate of 1 per year for a term of ninetynine years they appear to be more beneficial to the developer than to the city under the agreement it appears that the city would be locked into a longterm commitment to a single developer who then would be in a position to reap substantial financial rewards without a corresponding penalty if the developer does not perform as expected in addition the very generous terms of the proposed agreement are indicative of either an extremely weak real estate market or a possible violation of general statutes § 8200 b because that statute suggests that property acquired pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes must be sold or leased to a developer at fair market value or fair rental value     accordingly the terms of the unsigned proposed agreement do not appear to be consistent with the longterm public interest

furthermore the evidence in the record establishes that the real estate market at the time of the takings was depressed and that prospects therefore were poor that the contemplated public use could be achieved with any reasonable certainty specifically the trial court stated that the development plan itself says that as of the date of its preparation its studies show that rent levels of class a office buildings have stabilized but are below the level needed to support new speculative construction in fact historical values of class a office buildings have not recovered sufficiently to justify new construction except for end users the trial court also referred to testimony that the city of new london is still recovering from the recession of the early 1990s    market values are still well below replacement cost and new construction is generally not feasible    the demand for class a office space in new london at the present time is soft     internal quotation marks omitted indeed testimony revealed that newly constructed office buildings in shaws cove an area adjacent to the project area had not been fully occupied for more than fifteen years similar testimony described unsuccessful efforts by the redevelopment agency over the course of several years to attract investor interest in the construction of commercial office space at still another nearby location

additional testimony revealed that commercial real estate brokers had received few inquiries from companies with similar needs to those of pfizer inc and that because it is difficult for the city of new london to compete against the city of new haven in the market for biotechnologybioscience office space it is not economically feasible to develop this type of office space without a definite end user that will pay the rent to support the cost specific testimony adduced as to parcel 3 revealed that in light of the uncertainty surrounding demand and the feasibility of creating biotechnologybioscience office space and in light of the fact that office development on parcel 3 probably would be deferred until after the development of office space on parcel 2 any design should remain flexible to accommodate future demand the trial court relied on testimony that market conditions do not justify construction of new commercial space    on a speculative basis internal quotation marks omitted furthermore the trial court noted that buildings are not built without tenants and as of june 2001 there were no tenant commitments as to    the newly proposed office buildings internal quotation marks omitted the court also relied on testimony that flexibility is needed in this type of planning market conditions change and sites are developed over decades not years there must be an ability reserved to make alterations as market conditions change

a close examination of the proposed plan from a financial standpoint also suggests that there were only limited prospects of a public benefit at the time of the takings although the trial court noted that the project ultimately would generate increased tax revenue there apparently was no consideration of the loss in revenue that could result from the relocation of former residents and taxpayers out of the area during the ten twenty or even thirty years that might be needed to fully implement the development plan

moreover although the city tax assessor projected that annual tax revenue from the project when fully implemented was expected to increase sevenfold to approximately 26 million she also testified that her projection was based on an estimate of the square footage to be constructed a figure that was subject to change indeed testimony confirmed that the square footage and proposed uses very likely would change over the course of the project in addition due to the lack of a development schedule there was no testimony as to when the projected tax revenue would be realized accordingly the tax assessors revenue projection may not come to fruition if the area is not developed in the manner and in the time frame predicted

for example the projected receipt of 422100 in annual revenue from parcel 4a does not take into account the tax assessors opinion that the property may be exempt from taxation if developed for a museum owned by the federal government as one proposal had suggested state or nonprofit ownership of the museum would generate a portion of the projected revenue but revenue would fall well below the 422100 currently estimated moreover the tax assessors opinion that the market value of a museum that costs 30 million to build would be only 18 million is yet another indication of the depressed real estate market finally and perhaps most significantly the expected public investment in the project area of close to 80 million for a potential increase in annual tax revenue of 680544 to 124984325 at best hardly can be considered a major financial benefit to the public accordingly the projected increase in tax revenue should not be accepted at face value and does not support the conclusion that the project will further the public good

various other elements of the plan also are problematical the record contains no evidence that the indirect benefits projected under the plan namely spinoff economic activities and between 500 and 940 indirect new jobs will indeed be realized there also is no evidence as to when in the next thirty years such benefits might be realized in addition although the trial court relied on testimony that the city of new london has limited high end housing it also noted that there was little explanation as to why seventy to ninety high end attached residences would significantly improve the overall housing situation in a distressed municipality the trial court further noted that high end housing concentrated in one small area of the city would not be likely to have a multiplier effect accordingly the only possible positive consequence of the housing to be constructed appears to be a limited increase in tax revenue this revenue is impossible to evaluate however because it is not yet known whether a future development agreement will include a tax abatement incentive to encourage development of the property or other terms and conditions that may not be in accord with the general purposes set forth in the development plan or the applicable statutory scheme

the development plan also contains few if any performance requirements for future developers section 62 of the plan which concerns the disposition of the properties contains a general description of restrictions on parcel use but no firm timetable for project implementation no indication as to whether future developers will be offered tax abatements or other incentives that might not be in the public interest and no indication of possible penalties if developers do not perform as required moreover § 623 of the development plan provides that proceeds from sale of disposition parcels shall be used to offset costs of implementation of this development plan the provision in the development plan that purports to lease parcels 1 2 and 3 to a developer at the sum of 1 per year for a term of ninetynine years is particularly troubling when viewed in this context

the defendants note that the budget for the project is almost 80 million of which approximately 311 million has been spent to date that the project has been approved by numerous state and local agencies that the city of new london has spent thousands of dollars planning road improvements to make the site more attractive to prospective tenants and that other properties in the project area have been acquired in accordance with the plan objectives this has little bearing however on whether there is any reasonable certainty that the planned public benefit will be realized as the trial court conceded the protections afforded by the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions would be hollow indeed if takings were found to be constitutional merely because the condemning authority and various government agencies thought and acted as if they were so

the record therefore fails to establish that there was any momentum in the project from a development standpoint or any reasonable development prospects for parcels 3 and 4a at the time of the takings evidence to the contrary consists of vague predictions of future demand the trial court noted for example that according to the development plan the city of new london is at the threshold of major economic revitalization and the key catalyst is the pfizer inc research facility emphasis added and that a significant shortage of office space was expected by 2010 but none of the evidence in the record supports this conclusion in most of the important economic development cases cited by the majority to support its analysis developers had been identified and were prepared to develop the properties in question see eg poletown neighborhood council v detroit supra 410 mich 628 property to be conveyed to general motors corporation for construction of automobile assembly plant southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 22930 property to be conveyed to gateway international motorsports corporation for expansion of racetrack parking facilities olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 551 property subject to taking to be used in operation of existing grist mill

although the trial court acknowledged that for economic development policy to be practical a substantial period of time might have to pass before a project plan can be accomplished it nonetheless declared that the intent of chapter 132 of the general statutes would be crippled if government intervention would only be feasible if immediate project development is possible— economically distressed communities are the very ones where despite state intervention project accomplishment might be difficult on the other hand i would submit that government intervention to take nonblighted properties by eminent domain is unwarranted in any circumstance in which there is no realistic prospect of a future public benefit in the present case there is no development agreement or time frame within which the proposed development must take place indeed all of the evidence suggests that the real estate market is depressed and the development plan itself contains no detailed provisions to ensure that the future use will serve the public interest accordingly the record in the present case does not contain clear and convincing evidence to establish that this portion of the test has been satisfied i therefore would conclude that the takings are unconstitutional

having concluded that there is no reasonable certainty that the proposed public benefit will be accomplished there is no need to consider whether the condemnations are reasonably necessary to implement the plan26 i therefore need not address the majoritys analysis of that issueiv

conclusionin summary i believe that chapter 132 of the general statutes is constitutional on its face27 additionally there is very little evidence to support the plaintiffs claim that the development plan was created primarily for the benefit of private interests the benefits expressed in the development plan namely an increased tax base job creation and the revitalization of the city of new london as well as other evidence presented at trial support the majoritys conclusion that the plan is consistent with the public purpose and the goals set forth in chapter 132 of the general statutes see part ii of the majority opinion nevertheless the takings of the plaintiffs properties are unconstitutional because in my view the evidence is not clear and convincing that the property taken actually will be used for a public purpose

to highlight this concern consider the following hypothetical a town is economically distressed and has seen no significant development for years in good faith and in accordance with the procedural prerequisites contained in chapter 132 of the general statutes the town creates a master plan of development in 1999 that designates an area within the city limits for mixed use development a marketing study is completed while the plan is being drafted and demonstrates no significant shortage of office space until 2010 no immediate demand for hotel space without a corporate user that will subsidize the occupancy of up to one half of the projected 200 room facility and no demonstrated demand for upscale residential units to fulfill local housing needs despite this scenario the town proceeds with the plan of development and settles on the above uses

further efforts result in a determination regarding the scope of the project and the location and general size of various proposed buildings the master plan is submitted to a public hearing and subsequently approved by the local governing body the plan projects that the new development will create between 518 and 867 construction jobs and 1200 and 2300 direct or indirect permanent jobs and will result in an estimated sevenfold increase in annual property tax revenue the master plan does not include any minimum standards that the contemplated private developer will be required to satisfy28 while the taking authority has had numerous discussions with a particular developer there has been no agreement on the terms of a development agreement nevertheless the taking authority purchases certain parcels of land in the economic development area and takes other properties by eminent domain no one contends under this scenario that the properties acquired by eminent domain are not reasonably necessary for development to occur as provided in the master plan

now consider the following scenario six months after the takings are completed an interested developer is located the developer contends that the economic conditions of the town and region are such that the project is not economically feasible unless the development agreement requires the town and the taking authority to do the following 1 remediate the environmental conditions affecting the property 2 replace the road and utility infrastructure and 3 take measures to reduce the risk of coastal flooding all at a cost of more than 70 million additionally the developer insists that the town abate property taxes on properties located in the development area for a period of years and rather than require the developer to purchase the improved property at fair market value enter into an agreement with the developer to lease the property for ninetynine years for the sum of 1 per year furthermore the developer agrees to commence construction only after he is able to find viable tenants for the property or when a particular economic index for the area indicates demand for the uses such as when the vacancy rate for class a office space drops below a certain level

as i understand the majoritys view after according deference to the taking authority the takings in the above scenario which occur six months before any of the terms of the development agreement are known would withstand a challenge by property owners who wish to remain in their homes i however would find the takings to be at best premature the majority has created a test that can aptly be described as the field of dreams29 test the majority assumes that if the enabling statute is constitutional if the plan of development is drawn in good faith and if the plan merely states that there are economic benefits to be realized that is enough thus the test is premised on the concept that if you build it they will come and fails to protect adequately the rights of private property owners

i am not suggesting that an absolute guarantee is necessary to ensure that private economic development will occur as planned such a guarantee would be unrealistic in light of the fact that many unforeseen events could affect the plans implementation for example positive economic trends might falter and committed developers might be confronted with unanticipated difficulties that impair their ability to carry out plan objectives when such difficulties are apparent at the very outset of the planning process however a course of action should not be endorsed based entirely on speculation

to conclude i would grant the legislature no deference on this issue and place the burden on the taking authority to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the public benefit anticipated in the economic development agreement is reasonably ensured this in my view cannot be accomplished without knowing initially what the actual public benefit will be in the present case it is entirely unknown whether the public interest will be served there are no assurances of a public use in the development plan there was no signed development agreement at the time of the takings and all of the evidence suggests that the economic climate will not support the project so that the public benefits can be realized the determination of whether the private benefit will be incidental to the public benefit requires an examination of all of the pieces to the puzzle accordingly i respectfully dissent from parts ii iv and vi of the majority opinion

12 with regard to this purposive approach to statutory interpretation our legislature recently has enacted public acts 2003 no 03154 § 1 pa 03154 which provides the meaning of a statute shall in the first instance be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes if after examining such text and considering such relationship the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered this case does not implicate pa 03154 we note that in the present case the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes is not plain and unambiguous     pa 03154 accordingly our analysis is not circumscribed to an examination of text alone but rather properly may consider the various other sources helpful in the ascertainment of statutory meaning

13 general statutes § 8186 provides it is found and declared that the economic welfare of the state depends upon the continued growth of industry and business within the state that the acquisition and improvement of unified land and water areas and vacated commercial plants to meet the needs of industry and business should be in accordance with local regional and state planning objectives that such acquisition and improvement often cannot be accomplished through the ordinary operations of private enterprise at competitive rates of progress and economies of cost that permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes and in distressed municipalities to lend funds to businesses and industries within a project area in accordance with such planning objectives are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination

14 chapter 132 of the general statutes originally had referred only to unified land areas public acts 1967 no 760 § 1 the legislature amended it to include the present term unified land and water areas in 1975 public acts 1975 no 75480 § 1

17 general statutes § 8193 providesa after approval of the development plan as provided in this chapter the development agency may proceed by purchase lease exchange or gift with the acquisition or rental of real property within the project area and real property and interests therein for rightsofway and other easements to and from the project area the development agency may with the approval of the legislative body and in the name of the municipality acquire by eminent domain real property located within the project area and real property and interests therein for rightsofway and other easements to and from the project area in the same manner that a redevelopment agency may acquire real property under sections 8128 to 8133 inclusive as if said sections specifically applied to development agencies the development agency may with the approval of the legislative body and of the commissioner if any grants were made by the state under section 8190 or 8195 for such development project and in the name of such municipality transfer by sale or lease at fair market value or fair rental value as the case may be the whole or any part of the real property in the project area to any person in accordance with the project plan and such disposition plans as may have been determined by the commissioner

b a development agency shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to undertake and carry out development plans and development projects including the power to clear demolish repair rehabilitate operate or insure real property while it is in its possession to make site improvements essential to the preparation of land for its use in accordance with the development plan to install construct or reconstruct streets utilities and other improvements necessary for carrying out the objectives of the development project and in distressed municipalities as defined in section 329p to lend funds to businesses and industries in a manner approved by the commissioneremphasis added

18 general statutes § 8198 provides the commissioner is authorized to make and enforce reasonable regulations to carry out the provisions of this chapter

19 general statutes § 8199 provides any development agency shall exercise its powers in the name of the municipality and all bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be issued in the name of the municipality and title to land taken or acquired pursuant to a development plan shall be solely in the name of the municipality

20 this definition is not inconsistent with the legislative history of public acts 1967 no 760 which reveals that the act was intended to enable and encourage industrial development in districts that are comprised of more than one municipality representative william s mayer sponsor of the legislation stated this particular bill will be of interest to towns interested in industrial development not only within their own confines but within multitown districts a section of this particular act provides that towns can get together to develop industrial land on contiguous borders 12 hr proc pt 10 1967 sess pp 491718

24 public act 74184 § 1 also amended § 8186 to declare expressly that it is a public use and purpose to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial or business purposes     emphasis added

25 accordingly we disagree with the plaintiffs contention that the requirement of a relocation plan refers to the chapters definition of vacated commercial plant which contemplates partial occupation see general statutes § 8187 5 vacated commercial plants means buildings formerly used principally for business or industrial purposes of which more than fifty per cent of the usable floor space is or which it is anticipated within eighteen months shall be unused or substantially underutilized

29 the plaintiffs in seeking invalidation of the eminent domain provisions of chapter 132 of the general statutes under the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions provide a single unitary analysis that does not assert that the state constitutions public use clause offers them greater protection than the federal constitutions public use clause their approach is confusing to us because their principal brief otherwise is replete with citations to cases such as gohld realty co v hartford supra 141 conn 135 southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc 199 ill 2d 225 24041 768 ne2d 1 cert denied 537 us 880 123 s ct 88 154 l ed 2d 135 2002 and poletown neighborhood council v detroit 410 mich 616 63335 304 nw2d 455 1981 which typically would support the separate state constitutional analysis required as a threshold matter for review by well established connecticut precedent see eg state v dejesus 260 conn 466 480 n11 797 a2d 1101 2002 separate state analysis required state v geisler 222 conn 672 68485 610 a2d 1225 1992 factors governing construction of state constitution enumerated moreover the plaintiffs principal brief does not contain a discussion of any relevant federal precedent such as hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 229 we do note however that they do cite three significant federal cases in their reply brief

30 a committee appointed pursuant to the flowage act recommended that the improvement be made in furtherance of the public use olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 534 with respect to public use the trial court found that the mill operated generally for the public benefit in a farming community where people relied but not exclusively on it and other merchants to furnish food for people and animals id 536 the court also found that the mill owner had no legal obligation to allow the public access to the mill or to do milling for the public himself id 537 the trial court then reserved for this court the question of whether allowing the improvements to the mill would be a public use id

31 even more tellingly the court in olmstead stated further in none of the cases to which we have referred does the public as an active agent take and hold and occupy the property in actual possession the term public use is synonymous with public benefit or advantage it is equivalent to the language so familiar in our statute in relation to highways of common convenience and necessity

if there were any doubt on the subject on first principles we understand it to be the settled law of the country that the flowing of land for the purposes of mills and manufactories in view of its effect upon the community is to be considered as a taking it for public use it would be difficult to conceive a greater public benefit than garnering up the waste waters of innumerable streams and rivers and ponds and lakes and compelling them with a gigantic energy to turn machinery and drive mills and thereby build up cities and villages and extend the business the wealth the population and the prosperity of the state it is obvious that those sections of the country which afford the greatest facilities for the business of manufacturing and the mechanic arts must become the workshops and warehouses of other vast regions not possessing these advantages and must receive in exchange for the results of their industry and skill an abundant return of the rich products of the earth including the precious metals it is of incalculable importance to this state to keep pace with others in the progress of improvements and to render to its citizens the fullest opportunity for success in an industrial competition emphasis added olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 55051

32 prior to the urban renewal cases we note that this court has construed the phrase public purpose in the context of spending public moneys as synonymous with the term public use in barnes v new haven 140 conn 8 1214 98 a2d 523 1953 a taxpayer challenged the validity of an act creating a parking authority as lacking a public purpose under the emoluments clause article first § 1 of the connecticut constitution this court upheld the act as having the legitimate public purpose of addressing severe traffic problems a situation that calls for an appropriate exercise of the police power of the state operating through the city as one of its municipalities id 14 the court noted that whether the act does provide for a legitimate public purpose in the constitutional sense involves the question whether it primarily serves in a reasonable manner to promote the public welfare    if it does that an incidental financial benefit may result to certain individuals as distinguished from the public at large does not deprive it of its legitimate public purpose citations omitted id 1415

although barnes is a spending case and not a taking case it is significant in our resolution of the present case indeed the court in barnes expressly used the terms public use and public purpose in an interchangeable manner a definition that we later adopted in katz v brandon supra 156 conn 53233 a redevelopment taking case

33 for the sake of clarity we note that this courts opinion in katz v brandon supra 156 conn 53234 does not state whether its public use analysis is based specifically on either or both of the federal and state constitutions

34 indeed this court in katz v brandon supra 156 conn 533 noted that in this day of keen competition to attract industry and business to a state or to a particular locality public officials are expected to cooperate in helping an industry to locate in their community they must be at all times alert in providing for future as well as present needs internal quotation marks omitted

35 the court stated further the public end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of government—or so the congress might conclude we cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects what we have said also disposes of any contention concerning the fact that certain property owners in the area may be permitted to repurchase their properties for redevelopment in harmony with the overall plan that too is a legitimate means which congress and its agencies may adopt if they choose berman v parker supra 348 us 3334

36 the housing authority also made loans for up to 90 percent of the purchase price available to the existing tenants hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 234

37 in taking a broad purposive approach to public use the united states supreme court further emphasized that the mere fact that property taken outright by eminent domain is transferred in the first instance to private beneficiaries does not condemn that taking as having only a private purpose    the land reform act advances its purposes without the states taking actual possession of the land in such cases government does not itself have to use property to legitimate the taking it is only the takings purpose and not its mechanics that must pass scrutiny under the public use clause citations omitted emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted hawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 24344

38 the court also noted that whether the act is successful in solving hawaiis land problems is irrelevant to whether it was passed in furtherance of a valid public purposehawaii housing authority v midkiff supra 467 us 242 of course this land reform act like any other may not be successful in achieving its intended goals but whether in fact the provision will accomplish its objectives is not the question the constitutional requirement is satisfied if    the    state legislature rationally could have believed that the act would promote its objective emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted

39 the michigan supreme courts decision in poletown neighborhood council is a landmark case in the use of eminent domain we conclude that it warrants further discussion because it illustrates amply how the use of eminent domain for a development project that benefits a private entity nevertheless can rise to the level of a constitutionally valid public benefit in that case general motors corporation general motors had informed the city of detroit that it was going to close its cadillac plant in three years at the cost of more than 6000 jobs and the following loss of millions of dollars in real estate and income tax revenues poletown neighborhood council v detroit supra 410 mich 65051 ryan j dissenting general motors offered to build a new assembly complex in the city so long as a site suitable with regard to size and transportation access could be located id 638 fitzgerald j dissenting the city proposed a number of sites of which one the neighborhood in question met general motors specifications id 637 fitzgerald j dissenting the plaintiffs a neighborhood association and various individual residents brought an action to challenge the project id 628

the michigan court concluded in a per curiam opinion that the taking of a residential neighborhood for the purpose of conveying that property to general motors for construction of an assembly plant was public use under the state constitution because of the economic benefits of the jobs and tax revenue that would result from the plants construction id 63334 the majority opinion noted that the legislature had stated distinctly in the state economic development corporations act the public purposes of revitalizing the states economy and alleviating unemployment and also had authorized municipalities to condemn properties for development as industrial or commercial sites with subsequent transfer to private users id 63031

indeed the court framed the issue in the case as whether the proposed condemnation is for the primary benefit of the public or the private user id 632 the majority deferred to the legislatures determination of economic development as a legitimate public purpose id 633 the court stated when there is    public need the abstract right of an individual to make use of his own property in his own way is compelled to yield to the general comfort and protection of community and to a proper regard to relative rights in others    eminent domain is an inherent power of the sovereign of the same nature as albeit more severe than the power to regulate the use of land through zoning or the prohibition of public nuisances citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted id 63334 the court then noted that the economic benefits to the city of the condemnation are clear and significant id 634 the court stated the power of eminent domain is to be used in this instance primarily to accomplish the essential public purposes of alleviating unemployment and revitalizing the economic base of the community the benefit to a private interest is merely incidental id

the majority however limited the impact of its holding the court stated our determination that this project falls within the public purpose as stated by the legislature does not mean that every condemnation proposed by an economic development corporation will meet with similar acceptance simply because it may provide some jobs or add to the industrial or commercial base if the public benefit was not so clear and significant we would hesitate to sanction approval of such a project    where as here the condemnation power is exercised in a way that benefits specific and identifiable private interests a court inspects with heightened scrutiny the claim that the public interest is the predominant interest being advanced such public benefit cannot be speculative or marginal but must be clear and significant     emphasis added id 63435

there were two dissenting opinions in poletown neighborhood council the dissenting opinions by justices fitzgerald and ryan both criticized the degree of deference to the legislative public use determination and distinguished economic development from blight clearance id 639 643 fitzgerald j dissenting id 665 673 ryan j dissenting the dissenters also criticized what they deemed to be incidental public benefit as compared to the direct benefit to general motors from the new plant id 641 fitzgerald j dissenting id 672 ryan j dissenting

poletown neighborhood council informs but does not dictate our decision in the present case specifically we decline to follow the michigan courts holding that when the condemnation power is exercised in a way that benefits specific and identifiable private interests a court inspects with heightened scrutiny the claim that the public interest is the predominant interest being advanced id 63435 indeed we conclude that the application of a heightened scrutiny standard id 635 is inconsistent with our well established approach of deference to legislative determinations of public use

40 we note that the ninth circuit court of appeals decision in armendariz v penman supra 75 f3d 132021 is a significant example of judicial intervention into an alleged governmental abuse of property rights by agents of the citys executive branch in armendariz city agents had conducted multiple housing code enforcement sweeps in an area of the city with low income housing owned by the plaintiffs id 1313 the plaintiffs alleged that city officials conducted the sweeps to enable a commercial developer to acquire contiguous property in the neighborhood on the cheap bulldoze the lowincome housing units and replace them with a planned shopping center according to the plaintiffs the city effectuated these purposes by faking the existence of serious housing code violations purportedly discovered on the plaintiffs properties during the sweeps in order to invoke the city building officials emergency powers to evict the plaintiffs tenants and revoke the plaintiffs business licenses and certificates of occupancy id 1315

the ninth circuit concluded that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under 42 usc § 1983 because if the plaintiffs can prove their allegations the defendants actions would constitute a taking of the property such a taking if the allegations are true would seem not to have been for a public use as the fifth amendment requires but rather for the use of another private person the shoppingcenter developer id 1321 significantly however the court stated in dicta that if the city council    had by ordinance declared that a shopping center on the plaintiffs property would serve a public use by for example increasing legitimate business traffic in the area and providing jobs for neighborhood residents the city might have been able to acquire the plaintiffs property through the payment of just compensation under the power of eminent domain id

the court emphasized however that what the plaintiffs allege here is an uncompensated taking through a raw misuse of government power if the allegations are true the only determination that could possibly have been made that a shopping center on the plaintiffs land was a public use would have been a secret determination by the defendants as executivebranch officials of the city or as individuals using the cloak of their official positions to effect their private ends thus the usual extreme deference that courts owe to legislative determinations of public use    is not appropriate here citations omitted emphasis added id

41 the leading treatise on eminent domain states that there are two competing definitions of the term public use—a narrow definition and a broad definition 2a p nichols eminent domain 3d ed rev 2003 j sackman ed § 7022 through 7 pp 726 through 737 the broad definition provides that  public use means public advantage any eminent domain action which tends to enlarge resources increase industrial energies or promote the productive power of any considerable number of inhabitants of a state or community manifestly contributes to the general welfare and prosperity of the whole community and thus constitutes a valid public use under this view of public use it has been held that the scope of eminent domain is both coterminous with the scope of the sovereigns police powers as well as its constitutional taxing authority id § 7023 pp 729 through 732

in contrast under the narrow definition to make a use public means that the property acquired by eminent domain must actually be used by the public or that the public must have the opportunity to use the property taken id § 7022 p 726 the treatise states that the broad view of eminent domain generally has gained greater acceptance among the federal and state courts id § 7025 pp 735 through 736 but that neither definition comprehensively can explain all eminent domain public use holdings id § 7026 and 7 pp 736 through 737 concluding that further efforts at providing a precise definition of public use are doomed to fail and many courts have recognized this     id § 7027 p 737

44 in the condemnation action the trial court heard testimony about the positive public safety impact that the expanded parking would have on severe highway traffic generated by the racetrack as well as on the benefits that continued racetrack expansion would bring to the region southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 23234 the trial court granted the condemnation petition and ordered compensation paid to the defendant as soon as title vested in the plaintiff it conveyed the property to the racetrack id 234

45 indeed the illinois supreme court rejected the plaintiffs contention that it is the purpose of the taking alone that controls noting that in its wisdom the legislature has given the plaintiff the authority to use eminent domain power to encourage private enterprise and become involved in commercial projects that may benefit a specific region of this state while we do not question the legislatures discretion in allowing for the exercise of eminent domain power the government does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights    the power of eminent domain is to be exercised with restraint not abandon citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 242

46 the court stated that it appears the plaintiffs true intentions were to act as a default broker of land for the racetracks proposed parking plan southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 241 the court also dismissed claims of resulting economic benefits as mere trickledown of the racetracks revenues stating that revenue expansion alone does not justify an improper and unacceptable expansion of the eminent domain power of the government using the power of the government for purely private purposes to allow the racetrack to avoid the open real estate market and expand its facilities in a more costefficient manner and thus maximizing corporate profits is a misuse of the power entrusted by the public id

47 the opinion in southwestern illinois development authority v national city environmental llc supra 199 ill 2d 254 also included a spirited dissent by justice freeman who stated that contrary to the holdings of hawaii housing authority and berman the majority gives little deference to the legislatures public use determination further the majority engrafts upon hawaii housing authority and berman a requirement that property taken by eminent domain be put into use for the public a proposition specifically rejected by the court in hawaii housing authority    todays opinion is not an accurate rendition of the holdings of hawaii housing authority and berman and of the principles of law involved in this area citation omitted

justice freeman also supplied a rendition of the facts that he concluded demonstrated the economic benefits of the racetrack and its proposed expansion id 24353 freeman j dissenting and noted what he considered an extreme lack of deference by the majority to the legislative findings regarding the need to alleviate certain economic housing and other conditions in the southwestern part of this state    and that alleviation of these conditions furthers certain public purposes id 26162 freeman j dissenting ultimately justice freeman concluded in his dissent that the majority commits great disservice to the state of illinois and its citizens in engrafting upon the public use doctrine the requirement that property taken by eminent domain must be accessible to the general public as of right this requirement is the death of social legislation in furtherance of economic development and revitalization emphasis added id 268

49 moreover we note that the use of the eminent domain power for economic development certainly is not without support in the academic community see eg m harrington public use and the original understanding of the socalled takings clause 53 hastings lj 1245 1249 2002 arguing that attempts to craft devices to encourage judicial oversight of legislative takings are without warrant in the historical record    and the term public use as used in the fifth amendment was meant to be descriptive rather than proscriptive t merrill the economics of public use 72 cornell l rev 61 65 1986 discussing economics of and proposing models of judicial review of public use determinations t benedict note the publicuse requirement in washington after state ex rel washington state convention  trade center v evans 75 wash l rev 225 226 2000 noting confusing array of standards for determining public use and advocating for application of broader public purpose standard

50 we note that the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the parcel 3 condemnations promote sufficient public benefit to be considered in furtherance of the economic development that constitutes the public use in the present case the plaintiffs also claim that the trial court correctly concluded that the parcel 4a condemnations do not promote sufficient public benefit to be considered in furtherance of the public use the defendants contend in response that the court should not engage in a parcelbyparcel analysis and should consider the significant tax and employment economic benefits resulting from the development plan as a whole

we decline to address the plaintiffs parcelspecific claims in this context because an appropriate public use analysis necessarily requires evaluation of the development plan as a whole—the end result of the sum of all of its parts cf broadriver inc v stamford 158 conn 521 534 265 a2d 75 1969 although the plaintiffs concern is for its own parcel within the redevelopment area the commissions responsibility was to consider conditions existing in the entire area including such matters as street layouts and the relation and significance of the plaintiffs property to the entire area cert denied 398 us 938 90 s ct 184 26 l ed 2d 270 1970 pet car products inc v barnett 150 conn 42 52 184 a2d 797 1962 for urban renewal the plaintiff misconceives the agencys responsibility to consider the condition obtaining in the entire area rather than the condition of the individual property we will however address the plaintiffs parcelspecific claims in the related context of reasonable necessity that is whether the taking of the plaintiffs property was reasonably necessary to achieve the public purpose of the development plan see eg pequonnock yacht club inc v bridgeport supra 259 conn 600604 see parts iv and vi of this opinion

51 the term requirements was contained in a december 1997 letter from claire gaudiani the president of the development corporation to george milne the president of pfizers research division in this letter gaudiani had stated that the development corporation was pleased to make the commitments outlined below to enable you to decide to construct a pfizer central research facility in new london the letter describes the efforts to design a land plan to ensure that the new pfizer facility will be the centerpiece of a concentrated reuse of the area surrounding the former new london mills it informs milne that in addition to your facility the project includes the development of the states fourth biotechnology incubator the refurbishment of historic fort trumbull the reuse of the vacant naval undersea warfare center and the development of mixed retail and residential space that will be fully integrated into the surrounding neighborhoods of the city of new london in order to achieve these goals it will be necessary to relocate the calamari bros scrap dealer upgrade utilities and infrastructure and acquire a number of surrounding properties the conclusion of the letter states that the development corporation will work with you to refine this proposal to meet pfizers requirements as the trial court correctly points out in the letter no mention is made of a hotel or office buildings    or any direct link between new residential construction and any need by pfizer executives for upscale housing

52 indeed hicks testified that the major gist of the development corporations goals were to expand upon the pfizer facilities that is to have not just pfizer come in but other ancillary economic benefits accrue before that i mean can you multiply it pfizer with any large company attracts other users attracts people to provide them services if you do whats commonly referred to as an economic analysis cluster analysis theres groups of firms and companies that relate to companies that also bring employment so one of the major goals was to expand upon pfizer for the benefit of citizens of new london to improve the tax base provide employment opportunity    if youve got something that very rarely happens in my experience in an urban area a major corporation moving a lot of jobs highpaying jobs it gives you really good opportunities to take advantage of that and expand some of the things that you see in your community emphasis added

53 we note that during the testimony of william longa senior corporate counsel for pfizer the trial court wondered how pfizer could move to the city without already having had the hotel and housing plans in place in response to this longa testified that there were sufficient hotels and housing in the general area that already served its facility in nearby groton the groton facility did not have housing and hotels immediately adjacent longa however testified that the hotels and housing are a significant part of ensuring that the city rather than just the outlying towns could take advantage of pfizers relocation

54 the trial court also noted the testimony of james mahoney executive director of the development corporation from 1992 to 1998 mahoney testified that the development corporation interacted with pfizer during the environmental impact evaluation process as part of a market analysis intended to determine appropriate uses for the development plan area pfizer did at this time inform them of the demand for hotel conference and residential space that its presence would create

55 the email indicated that the state did not want to locate new residences in a floodplain area or condemn existing residential areas to replace them with more upscale housing the email did not mention office space or the need to clear the entire fort trumbull area of existing residences and businesses which were the needs that precipitated the need for the condemnations in the present case

56 the trial also court quoted the proposition in katz v brandon supra 156 conn 533 that in this day of keen competition to attract industry and business to a state or to a particular locality public officials are expected to cooperate in helping an industry to locate in their community they must be at all times alert in providing for future as well as present needs internal quotation marks omitted

57 the trial court was not and we are not blind to the social costs of the development plan in the present case in the words of the trial court an old new london neighborhood with all of its memories in effect has been destroyed people like the plaintiffs have been or might yet be removed from homes they love and in some cases from homes where their families have lived for generations

58 we take the opportunity however to state that the trial courts social costs analysis was an improper but in this case harmless supplantation of a decisionmaking function better suited to legislative bodies although the courts remain charged with determining whether the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the primary purpose of the taking is to benefit the public the balancing of the benefits and social costs of a particular project is uniquely a legislative function

59 indeed wilmington parking authority v land with improvements supra 521 a2d 23234 is noteworthy as another example of the role of judicial review in curtailing the abusive use of the power of eminent domain it is an excellent illustration of the line between public and private takings in that case a parking authority attempted to take land ostensibly for garage construction but then intended to transfer it to a neighboring newspaper company id 229 the newspaper company would use the land for facility expansion but the parking authority would pay the newspaper company for the air rights over the land and construct a garage there id the trial court blocked the parking authoritys use of eminent domain for this purpose id 230

on appeal the delaware supreme court concluded that the trial court did not commit clear error when it concluded that the parking authority acted beyond its statutory authorization because the primary purpose of the project was to retain a newspaper company as a corporate citizen rather than to provide the public with parking facilities id 234 the court also considered that other parking authority actions would dispose of 500 public parking spaces offsetting the projected gain of 950 new spaces of which 10 percent were reserved automatically for newspaper company employees id

60 cf donahue v southington supra 259 conn 795 in equal protection context the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker internal quotation marks omitted franklin furniture co v bridgeport 142 conn 510 51415 115 a2d 435 1955 while recitals of fact in a legislative act may not be conclusive a decent respect for a coordinate department of the government requires the courts to treat them as true until the contrary appears

61 the trial court determined that the taking of parcel 4a was not reasonably necessary and therefore only discussed the reasonable assurances of future public use for parcel 3 accordingly on appeal the plaintiffs claimed only that parcel 3 lacked reasonable assurances of future public use in response to the defendants crossappeal however the plaintiffs expanded their argument to include parcel 4a and therefore we will address them together

62 the dissent claims that this court sub silentio is overruling the holdings of connecticut college v calvert 87 conn 421 88 a 633 1913 and evergreen cemetery assn v beecher 53 conn 551 5 a 353 1886 more specifically the dissent cites those two cases for the proposition that the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand connecticut college v calvert supra 428 contrary to the dissents claim our conclusion in the present case is consistent with the principles set forth in those two cases

we disagree with the dissent however on the appropriate standard the trial court should apply to the plaintiffs claim of lack of reasonable assurance of future public use we conclude that the trial courts factual determination about the statutory and contractual constraints on future public use is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review the dissent to the contrary proposes a new four step process of review in which one of the steps would require the development corporation to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the specific economic development contemplated by the plan will in fact result in a public benefit this step essentially subjects the plaintiffs lack of reasonable assurances argument to an evidentiary standard that no other court or even the plaintiffs themselves has set forth furthermore this court knows of no other area of the law where we or any other courts have imposed a clear and convincing standard on a prediction of future events as the dissent itself makes clear even in other civil cases involving property disputes the clear and convincing standard is reserved for past events and not for predictions of future events see eg wildwood associates ltd v esposito 211 conn 36 42 557 a2d 1241 1989 clear and convincing evidence required to prove elements of adverse possession claim additionally it is hard for this court to imagine how any plan proposed and adopted according to the provisions of chapter 132 of the general statutes would be able to prove that the economic development will in fact occur in the future thus there is simply no basis in reason precedent policy or practicality for the dissents proffered standard

63 the trial court also referred to its findings on the delegation issue see part iii of this opinion wherein the court concluded that pursuant to chapter 132 of the general statutes there is substantial state oversight of the operations of the development corporation with respect to the implementation of the development plan specifically the court discussed § 8189 development plan must conform to department regulations general statutes § 8190 department may make planning grants and advise development agency general statutes § 8191 department must approve final development plan if state grants have been made general statutes § 8193 a if state grants have been made department and city must approve land transfers by sale or lease in accordance with plan and general statutes § 8200 a substantial changes to development plan require approval in same manner as original plan in discussing the delegation issue the trial court noted that the state is a signatory to the development agreement and it concluded that it strained credulity to believe that the state    will not 1 have the wherewithal to control the activities of the development corporation to a sufficient degree so as not to allow that agency to be characterized as being able to act according to its own will and caprice and will not 2 have the ability to ensure through the development agreement that the developer and the development corporation will seek to meet the goals and purposes of the development plan which the commissioner had to approve in the first place    

64 the development plan provides in addition to an antidiscrimination clause that the redeveloper must agree for itself and its successors and assigns as successors in interest to the parcel or any part thereof that the deed conveying the parcel shall contain language covenanting on the part of redeveloper and its successors and assigns thatthe parcel shall be devoted principally to the uses contemplated by the plan and shall not be used or devoted for any other purpose or contrary to any of the limitations or requirements of said plan all improvements made pursuant to the plan and this agreement shall be used in accordance with the plan unless prior written consent is given by the development corporation and department for a different use

the parcel shall not be sold leased or otherwise disposed of for the purposes of speculationemphasis added

65 although the present case provides no occasion for a complete exploration of the mechanisms for judicial enforcement of the development plan under chapter 132 of the general statutes it is elementary that the terms of the development plan like any other legal obligation may of course be dishonored that is one reason why courts exist northeastern gas transmission co v collins supra 138 conn 589 although we need not address its precise workings there is ample judicial machinery id available for enforcement of the development agreement and the development plan in the event of breach of their terms by either the development corporation or private developers

66 indeed the court distinguished the project from redevelopment projects    with the public agency identifying and putting together an assemblage of land in order to attract a developer because all of the other land already was owned by the existing neighboring hotel and casino casino reinvestment development authority v banin supra 320 nj super 355

67 the court stated that in casino reinvestment development authority v banin supra 320 nj super 357 a public agency through the power of eminent domain if successful will have effectively created an assemblage of land for future development by trump under circumstances where the casino authority could not do so under the enabling statute and where trump is unable or unwilling to do so itself on the open market

68 moreover we also reiterate our previous conclusion that the public use or purpose in the present case is in the first instance the plan to induce the significant economic growth projected as a result of private sector development spurred by the terms of the development plan as the defendants note correctly such growth necessarily requires time to occur

69 general statutes § 8188 provides any municipality which has a planning commission is authorized by vote of its legislative body to designate the economic development commission or the redevelopment agency of such municipality or a nonprofit development corporation as its development agency and exercise through such agency the powers granted under this chapter except that the quinnipiac valley development corporation organized and existing by virtue of the provisions of number 625 of the special acts of 1957 may be designated as a development agency for the purposes of this chapter to act as such within the geographical area specified in section 2 of said special act any municipality may with the approval of the commissioner designate a separate economic development commission redevelopment agency or nonprofit development corporation as its development agency for each development project undertaken by the municipality pursuant to this chapter

70 the development plan as approved by the city council prior to its authorization of the development corporation to use eminent domain expressly listed those properties needed for its implementation

71 the january 2000 resolution specifically stated that the new london city council hereby resolves 1 that the development plan is hereby approved    6 that to carry out and administer the project public action under chapters 130 132 and 588 l of the connecticut general statutes as amended is required and for the purposes of carrying out this project that the new london city council approves and bestows upon the development corporation all rights and powers that are permitted to accrue to a development agency or implementing agency under chapters 130 132 and 588 l of the connecticut general statutes as amended including the power of eminent domain with the project area in the name of the city of new london per chapter 130 section 8128 and chapter 132 section 819372 the october 2000 development corporation resolution provided in relevant part whereas the new london city council has designated the development corporation a nonprofit development corporation as its development agency pursuant to the connecticut general statutes andwhereas the development corporation has prepared a project plan for development plan area pursuant to section 8189 of the connecticut general statutes and

whereas the project plan for the development plan area has been duly approved and adopted pursuant to section 8191 of the connecticut general statutes and

whereas it is necessary to acquire certain properties located in the development plan area of the city in order to carry out and administer said project plan and

whereas pursuant to section 8193 of the connecticut general statutes the development corporation has the approval of the new london city council to acquire by eminent domain properties within the development plan area

now therefore it is resolved that the development corporation in the name of the city acquire certain properties located in the development plan area of the city through the exercise of the power of eminent domain as granted to it under chapter 132 of the connecticut general statutes said properties are more particularly described    

it is further resolved that the development corporation take such steps as are necessary to effectuate such acquisition in the manner provided in sections 8128 through 8133 of the connecticut general statutes73 the plaintiffs also had argued in the trial court that the development corporation was entirely a private entity not subject to control by the state or city governments and that the benefits of its actions accrued wholly to private parties such as corcoran jennison the trial court rejected these arguments after reviewing the extensive statutory framework under chapter 132 of the general statutes governing the development corporations use of eminent domain see footnote 63 of this opinion on appeal the plaintiffs challenge only the trial courts constitutional analysis

74 in evergreen cemetery assn v beecher supra 53 conn 552 this court acknowledged the public necessity of the proper burial of the dead as a matter of the safety of the living     the court also noted that the legislature provided for associations to exist with power to provide maintain and protect public burial places and that the use of land by them for this purpose does not cease to be a public use because they require varying sums for rights to bury in different localities not even if the cost of the right is the practical exclusion of some id 553

the court also noted that the cemetery association was a private facility not necessarily open to all a category of cemetery whose proprietors    cannot take land for such continued private use by right of eminent domain id it therefore was distinguishable from public access cemeteries as well as privately operated mills toll roads and bridges which while they benefit their private operators remain a public use as long as all persons have the same measure of right for the same measure of money id the court therefore denied the cemetery associations petition to take land by eminent domain id

75 the power of eminent domain which emanates from the state legislature see eg northeastern gas transmission co v collins supra 138 conn 58687 initially had been granted to the city through chapter 132 of the general statutes see general statutes §§ 8186 8193 a and 8199 the plaintiffs did not challenge this initial grant to the city only the subsequent grant from the city to the development corporation

76 goebel testified that corcoran jennison will select the tenants for the office buildings the development corporation has no say over who the tenants will be

77 we note that the parties dispute whether an agency relationship exists between the development corporation and the city and that the plaintiffs cite several instances of the development corporation being less responsive to the inquiries of the city than an agent customarily should be to the questions of a principal the trial court however concluded that an agency relationship did in fact exist between the city and the development corporation as well as the development corporation and the department nevertheless in light of our resolution of the plaintiffs claim by a straightforward application of the rule set forth in carofano and connecticut college we note that the existence of an agency relationship is immaterial to the resolution of this appeal

78 the trial court acknowledged that mullin is a highly qualified and obviously knowledgeable individual his qualifications included numerous fellowships teaching positions academic publication military experience and government planning work

79 mullin also testified that in his opinion prospective purchasers of singlefamily detached homes would not necessarily be more inclined to look in the suburbs or someplace other than immediately adjacent to a sewage treatment plant

80 hicks has had experience in planning waterfront development projects in other cities including lewiston maine and fall river massachusetts he also has governmental and academic experience in addition to his private sector work hicks also has worked as a developer in addition to planning

81 in preparing the development plan rkg associates also worked on the statutorily required environmental impact evaluation which described the city in great detail hicks testified that the environmental impact evaluation reflected the citys declining population housing stagnation and rising unemployment particularly in light of the closing of the united states naval undersea warfare center

82 specifically hicks testified as follows what they finally adopted was they would get a private sector developer to come in what that basically means is a common redevelopment approach as you prepare the site you give them raw land with the necessary infrastructure and the developer makes an investment this site though has a lot of risk its got hazardous waste its got geographic constrainment its got a lot of regulations dealing with it and its in an urban setting thats not the most attractive for investment and thats the reality you have to face theres not a lot of people coming and investing in the city so if youre going to attract a private developer to this type of site setting youve got to try to minimize as much uncertainty as much as possible most developers are good at understanding risks but not uncertainty if you said well give you something that looks like a spotted leopard—

q whats the spotted leopard

a its where a leopard has spots spots are things that stay the same and youve got to work around them spotted leopard is just a way to refer at the configuration of land uses if youre going to attract developers if youre going to put out what you call requests for proposals and get them interested in the site and after they overcome all the inherent problems with redevelopment say to them also well youve got to work around this contingency    you greatly diminish your ability to finding competent capable people to come in you take things that would possibly be risk and turn them into uncertainty developers operate with very short time frame financial conditions and it was our recommendation that because the housing wasnt adaptable and a longterm use to the office related things and that three four kinds of the hodgepodge of certain things that we recommended that most of those facilities be demolished emphasis added

83 the parties had stipulated to the admission into evidence of the deposition of jones

84 jones testified that publicprivate partnerships frequently have design review processes wherein the agency that selected the developer has a role in reviewing the developers site plan jones and goebel testified that in the present case the development corporation and the department would be the reviewing agencies and that they had in fact engaged in informal reviews of corcoran jennisons plans jones also testified however that the formal process would occur pursuant to the development agreement which had not yet been finalized

85 jones testified that it is important for corcoran jennison to have a full site because first of all to be able to develop the amount of parking needed for economic feasibility and also    that the grading issues in    parcel 3 are very complicated and the retention of isolated properties within that area could make it very difficult to develop this sort of property

86 the trial court also heard the testimony of goebel who stated that retention of the plaintiffs homes in parcel 3 did not conform with the development plan he also described the process by which the present development plan was chosen and eventually approved by the city development corporation and department and the fact that it was a composite of six alternate plans see footnote 6 of this opinion goebel also stated that the development corporations decision to utilize the development plan at issue was informed by public comments during the selection process

87 general statutes § 8125 b provides redevelopment area means an area within the state which is deteriorated deteriorating substandard or detrimental to the safety health morals or welfare of the community an area may consist partly or wholly of vacant or unimproved land or of land with structures and improvements thereon and may include structures not in themselves substandard or insanitary which are found to be essential to complete an adequate unit of development if the redevelopment area is deteriorated deteriorating substandard or detrimental an area may include properties not contiguous to each other an area may include all or part of the territorial limits of any fire district sewer district fire and sewer district lighting district village beach or improvement association or any other district or association wholly within a town and having the power to make appropriations or to levy taxes whether or not such entity is chartered by the general assembly     emphasis added

88 hyde testified that when the united states naval undersea warfare center was in the city spinoff development occurred as satellite companies opened up in the city to service it he testified that these satellite companies then followed the sound lab to newport rhode island when it relocated there hyde stated that he would expect similar spinoff development in the city as a result of pfizer although he personally was unsure about the kind of outside contractors with whom pfizer interacts

89 additionally in support of their claim that courts reject projects that are on uncertain timetables the plaintiffs point us to san diego gas  electric co v lux land co 194 cal app 2d 472 47980 14 cal rptr 899 1961 state v 062033 acres of land 49 del 174 17980 112 a2d 857 1955 and meyer v northern indiana public service co 254 ind 112 11315 258 ne2d 57 1970 superseded on other grounds 259 ind 408 287 ne2d 882 1972 their reliance on these cases is misplaced because of the considered effort that went into the development plan in the present case and the fact that the marketing studies and other evidence have indicated a foreseeable need for office space as a result of the new pfizer facility in contrast we note that the california court concluded that on the facts of that case the taking of the defendants property by the plaintiff power company for gas and telephone lines is not necessary    because the plaintiff has no present or prospective plans to use it for that purpose san diego gas  electric co v lux land co supra 194 cal app 2d 481 similarly the indiana court rejected the electric companys attempt to maintain a 200 foot rightofway for electric lines when the company had admitted that all it needed for the near future was the 150 feet that they already had there was no evidence of plans that would require more room meyer v northern indiana public service co supra 254 ind 115 moreover the delaware court concluded that the taking for highway construction was impermissible when no present or future need had been established and the department of transportation had taken no official action toward the highways construction state v 062033 acres of land supra 49 del 17980 accordingly these cases are distinguishable from the present case wherein a carefully considered projection of need and plans for achieving it were in place prior to the taking

90 article first § 20 of the constitution of connecticut provides in relevant part no person shall be denied the equal protection of the law    

91 the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution § 1 provides in relevant part no state shall    deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws

92 in their brief the plaintiffs do not provide an independent analysis asserting the existence of greater protection under the state constitutional provision than its federal counterpart    and we will not of our own initiative address that question    accordingly the federal equal protection standard is considered prevailing for the purposes of our review of both the state and federal equal protection claims in this case internal quotation marks omitted donahue v southington supra 259 conn 794 n7

93 membership in the club is limited to descendants of people who emigrated from a certain region in italy the club holds dinners for its members they may bring guests to the dinners

94 in so concluding the trial court rejected the defendants contention that the club and the plaintiffs were not similarly situated because the clubs building was a commercial property while the plaintiffs homes were residential the court expressly noted that the club was not commercial property the trial court however also rejected the plaintiffs contention that they were similarly situated because both were slated for acquisition and demolition under the development plan and wanted to stay but that the clubs building was spared the court concluded that this was more a statement of the problem not the solution

95 the plaintiffs had claimed in the trial court that the taking implicated a fundamental right to property ownership and that the development corporations decision thus was subject to the strict scrutiny standard of review the trial court concluded that the right to property ownership was not fundamental for equal protection purposes and therefore the development corporations action was subject only to the rational basis standard of review on appeal the plaintiffs do not contest the trial courts decision to use the rational basis standard of review

96 specifically the trial court noted the testimony of mahoney and james dunn the director of real estate acquisition for the development corporation to the effect that condemnation of the club and a nearby church could be politically difficult nevertheless the trial court concluded that in january 2000 the city council approved the development plan with the club condemnation intact the trial court also noted the testimony of goebel and damon hemmerdinger a consultant to and former director of real estate development for the development corporation to the effect that even after the city had approved the development plan the development corporation in response to public comments continued to consider not demolishing other properties in addition to the club

the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs claim that milne spoke to the governor about retaining the club was pure speculation particularly because milne was never deposed or called to testify and the development corporation officers were never questioned about their involvement in this conversation the trial court also noted multiple substantial state expenditures in support of the project many months before the decision was made to retain the clubs building

97 see eg state v ferguson 260 conn 339 36566 796 a2d 1118 2002 even if we were to assume without deciding that the statement had been made with knowledge of its falsity and that this fact should therefore be excised from the affidavit we conclude that probable cause still existed for the warrant to issue

98 equal protection does not just mean treating identically situated persons identically    moreover the requirement imposed upon plaintiffs claiming an equal protection violation is that they identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in all relevant aspects were treated differently     citation omitted emphasis altered internal quotation marks omitted thomas v west haven supra 249 conn 402 quoting dartmouth review v dartmouth college 889 f2d 13 19 1st cir 1989 accord cadlerock properties joint venture lp v commissioner of environmental protection 253 conn 661 672 757 a2d 1 2000 cert denied 531 us 1148 121 s ct 1089 148 l ed 2d 963 2001 entities are situated similarly in all relevant aspects if a prudent person looking objectively at the incidents would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated much as in the lawyers art of distinguishing cases the relevant aspects are those factual elements which determine whether reasoned analogy supports or demands a like result exact correlation is neither likely nor necessary but the cases must be fair congeners in other words apples should be compared to apples internal quotation marks omitted dartmouth review v dartmouth college supra 19 accord equus associates ltd v southampton 37 f sup 2d 582 599 edny 1999 utilizing test kirschner v zoning board of appeals 924 f sup 385 392 edny 1996 same

99 in willowbrook v olech supra 528 us 563 property owners had asked village officials to connect their property to the municipal water supply the village conditioned the connection on the property owners granting the village a thirtythree foot easement despite the fact that it had connected other properties to the water supply upon the grant of fifteen foot easements id after a three month delay the village relented and connected the subject property to the water supply with a fifteen foot easement id thereafter the property owners brought an action contending that their equal protection rights had been violated by the thirtythree foot demand which they alleged was irrational and wholly arbitrary and the result of ill will by the village toward them because of a prior action between the parties id the district court dismissed the claim on appeal the seventh circuit reversed holding that a plaintiff can allege an equal protection violation by asserting that state action was motivated solely by a spiteful effort to get him for reasons wholly unrelated to any legitimate state objective id 56364

applying this reasoning the supreme court affirmed the seventh circuits decision and concluded that the property owners complaint stated a cause of action stating that the allegations that the villages demand was irrational and wholly arbitrary and that the village ultimately connected the property after receiving a clearly adequate fifteen foot easement    quite apart from the villages subjective motivation are sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis id 565 in so concluding the court expressly did not reach the alternative theory of subjective ill will relied on by the seventh circuit id

100 in its memorandum of decision the trial court expressed its concern that the phrase park support is vague and undefined damon hemmerdinger who had been the development corporations director of real estate development and presently serves as a consultant to the development corporation called it broad and not a statutory term stating that parcel 4a would serve uses such as parking or other ancillary uses for the park or marina indeed claire gaudiani president of the development corporation also was not sure of the exact definition of the phrase park support

we note as did the trial court that mullin the plaintiffs expert testified that he had never heard the term before but understood it to mean parking storage and warehousing mullin also referred to parcel 4a as a big nothing but then acknowledged that it could provide parking for both the parcel 4b marina as well as the state park he did state that he had insufficient information to estimate the parking demand as a result of those two facilities

101 this section of the development plan also states that parcel 4b is intended to accommodate a mix of waterdependent uses centered around the rehabilitated fort trumbull marina which will provide boat slips and upland support the marina may be developed as a working marina training center with facilities designed in conjunction with improvements made to parcel 4a

102 gaudiani testified that the museum would not be on the tax rolls but would provide jobs and generate revenue by attracting thousands of visitors if built the museum would preclude the use of parcel 4a for parking

103 goebel also testified that he was hoping for the museum to be located on parcel 4a

104 the trial court quoted krauter v lower big blue natural resources district supra 199 neb 439 as stating that the landowners right to own possess and enjoy his property free from an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain may best be insured by requiring specific pleadings and proof we hold that in a condemnation action under the power of eminent domain the condemnor must allege the specific public purposes for which the condemnor seeks to acquire and use the property sought to be taken emphasis added

105 the court in state highway commission v yost farm co supra 142 mont 24344 stated in an action to condemn private property for a public use the question of necessity is one of fact to be determined as other questions of fact in view of all the evidence in the case the evidence should show that the land is reasonably required for the purpose of effecting the object of its condemnation    the question of necessity in a given case involves a consideration of facts which relate to the public and also to the private citizens whose property may be injured the greatest good on the one hand and the least injury on the other are the questions of fact to be determined in passing upon the question of necessity   

the foregoing statutes and cases clearly reflect that under our eminent domain statutory provisions the trial judge not only has the power to determine the question of necessity but has been directed to make a finding that the public interest requires the taking of the lands before he has power to issue an order of condemnation citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted

similarly the court in krauter v lower big blue natural resources district supra 199 neb 439 stated that in a condemnation case issues as to the amount of property needed and the estate or interest in such property are questions of fact for the court see also footnote 104 of this opinion

106 accordingly we need not address the plaintiffs factual contentions in support of the trial courts opinion because they are offered in support of a factual finding that was the product of the application of an improper legal standard

107 we also need not address the defendants other claim in support of their cross appeal which is that the trial court improperly refused to permit the defendants to take the plaintiffs properties on parcel 4a for the purpose of roadway and infrastructure improvements

108 as the development corporation points out accomplishment of the development plans general plan for development requires that the development corporation have flexibility in carrying out the plan the general plan states that the fort trumbull development plan area shall be developed as a dynamic mixeduse urban district that fully develops the opportunities presented by its waterfront location and its adjacency to the developing regional assets of the fort trumbull state park and the pfizer global development facility the development of its proposed land uses shall support the formation of a vibrant waterfront urban village which binds each of its components into a highly cohesive urban district

the integrated nature of the proposed development shall a increase public access and use of the waterfront b maintain a community atmosphere and c enhance the locations attractiveness and desirability the establishment of strong functional spatial and physical interrelationships between the districts various buildings streets public spaces and the waterfront shall orient the development of each of the proposed land use components emphasis added

1 it is a fundamental principle of law that the power to appropriate private property for public use is an attribute of sovereignty and essential to the existence of government    it attaches to every mans land and is paramount to his right of ownership    it lies dormant in the state until set in motion by legislative enactment citations omitted northeastern gas transmission co v collins 138 conn 582 586 87 a2d 139 1952

2 i disagree in large part with the majoritys analysis in part i of its opinion any discussion about this issue is unnecessary however in light of my conclusion that chapter 132 of the general statutes applies to nonvacant land

3 although i agree with the majoritys conclusion in part v of its opinion my conclusion that the taking of the plaintiffs properties is unconstitutional for other reasons is dispositive of the appeal and thus the court need not reach the plaintiffs equal protection claims

4 general statutes §§ 8186 through 8200b

5 the term private economic development as used in this opinion refers to the type of development permitted under chapter 132 of the general statutes

6 in redevelopment projects it is the elimination of blight and not the development that follows that constitutes the public benefit see generally general statutes § 8124

7 the police power has been described as extensive elastic and constantly evolving to meet new and increasing demands for its exercise for the benefit of society and to promote the general welfare it embraces the states power to preserve and to promote the general welfare and it is concerned with whatever affects the peace security safety morals health and general welfare of the community     16a am jur 2d 251 constitutional law § 315 1998

8 section 120 of the development plan provides in relevant part this development plan andor any modification hereof shall be in full force and effect for a period of thirty    years from the date of first approval    by the city council of the city of new london   

9 general statutes §§ 8125 through 8169w

10 pursuant to § 8124 those activities include the acquisition of property the removal of structures the improvement of sites the exercise of powers by municipalities and any assistance offered by any public body

11 general statutes § 8187 10 defines the term business purpose as including    any commercial financial or retail enterprise and    any enterprise which promotes tourism and any property that produces income this definition does little however to illuminate the meaning of private economic development as that term is used in chapter 132 of the general statutes

12 general statutes § 8200 provides in relevant part b if after three years from the date of approval of the development plan the development agency has been unable to transfer by sale or lease at fair market value or fair rental value as the case may be the whole or any part of the real property acquired in the project area to any person in accordance with the project plan and no grant has been made for such project pursuant to section 8195 the municipality may by vote of its legislative body abandon the project plan and such real property may be conveyed free of any restriction obligation or procedure imposed by the plan but shall be subject to all other local and state laws ordinances or regulations

13 the majoritys claim that its conclusion in the present case is consistent with the principles set forth in connecticut college and evergreen cemetery assn footnote 62 of the majority opinion is misplaced the majority misses the point in concluding that the trial court properly determined that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to ensure that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan part ii c of the majority opinion as i note in this opinion the question is not whether the development plan and the statutes reasonably ensure adherence to the development plan but rather whether private sector participants are available and willing to develop the property and whether the terms by which they agree to develop the property will result in a public benefit such that the private benefit will be incidental thereto

14 in olmstead a private party effected the taking see olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 532 reporters case summary but for a purpose that the court concluded was public id 551

15 the court found that olmstead had leased the mill to his brotherinlaw jonathan camp jr for an indefinite period olmstead v camp supra 33 conn 535 reporters case summary the court also found that there was no agreement that camp should do custom grinding for the public which obligated him to do it but such had been the practice from the time when the mill was erected and it was the expectation of the parties to the lease that the practice would be continued id 53536 reporters case summary

16 public acts 1864 c xxvi §§ 1 and 2 codified as amended at general statutes 1866 rev tit 1 c 16 § 388 provided sec 1 that when any person shall desire to set up a water mill on his own land or upon land of another with his consent and to erect a dam on the same for working such mill by water which dam would flow water on to land belonging to any other person he may obtain the right to flow said land upon the terms and conditions and subject to the regulations hereinafter expressed

sec 2 any person wishing to flow land as aforesaid if he can not agree with the owner or owners as to the damages to be paid may bring his petition to the superior court for the county where the land to be overflowed or any part of it lies which petition shall contain such a description of the land to be overflowed and of the dam its location and proposed height as that the record will show with certainty the matter that shall be determined and shall be served on the respondent according to law requiring service of petitioners in such court

17 the majoritys conclusion that there is no basis in reason precedent policy or practicality for judicial review to determine whether the proposed economic development will in fact occur footnote 62 of the majority opinion reflects a complete misunderstanding of the law of this and other jurisdictions see part ii b of this opinion see also walker v shasta power co supra 160 f 860 connecticut college v calvert supra 87 conn 428 evergreen cemetery assn v beecher supra 53 conn 553 linggi v garovotti supra 45 cal 2d 27 wilton v st johns supra 98 fla 47 kessler v indianapolis supra 199 ind 426 brown v gerald supra 100 me 357 kirkwood v venable supra 351 mo 46668 kansas city v liebi supra 298 mo 591 charlotte v heath supra 226 nc 754 756 state ex rel harlan v centraliachehalis electric ry  power co supra 42 wash 63940 state ex rel tacoma industrial co v white river power co supra 39 wash 66771

18 i contrast this standard of proof with the standard of proof in the typical civil case between private parties ie preponderance of the evidence in the typical civil case society is minimally concerned with the outcome and the litigants share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion eg state v rizzo supra 266 conn 210 in such a case we require only a modicum of subjective certitude on the part of the fact finder as long as the fact finder is persuaded that the plaintiffs assertions are probably more true— by no more than a ratio of fiftyone to fortynine—the plaintiff has met his burden of persuasion

at the other end of the spectrum is the criminal case in such a case the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment in the administration of criminal justice our society imposes almost the entire risk of error on itself    by requiring    that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt internal quotation marks omitted id 21011

19 the majoritys assertion that the clear and convincing standard should not be applied to evidence that the proposed development will in fact occur because the standard is reserved for past events and not for predictions of future events footnote 62 of the majority opinion is not only incorrect but entirely misses the point of the present analysis as to the assertions validity the majority need only consider the fact that when the state wishes to exclude a criminal defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victims testimony it must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants presence would    seriously call into question the trustworthiness of the victims testimony state v jarzbek supra 204 conn 704705 obviously the testimony in question is the future testimony of the minor victim the clear and convincing standard also is used in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to establish that the natural parent cannot or will not provide a normal family home for the child emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted santosky v kramer 455 us 745 767 102 s ct 1388 71 l ed 2d 599 1982 quoting ny soc serv law § 384b 1 a iv mckinney sup 1981 more important however is the fact that the evidentiary showing suggested in the present case does not require a prediction of future events but testimony and documentation as to the present development environment which if persuasive might include signed development agreements marketing studies that indicate a nearterm demand for the proposed uses and evidence of economic trends that would support economic development within the three year time period before the condemnor is permitted to abandon the project and convey the acquired properties to developers free of the plans restrictions see general statutes § 8200 b in other words although the purpose of such evidence is to document the probability that future development will occur as planned the evidence itself would be grounded in present realities

20 see also general statutes §§ 8128 through 8133

21 i note that the plaintiffs have not raised the issue of whether the statutory scheme is facially unconstitutional on the basis of a lack of adequate standards to ensure that the public purpose will be achieved when a legislative body retains a police power articulated standards and guidelines to limit the exercise of the police power are unnecessary    police powers which are delegated however must include minimum standards and guidelines for their application    the failure to provide standards and guidelines for the application of the police power constitutes a delegation of legislative power repugnant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment citations omitted cary v rapid city 559 nw2d 891 895 sd 1997 see 16a am jur 2d 257 supra § 320 see also berman v parker supra 348 us 35 standards contained in redevelopment statute sufficiently definite to sustain delegation of authority to administrative agencies to execute plan for eliminating blight

chapter 132 of the general statutes contains numerous technical specifications regarding the content and adoption of a plan project financing the acquisition and transfer of properties and other matters see generally general statutes § 8186 et seq there are no statutory guidelines and criteria however to ensure that the plan primarily will benefit the public and thereafter that the proposed public benefit will be achieved this is in stark contrast to chapter 130 of the general statutes in which the public purpose is defined as the elimination of blight and detailed guidance is provided as to how that purpose is to be accomplished see generally general statutes § 8124 et seq

22 in my view the evidence in the record also is insufficient to establish that the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met

23 on march 6 2002 claire gaudiani president of the development corporation sent an email to several other project participants including jones and david goebel executive director of the development corporation which stated what became clear during the executive committee meeting with the development corporation yesterday morning is that we absolutely positively need a fully signed and executable set of documents including the real estate agreement by may 1 the importance of this fact to the law suit is apparently very high the same sentiment was expressed by goebel in an email sent to jones among others on march 27 2001 when he stated that concluding the development agreement prior to the start of the institute law suit will go a long way to deflate the argument that property is being taken with no plan in place in fact we feel this is crucial corcoran jennison also realized the importance of a signed development agreement when jones testified in a deposition taken on june 22 2001 that she had received communications from others involved in the project that such an agreement should be in place prior to commencement of the trial in order to demonstrate that the project was moving forward

24 the courts knowledge of the agreement is derived from the very brief document entered into evidence as plaintiffs exhibit jjj and the testimony of various witnesses and deponents the document in evidence contains only the first page of the proposed agreement that page refers to the acquisition and demolition of properties by the development corporation but not to any obligation on the part of the developer or other terms regarding the leasing of the properties in question

25 these figures which differ from the figures to which the tax assessor testified are the figures contained in the development plan and quoted in the majority opinion according to the tax assessor the annual property tax revenue derived from the project area was approximately 362111 prior to project approval but was expected to increase to approximately 2603696 following completion of the project if borne out this constitutes an increase of approximately 2241585 far more than that projected by the development plan

26 i note however that i disagree with the majoritys conclusion that the trial court improperly determined that the takings on parcel 4a were not reasonably necessary because the proposed use was too vague and uncertain see part vi of the majority opinion

27 see footnote 21 of this opinion however for a brief discussion of constitutional concerns that the plaintiffs have not raised on appeal

28 such minimum standards might include a commencement date for the project a construction schedule a guaranteed number of jobs to be created selection criteria for potential developers financing requirements the nature and timing of land disposition and a commitment as to the amount received in property taxes as a percentage of assessed value
