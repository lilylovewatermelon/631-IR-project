can never be true
you can show emotion
in the little things you do
words when kindly spoken
can make dreams seem true
but more than words can say
are the little things you do
the little things you do

a tender touch can mean so much
a card a letter when away
each little smile is so worthwhile
to show affection each day
love can be so tender and always be true
but love must have assurance
by those little things you do
love must have assurance and you can make it true
by the little tings you doyou might also likeembed"
