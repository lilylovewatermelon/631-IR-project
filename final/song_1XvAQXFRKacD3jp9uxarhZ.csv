you know sometimes i dont know why
but this old town just seems so hopeless
i aint really sure but it seems i remember the good times
were just a little bit more in focus
but when she puts her arms around me
i can somehow rise above it
yeah man when i got that little girl standin right by my side
you know i can tell the whole wide world to shove it hey

chorus
here comes my girl
here comes my girl
yeah and she looks so right
she is all i need tonight

verse 2
every now and then i get down to the end of the day
i have to stop and ask myself why ive done it
it just seems so useless to have to work so hard
and nothin ever really seems to come from it
and then she looks me in the eye and says were gonna last forever
and man you know i cant begin to doubt it
no cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
i know we aint never gonna change our minds about it hey

here comes my girl

bridge
watch her walk

verse 3
every time it seems like there aint nothin left no more
i find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
yeah i just catch myself wondering waiting and worrying
about some silly little things that dont add up to nothin
and then she looks me in the eye and says were gonna last forever
and man you know i cant begin to doubt it
no cause it just feels so good and so free and so right
i know we aint never gonna change our minds about it hey

chorus
here comes my girl
here comes my girl
yeah and she looks so right
she is all i need tonight
