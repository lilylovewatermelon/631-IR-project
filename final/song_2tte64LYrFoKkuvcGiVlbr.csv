yeah youre a loaded gun
so dont worry honey youll go right back
where you started from
benny saved saved a spot for you
cause he knows youre comin back honey
cause you always come back
and you cant talk to him like that
cause hes gonna hurt you bad
honey i bet you my spot in hell
i dont know where it is you go
but i know hes going through your heart honey
and straight to the house of god
i know youre still here and you wish you could feel it
i see you on a big screen and youre lookin sick to your stomach
look at you
you look so confused
and i remember when you complained about being alone
i could do anything to you
i could do anything for you
i could do anything to youyou might also like1embed"
