verse 1
hunnas on hunnas do numbers on numbers get llamas on llamas llamas on llamas
got bales by the bundle
got hunters thats gone theres a hun in the joint thats a hundred on hundred
trapped out the house with my partners
we went to shoppin on midget
we went to cop it and get it take flights out the city
we go to az and send it

im hungry i admit it i swear im conditioned
i served and i hustled on any conditions

i get them stacks and get busy
