you were the one to visit my darkness
you were the brightest way
you dropped a stone into the well
wed wait for the sound it made
when it got quiet you could hear your heart
tell me what did it say
i was a bird you opened the cage
it felt like a clean white page

chorus
you came along
you light up my days my personal sun
showing me all the ways i could fall
you made me feel new
im crashing im crashing right into you
baby feel me crash
im crashing im crashing right into you
baby feel me crash
