verse 1 lil wayne
i tell her now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga
i already know that life is deep but i still dig her
niggas is jealous but really i could care less
im in hells kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
devil on my shoulder the lord as my witness
so on my libra scale im weighin sins and forgiveness
what goes around comes around like a hula hoop
karma is a bitch well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
life on the edge im danglin my feet
i tried to pay attention but attention paid me
haters cant see me nosebleed seats
and today i went shoppin and talk is still cheap
i rock to the beat of my drum set
i been at the top for a while and i aint jump yet
but im ray charles to the bullshit
now jump up on that dick and do a full split

hook drake
uh she just started to pop it for a nigga
and looked back and told me baby its real
and i say i aint doubt you for a second

verse 2 lil wayne
i tell her now go and pop that pussy for me
haters cant see me but them bitches still lookin for me
and you could take that to the bank and deposit that
put your two cents in and get a dollar back
some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
im all about i give the rest of the vowels back
i like my girl thick not just kinda fine
eat her til she cry—call that whine n dine
try to check me and ima have em checkin pulses
they say choose wisely thats why i was chosen
rockin like asphalt its the cash fault
looked in the face of death and took its mask off
now i like my house big and my grass soft
i like my girl face south and her ass north
but im ray charles to the bullshit
now hop up on that dick and do a full split

hook drake
uh she just started to pop it for a nigga
and looked back and told me baby its real
and i say i aint doubt you for a second
i squeeze it and i could tell how it feel
i wish we could take off
and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
‘cause she bad so maybe she wont
uh but shit then again maybe she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin game right now she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin game right now she will
maybe for the money and the power
and the fame right now she will
do it for the realest niggas
in the fuckin game right now she will
outro drake
uh she just started to pop it for a nigga
and looked back and told me baby its real

i squeeze it and i could tell how it feel i feel like the sky is opening and i am entering
i wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal

cause she bad so maybe she wont
uh but shit then again maybe she will
