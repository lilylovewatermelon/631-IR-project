verse 1
i tick tick tick i collected my ticks
top dog even though i didn’t speak no english
guess i got grit coz i suffer for my shit
guess i came from the sticks and moved to the bricks
you can’t fix this coz i’m in the same mix
guess i’m in the air you can smell me like vickss
this chicks bringing back this
it’s my last wish
one snare one kick oh look at this

verse 2
i freak in minds like
giddy up giddy up giddy up
come take a ride
light the city up city up city up
you’ve got me fired up
sound boy got me back up
i keep my head downbeat it up beat it up beat it up

verse 3
mia mudra middle finger
fuck em other bitches that try to be my ringer
this time i come as singer
next time ill come as pain
i aint talking money
but i can make it rain
bitches try to get me with
their witches on cocaine
snitches turn to dust
and i wash em down the drain
vitamins for your brain
protein for your weight gain
