i want to be where the talk of the town
is about last night when the sun went down
yeah and the trees all dance
and the warm wind blows in that same old sound

prechorus
and the water below gives a gift to the sky
and the clouds give back every time they cry
and make the grass grow green beneath my toes
and if the sun comes out ill paint a picture all about

chorus
the colors ive been dreaming of
the hours just dont seem enough
to put it all together
maybe its as strange as it seems
hmm hmm hmm hmm

verse 2
and the trouble i find is that the trouble finds me
its a part of my mind it begins with a dream
and a feeling i get when i look and i see
that this world is a puzzle ill find all of the pieces

and put it all together and then ill rearrange it
ill follow it forever
always be as strange as it seems hmm hmm
nobody ever told me not to try not to try
oh lets try oh lets try
