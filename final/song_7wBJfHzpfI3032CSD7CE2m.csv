verse travis scott  mc e
okay i been up for some days i aint got time to lay
just to drown out all these thoughts i tried all kind of things
if i take you to my past you will be traumatized
got a thousand kids outside thats tryna come alive
99 took astroworld it had to relocate
told the dawgs id bring it back it was a seal of faith
before no car notes baby girl she played the tourist guide
got the keys into my city now she know the rides
got new money got new problems got new enemies
when you make it to the top thats the amenities
packin out toyota like im in the league
and it aint a mosh pit if aint no injuries
i got em stage divin out the nosebleeds alright alright alright
and she hit that booger sugar til her nose bleed alright alright alright
bounce that shit forever she on both knees
she was talkin bout forever got a whole week alright alright alright
plus she know my baby mama is a trophy
she be throwin up them bs feel like we both bleed
she keep my dick jumpin up feel like im moby
im way too gold for this beef feel like im kobe yeah
this right here is astronomical
i see you picked up all my ways i feel responsible
they tryna say that all my problems is improbable
they keep itchin at my spirit im diabolical you feel me238embed"
