i see your face in my mind as i drive away
cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes we change our minds
but its killing me to see you go after all this time

verse 2 taylor swift with colbie caillat
music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
now i dont know what to be without you around

prechorus taylor swift with colbie caillat
and we know its never simple never easy
never a clean break no one here to save me
youre the only thing i know like the back of my hand

chorus taylor swift with colbie caillat
and i cant breathe without you but i have to
breathe without you but i have to

verse 3 taylor swift with colbie caillat
never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
