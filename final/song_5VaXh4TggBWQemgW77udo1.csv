my reflection as that shadows
blessing my death
lost soul in agony meet machine tragedy

god if you love me then why wont
you set me free
i dont have callwaiting hey was that
you pranking me

chorus
the sheep within
wearing wolfs skin
weak vagiant
amongst midgets

bridge
snot and cum piss and shit
of this i am made  like the taste of it

vomit pus sweat tears blood
the scab removed revealing what was

chorus 2
of this man of steele
nothing is real
the truth be scant
lord of idiots
you might also likethe punishment
eternal lent
victims be clear
youre all volunteersembed"
