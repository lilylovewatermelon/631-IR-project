long lost words whisper slowly to me
still cant find what keeps me here oh ohoh ohoh
when all this time ive been so hollow inside

i know youre still there

chorus
watching me
wanting me
i can feel you pull me down
fearing you
loving you
i wont let you pull me down

postchorus

verse 2
hunting you
i can smell you alive oh ohoh ohoh
your heart pounding in my head

chorus
watching me
wanting me
i can feel you pull me down
saving me
raping me
