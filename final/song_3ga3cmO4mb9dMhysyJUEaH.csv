theres a slow moon rising
its shining on your skin
the way your body moves me
i know theres no holding back
no holding back

chorus
i wouldnt be a man if i didnt feel like this
i wouldnt be a man if a woman like you
was anything i could resist
id have to be from another planet
where love doesnt exist
i wouldnt be a man if i didnt feel like this

verse 2
i can feel passion flowing
as you fall into my arms
the secret way you touch me
tells me theres no holding back
no holding back

chorus
i wouldnt be a man if i didnt feel like this
i wouldnt be a man if a woman like you
was anything i could resist
id have to be from another planet
where love doesnt exist
i wouldnt be a man if i didnt feel like this

chorus
i wouldnt be a man if i didnt feel like this
