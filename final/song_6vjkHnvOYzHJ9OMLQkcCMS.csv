i wanna crawl inside your womb
i wanna watch the rose on your cheeks bloom
i wanna be the face in the moon
and watch the stars spin around your room
all your carefully worded letters
and your carefully spoken words

chorus
i will continue to evolve
i will continue to revolve around your sun
cause you are the only one
who understands
who reaches out with both hands
even while youre fading
im just shivering and waiting
i will continue to evolve
i will continue to revolve around your sun
cause you are the only one

verse 2
i wanna drink deep from your well
i wanna be the heart for which you fell
i wanna be a shooting star
across the heavens to be where you are
all your carefully worded letters
and your carefully spoken words

i will continue to evolve

i will continue to evolve
i will continue to revolve around your sun
cause you are the only one

i wanna crawl inside your womb
i wanna watch the rose on your cheeks bloom
