im a liability im a liability
much for me
youre a little much for me no no no no
and what ya gonna do whoa

verse
all of the dreams that get harder
all of the things that i offer you ayy
and all of the shit that we harbour
make all of the kids in the choirs sing woohoo
and maybe all this is the party
maybe the tears and the highs we breathe oh no
and maybe all this is the party
maybe we just do it violently

outro
but youre not what you thought you were
but youre not what you thought you were
liability but youre not what you thought you were
much for me but youre not what you thought you were
