where’s that space of fear you hide
have you gone way beyond the center out there in space
i know you need to get even

verse 1
tell me the one about the hand that holds you down
because the bruise on your face it always seems to stay around
and tell me the one about the hand that holds you down
cause you seem to be lost with no intention to be found

prechorus
so how does it feel
and how does it feel

chorus
to be the one who’s always in the way
to be the words that never made the page
be the one who’s always
left out in the rain

verse 2
tell me again about the spark that met the flame
and tell me again about the man who went insane
is there a place within for redemption is there a voice inside with a decision
and if so when and if so then where’s the conviction

so how does it feel
and how does it feel

chorus
to be the one who’s always in the way
to be the words that never made the page
be the one who’s always
left out in the rain

be the one who’s always
left out in the rain
be the one who’s always
left out in the rain

i know that you need to get even
and i know it’s for all the right reasons
and i well i know that youre staring at the edge
and i well i know that you need to get even

prechorus
so how does it feel
and how does it feel

chorus
to be the one who’s always in the way
to be the words that never made the page
be the one who’s always
left out in the rain
be the one who’s always
left out in the rain
be the one who’s always
left out in the rainembed"
