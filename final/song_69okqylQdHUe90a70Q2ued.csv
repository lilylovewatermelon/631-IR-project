bury me in the bedroom where i i can sing you to sleep all night
put me next to the open window promise me a second time
cause i dont wanna leave without you buried by my side
id rather kill the one responsible for falling stars at night
cause they fall all around me
the night can be deadly

chorus vic fuentes and vanessa harris
and theyll never take us alive
can you chase away the darkness
to live and love and die
last night she recited every reason shes fine
so if were heading there together at the same time
you sing while i drive

verse 2
move like a fugitive tonight
dance on the ambulance
cause id rather spend my life vacations
in bed with you like drunken summer kites
and this is only a test
sober and scaring me to death

chorus vic fuentes and vanessa harris
theyll never take us alive
can you chase away the darkness
to live in love and die
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
and i dont care if youre sick
i dont care if youre contagious
i would kiss you even if you were dead
would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life
cause id do anything to hold your hand
and i dont care if youre sick
i dont care if youre contagious oh no
would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life
cause id do anything anything anything

chorus vic fuentes
theyll never take us alive
cause ill chase away the darkness
ill live and love and die
i join the party for the recently blind
so if were heading there together you can sing all night

outro vic fuentes
im gonna tear out the thread one by one from your skin
till your bones feel embarrassed from all the attention
kiss me while i drive19embed"
