ladies and gentlemen
i like to introduce you all to a new game
its called dope ball
similar rules and regulations but at the same time very different
goes a lil something like this

verse
its not pick n roll its more like pick a roll
what you gon push we waste a blow
if its all 3 then thats the 3 from the top of the key before you cup a brick scrape some grams off the top of the key
same for the blow we call those free throws they call m cheerleaders we call m cheap hoes
find some low ones have them beg a few os
next thing you know your puttin numbers on the boat
the whole point is to stay on the courts but in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts
yeah they similar but not the same sports
both international import export
extort and if you get caught the law is like referee it can get bought
extort and if you get caught the law is like referee it can get bought

outro

little idea i came up with sitting at the crib
watching the ocean thinking about things we used to do back in the day
