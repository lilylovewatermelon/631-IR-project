last night i saw that beauty queen
watched her paint her face on
i wanna be that magazine
that she bases life on

prechorus
i wanna waste her monthly blood
wanna get some on my love
wanna get some gasoline
and burn the house down

chorus
shes got nothing to say
shes got bills to pay
shes got no one to hate
except for me

when i saw that beauty queen
watched her paint her face on
i wanna be the one unclean
that she wipes her ass on

prechorus
wanna waste her monthly blood
wanna get some on my love
wanna get some gasoline
and burn the house down

shes got bills to pay
shes got no one to hate
except for me
shes got nothing but shame
she takes pills for pain
shes got no one to blame
except for me
