remember the feelings remember the day
my stone heart was breaking my love ran away
this moment i knew i would be someone else
my love turned around and i fell

be my bad boy be my man
be my weekend lover but dont be my friend
you can be my bad boy but understand
that i dont need you in my life again
wont you be my bad boy be my man
be my weekend lover but dont be my friend
you can be my bad boy but understand
that i dont need you again
no i dont need you again

verse 2
you once made this promise to stay by my side
but after some time you just pushed me aside
