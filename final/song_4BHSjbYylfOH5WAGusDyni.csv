verse 1 kendrick lamar
i got so many theories and suspicions
im diagnosed with real nigga conditions
today is the day i follow my intuition

my girl told me dont let these hoes get in my head
my world been ecstatic i checked the signal that read—

verse 2 kendrick lamar
interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
fox news wanna use my name for percentage
my latest muse is my niece she worth livin

im not a politician im not bout a religion
im a israelite dont call me black no mo
that word is only a color it aint facts no mo
my cousin called my cousin carl duckworth

and deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
i know he walks the earth
but its money to get bitches to hit yah
zeroes to flip temptation is yah
first on my list i cant resist yah
