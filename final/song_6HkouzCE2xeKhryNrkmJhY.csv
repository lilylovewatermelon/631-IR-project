find out whats there something new you can see
get up get down get a little bit closer to me
find out whats there what you can be

yesterday was our time to turn back again
and instead we went through the fire to get lost in sin
burn baby burn let me cool you down again
turn baby turn to see where it all begins

cause its alright its out there
go and get lost girl
its alright im out there
let me take control

get up get down move a little bit closer to the scene
find out whats there something new you can see there
get up get down get a little bit closer to me girl
find out whats there what you can be

walking over tv on
let it take control love
every side inside your body each and every bone
burn baby burn lets cool it down again
turn baby turn to see where it all begins
