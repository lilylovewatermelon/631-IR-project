verse 1
oh if you only knew what weve been up to
i guarantee youd keep it secret
so give it to me now were lost in a dream now
do it five four three two one more time

chorus
in the vegas lights
where villains spend the weekend the deep end
were swimming with the sharks until we drown
the vegas lights
the lies and affectations sensation
were winning till the curtains coming down

aint it so aint it so perfect
our cynical minds will make it totally worth it
so give it to me now were lost in a dream now
do it five four three two one more time

and were all not here for nothing
and were bored with looking good
we gotta be starting something
would you change it if you could

would you change it if you could
and were bored with looking good

we gotta be starting something
would you change it if you could
would you change it if you could
