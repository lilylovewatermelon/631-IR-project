verse 1 xxxtentacion
lost in the pessimistic state of perception
its been hard to participate in natural instances and
due to my history i dont know whats next for me but
keep my composure fuck over anyone next to me
if dean detriment told me love was for negligent
motherfuckers that cant seem to keep aware in they head
im not selfaware im misled im a hypocrite like the rest
i will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends

im sorry mama i didnt mean to fucking hurt you
if i could test my worth ill show you heaven on this earth
so if alive or in the dirt i swear to god youll be my first priority

i said i didnt mean to fucking hurt you
if i had to test my worth ill show you heaven on this earth
so if alive or in the dirt i swear to god youll be my first priority
before the hurt that mean for better or for worse

verse 2 kinoul
through the soulless pit i never slip i get a grip
my mind drift to a place where the devil lives
my soul rise to a sky made of abyss
with the evidence that i made with the elements
fuck your settlement lets settle this now we tearing it down
we make these incredible sounds we cherishin now
the pain that was never announced we singin it out
they look around confused like they aint figure it out
outro killstation
oh you cant run away
from everything you made
you try to erase
the memories will fade69embed"
