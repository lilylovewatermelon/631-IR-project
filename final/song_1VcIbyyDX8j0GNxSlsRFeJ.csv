yeah but nobody searches
nobody cares somehow
when the loving that youve wasted
comes raining from a hapless cloud
and i might stop and look upon your face
disappear in the sweet sweet gaze
see the living that surrounds me
dissipate in a violet place

prechorus
cant you see what youve done to my heart
and soul
this is a wasteland now

chorus
we spies
we slow hands
put the weights around yourself
we spies
oh yeah we slow hands
you put the weights all around yourself
now

verse 2
i submit my incentive is romance
i watched the pole dance of the stars
we rejoice because the hurting is so painless
from the distance of passing cars
but i am married to your charms and grace
i just go crazy like the good old days
you make me want to pick up a guitar
and celebrate the myriad ways that i love you

cant you see what youve done to my heart
and soul
this is a wasteland now

chorus
we spies
yeah we slow hands
put the weights around yourself
we spies
oh yeah we slow hands
killer for hire you know not yourself

chorus
we spies
we slow hands
you put the weights all around yourself
we spies
oh yeah we slow hands
we retire like nobody else
we spies
intimate slow hands
killer for hire you know not yourself
we spies
intimate slow hands
you let the face slap around herself8embed"
