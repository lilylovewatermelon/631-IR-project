verse 1
you dont ever have to be stronger than you really are
when youre lying in my arms baby
you dont ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
or faster than my fastest cars

prechorus
i shouldnt have done it but i read it in your letter
you said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
i wanted to reach out but i never said a thing
i shouldnt have done it but i read it in your letter
you said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
i wanted to call you but i didnt say a thing
two three four

chorus
oh ill pick you up
if you come back to america just hit me up
cause this is crazy love ill catch you on the flip side
if you come back to california you should just hit me up
well do whatever you want travel wherever how far
well hit up all the old places
well have a party well dance til dawn
ill pick up all of your vogues and all of your rolling stones
your favorite liquor off the top shelf
ill throw a party all night long
