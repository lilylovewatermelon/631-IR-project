verse 1
well the cops didnt fine em for grindin no
they kinda blew the vibe figured it was time to go
plus he had to be at home a long time ago
and he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
it read a lil hungry and need a lil money
its for my lil sister and her lil tummy
wasnt lyin though—he didnt go buy hydro
went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
cause he knew they wasnt cookin where he live
the kunk kakunk kakunks now took him to the crib
a lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
right past the pushers who couldnt underdig
whats the use of pushin you aint pushin none of this
if i kick it with yall im just pushin for a bid
but what was on his mind and pushed him to the lid
they best customer wasnt cookin for her kids

you see his mom was a crackhead
and his father couldnt be contacted

amongst the other things on his young black head
and see his girl was a white girl
but just cause she was white see her life wasnt lightworld
she too had the drama thick

daddy caught something chasin fatties made her mama sick
couldnt afford the medicine pimped her to the pharmacist

her cell phone bill and a honda kit uhhuh
and thats why she skates with he
someone to feel her pain and a place to be

verse 3
a traveling band of misfits and outcasts outcasts
nod they heads from misfits to outkast outkast
a lot of scars they did this without pads
a lot of hearts who did this without dads
ones father was filthy rich
two was middleclass and one was homeless ugh
add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair who just liked to watch
and that was the whole clique
i think about em every time i see this old flick
that was taken in the park in front of this old bench
they wrote on the back you thank for push kick
hope you make a video the beat is so sick
well i did—i hope you seen it
its on mtv soundtrakks a genius
love from tony hawk beef from the ice creamaz
