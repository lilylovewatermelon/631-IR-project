this is the first day of my life
swear i was born right in the doorway
i went out in the rain suddenly everything changed
theyre spreading blankets on the beach
yours is the first face that i saw
i think i was blind before i met you
now i dont know where i am i dont know where ive been
but i know where i want to go

chorus
and so i thought id let you know
yeah these things take forever i especially am slow
but i realize that i need you
and i wondered if i could come home
mhm mhm

verse 2
remember the time you drove all night
just to meet me in the morning
and i thought it was strange you said everything changed
you felt as if youd just woke up
and you said this is the first day of my life
im glad i didnt die before i met you
but now i dont care i could go anywhere with you
and id probably be happy
you might also likechorus
so if you wanna be with me
with these things theres no telling we just have to wait and see
but id rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery
aha mhm
besides maybe this time its different
i mean i really think you like me33embed"
