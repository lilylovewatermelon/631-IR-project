ive got a way of making everything a confrontation
and youve got a way of bringing out the worst in me
you see its just if im bored
ill find a way to make an accusation
ive got a problem with more
so give me give me everything

break
stop

chorus
not my fault not at all
i cant help you what you want
get in line take a number
get you when my song is over
if you leave it up to me ill make a lie out of truth its true
and then ill break it up make it bleed
tell you that its you not me
make a scene at a show just because the wind blows
shoot myself in the foot to make a point i cant prove
to get it back to you
thats just my signature move

verse 2
