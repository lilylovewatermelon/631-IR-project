verse 1
who knows how long ive been awake now
the shadows on my wall dont sleep
they keep calling me
beckoning beckoning
who knows whats right the lines keep getting thinner
my age has never made me wise
but i keep pushing
on and on
and on and on

verse 2
below my soul i feel an engine
collapsing as it sees the pain
if i could only shut it out
shut it out shut it out shut it out
ive come too far to see the end now
even if my way is wrong
and i keep pushing
on and on and on and on
