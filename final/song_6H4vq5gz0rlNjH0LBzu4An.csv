do you know where your heart is
do you think you can find it
or did you trade it for something
somewhere better just to have it
do you know where your love is
do you think that you lost it
you felt it so strong but nothings turned out how you wanted

prechorus
well bless my soul
youre a lonely soul
cause you wont let go of anything you hold

chorus
well all i need
is the air i breathe
and a place to rest my head

verse 2
do you know what your fate is
and are you trying to shake it
youre doing your best dance your best look
youre praying that youll make it

well bless my soul
