excuse me maam i saw you walking
i turned around im not a stalker
where you going maybe i can help you
my tank is full id be obliged to take you

cause im a country boy i got a fourwheel drive
climb in my bed and ill take you for a ride
up city streets down country roads
i can get you where you need to go
cause im a country boy

verse 2
you sure look good sitting in my right seat
buckle up and ill take you through the five speeds
wind it up or i can slow it way down
in the woods or right up town

climb in my bed and ill take you for a ride
up city streets down country roads
yeah i can get you where you need to go

crank the music and the tone gets real good
let me know when were getting close
you can slide on out or we can head on down the road

climb in my bed and ill take you for a ride
up city streets down country roads
yeah i can get you where you want to go
cause im a country boy

bridge
bucket seats soft as babies nude butt
locking hubs to take you through a deep rut

chorus
cause im a country boy i got a fourwheel drive
climb in my bed and ill take you for a ride
up city streets down winding roads
yeah i can get you where you need to go
cause im a country boy

climb in my bed and ill take you for a ride
up city streets down country roads
i can get you where you want to go
