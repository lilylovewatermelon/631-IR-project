a welcome to my friends
this house is a home and a homes where i belong
where the feelings are warm and the foundations are strong
if my soul has a shape well then it is an ellipse
and this slap is a gift

prechorus
cause your cheeks have lost their luster
you know your cheeks have lost their luster
you know your cheeks have lost their luster
you know your cheeks have lost their luster luster luster luster
take it back

chorus
send return out of time
tape machine needs to be aligned

verse 2
aloha means goodbye and also hello its in how you inflect
put the bark in the dog and youve got a guardian
when the capitals s it is followed by a t and its probably me

prechorus
and the tones are grouped in clusters
you know the tones are grouped in clusters
well the tones are grouped in clusters
you know the tones are grouped in clusters clusters clusters clusters
take it back
