one two buckle my show
mmm yeah

verse 1
i stood by the exit door of the hotel café
he was playin with his band
ive always been a sucker
had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
his words were like heaven in my hurricane
my knees buckled under
i thought everyone was watching me
watching you save my life with the song

prechorus
you were mine
in the back of my mind
oh just for one night
just for a while

chorus
theres always one that gets away
the one that sneaks up on you then slips away

verse 2
said two weeks later i was sitting in his apartment
he was making cappuccino
i said what kind of man makes cappuccino
we laughed we laughed we laughed
we laughed til tears ran down my face
oh but my man youre someone elses man
and that aint the man that i wanna want
but you keep drawin me in with those big brown lyin eyes
