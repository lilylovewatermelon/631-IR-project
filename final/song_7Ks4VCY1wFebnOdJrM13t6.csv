who will deny that you and i and every nigga is a star
intro josef leimberg
hit me
when the four corners of this cocoon collide
youll slip through the cracks hopin that youll survive
gather your wit take a deep look inside
are you really who they idolize
to pimp a butterfly

chorus kendrick lamar
at first i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late nights thinkin of you
until i get my nut
tossed and turned lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned all across the board
destroyed but what for
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likeverse 1 kendrick lamar
when i get signed homie ima act a fool
hit the dance floor strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blueeyed devil with a fatass monkey
ima buy a brand new caddy on vogues
trunk the hood up two times deucefour
platinum on everythin platinum on weddin ring
married to the game and a bad bitch chose
when i get signed homie ima buy a strap
straight from the cia set it on my lap
take a few m16s to the hood
pass em all out on the block whats good
ima put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican run up get socked out
hit the press with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated but i got a milliondollar check like that
refrain thundercat  george clinton
we should never gave
we should never gave niggas money
go back home money go back home
we should never gave
we should never gave niggas money
go back home money go back home
everybody get out
chorus kendrick lamar thundercat  george clinton

break dr dre
yo whats up its dre
remember the first time you came out to the house
you said you wanted a spot like mine
but remember anybody can get it
the hard part is keepin it motherfucker
verse 2 kendrick lamar
what you want you a house or a car
forty acres and a mule a piano a guitar
anythin see my name is uncle sam im your dog
motherfucker you can live at the mall
i know your kind thats why im kind
dont have receipts oh man thats fine
pay me later wear those gators
cliché then say fuck your haters
i can see the baller in you i can see the dollar in you
little white lies but its no whitecollar in you
but its whatever though because im still followin you
because you make me live forever baby
count it all together baby
then hit the register and make me feel better baby
your horoscope is a gemini two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes two chains two cnotes
too much aint enough both we know
christmas tell em whats on your wish list
get it all you deserve it kendrick
and when you hit the white house do you
but remember you aint pass economics in school
and everything you buy taxes will deny
ill wesley snipe your ass before thirtyfive
bridge george clinton  kendrick lamar
yeah lookin down its quite a drop its quite a drop drop drop
lookin good when youre on top we’re on top together
you got a medal for us
leavin metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
look both ways before you cross my mind

refrain thundercat  george clinton
we should never gave
we should never gave niggas money
go back home money go back home
we should never gave
we should never gave niggas money
go back home money go back home
