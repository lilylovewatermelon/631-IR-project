telling me to go
but hands beg me to stay
your lips say that you love
your eyes say that you hate

prechorus chester bennington
theres truth in your lies doubt in your faith
what you build you lay to waste
theres truth in your lies doubt in your faith
all ive gots what you didnt take

chorus chester bennington
so i i wont be the one
be the one to leave this in pieces
and you you will be alone
alone with all your secrets and regrets dont lie

verse 2 chester bennington
you promise me the sky
then toss me like a stone
you wrap me in your arms
then chill me to the bone

prechorus chester bennington
theres truth in your lies doubt in your faith
all ive gots what you didnt take
