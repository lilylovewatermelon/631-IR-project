you get up in the morning and you get right to it
you bring home the bacon and you make a little bread
you get a little sleepy and you go back to bed
life dont have to mean nothin at all

if everybody says youre a little to tall
go out and get yourself a basketball
dye your hair orange and put a ring in your ear
you can make 47 million dollars a year
life dont have to mean nothin at all

if everybody says youre a little to short
go out and get yourself a big ol horse
you can be a jockey if you got no fear
you can make 47 million dollars a year
life dont have to mean nothin at all

life dont have to mean nothin at all
be good to your sister and good to your brother
good to your poppa and good to your mother
life dont have to mean nothin at all

now if youre a con man lookin for a pigeon
go out and start a brand new religion
get on tv and make a money request
they can all go to heaven while theyre starvin to death
life dont have to mean nothin at all
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likenow if everybody says youre a little too rough
go out and get yourself some boxing gloves
beat somebody up around the ears
you can make 47 million dollars a year
life dont have to mean nothin at all

life dont have to mean nothin at all
be good to your sister and good to your brother
you might even try to be good to one another
life dont have to mean nothin at all

now if everybody says youre a little to slick
get yourself into politics
get that office and get that power
and you can spend 47 million dollars an hour
life dont have to mean nothin at all

now if you can pick a guitar and sing through your nose
get yourself a bunch of cowboy clothes
sing about dying and shedding them tears
you can lose 47 million dollars a year
life dont have to mean nothin at all

life dont have to mean nothin at all
dont trouble your mind and worry your soul
bout stuff you aint supposed to know
life dont have to mean nothin at all
no life dont have to mean nothin at allembed"
