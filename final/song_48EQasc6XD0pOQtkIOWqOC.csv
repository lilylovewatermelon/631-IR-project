‘cause visitation no longer comes by comes by
seems like they forgot about me bout me
commissary is getting empty empty
my cell mates getting food without me without me
cant wait to get out
and move forward with my life ooh no with my life
got a family that loves me
and wants me to do right
but instead im here locked up
