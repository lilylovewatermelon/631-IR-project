salt of the earth my friend
its all that we are in the end
well you trapped down all the lines you drew
and i can take the hit but im sorry i dont want the bruise
your voice gets a little loud
when theres nothing to talk about you shout dear

prechorus
and ill find my lights fading out
more and more by the hour
it gets dark in here

chorus
if you got time enough for me
sing me a song and send me to sleep
slip into my headspace while i dream
spin me a yarn wrap it up around me

verse 2
dust to dust my friend
well youre only blood and bones
and i know your hearts at war with your head
i am sure it hurt to see
youre more than ill ever have
and more than ill ever be
i know its a little late
my timing was never great
but im calling dear
you might also likeprechorus
i just wanted to let you know
that i wont bother you anymore
ill be gone this time next year

chorus
if you got time enough for me
sing me a song and send me to sleep
slip into my headspace while i dream
spin me a yarn wrap it up around me
if you got time enough for me
sing me a song and send me to sleep
i never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
until you opened your mouth
and you said you loved me10embed"
