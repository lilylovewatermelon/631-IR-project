the situations are irrelevant now
she loves the way that i tease i love the way that she breathes

verse 1
i touched her ooh she touched my ahhh it was the craziest thing
i love the girls who hate to love because theyre just like me
a certain girl she took my hand and ran it up her thigh
she licked her lips and pulled my hair i fall in love for a night

prechorus
she cant behave and im just a slave
don’t worry ill be gone when the morning comes

chorus
darling what is going on
honestly that never happened lying is your favorite passion
leave me go where you belong
higher heels and lipstick napkins dying is your latest fashion

verse 2
the frustration its a regular thing
i hate the ones who love to hate because theyre just like me
a certain girl she took her hand and put it in my lap
its way too— fuck she said once you have me youll always come back
