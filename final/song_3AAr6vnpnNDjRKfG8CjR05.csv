you aint worth my pain
you aint worth the pride that comes along with my last name
you aint worth my wages
you aint worth my wine
its taken me so long to find you aint worth my time
you aint worth my time

and i always thought the words in your bedroom talk were true
come to find it was all a lie of no substance to you
dont come back this way some sunny day i wont be your man
cause you you aint worth a damn

you aint worth no sleepless nights when you left me here to stay
you aint worth my buddys time tellin me itll be okay
you aint worth this heartache hun you aint worth the this  at all
if thats what you call love then honey he can have it all
i said he can have it all

and i always thought the words in your bedroom talk were true
come to find it was all a lie of no substance to you
dont come back this way some sunny day i wont be your man
cause you you aint worth a damn
aint worth a damn

and i always thought the words in your bedroom talk were true
come to find it was all a lie of no substance to you
dont come back this way some sunny day i wont be your man
cause you you aint worth a damn
aint worth a damnyou might also likeembed"
