the promise of love
it came from my heart
thought all that we shared
would last forever
so where did things go wrong
what happened that made things fall apart
why i just dont know
its so hard to let go of someone i used to call my own

chorus
but ill find a way
ill get over you one day oh
ill find a way
im gonna deal with all this pain
ill ill find a way
cause i know that somewhere
my soulmate is waiting for me
gonna make it through the day ooh
ill find a way

verse 2
silence gets so intense
without you to share a word
i really miss your presence
this loneliness feels awkward
but i wont call you i refuse
id rather lay here by myself in the dark
cryin my heart out
wish these tears could erase
all the memories of you but they cant

ill get over you one day oh
ill find a way
im gonna deal with all this pain yeah
ill find a way
cause i know that somewhere

bridge
cause what hurts today
in time will fade away
when you told me goodbye oh oh
i felt so betrayed
find the courage
to move on
cause one day ill replace
the precious love i lost yeah yeah
