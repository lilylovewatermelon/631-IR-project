verse 1 2d
up on melancholy hill theres a plastic tree
are you here with me
just looking out on the day of another dream
where you cant get what you want but you can get me
so lets set out to sea love
cause you are my medicine when youre close to me
when youre close to me

verse 2 2d
so call in the submarines round the world well go
does anybody know her
if were looking out on the day of another dream
if you cant get what you want then you come with me
up on melancholy hill
sits the manatee love
just looking out for the day when youre close to me
when youre close to me
when youre close to me
