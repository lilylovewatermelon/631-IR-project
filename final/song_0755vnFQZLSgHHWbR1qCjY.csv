chorus
and rock right up to the side of my mountain
climb until you reach my peak baby peak baby peak
and reach right into the bottom of my fountain
i wanna play in your deep baby deep baby deep
then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
hold me til i scream for air to breathe
and wash me over until my well runs dry
send all your sins all over me baby me baby me

i gotta make a confession
im proud of all this bass

you and i create rockets and waterfalls

chorus

climb until you reach my peak baby peak baby peak
and reach right into the bottom of my fountain
i wanna play in your deep baby deep baby deep
then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
hold me til i scream for air to breathe
and wash me over until my well runs dry
send all your sins all over me baby me baby me
