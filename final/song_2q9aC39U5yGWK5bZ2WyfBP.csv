oh amber look at this motley crew
oh this town sure has gone downhill since crowned miss

amber spoken
oh mother not more ancient history
velma
oh my god how times have changed
these girls must be blind or completely deranged
but time seemed to halt
when i was miss baltimore
crabs

amber
that move is far too dirty

amber
mother wake up from that dream of yours this isnt 1930

velma
you can laugh but lifes a test
dont do this dont do that
remember
mother knows best
for the crowns in the vault
from when i won miss baltimore
crabs

amber
these steps are perfect ammunition

velma
let me show you how your mommy dear took out the competition
girls go get em
boys lets rumba
one two three four five six seven
you might also likethose poor runnerups might still hold some grudges
they padded their cups but i screwed the judges
those broads thought theyd win
if a plate they would spin in their dance
ha not a chance

spoken
boys put me down
oh good morning ladies
lets see what you got

council members
twist twist twist twist
mashed potato mambo

velma
ready
begin

on my show youll never find
a thrusting hip or bumping grind

amber
whats that
a dance for fleas and ticks
velma
oh you should have seen my bag of tricks

oh i hit the stage batons ablaze
while belting aida and preparing souffles
but that triple somersault
is how i clinched miss baltimore
crabs

instrumental break

velma
proceed

tammy
are you scared were on live

tracy
no im sure i can cope

amber

council members
cinemascope

velma
i never drank one chocolate malt
no desserts for miss baltimore
crabs

amber
this one will never get a date in those handmedown clothes

velma
ha kid shell never get a date til daddy buys her a new nose

i would say oy gevalt
if i wasnt miss baltimore crabs

amber
do you dance like you dress

link
amber theres no need to be cruel

velma
would you swim in an integrated pool
tracy
i sure would im all for integration its the new frontier

velma
not in baltimore it isnt
and may i be frank

first impressions can be tough and when i saw you i knew it
if your size werent enough your last answer just blew it
and so my dear so short and stout
youll never be in so were kicking you out
with your form and your face oh but it isnt your fault
youre just down with a case of miss
baltimore crabs

eh you may go

tracy
um thank you

penny
