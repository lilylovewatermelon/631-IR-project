after that the woman said “pick up my pocketbook boy and give it here”

she still held him but	she bent down enough to permit him to stoop and pick up her purse
then she said “now ain’t you ashamed of yourself”

firmly gripped by his shirt front the boy said “yes’m”

the woman said “what did you want to do it for”

the boy said “i didn’t aim to”

she said “you a lie”
by that time two or three people passed stopped turned to look and some stood watching
“if i turn you loose will you run” asked the woman

“yes’m” said the boy

“then i won’t turn you loose” said the woman she did not release him
“i’m very sorry lady i’m sorry” whispered the boy
“umhum and your face is dirty i got a great mind to wash your face for you ain’t you got nobody home to tell you to wash your face”

“no’m” said the boy

“then it will get washed this evening” said the large woman starting up the street dragging the	frightened boy behind her he looked as if he were fourteen or fifteen frail and willowwild in tennis shoes and blue jeans
the woman said “you ought to be my son i would teach you right from wrong least i can do right now is to wash your face are you hungry”

“no’m” said the being dragged boy “i just want you to turn me loose”
“was i bothering you when i turned that corner” asked the woman

“no’m”

“but you put yourself in contact with me” said the woman “if you think that that contact is not going to last awhile you got another thought coming when i get through with you sir you are going to remember mrs luella bates washington jones”
sweat popped out on the boy’s face and he began to struggle mrs jones stopped jerked him around in front of her put a halfnelson about his neck and continued to drag him up the street when she got to her door she dragged the boy inside down a hall and into a large kitchenette furnished room at the rear of the house she switched on the light and left the door open the boy could hear other roomers laughing and talking in the large house some of their doors were open too so he knew he and the woman were not alone the woman still had him by the neck in the middle of her room she said “what is your name”

“roger” answered the boy

“then roger you go to that sink and wash your face” said the woman whereupon she turned him looseat last roger looked at the doorlooked at the womanlooked at the doorand went to the sink

“let the water run until it gets warm” she said “here’s a clean towel”

“you gonna take me to jail” asked the boy bending over the sink
“not with that face i would not take you nowhere” said the woman “here i am trying to get home to cook me a bite to eat and you snatch my pocketbook maybe you ain’t been to your supper either late as it be have you”

“there’s nobody home at my house” said the boy

“then we’ll eat” said the woman “i believe you’re hungryor been hungryto try to snatch my	pockekbook”

“i wanted a pair of blue suede shoes” said the boy

“well you didn’t have to snatch my pocketbook to get some suede shoes” said mrs luella bates washington jones “you could of asked me”

“m’am”

the water dripping from his face the boy looked at her there was a long pause a very long pause after he had dried his face and not knowing what else to do dried it again the boy turned around wondering what next the door was open he could make a dash for it down the hall he could run run run run run

the woman was sitting on the daybed after a while she said “i were young once and i wanted things i could not get” there was another long pause the boy’s mouth opened then he frowned but not knowing he frowned

the woman said “umhum you thought i was going to say but didn’t you you thought i was going to say but i didn’t snatch people’s pocketbooks well i wasn’t going to say that”

pause silence

“i have done things too which i would not tell you sonneither tell god if he didn’t already know so you set down while i fix us something to eat 055 you might run that comb through your hair so you will look presentable”

in another corner of the room behind a screen was a gas plate and an icebox mrs jones got up and went behind the screen the woman did not watch the boy to see if he was going to run now nor did she watch her purse which she left behind her on the daybed but the boy took care to sit on the far side of the room where he thought she could easily see him out of the corner of her eye if she wanted to he did not trust the woman not to trust him and he did not want to be mistrusted now

“do you need somebody to go to the store” asked the boy “maybe to get some milk or something”
“don’t believe i do” said the woman “unless you just want sweet milk yourself i was going to make cocoa out of this canned milk i got here”

“that will be fine” said the boy

she heated some lima beans and ham she had in the icebox made the cocoa and set the table the woman did not ask the boy anything about where he lived or his folks or anything else that would embarrass him instead as they ate she told him about her job in a hotel beautyshop that stayed open late what the work was like and how all kinds of women came in and out blondes redheads and spanish

then she cut him a half of her tencent cake

“eat some more son” she said

when they were finished eating she got up and said “now here take this ten dollars and buy yourself some blue suede shoes and next time do not make the mistake of latching onto my pocketbook nor nobody else’sbecause shoes come by devilish like that will burn your feet i got to get my rest now but i wish you would behave yourself son from here on in”

she led him down the hall to the front door and opened it

“goodnight behave yourself boy” she said looking out into the street the boy wanted to say something else other than “thank you m’am” to mrs luella bates washington jones but he couldn’t do so as he turned at the barren stoop and looked back at the large woman in the door he barely managed to say “thank you” before she shut the door and he never saw her again2embed"
