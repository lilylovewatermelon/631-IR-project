mwahahaha
dracula was the name
and the boogie man is my father

chorus
i got a monster in my closet
someones underneath my bed
the winds knockin at my window
id kill it but its already dead

verse 1
it waits til the midnight hour to come
to torture me for the wrong ive done
it just sits there and stares at me
and it wont let me get any sleep just let me sleep

chorus
i got a monster in my closet
someones underneath my bed
the winds knockin at my window
id kill it but its already dead

verse 2
at first i was scared when i looked at his eyes
but now that i know him im not that surprised
im just waiting on the sun to rise
oh how i wish that old sun would rise

i got a monster in my closet
someones underneath my bed
the winds knockin at my window
id kill it but its already dead

verse 3
i used to wonder why he looked familiar
then i realized it was a mirror
oh and now it is plain to see
the whole time the monster was me

chorus
oh theres a monster in my closet
someones underneath my bed
the winds knockin at my window
id kill it but its already dead

outro
im the living dead
only thing thatll bring me back alive woman
is some good good head
