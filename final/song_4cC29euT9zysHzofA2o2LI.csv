i’m not capable of love
there’s something broken inside of me
it doesn’t matter how hard i try
i can’t forget about all the times i cried myself to sleep

bridge
i’m far away from better days but memories keep bringing me back here
the past is my enemy

chorus
take a look at what it did to me
try my best to hold it in
gone on that reposado
sorrow is my only friend
i don’t wanna see tomorrow
so much regret stuck in my head and i’m left with a hole that i can’t fill
just like this empty bottle
my heart is hollow

verse 2
i try to ease thе pain with this weed smoke
the only thing that helps whеn i need hope
things look strange through a peephole
life’s not a game with a cheat code
man in the mirror right in front of me
all alone but i’m still in bad company
running from something for so long i can’t even stomach the thought of trusting is crushing i just wish someone would love me

i’m far away from better days but memories keep bringing me back here
the past is my enemy

chorus
take a look at what it did to me
try my best to hold it in
gone on that reposado
sorrow is my only friend
i don’t wanna see tomorrow
so much regret stuck in my head and i’m left with a hole that i can’t fill
just like this empty bottle
my heart is hollow

verse 3
what’s wrong with me
is it something i can’t see
i pray one day i’ll get back on my feet
i can’t open up
i’m swore to secrecy
in the end i found just what i need
and look at what it did to me

chorus
try my best to hold it in
gone on that reposado
sorrow is my only friend
i don’t wanna see tomorrow
so much regret stuck in my head and i’m left with a hole that i can’t fill
just like this empty bottle
my heart is hollowembed"
