maybe youve been pouring everything into this from a state of bliss
it turns to agony
you cant predict this
when it comes to it
you cant hide from me
but dont you surrender anything

prechorus
dont you know that
that patience is a virtue
and life is a waiting game
dont you know that
peace must be nurtured
and all the money in the world can buy you nothing

chorus
all these things happen
all these things happen for a reason
dont you go and throw it all away
get yours when the seasons change

verse 2
hurts me to see you feel this way but it wont be always
dont you know everything got to change
feel like all your hope is gone
you cant carry on
but theres nothing wrong
you dont have to pretend with me

that patience is a virtue
and life is a waiting game

peace must be nurtured
and all the money in the world can buy you nothing

all these things happen
all these things happen for a reason
dont you go and throw it all away
