things are gonna get better in the byandby
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world

work through the winter work through the spring
yeah plant my corn and taters and then it wouldnt rain
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world

now i got down on my knees
lord i thought id pray
along come a great big flood
washed everything away
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world

work through the winter lord work through this fall
all i got for christmas was a pair of overalls
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world

well i got down on my knees
looked up to the sky
all i can think of is to ask the good lord why
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world
see old crow medicine show liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likewell hush up honey lord dont get down
you know that i love you every way around
and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this world

and there aint a thing for a poor man
in this worldembed"
