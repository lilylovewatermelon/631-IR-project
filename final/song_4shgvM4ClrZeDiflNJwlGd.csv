hey ive got a mouth full of cavities
sweet tooth full of mama like sugar to me
so my love with the lips put a bug in the ear tone
shawty gotta kiss its an emergency
spit sprung for the taste addicted to her gloss
wont smile this way baby i rub it off
put my tongue in your face
a little mistletoe sippin gran marnier
im a fan all day
do me that favor cause i like your flavor
my manage behavior im into your major
