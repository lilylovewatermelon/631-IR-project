hey you hey you devils little sister
listening to your twisted transistor
hold it between your legs
turn it up turn it up
low end is coming through
cant get enough

prechorus
a lonely life where no one understands you
but dont give up because the music do
music do music do
music do music do
music do music do

chorus
because the music do
and then its reaching inside you
forever preaching fuck you too
your screams a whisper
hang on you twisted transistor

verse 2
hey you hey you finally you get it
the world aint fair eat you if you let it
and as your tears fall on
your breasts your dress
vibrations coming through
youre in a mess
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeprechorus
a lonely life where no one understands you
but dont give up because the music do
music do music do
music do music do
music do music do

chorus
because the music do
and then its reaching inside you
forever preaching fuck you too
your screams a whisper
hang on you twisted transistor

interlude
music do music do
music do music do
music do music do
music do music do

bridge
hey you hey you this wont hurt a bit
this wont hurt a bit this wont hurt
says who says who anesthetize this bitch

just let me be between you and me

and then its reaching inside you
forever preaching fuck you too
your screams a whisper
hang on you twisted transistor9embed"
