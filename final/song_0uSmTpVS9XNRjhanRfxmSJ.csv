running from the morning
think i hit a wall
late nights not you
running from the moment
so i dont recall
late nights not you
waking up in a cold sweat
someone else in this cold bed
id do anything to not be alone
all alone with the ceiling
all alone with this feeling
and i wonder if ill ever let go

prechorus
i tried spending my nights under someone new
but the truth is
i could spend my whole life getting over you

chorus
yeah yeah
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you

drowning in my coffee
to wash the alcohol
out my bloodstream
sitting here i wonder
if we hadnt been at all
who would i be
waking up in a cold sweat
someone else in this cold bed
and i wonder if ill ever let go oh oh

prechorus
i tried spending my nights under someone new
but the truth is
i could spend my whole life getting over you

chorus
yeah yeah
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
getting over you
