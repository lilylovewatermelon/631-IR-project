in my heart sent
my confession my condolence
youre indefinite
youre incompetent inconsiderate
youre so childish
i will push you
out of what is real out of my head
you can stick and drown
at your residence of disappointments
are of yours to come
so embrace them
oh my shallow one today

chorus
if i could change anything
then i would change everything
these bitter days shall remain

verse 2
i dont ask for your forgiveness
i dont care much for your actress
thats just you though
shallow and selfish
so i go now
oh my hollow one today
you might also likechorus
if i could change anything
then i would change everything
these bitter days shall remain

verse 3
you carry your blues behind your eyes
dont flatter yourself i will survive
so carry your blues your own denial
your feathers are gone youll never fly

chorus
if i could change anything
then i would wipe the years away
if i could change anything
then i would brush the time away
if i could change anything
then i would change everything
these bitter days shall remain

outro
since youre gone im much better than you
you carry your blues behind your eyes
dont flatter yourself i will survive
so carry your blues your own denial
your feathers are gone youll never fly
shell never flyembed"
