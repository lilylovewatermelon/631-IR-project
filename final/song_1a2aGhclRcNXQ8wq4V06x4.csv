verse 1
today is the first day of the rest of our lives
tomorrow is too late to pretend everythings alright now
im not gettin any younger as long as you dont get any older
im not gonna say that yesterday never was

prechorus
bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
makin your mascara bleed
tears down your face leavin traces of my mistakes

chorus
if i promise go to church on sunday
will you go with me on friday night
if you live with me ill die for you and this compromise

verse 2
i hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
and nothin but that truth is what ill ever hear from you now
trust is a dirty word that comes from such a liar
but respect is something i will learn if you have faith
