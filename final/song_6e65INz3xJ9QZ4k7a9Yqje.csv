verse 1 crim
blunt fulla indo starin out my window
its the pillpoppin junkie young sex symbol
ashes on the cross all my bitches lost
depressed motherfuckers never show no love
got a blunt fulla tiva grippin on the nina
run up and ill show ya why im always tweakin
sleepin through the weekend uicidal seasons
i just wanna die dont have no fuckin reason
blunt fulla codeine they know that im a dope fiend
grab the knife and cut me twice and let me die slowly
creepin out the basement inside my heart vacant
slice me wide open because im too fuckin impatient
to wait for death silhouettes of demons in my shadows
hang me in the gallows brain filled with ammo

verse 2 oddy nuff da now leopard
i just want to chill fuck makin a mill
i mean i make enough money to pay the bills
still working in the pizza kitchen itchin to be free of this shit
i know lick was cleanin dishes wishin everythin was fingerlickin
but the truth is i make this fucking music
and i cant even get my friends to listen to it
i wanna say screw it but i know improvement will prove it fuck it
its evident they need the evidence
thinkin im heaven sent but really im crawling outta hell
uicide for life g59 count the spells
and just think im only beginnin to crawl out of my shell
weed and bullets on the coffee table
im the son of the snake im both cain and abel
smoke and death is the smell that dwells around my humble abode
this is just a story no fable no moral code
it ends with me rich sad and alone

verse 3 supa sortahuman
uicidal tendencies we are not the same
tryna make the best of every day bad thoughts go away
thats why i blaze up some indo and sip some alizé
grind nonstop i gotta stay paid
keep it chill with my bae smoke good getting laid
the lane that i made is where supa finna stay
the game that we play we still play it till this day
half these cat’s lames theyre just one pill away
keep them fools far away then everything will be okay
take a shot to the head like a ak might spray
repeat repeat
we do this every day
my mind is everywhere but mostly up in outer space
bong rips to my face sipping on a half a case
take some shrooms to escape supamane with no cape
