no words appear before me in the aftermath
salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
every single thing i touch becomes sick with sadness
cause its all over now all out to sea

chorus
goodbye goodbye goodbye
you were bigger than the whole sky
you were more than just a short time
and ive got a lot to pine about
ive got a lot to live without
im never gonna meet
what couldve been wouldve been
what shouldve been you
what couldve been wouldve been you

verse 2
did some bird flap its wings ovеr in asia
did some force take you bеcause i didnt pray
every single thing to come has turned into ashes
cause its all over its not meant to be
so ill say words i dont believe

chorus
goodbye goodbye goodbye
you were bigger than the whole sky
you were more than just a short time
and ive got a lot to pine about
ive got a lot to live without
im never gonna meet
what couldve been wouldve been
what shouldve been you
