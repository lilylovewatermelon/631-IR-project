waitin on a sunday afternoon
for what ive read between the lines
your lies
feelin like a hand in rusted shame
so do you laugh or does it cry
reply

chorus
leavin on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what i seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things you said to me

verse 2
breathin is the hardest thing to do
with all ive said and all thats dead for you
you lied goodbye

chorus
leavin on a southern train
only yesterday you lied
promises of what i seemed to be
only watched the time go by
all of these things i said to youyou might also like21embed"
