what makes you think that you have won
when the battle has only just begun
let the punishment fit the crime
bad things come to those in all good time

verse 2
my mistake was to put you first
deceitful bubble was so soon to burst
i asked you  believe in just us
now my faith lie in mine own justice

chorus
how many times must i say im not sorry
and how many ways can i show i dont care

verse 3
rotting bodies of enemies
cannot smell sweet enough to me
what is the price of a friend
who would carry out revenge

in this bleak world of absent laws
one in which the just are whores
an honor to die for the truth
eye for an eye tooth for tooth

how many times must i say im not sorry
and how many ways can i show i dont careembed"
