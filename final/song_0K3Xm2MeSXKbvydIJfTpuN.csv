its so cold in this house
open mouth swallowing us
the children sent home from school
will not stop crying
and i know that youre busy do i know that you care
you got your finger on the pulse you got your eyes everywhere
and it hurts all the time when you dont return my calls
and you havent got the time to remember how it was
its so cold in this house
its so cold in this house

verse 2
i cant eat i cant sleep
i cant sleep i cant dream
an aversion to light
got a fear of the ocean

chorus
like drinking poison like eating glass
like drinking poison like eating glass
like drinking poison like eating glass
like drinking poison like eating

verse 3
its so cold in this house
its so cold in this house
its so cold in this house
its so cold in this bed

outro
we got crosses on our eyes
been walking into the walls again
we got crosses on our eyes
been walking into the furniture
we got crosses on our eyes
for richer for poorer for better for worse
we got crosses on our eyes
weve been walking into the furniture11embed"
