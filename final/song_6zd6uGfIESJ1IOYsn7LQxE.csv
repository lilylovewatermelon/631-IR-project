but you can make it up next time
i know she knows its not right
there aint no use in lying
maybe she thinks i know something
maybe maybe she thinks its fine
but maybe she knows something i dont
im so im so tired im so tired of trying
it seems to me that maybe
it pretty much always means no
so dont tell me
you might just let it go
and often times were lazy
it seems to stand in my way
cause no one no not no one
likes to be let down
i know she loves the sunrise
no longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
and i know that when she said shes gonna try
well it might not work because of other ties and
i know she usually has some other ties
and i wouldnt want to break em nah
i wouldnt want to break em
maybe shell help me to untie this but
until then well im gonna have to lie too
it seems to me that maybe
it pretty much always means no
so dont tell me
you might just let it go
and often times were lazy
it seems to stand in my way
cause no one no not no one
likes to be let down
it seems to me that maybe
it pretty much always means no
so dont tell me
you might just let it go
the harder that you try baby the further youll fall
even with all the money in the whole wide world
please please please dont pass me
please please please dont pass me
please please please dont pass me by
everything you know about me now baby you gonna have to change
you gonna call it by a brand new name
please please please dont drag me
please please please dont drag me
please please please dont drag me down
just like a tree down by the water baby i shall not move
even after all those silly things you do
please please please dont drag me
please please please dont drag me
please please please dont drag me downsee jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeembed"
