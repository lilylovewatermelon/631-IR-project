cut the music up please

verse 1 lil wayne
yeah i shall never leave hiphop
controlled by my two hands they go tick tock
around the clock yes it’s my time my throne
better know the time of day in any fuckin time zone
i’m feelin like i’m on top of the rhinestone
pullin the ladder from heaven about to climb home
mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
in this world of numbers i keep my nine on
and i don’t go to church because the lyin long
and the preacher he be gettin his shine on
but i know my lord — i am god’s own
back to my hands ticktick a time bomb

chorus jay sean
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
i’ll be here cause i won’t quit yeah
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 80you might also likeverse 2 lil wayne
tryna stay afloat on my inner tube
when they turned my city into a swimmin pool
before that it was a livin cesspool
we gotta get on our shit like gnats do
polices be on my tip like hats do
but i stay strong like blacks do
never saved by the bell in a black school
and i stay in trouble like zack do
and in this game nobody’s on my plateau
therefore my name remains like a tattoo
yes i take giant steps in shaq boots
birdman junior or — weezy f baby baby

chorus jay sean
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
i’ll be here cause i won’t quit yeah
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
bridge jay sean
that aint me
see i won’t stop that aint me
i wont quit that aint me
no i wont stop that aint me
cause that aint me

verse 3 lil wayne
alright alright alright alright
i’m in their conversations
the titles up for grabs i’m into confiscation
punch shot and stab now youre the doctors patient
wild like an arab from the islamic nation
i get money round the clock aint got no time for hatin
and these niggas aint shit like theyre constipated
i get the coupe with the kit watch me lobster red it
drop the top at the light thats when i be headed
so far ahead of them i feel outdated
but i feel electric like i’m rayden
used to play mortal kombat when i was a couch potato
and now i’m coming out the faders no homo

chorus jay sean
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
yeah don’t you know i’ll be i’ll be
i’ll be here cause i won’t quit yeah
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me
you can try lock me up
you can try to break me down
but i stay strong
it’s my own throne
cant stop now cause that aint me2embed"
