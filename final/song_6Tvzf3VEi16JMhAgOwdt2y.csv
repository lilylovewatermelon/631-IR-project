two hearts one valve
pumpin the blood we were the flood
we were the body and
two lives one life
stickin it out lettin you down
makin it right

prechorus
seasons they will change
life will make you grow
dreams will make you cry cry cry
everything is temporary
everything will slide
love will never die die die

chorus
i know that
ooh ooh ooh ooh
birds fly in different directions
ooh ooh ooh ooh
i hope to see you again
