i think i just fell in love with a pornstar
turn the camera on she a born star
turn the corners in a foreign car
call the coroners do the cpr
she gave that old nigga a ulcer
her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache uh
make her knees shake make a priest faint uh
make a nun cum make her cremate uh
move downtown cop a sweet space uh
livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
we headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
well ima levitate make the devil wait yeah
chorus
have you lost your mind
tell me when you think we crossed the line
no more drugs for me pussy and religion is all i need
grab my hand and baby well live a hell of a life

verse 2
never in your wildest dreams
never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
you could hear the loudest screams
comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
tell me what i gotta do to be that guy

or do anal or do a gangbang
