if my man was fightin some unholy war
i would be behind him
straight shook up beside him
with strength he didnt know
its you im fightin for
he cant lose with me in tow with me in tow
i refuse to let him go to let him go
at his side and drunk on pride
we wait for the blow

verse 2
we put it in writin
but who you writin for
just us on kitchen floor
justice done recitin
my stomach standin still
like you readin my will
he still stands in spite of what his scars say still stand
and ill battle til this bitter finale bitter finale
just me my dignity and this guitar case oh oh

verse 3
yes my man is fightin some unholy war
and i will stand beside you
and who you dyin for
b i would have died too
id like to
if my man was fightin some unholy war
if my man was fightin some unholy war
if my man was fightin some unholy waryou might also like1embed"
