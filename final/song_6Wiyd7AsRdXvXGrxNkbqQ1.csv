stupid in love
oh
stupid in love

verse 1
let me tell you something
never have i ever been a size ten in my whole life
i left the engine running
i just came to see what you would do if i
gave you a chance to make things right
so i made it even though katy told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
and she was right mmm
dont understand it blood on your hands
and still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
and i just dont know why oh

chorus
this is stupid im not stupid
dont talk to me like im stupid stupid in love
i still love you but i just cant do this
i may be dumb but im not stupid

verse 2
my new nickname is you idiot such an idiot
mmm thats what my friends are calling me when
they see me yelling into my phone
theyre telling me let go he is not the one
i thought i saw your potential
guess thats what made me dumb
he dont want it not like you want it
scheming and cheating oh girl why do you waste your time
you know he aint right
youre telling me this i dont wanna listen
but you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
and i just dont know why
