the cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
truth ignites our generation to change whats been programmed
inside the mind
dont you turn a blind eye
change whats been programmed inside
dont you turn a blind eye

chorus
listen to me when i tell you
feel the passion in my breath
stay on top if they let you
because the change is permanent
change is permanent

verse 2
rudiments of interpersonal communication
truth will uproot and bring wars devastation to light
dont you turn a blind eye
change whats been programmed inside
staying silent is a crime

chorus
listen to me when i tell you
feel the passion in my breath
stay on top if they let you
because the change is permanent
change is permanent

change starts in your mind
leave the past behind
forget everything you know
make a change let go

chorus
listen to me when i tell you
feel the passion in my breath
stay on top if they let you
because the change is permanent
listen to me when i tell you
feel the passion in my breath
stay on top if they let you
because the change is permanent
change is permanent

outro
leave the past behind
leave the past behind
make a change
let go
let go
let go
let go
let go
let go1embed"
