baby this that waterfall flow yeah uh
baby this that waterfall flow

verse 1
certain shit im not fascinated with i cant fake this shit
my legs made for a money run i cant chase a bitch
when the tab come we dont gotta split it bro im gon pay the shit
somewhere in toronto with a canadian
used to have no one to call on now i fill up stadiums
oh you cant be fucked with you aint turnt come get with babynem
you supposed to be with us but you switched up you gotta stay with them
i ran up a dub in just two months told you dont play with him
this shit gettin crazy
im workin double time this summer mine im not just sayin this
we did too much to just be gang i really treat him like family
im not a fraud i make a lot of noise thats why they cant stand me
you piss me off we goin to war and i aint got no understandin
waterfall flow cause i just keep flowin yeah
she told me she comin so i keep goin oh yeah
really tryna win you gotta sacrifice
bronem was gettin rich i felt i had to try it
i took a little piece and went and maximized it
i took my little fans i had and amplified em
this shit dont come free but you cant go and buy it
aint into the clout but i stay goin viral
you aint really down then you cant come around us
forever with the ones that ima do or die with
you might also likechorus
phantom doors came suicide used to have to catch a ride
i aint tryna go too deep maybe we can catch a vibe
maybe we can slide dependin on what your plans like
i might play it quiet but you know that im the man right
you gon have to pick a side come here let me pick your mind
you can tell me all your flaws ill get someone to fix your body
she love when i thug and like when i get romantic
she wanna be gang i got her doin our handshake

verse 2
i been doin all of this shit from the top of my head
if youre ready to cross the line then i aint gon stop you go ahead
but i just hope that youre prepared i been accepted life aint fair
we used to ship from here and there my mama done had to sign for mail
never let a ho play with my heart i went through that in jail
cant believe i gotta put that fire on bro we been through hell
you aint gangster i know damn well if they catch you you gon tell
i aint have no help i made everybody happy by myself
but i did have a plug and my fans though
know they want me to lay down but i got somethin to stand for
this shit in me it aint on me i cant never get canceled
i aint trippin about the price i gotta get what im payin for
its the principle

chorus
phantom doors came suicide used to have to catch a ride
i aint tryna go too deep maybe we can catch a vibe
maybe we can slide dependin on what your plans like
i might play it quiet but you know that im the man right
you gon have to pick a side come here let me pick your mind
you can tell me all your flaws ill get someone to fix your body
she love when i thug and like when i get romantic
she wanna be gang i got her doin our handshakeembed"
