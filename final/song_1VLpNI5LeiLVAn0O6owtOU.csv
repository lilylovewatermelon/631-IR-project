verse 1
you made up your mind
right before the sound can move softly from your lips
you leave behind
a choice which once before you thought you could not resist

prechorus
you give what you have when you
decide that you keep burning like fire
its burning you down

chorus
sometimes they say this should feel something like fire
til it burns you and you cant
no you cant remain the same
stay the same stay the same stay the same

postchorus
ii cant change

everything that was yours just does not exist

sorry for the things in life that you might have missed
you might also likeprechorus
you give what you have when you
decide that you keep burning like fire
its burning you down

chorus
sometimes they say this should feel something like fire
til it burns you and you cant

keep burning like fire like its all around
