across the floor in the hand of where we drove the drill
a cautious ear to the mouth of your confession
think of all the things we put him through
in the face of his god would he tell the truth
still recorded were the words that dribbled out his kiss
when eyes go blind in this man of what could once become
sever the limbs off his torso in sleep
and burn what remains so the world may now see
no longer will we wait for your answers
back to the hell where youve come from
think of all the times you once had
write them in a letter that says goodbye

chorus
youll listen to reason
while youre face down in the dirt
youll stomach the hurt and break for him here
just how much hes worth

verse 2
slowly discarded were the remains of his lonely youth
among the alley where the dwellers scare to notice
picture a young boy in pieces and streets with leveled
malfunctions no name to be called redeemer
well fix him restore him
with the love if no other
think of all the things you did before
write them in a letter that says reborn
you might also likechorus
youll listen to reason
while youre face down in the dirt
youll stomach the hurt and break for him here
just how much hes worth

following you across the interstate walking away
walking away ill fire on
following you across the interstate walking away
walking away ill fire on
following you across the interstate walking away
walking away ill fire on
on the wrong way out
on the causeway to neverwhere
on the wrong way out
on the causeway to neverwhere
on the wrong way out
on the causeway to neverwhere

dear my friends
in the time weve spent
forever after beyond this
when will our nightmare ever end end end
