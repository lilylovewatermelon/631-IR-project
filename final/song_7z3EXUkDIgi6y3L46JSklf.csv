who can this be this stranger at my door
although i know ive seen her once before
come on why cant i remember your name now
but in a way its best that i dont say

chorus
its a pleasure to meet ya
once again for the night
i cant promise my focus
is it me or is it my attention span

verse 2
i see the way you stare at me oh girl
i like the way you sway your hair and twirl
come on why cant i remember your name now
but in a way its best that i dont say

chorus

verse 3
is this more than just routine
weigh it down on me
give me more than just my needs
weigh it down on me
and were still riding high
and were still riding high
