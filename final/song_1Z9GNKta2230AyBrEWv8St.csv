we work all week just to get our pay
cause where theres music there could be romancing
were gonna dance the whole night away

you gotta take the time to relax your mind
switch off and leave your worries behind
for time it isnt on our side
we havent even got the time to play

yeah time
we need more time
yeah time
were gonna have a good time
trying to forget the working day

dont take it easy
dont take it slow oh no no no no
cant you feel the burning
cant you feel the glow ah yeah

life lifts you higher and higher
so just get on down to where the music flows

gotta take the time to relax your mind
leave your worries behind
for time it isnt on our side
switch off and let yourself unwind
