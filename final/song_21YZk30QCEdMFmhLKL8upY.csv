but im sayin
here i am say lying and praying
that im laying something hot
cause baby its cold outside
and even when its not it still is
baby shorties ask me what the deal is
not listening to they mom and them
cause they all know what they talkin bout like willis
i say what shorty desire be what real is
and when i first came to her
i was still wet behind the ears
so i was just a lame to her
i heard older cats lay claim to her
and say they spit game to her
but they never put a name to her
so i called her desire
like so many street cars that i did for
for her promises little brothers there bids for
and little sisters sacrifice they head for
even streetwise vets wind up dead for
see she will attempt to straight pimp you
youll scream fuck the world
but soon go limp too
she proclaim that my esteem was way off the rack
i had style but it was the caddy i lack
the gangsta white walls and the diamond in the back
i asked her was she white or black
she said neither one or somewhere in between
plus she was mean and had been seen
in places where cats got big faces
has made some trade in freestyles for freebases
i knew that my best friend was meddling
but i continued peddling
but i got arrested before i got rich
trying to make some scratch
like trigger fingers that itch
she told me shed call me an ambulance
if i ever called her a bitch
im so glad
alright i tried to be online
trouble dont last
but the matrix had a major glitch
always
she said my style could never switch
i was her nigga for life
always
she said her peeps probably couldnt pronounce malik yusef
but they could pronounce us man and wife
im so glad
so the script i attempted to flip flop
trouble dont last
flip floppin to backwards no in the back seats
