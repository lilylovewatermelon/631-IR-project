i can say things i dont always mean
when people get too close to me
dont know where it comes from honestly
and you werent perfect yeah you have your lows
but id say you got pretty close
dont know how you could put up with me

prechorus
i was so caught up in my own thoughts
dont think that i understood
when you said that you just couldnt take it
that i would lose you for good

chorus
oh i didnt think this over
fell back when you got closer
after i just put you right through hell
you couldnt hate me more than i hate myself
id always act so selfish
had shit i hadnt dealt with
after i just put you right through hell
you couldnt hate me more than i hatе myself

verse 2
we both know i might be thе worst at goodbyes
but i look at you straight and i lied
and acted like id be fine
sometimes when i care i think i tend to shut off
like nothing could matter enough
why would you let me keep doing that
you shouldve stopped me but

chorus

you couldnt hate me more than i hate myself

bridge
so off i go to hurt you again
i shut you out to try to forget
that im the one whos fucked in the end
cause baby youll be happier with someone else
so off i go to hurt you again
i shut you out to try to forget
that im the one whos fucked in the end
cause you couldnt hate me more than i hate myself
outro
i didnt think this over
fell back when you got closer
after i just put you right through hell
you couldnt hate me more than i hate myself8embed"
