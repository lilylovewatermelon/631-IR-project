feels like my life is ready to blow
me and my love well take it slow
i hope she knows that ill love her long
i just dont know where the hell i belong no no

verse 1
how optimism led me astray
two hundred things i took the wrong way
but i saw her love gauge runnin low
i tried to fill but it overflowed

chorus
feels like my life is ready to blow
me and my lover taking it slow
i hope she knows that ill love her long
i just dont know where the hell i belong

verse 2
she remembers my name
could be blown way out
its all going to change
she remembers my name

bridge
but she was only messing around
please no more playing with my heart
ooh go mr right just for once
then it all just came out
ooh no more mischief with my mind
guess ill hold in next time

ill be frozen here on
if forever well see
no more guessin for me

outro
oh i was just so sure of everything
oh thats what you get for dreamin aloud
then it all just came out

if forever well see
oh the day that words are clearer for me
