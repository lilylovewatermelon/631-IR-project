lately nothin i do ever seems to please you
and maybe turning my back would be that much easier
cause hurtful words are all that we exchange
but i cant watch you walk away
can i forget about the way it feels to touch you
and all about the good times that weve been through
could i wake up without you every day
and would i let you walk away

prechorus
no i cant learn to live without
and i cant give up on us now

chorus
oh i know i could say were through
and tell myself im over you
but even if i made a vow
i promise not to miss you now
and try to hide the truth inside
id fail cause i i just cant live a lie

verse 2
could i forget the look that tells me that you want me
and all the reasons that make loving you so easy
the kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
the way you know just what i mean
