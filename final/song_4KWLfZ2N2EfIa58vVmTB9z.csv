ghosts and goblins run amok
in the caverns of rhine
slinging petty corruption
the seventh sign

chorus
give it yeah
give it to you to you
and i do what it takes
to give it to you bust
bust

verse 1 big boi
step into the realms of space where nobody goes
only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose
some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care
no collision supervision but my family is here
now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
one of those who chauffeured life and then was underprepared
but my hunger is the thunder no wonder it cant be smothered
or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce
you a chuck e cheese bouncer chumpin off the boss
what im tryna tell you now is that youre softer than soft
and im sick as a cough did i mention its raw
your predicaments flawed flaw means fucked up
and serving out the oven not fried slow roast
no coast tuck your tail and hide
you scared
you might also likechorus
give it yeah
give it to you to you
and i do what it takes
to give it to you bust
bust

verse 2 killer mike
i officially do it with guns on tour
we lock down traps push caps galore
my wiz cook work until it scale like fish
my old earth even known to handle biz
i serve whipped out of whips whip out cash
usually keep a gpack on the dash
try to test my gangsta i bring harm
im as slick as freeway rick and nicholas barnes
my uptown nikes hold caps and cheddar
my waistline hold a four pound beretta
ill shoelace your face just to learn you better
my ox so sharp it cut through leather
my rap name killer my street name skunk
i mastered the music that was born in the bronx
i switch my slang spit from my mouth
im still all coast my coast the south

chorus
give it yeah
give it to you to you
and i do what it takes
to give it to you bust
