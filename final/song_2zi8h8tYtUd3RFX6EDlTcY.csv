i sense theres something in the wind
that seems like tragedys at hand
and though id like to stand by him
cant shake this feeling that i have
the worst is just around the bend

chorus
and does he notice
my feelings for him
and will he see
how much he means to me
i think its not to be

verse 2
what will become of my dear friend
where will his actions lead us then
although id like to join the crowd
in their enthusiastic cloud
try as i may it doesnt last

chorus
and will we ever
end up together
no i think not
its never to become
for i am not the one

chorus
and will we ever
end up together
no i think not
its never to become
for i am not the one1embed"
