our father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us for our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespassed against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
for ever and ever hmm amen

verse 1
man im prayin for help
while im lookin at the life i left its kinda hard not to hate myself
but quiet as kept right or wrong its just the way i felt
i might be better off prayin for death on my knees i knelt
still tryin to find a way to accept it aint a way that i can
help nobody til i save myself technically im still a slave myself
i gotta climb out the grave myself man i played myself
but when i look at all the fans i touched
i ask how can a man thats done so much be treated so unjust
cause im tryin to inspire the folks you wanna condemn
cause they sell dope well man show em the ropes
be a father or a football coach a role model or a symbol of hope
take another approach instead of testifyin against them in court
handcuffin em and closin the door so they can be worse than before
cant you see they only do what they know
than you wonder why they dont care no mo life aint fair i know
but why im hated everywhere i go next time you wanna
compare my flow just know that im prayin for help
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likehook
askin somebody else to give me a hand
im tryin hard but im only a man
man im prayin for help
hopin somebody else could see what i see
its like the hood only matter to me
they got me prayin for help
hopin somebody else can carry the torch
im all alone with no kinda support
while i was prayin for help
realized that i dont need nobody else
if god wit me i can do it myself
im tired of just prayin for help

verse 2
i know its only one king one thing one being
only somethin i believe without seeing and with all my faith
i pray some how some way regardless of what anyone say
i believe one day that imma change my life get right
start livin like christ til the end of my fight
imma be defending my strife
til somebody come and shut off my lights i aint never gon quit
no matter how difficult its gon get and you can bet whatever on this
im forever gon spit harder than niggas hatin on tip
you can take away place it on tip i double my load
carry it as the trouble unfolds holds yours
and i betta dont fold put that on my soul
if it takes till im a hundred years old bet im reachin everyone of my goals
hook

verse 3
ay its so many times i done wish i could change my mind
change my life and leave the game behind
and its been so many days i done prayed i could find a way
find a heart and the time to say only so many are blessed
with so many chances and so many checks so many fans
with so many arrest and its been so many deaths
so many prisons with niggas in there
and the system keep playin them to the left man its so many tests
so many haters love seeing you stress but tribulations come with being the best
still its so many who flex singin bout checks when they greener than shreks
sellin dreams never seen in the jects thats why im seen as a threat
so many stripes off the streets imma vet so many rappers get so little respect
now niggas faith on the shelf cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt
or the heart that a nigga that dealt so many niggas done left outta the hood
made a way for themself instead of givin back they stay for they self
so many playin they self instead of readin educating they self
the ones who wont even pray for they self they got me prayin for help
