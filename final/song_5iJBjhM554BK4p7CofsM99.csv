the young man stands on the edge of his porch
the days were short and the father was gone
there was no one in the town and no one in the field
this dusty barren land had given all it could yield

verse 2
ive been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
and i have no idea where else my heart could have been
i placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
and now i am sure my heart will never be still
so collect your courage and collect your horse
and pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

chorus
seal my heart and break my pride
ive nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
align my heart my body my mind
to face what ive done and do my time

verse 3
well you are my accuser now look in my face
your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
so one man has and another has not
how can you love what it is you have got
when you took it all from the weak hands of the poor
liars and thieves you know not what is in store
you might also likeverse 4
there will come a time i will look in your eye
you will pray to the god that youve always denied
then ill go out back and ill get my gun
ill say you havent met me i am the only son

chorus
seal my heart and break my pride
ive nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
align my heart my body my mind
to face what ive done and do my time

interlude

chorus
seal my heart and break my pride
ive nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide

chorus 2
