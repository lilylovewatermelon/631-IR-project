there was a time i used to look into my fathers eyes
in a happy home i was a king i had a golden throne
those days are gone now the memorys on the wall
i hear the songs from the places where i was born

prechorus
up on that hill across the blue lake
thats where i had my first heartbreak
i still remember how it all changed
my father said
