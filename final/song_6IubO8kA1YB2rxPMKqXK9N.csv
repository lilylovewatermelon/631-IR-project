its getting really hard just to live these days
my lifes in a blur i cant see straight
its hard to play the hand that was dealt to me the past im running from wont set me free
i dont think ill ever change these ways

prechorus
took a wrong turn and now im lost
smoke still burns on every bridge i cross

chorus
ive been down this road before
its just not what it seems
ive learned every open door
isnt always what you need
poverty laid to follow dreams
i watch them fall like autumn leaves
and honestly even angels cry
even angels cry

postchorus
even angels cry

verse 2
i been feeling pressure and i been feeling reckless
since i was an adolescent i could snap at any second
long nights and adderall cocaine and alcohol
mind racing my hearts dribbling like a basketball
and i feel like im going insane
when im knowing theres no way i will change
the angels that used to lead me now they torture my soul
feeling confusion as im moving towards this fork in the road

took a wrong turn and now im lost
smoke still burns on every bridge i cross

chorus
ive been down this road before
its just not what it seems
ive learned every open door
isnt always what you need
poverty laid to follow dreams
i watch them fall like autumn leaves
and honestly even angels cry
