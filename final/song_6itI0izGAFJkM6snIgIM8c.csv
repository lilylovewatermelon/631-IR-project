im a runner thats what i do
dont be surprised when i run from you
when you turn around ill be gone
i wont leave cause of something you said
nobody will know which way that i went
beat ya to the door before you get the chance

chorus
it aint the falling in love im scared of
it aint the moonlight shining in your eyes
it aint the falling baby cause the fallin ive always liked
im good at being lonely lonelys all i got
it aint the fallin in love thatll kill me its the sudden stop

verse 2
love me now we cant waste time
im not the kind who likes to stay all night
once the sun comes up theres too much at stake
never wanted a one night stand
a broken heart can really change a man
youre the kind of girl who really hurt me bad

chorus
it aint the falling in love im scared of
it aint the moonlight shining in your eyes
it aint the falling baby cause the fallin ive always liked
im good at being lonely lonelys all i got
it aint the fallin in love thatll kill me its the sudden stop

i cant afford to fall again
cause if you leave yeah you know nobody wins

chorus
it aint the falling in love im scared of
it aint the moonlight shining in your eyes
it aint the falling baby cause the fallin ive always liked
im good at being lonely lonelys all i got
it aint the fallin in love thatll kill me its the sudden stop
