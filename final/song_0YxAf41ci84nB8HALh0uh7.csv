from the moment that we met
my world was turned around upside down
to some degree i still regret
my memory for keeping you around
girl i thought that you were mine
but my broken hearts been shattered one too many times

chorus
and i dont want to see you anymore im just not that strong
i love it when youre here but im better when youre gone
im certain that ive given and oh how you can take
theres no use in you looking theres nothing left for you to break
baby please release me
let my heart rest in pieces
in pieces

verse 2
someone let you down again
so you turn to me your convenient friend
oh but i know what youre doing and what you hope to find
ive seen it a thousand times
oh the fire we had before
are now just bitter ashes left scattered on the floor

chorus
and i dont want to see you anymore im just not that strong
i love it when youre here but im better when youre gone
im certain that ive given and oh how you can take
theres no use in you looking theres nothing left for you to break
baby please release me
let my heart rest in pieces
you might also likei dont want to see you anymore im just not that strong
i love it when youre here baby but im better when youre gone
im certain that ive given and oh how you can take
theres no use in you looking theres nothing left for you to break
baby please release me
we both know that you dont need me
let my heart rest in pieces
in pieces
let it rest1embed"
