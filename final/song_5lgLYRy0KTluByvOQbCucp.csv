we sit with the fools and the sinners
the jokers and the killers
it’s just our way
toss a rock and you break a window
and toss a feather up
and watch the wind blow
it away

chorus
and you can float on the wind for so long
but someday honey
you’ve got to come back down
and when you do ill be hanging around

verse 2
it smells like smoke in here
and the piano does not play
it never did
and there’s this feeling i get
when you’re in the room
i want you to stay

chorus
and you can float on the wind for so long
but someday honey
you have to come back down
and when you do ill be hanging around
and you can float on the wind for so long
but someday honey you’ve have to come back down
and when you do ill be hanging around
