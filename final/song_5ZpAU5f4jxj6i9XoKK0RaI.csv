all my style all my grace
all i tried to save my face
all my guts try to spill
all my holes try to fill
all my money been a long time spent
on my drugs on my rent
on my saving philosophy
it goes one in the bank and the rest for me

chorus
it goes all my troubles on a burning pile
all lit up and i start to smile
if i catch fire then ill change my aim
throw my troubles at the pearly gates

postchorus

got her buns in the oven and she never got laid
