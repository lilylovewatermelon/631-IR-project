in some respects
i suspect youve got a respectable side
when pushed and pulled and pressured
you seldom run and hide
but its for someone elses benefit
not for what you wanna do
until i realize that youve realized
im gonna say these words to you

chorus
you dont know what love is
you do as youre told
just as a child at ten might act
but youre far too old
youre not hopeless or helpless
and i hate to sound cold
but you dont know what love is
you just do as youre told

verse 2
i can see your man
cant help but win
any problems that may arise
but in his mind there can be no sin
if you never criticize
you just keep on repeating
all those empty i love yous
until you say you deserve better
im gonna lay right into you

but youre far too old
youre not hopeless or helpless
and i hate to sound cold
but you dont know what love is
no you dont know what love is
no you dont know what love is
you just do as youre told
you do as youre told
