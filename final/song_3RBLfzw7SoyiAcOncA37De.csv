tiptoe
down the hall from where you live
these floors are talkative
but its alright its alright

so quiet
a little house out in the woods
and it would feel so good
if you would stay if you would stay

chorus
summer is over
and i wanna leave you satisfied
summer is over
and i can feel the cold changing us inside
come under the covers
cause i wanna leave you satisfied tonight

verse 2
in the low light
two white shadows become one
come on put your moon in my sun
and set me on fire set me on fire

chorus
summer is over
and i wanna leave you satisfied
summer is over
and i can feel the cold changing us inside
come under the covers
and i wanna leave you satisfied tonight
ohohoh ohoh
ohohoh ohoh
ohohoh ohoh

sometimes
its like you grew up down the street
its such a mystery
the way you know me the way you know me

chorus
summer is over
and i wanna leave you satisfied
summer is over
and i can feel the cold changing us inside
come under the covers
oh and i wanna leave you satisfied

summer is over
summer is over
summer is over
summer is over7embed"
