verse 1 ja rule
dear lord can you feel i think the reign is my pain
if you cant its alright cause ima live my life anyway
just let it rain  on me
i feel so free like a cool breeze
and when the sun gon shine
fold up the miniblinds load up the lucky 9
hit em up from behind
thats my life  and itll never be the same
ever again the game is to blame
dont get caught up in your range rover pullin over
on the westside highway shoulder nigga ill blow ya
like a windshield leave yo mind on the windshield
and have yo whip doin windmills thats what rain feels like
when its hittin a little harder than drizzle woo
and pickles flyin out pistols got niggas cryin they christians and
i cant believe shit has come to this
its unheard of now its gonna reign down murda

verse 2 ja rule
god only breathes with i think the reign is the best of them
bury the rest of them
a storm is comin i got a hundred mile runnin head start on these niggas cause its murda for life
drugs bitches and money be my only vice
but im livin life in the fast lane
doin the damn thang
in the ferrari hard top watchin hard rain
its a damn shame no more games no more love baby boy i throw back slugs
through your green bay throwback i hits that up and let you know where the reign is from
you ever heard of mixin whiskey with jamaican rum you get biggie
mix gin with a little cocaine you got me
and my style is a little too savage to not be
be looked upon as one of the illest to mc
yall niggas want it with me that shits unheard of cause niggas now its gonna reign down murda

chorus celeste scalone
i think the reign is comin back murda

i think the reign is comin back murda inc shit murda
i think the reign is rule baby comin back
verse 3 ja rule
nobody loves me i think the reign is
sometimes i wish the good lord would come down and hug me
i take a look at my life its gettin ugly
and now i know that you all wanna slug me i can get above it its my life and i thug it
even though i live it close to the edge
im gettin closer to death with everrry little step that i take
in the awake of my last days
i hope the sun shines with a light rain
that would mean the world shared my pain
and now the world could be happy again smile
cause if i ever walk the green mile
you can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
what can i say i was raised as an only child
lonely poppa disowned me so the streets raised me
to call me crazy is not unheard of
now its gonna reign down murda

chorus celeste scalone
i think the reign is comin back murda
i think the reign is comin back murda
i think the reign is comin back murda
i think the reign is comin back murda
i think the reign is comin back murda
i think the reign is comin back1embed"
