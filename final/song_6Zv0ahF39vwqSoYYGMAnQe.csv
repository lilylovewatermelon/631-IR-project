when your heart is all alone every second
seems so long
when its just you you cant see through
those old clouds that rain so blue

chorus
but when somebody loves you
theres nothing you cant do
when somebody loves you
its easy to get through
when somebody loves you
the way i love you

verse 2
when its late the sun hangs low
by yourself nowhere to go
sing a song you dance alone
play solitaire and stare at the phone

chorus

verse 3
so lets put aside our foolish pride
and let our hearts say hello
we both agree were just no good
at being on our own

outro
the way i love you
the way i love youembed"
