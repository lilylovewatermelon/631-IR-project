we broke up a month ago
your friends are mine you know i know
youve moved on found someone new
one more girl who brings out the better in you
and i thought my heart was detached
from all the sunlight of our past
but shes so sweet shes so pretty
does she mean you forgot about me

chorus
oh i hope youre happy
but not like how you were with me
im selfish i know i cant let you go
so find someone great but dont find no one better
i hope youre happy but dont be happier

verse 2
and do you tell her shes the most beautiful girl youve ever seen
an eternal love bullshit you know youll never mean
remember when i believed
you meant it when you said it first to me
and now im pickin her apart
like cuttin her down will make you miss my wretched heart
but shes beautiful she looks kind
she probably gives you butterflies

i hope youre happy
but not like how you were with me
im selfish i know i cant let you go
so find someone great but dont find no one better
i hope youre happy
i wish you all the best really
say you love her baby just not like you loved me
and think of me fondly when your hands are on her
i hope youre happy but dont be happier

bridge
ooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh

chorus
i hope youre happy
just not like how you were with me
im selfish i know cant let you go
so find someone great but dont find no one better
i hope youre happy but dont be happier86embed"
