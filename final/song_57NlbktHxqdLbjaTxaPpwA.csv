i spent my last three bucks on the last thing that i need
theres no way that ill end in the black for this term
guess i got a lot to learn

eight hours on the top of a bus
just to find out in the end
i will never stop falling in love

im alright and im always getting better
let the fire burn low cause we like it that way
we let the ash flow down our throats so stout
but we dont mind the burn
we will never ever let it go out

open doors and sweatsoaked floors
youll find it hard to miss your family
when every day youre part of one more
just slow down baby take it all in
and i promise you will never be angry again after this

kicked out of the liquor store
but were not the type of guys to fall asleep on the floor anyway
you wanna join me for dinner man i got so much to do
but never once did i expect it not to tear me in two
you might also likeim alright and im always getting better
let the fire burn high cause we like it that way
we let the ash flow down our throats so stout
but we dont mind the burn
we will never ever let it go out2embed"
