west coast hippie in a pickup truck
with stickers all over the back
vanity plate that says livin life
i bet you love to take it off the map
you seem like a girl who sleeps under the stars
every single chance you get

prechorus
oohooh
wherever you end up is where youll be
oohooh
if youre looking for a little bit of company

chorus
ill roll i can be your navigator
ill roll ill be on my best behavior
ill roll east west north to south
ill roll baby break the good stuff out and ill roll

verse 2
youre the kind of girl that only exists
in a kerouac paperback dream
theres just enough room in your front seat
for me to drop everything
i just wanna read a couple highway signs
aint got no tieyoudown plans
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeprechorus
oohooh
i just wanna burn down a road i aint ever been down
oohooh
when the gas in the tank or my welcome runs out

chorus
ill roll i aint trying to cramp your style
ill roll give me just a few good miles
ill roll i can just fade to black
ill roll you can have your blue sky back
ill roll

bridge
oohooh
wherever you end up is where youll be
oohooh
im just looking for a little bit of wild and free
can i roll
ill roll

chorus
ill roll i can be your navigator
ill roll ill be on my best behavior
ill roll east west north to south
ill roll baby break the good stuff out and
ill roll i aint trying to cramp your style
ill roll baby give me just a few good miles
ill roll then i can just fade to black
ill roll you can have your blue sky back
ill roll
ill rollembed"
