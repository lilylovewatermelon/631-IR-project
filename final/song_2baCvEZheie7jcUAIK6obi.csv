in the dark bodies touch
looking for ones to trust
i realized my mistake
its too much for me to take

chorus
the rope around my neck will make my prescence known
the gun held to my head will show how much ive grown
the knife thats in my back will leave your heart to roam
as pleasure turns to pain ill be alone
ill be alone

verse 2
normally i will fall
to stay clean to fix it all
i have been through your hell
bury me when you are well

chorus
the rope around my neck will make my prescence known
the gun held to my head will show how much ive grown
the knife thats in my back will leave your heart to roam
as pleasure turns to pain ill be alone
ill be alone

chorus
the rope around my neck will make my prescence known
the gun held to my head will show how much ive grown
the knife thats in my back will leave your heart to roam
as pleasure turns to pain ill be alone
ill be alone4embed"
