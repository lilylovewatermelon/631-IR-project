so here we go
having the same old fight again
though there she goes
same old game that never ends
if i could say all the right words
i know i could make you stay
if i could say all the right words
things would work out all right

chorus 1
and if you go
i wont believe
that its forever
and you can go
but ill never leave
â€™cause its not over

verse 2
replay last night
talking it out dont make it right
i know shes tried but my whole world
is her and all weve got now

chorus 2
and if you go
i wont believe
that its forever
i wont let go
even if she
says that its over
i know itll be
different this time
if youd just stay
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likebridge
and when we wrote this story how did it end
it was you and me for all our lives
come on dont say it well try again
and if id just hold you we could last
but she stands softly tears down her face
hitting me oh god this is the end
id wait for you but theres nothing more now i can do

outro
how did you know
how did you know
how did you know
