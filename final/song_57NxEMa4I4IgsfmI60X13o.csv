seventeen now my mommys gone
cant wait till she come back home
missin her face like dust till dawn while she went away
never think it be this long
i feel like cryin while im writin this song
cant wait till that day come on
when she leave the place

speaking

its been about two years since i saw your face
i miss you like crazy
know the money orders the prepaid costs
bein on my own
no knee kurt canino
but i love you though
