baby what do you say what love comes down on you
raining the blues on you
like its never gonna end on you
and all your dreams like leaves in the gutter go floating b
no baby i dont know why all gods children cry
ill miss your skin as golden as your wheatfield hair
and where you go i hope you find out there

chorus
a better rain
the kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
and lets you know that gods alive
a better rain
thatll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
and be all right again
in a better rain

verse 2
someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
long after time has earsed
all the words like razor blades
youll remember you and me before the flood
once upon a time in love a beautiful us
i can see you on some stretch of sand
spinning round in circles barefoot dancin in
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeoutro
a better rain
thatll leave behind rainbow in the sky
lets you know that gods alive
in a better rain
