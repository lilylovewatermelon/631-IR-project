can somebody save me
because im thinking maybe
that you can take me piece by piece
then you got your reasons
but i didnt need em
and either way im on my knees yeah

prechorus
i never wanted to ruin you
i only wanna get it across that i can only go so far
wherever you are

chorus
wherever you go im calling
either way youre breaking my heart
wherever you go im crawling
even when were falling
even when were falling apart

verse 2
you say that youre leaving
say that you dont need him
and all i do is give and you just take
i guess that i knew it
i cant make it through it
but im gonna try this anyway

in your garden where the roses sleep
i can make you anything you wanna be
when that bodys close to me
