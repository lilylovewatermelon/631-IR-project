yes skrawberries

verse 1 joey bada
im a beast with these flows
two birds one stoned you get geeseâ€™d when trees rolled
they say im evil cause i trained my ego to see gold
cause he know seagulls couldnt see these goals please
its the return of the beast coast
no cash flashed but the cheese still make teeth show
incognito is how you move on the strip
what you tryna be vito well theres rules to this shit
dont get clapped yall aint real spitters yall lips chapped
better watch it mr nice watch dont risk that
i got a sixpack of bare skill that i spill like that
and everybody know that shit crack
yall niggas softspoken down below choking
the type to drop the soap when you soakin in front of most men
it makes sense why you want beef well this frozen
its nuts for you screwed in the tool and cant hold em
better shoot yourself plaxico because im next to go
the progressive flows from new york to new mexico
my lyrical span is what the fans is demandin
step into my box and thats exactly whatchu stand in
aint no half steppin around me
and you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
the young cop killer im that ill so doc will ya
give me two shots for 2pac killer nigga
you might also likeverse 2 capital steez
soul searchin til my flows are perfect
i aint tryna be a slave to grow old from workin
sorry bada you lucky that i peeped it second
tell them niggas keep it steppin with they beat selection
check the melodies its so heavenly
that shitll get your hips to move with no 7ds
audiopium can i bust soliloquies
got that shit mixed and mastered both remedies
grab a spoonful we stirrin up a pot
and you know we gotta serve it while its hot
im flowin like a volcano and drippin verses off the top
dirty cops still swervin on the block
lookin for black kids that spittin up acid
its in my jeans so dont worry what my pants is
get with the script its that ignorant shit
and they bound to get sick of us quick but i aint sealin my lips
its a shift i know you feel it man
we blowin up like a ceiling fan
droppin off jewels like killa cams man
when it comes to kickin verses im mr van damme
crushin strawberries its a jam
so throw up both hands if you can
ironic how im killin this shit until they bury me
my volume is going in depth with longevity
stupids
