she said lets start from the top
just rid of everything
like the notes in your pockets the texts youre always locking
and if its all the same forget all of those lines
where you mention my smile
you got a lot of nerve complimenting me
through choruses and rhyme

verse 2 brendan lukens
but i know how you get
from time to time
well do this and that oh travel the map
and maybe just for a while
i thought you were my redo
you thought you could change my name
i could tell by the look on your face
whenever i would sayâ€”

verse 3 brendan lukens
but that when i stopped
to listen or care
about anything other than a plan of attack
to get me back to where
you are my redo
or at least a pair of eyes that would notice when i
couldnt conjure words cause i thought about it too long
so ill leave the steady hands to sean

cause we all know i lack
in the field of conversing correctly
without shaking or getting queasy
not letting my emotions get involved
and on a side note you stole my heart
like i stole your hometown lingo
with steady hands and strong steady hands and strong
but now were down to brass tacks
and we both know it
the odds are in my favor
though you wont show it

verse 5 brendan lukens
you etched holes in my brain
deep and like you
always too out of reach
to see it clearly
you sank words into my veins
deep and like you
too excited to get them out fully

verse 6 brendan lukens
i know im bad with expectations
the ones too large for any moment but i
i can promise expectations
grounded for this time around
lets be the last to leave tonight
cause i need time to find the courage
to speak my mind to speak my mind
oh hear me out oh just this time
refrain brendan lukens
they dont think we can make this last
but we got eyes that see past these nights
and we got calloused hands
but these arms arent tired at least not yet

refrain brendan lukens
they dont think we can make this last
but we got eyes that see past these nights
and we got calloused hands
but these arms arent tired at least not yet

outro brendan lukens
they just think we are young with broken hearts
stomping around every day
so lets stomp around breaking
young at heart all the way
so lets stomp around breaking
young at heart all the way4embed"
