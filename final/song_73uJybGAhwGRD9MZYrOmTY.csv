spirit of my silence i can hear you
but i’m afraid to be near you
and i don’t know where to begin
and i don’t know where to begin

verse 2
somewhere in the desert there’s a forest
and an acre before us
but i don’t know where to begin
but i don’t know where to begin
again ive lost my strength completely oh be near me
tired old mare with the wind in your hair

verse 3
amethyst and flowers on the table on the table
is it real or a fable is it real or a fable
well i suppose a friend is a friend
and we all know how this will end

verse 4
chimney swift that finds me be my keeper be my keeper
silhouette of the cedar silhouette of the cedar
what is that song you sing for the dead
what is that song you sing for the dead
i see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
well i got nothing to prove
well i got nothing to prove
you might also likeinstrumental bridge

verse 5
i forgive you mother i can hear you i can hear you
and i long to be near you and i long to be near you
but every road leads to an end
yes every road leads to an end
your apparition passes through me in the willows
five red hens – you’ll never see us again
you’ll never see us again
