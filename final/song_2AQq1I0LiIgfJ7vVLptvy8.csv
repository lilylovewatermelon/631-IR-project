like an unsung melody
the truth is waiting there for you to find it
its not a blight but a remedy
a clear reminder of how it began
deep inside your memory
you turned away as you struggled to find it
you heard the call as you walked away
a voice of calm from within the silence
and for what seemed an eternity
you waited hoping it would call out again
you heard the shadow beckoning
then your fear seemed to keep you blinded
you held your guard as you walked away

chorus
when you think all is forsaken
listen to me now alls not forsaken
you need never feel broken again
sometimes darkness can show you the light

verse 2
an unforgivable tragedy
the answer isnt where you think youd find it
prepare yourself for the reckoning
for when your world seems to crumble again
dont be afraid dont turn away
youre the one who can redefine it
dont let hope become a memory
let the shadow permeate your mind
and reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
so that the door can be opened again
within your darkest memories
lies the answer if you dare to find it
dont let hope become a memory

when you think all is forsaken
listen to me now alls not forsaken
you need never feel broken again
sometimes darkness can show you the light

sickening weakening
dont let another somber pariah consume your soul
you need strengthening toughening
it takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
ignite the fire within you

chorus
when you think all is forsaken
listen to me now alls not forsaken
you need never feel broken again
sometimes darkness can show you the light

outro
dont ignore listen to me now
you need never feel broken again
sometimes darkness can show you the light3embed"
