we didnt need a story we didnt need a real world
we just had to keep walking
and we became the stories we became the places
we were the lights the deserts the faraway worlds
we were you before you even existed

verse 1 anthony gonzalez
carry on carry on carry on
and after us the flood
carry on carry on carry on
our silver horn it leads the way
banners of gold shine
in the cold in the cold in the cold
footprints of snow blind from the road
hail

verse 2 zola jesus
we carry on carry on
follow us we are one
the battles fought the deed is done
our silver hum runs deep and strong
hand to the heart lips to the horn
we can save we can be reborn
head on my breast ill keep you warm
