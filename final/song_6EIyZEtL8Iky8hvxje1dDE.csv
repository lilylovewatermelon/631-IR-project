ive got myself in a masochistic hold
why dont you let go
shake it off just to redirect my flow
come on lets go

prechorus 1
sit up straight im on a double date
ive got to find my way into the light heavy middleweight
we dont stop arock around the clock
a motormouthing off in front of every other road block

prechorus 2
come again and tell me what youre going through
like a girl who only knew her child was due

chorus
memories of everything of lemon trees on mercury and
come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
you always took me with a smile when i was down
memories of everything that blew through

verse 2
looking up into a reverse vertigo
what an undertow
give it up another stubborn scorpio
come on lets go
