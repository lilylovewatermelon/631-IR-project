i gave up on cigarettes to the day i aint touched one yet
but tonight i think im gonna burn the whole pack
i laid off 90 proof aint had a drop in years and thats the truth
but tonight when i light the first one im gonna open up the jack

chorus
she aint hooked on me no more
she aint hooked on me no more
the one thing that always hurt her the most
is the one thing she finally quit fighting for
she aint hooked on me no more
she aint hooked on me no more
im picking up all my bad habits again
shes letting one go

verse 2
for years she had it real bad
i was the only addiction she ever had
her love made me so high but i abused it
and here i sit all alone tonight
whiskey on the rocks and more cigarettes to light
holding on to everything ive got left hoping i dont lose it

chorus
she aint hooked on me no more
she aint hooked on me no more
the one thing that always hurt her the most
is the one thing she finally quit fighting for
she aint hooked on me no more
she aint hooked on me no more
im picking up all my bad habits again
shes letting one go
