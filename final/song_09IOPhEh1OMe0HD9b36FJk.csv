verse 1
when you leave me make me jump up off my roof
didnt faze you wouldve given you the moon
even after everything that weve been through
i aint never met nobody like you
why you always tryna tell me that its cool
need to quiet cause you never tell the truth
felt like ballin was the only thing to do
trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

prechorus
when shes comin for my heart it feels like armageddon
ima turn the tables promise you will not forget it
wont apologize dont give a fuck if youre offended
no discussion yeah we gotta go our separate ways
wont take me down in flames
i dont even wanna know your name
watch how everything is gonna change yeah ayy

chorus
