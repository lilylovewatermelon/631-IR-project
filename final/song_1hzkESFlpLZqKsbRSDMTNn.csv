i will forgive but i wont forget
and i hope you know youve lost my respect

verse 1
you better watch out
if you dont know whats going on around you
you better think twice
before you fly off the handle and lose it
you better join us
before you get lost in the shuffle
you better rise against
the demons that are going to try and hold you down

chorus 2
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
the ones you love the ones you love the ones you love

verse 2
because im not a pawn for you to play in your fucking game
ive got dignity and a dream that i want to achieve
under pressure you crumbled and you let me down
im not deaf and all i hear are your empty promises

chorus 2
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
the ones you love the ones you love the ones you love
you might also likebridge
does it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love
yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love
yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love
yes it runs in your blood to betray the ones you love

chorus 1
i will forgive but i wont forget
and i hope you know youve lost my respect

outro
yes it run in your blood to betray the ones you love
yes it run in your blood to betray the ones you love1embed"
