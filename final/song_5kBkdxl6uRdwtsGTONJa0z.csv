from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop
at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety the pictures there
the memory wont escape me but why should i care
from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop
at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety the pictures there
the memory wont escape me but why should i care

verse 1 mike shinoda
theres a place so dark you cant see the end
skies cock back and shock that which cant defend
the rain then sends dripping acidic questions
forcefully the power of suggestion
then with the eyes shut lookin through the rust and rot and dust
a small spot of light floods the floor
and pours over the rusted world of pretend
and the eyes ease open and its dark again

prechorus chester bennington mike shinoda
from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop
at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety the pictures there
the memory wont escape me but why should i care
you might also likechorus chester bennington
in the memory youll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up

verse 2 mike shinoda
movin all around screamin of the ups and downs
pollution manifested in perpetual sound
the wheels go round and the sunset creeps
behind street lamps chainlink and concrete
a little piece of paper with a picture drawn
floats on down the street til the wind is gone
and the memory now is like the picture was then
when the papers crumpled up it cant be perfect again

prechorus chester bennington mike shinoda
from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop
at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety the pictures there
the memory wont escape me but why should i care
from the top to the bottom bottom to top i stop
at the core ive forgotten in the middle of my thoughts
taken far from my safety the pictures there
the memory wont escape me but why should i care
chorus chester bennington
in the memory youll find me
eyes burning up
the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up

the darkness holding me tightly
until the sun rises up17embed"
