come over to my house  jump in the neighbours pool
it felt nice felt so nice
and it was getting dark you wrapped your long legs
around me i held on tight
lying in my bed the unfamiliar sheets
were so cool on your skin
when your daddy called said you were at a friends
and we walked the long way home

chorus
going on my first impression i recall you wearing white
there was something sweet in the air babe that summer night
there will always be another time for us to fall in love
but it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
youll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
first times always cut the deepest

verse 2
breathe me with your hands show me a safe place
and ill come down yeah ill come down
and can you recognise the look upon my face
its on my lips its in my eyes
this bar will never break wont you say it one more time
wont you say my name wont you say my name
this bar will never break wont you say it one more time
wont you say say my name
