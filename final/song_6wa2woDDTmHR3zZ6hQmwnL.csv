weve been alright up until now
but the air that we breathe is about to run out
weve rehearsed our lines clear and loud
but the cue never came and the lights
they never went down
so were passing the time
while time passes us
the fast lanes a term never applied to us
without a dime to my name
or a prayer in the world
i walk out the door

prechorus
destination anywhere but here
away from you

chorus
now im on my way to the other side
on my way
ill forget everything i left behind
on my way
these empty rooms
on my way
are still filled with you
on my way

so i dropped out of my own race
a race with no finish line
no first or last place
these faces all rush right past me
i turn and walk away
cause we finally know now what our
time heres about we were not meant to be
another face in the crowd
were a forest of lives
but we grow tall and wide
well never be cut down

prechorus
destination anywhere but here
away from you

chorus
now im on my way to the other side
on my way
ill forget everything i left behind
on my way
these empty rooms
on my way
are still filled with you
on my way
bridge
im so tired and turned around and scared
im lying in empty beds again
ill wait for you to come
to your senses barbedwire fences
wont keep me from breaking through
i swear i will to you

chorus
now im on my way to the other side
on my way
ill forget everything i left behind
on my way
these empty rooms
on my way
are still filled with you
on my way
are still filled with you
on my way

outro
im so tired and turned around and scared
im lying in empty beds again
away from youembed"
