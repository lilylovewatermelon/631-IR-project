looking for a cavern
a place where she can stay
waiting for the darkness
when she leaves obsessed to make her way to me
because its getting to the time when she will need to feed

chorus
and i am the willing victim of a cannibal
she rips out my bones just like im an animal
and right when im feeling like my blood is drained
she calls it a game
but the wound that she leaves is unmistakable

verse 2
im not the only one that she has come to see
dig up the skeletons of men who thought that they would be the one like me
like they could be the ones to make her believe
but for now

chorus
i am the willing victim of a cannibal
she rips out my bones just like im an animal
and right when im feeling like my blood is drained
she calls it a game
but the wound that she leaves is unmistakable

hiding in corners disguised
shes a phantom a glimmer inside
she keeps on feeding while i am conceding
so please wont you tear me open wide

drum solo

chorus
i am the willing victim of a cannibal
she rips out my bones just like im an animal
and right when im feeling like my blood is drained
she calls it a game
but the wound that she leaves is unmistakable13embed"
