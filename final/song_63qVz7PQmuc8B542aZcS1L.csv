no tears of regret no smell of her perfume
no more dancing feet to the beats that go boom
while i watch the sunrise all alone in my room

beat break
tonight therell be no pouring rain
no eyes wide shut to your never ending game
after tonight therell be no me and you
no distant memories past for me to hold on to

beat break
see everybodys working to hold on to what they know
so i guess i kept belive in my tonight will never go
some spend a lifetime searchin trying to figure out
when hell stops and heaven begins

beat break
how soon is now repeatssee david guetta liveget tickets as low as 80you might also likeembed"
