watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
children roam the streets now orphans of war
bodies hangin in the streets to adore

prechorus
royal flames will carve a path in chaos
bringing daylight to the night
death is riding into town with armor
theyve come to take all your rights

chorus
hail to the king
hail to the one
kneel to the crown
stand in the sun
hail to the king
hail hail hail
the king

verse 2
blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
born again but itâ€™s too late to atone
no mercy from the edge of the blade
dare escape and learn the price to be paid
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus
let the water flow with shades of red now
arrows black out all the light
death is riding into town with armor
theyve come to grant you your rights

chorus
hail to the king
hail to the one
kneel to the crown
stand in the sun
hail to the king
hail hail hail
the king

theres a taste of fear
hail hail hail
when the henchmen call
hail hail hail
iron fist to tame the land
hail hail hail
iron fist to claim it all
chorus
hail to the king
hail to the one
kneel to the crown
stand in the sun
hail to the king
hail to the one
kneel to the crown
stand in the sun
hail to the king
