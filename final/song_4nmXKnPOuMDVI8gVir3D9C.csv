thou shalt not

verse 1
kill your fathers destroy another life
question everything we clung to for years
live forever design a better death
confuse a liar with a savior from fear
create a myth and separate the chosen ones
adolescent independence dominion
i only wanna believe in fucking anything
but now my conscience is contradicting everything

prechorus 1
the endings the same
the world will not change
the answer is clear

verse 2
tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
blame yourselves because your children are mine
we are orphans but we are not forgotten
and we will find a way to save us this time
we can run but we are tired of running
were dropping seconds in a glass til we die
we only wanna believe in fucking everything
but were alive and were not accepting anything

the endings the same
the world will not change
the answer is clear
annihilation

chorus
i wont control or restrain
things i do not understand
now i realize im stronger better
they gave to me now i give to you
the means to burn the thoughts i had
now i realize im stronger better more

bridge
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves

verse 3
i will never become another piece
inside the paralytic construct i hate
live forever well i would rather die
at least id know i wasnt theirs to create
this is yours but you had better choose
before they take away your right to decide
i guess ill never believe in fucking anything
but my solace is i can handle everything
prechorus 3
the endings the same
the world will not change
the answer is clear
obliteration

chorus
i wont control or restrain
things i do not understand
now i realize im stronger better
they gave to me now i give to you
the means to burn the thoughts i had
now i realize im stronger better

chorus
i wont control or restrain
things i do not understand
now i realize im stronger better
they gave to me now i give to you
the means to burn the thoughts i had
now i realize im stronger better more

outro
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves
we have to save ourselves1embed"
