there was a time when i was alone
nowhere to go and no place to call home
my only friend was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away too
then one night as i closed my eyes
i saw a shadow flying high
he came to me with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for a while
he said peter pan thats what they call me
i promise that youll never be lonely
and ever since that day

chorus
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when were bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
run run lost boy they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free

verse 2
he sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
believe in him and believe in me
together we will fly away in a cloud of green
to your beautiful destiny
as we soared above the town that never loved me
i realized i finally had a family
soon enough we reached neverland
peacefully my feet hit the sand
and ever since that day
