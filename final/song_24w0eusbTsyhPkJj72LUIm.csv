oh he gave up on arrows a long long time ago
turns out im too hard to hit so he put away his bow
i might just keep on running from here to timbuktu
cause he gave up on arrows and i aint bulletproof

chorus
yeah cupids got a shotgun aimin at my heart
ive been dodging bullets ive been hiding in the dark
sawedoff double barrel trigger happy as can be
cupids got a shotgun and hes pointing it at me

verse 2
hes sitting in that tree stand and his wings are camouflage
im dug down in my foxhole waiting on his next barrage
it must be open season got a target on my back
think hes throwing love grenades and im under attack

chorus
yeah cupids got a shotgun aimin at my heart
ive been dodging bullets ive been hiding in the dark
sawedoff double barrel trigger happy as can be
cupids got a shotgun and hes pointing it at me yeah

bridge
well hes got me in his sights ive got a red dot on my chest
but little does he know i strapped on my kevlar vest
i pulled out my remington and i loaded up these shells
hes about to find out im a dang good shot myself
