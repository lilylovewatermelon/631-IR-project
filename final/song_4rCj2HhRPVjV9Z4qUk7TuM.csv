shes got too much run and too much wild
she dont hold back no she dont hide
shes always drifting and always dreaming
shes good at loving and better at leaving

chorus
damn those airplanes and
damn those fast trains and
damn those interstates
they always keep calling her
so damn easy for her to leave me
but as long as this worlds spinning round
im gonna love her
damn shes so tough to tie down
tough to tie down

verse 2
its who she is so she cant see
that her gypsy side is killing me
and i told myself i should call it quits
but before i can shes gone again

chorus
damn those airplanes and
damn those fast trains and
damn those interstates
they always keep calling her
so damn easy for her to leave me
but as long as this worlds spinning round
im gonna love her
damn shes so tough to tie down
