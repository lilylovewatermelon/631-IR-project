clear blue water
high tide came and brought you in
and i could go on and on on and on and i will
skies grew darker
currents swept you out again
and you were just gone and gone gone and gone

prechorus
in silent screams and wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this

chorus
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead ohoh oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me ohoh oh
ohoh ohoh oh

verse 2
tossing turning
struggled through the night with someone new
baby i could go on and on on and on
lantern burning
flickered in my mind only you
but you were still gone gone gone

been losing grip on sinking ships
you showed up just in time

chorus
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead ohoh oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me ohoh oh
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark ohoh oh
these hands had to let it go free and
this love came back to me ohoh oh

your smile my ghost i fell to my knees
when youre young you just run
but you come back to what you need
