this is not a test or an sos
im no longer on a quest to get girls undressed
i searched through their hearts and no treasure i found
im so lucky this one lets dogs hang around
its good having somebody good for a change
i thought that no good dirty cheats had drove me insane
i had finally given up on love and romance
if i lay down the sword im giving my innocence

chorus
coming for your heart like a cannibal
oh she lets me right in and im fed til im full
if something goes wrong im accountable
oh a life without her is no life at all
i la la la la la la la la love you cannibal queen

verse 2
if she ever left me i would break down and die
like mickey and piu could bury me alive
another pretty girl i would love to admire
from a distance but shes here so ill jump in the fire

chorus
coming for your heart like a cannibal
oh she lets me right in and im fed til im full
if something goes wrong im accountable
oh a life without her is no life at all
i la la la la la la la la love you cannibal queen

chorus
coming for your heart like a cannibal
oh she lets me right in and im fed til im full
