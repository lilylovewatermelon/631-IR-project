verse 2 damian marley
it seems she need to oil her spine
tell all a gyal toast bread cant build di putty gold mine
need all di doctor fish with di essential slime
she tell me she want to signal the plane n time mi want slow wine
turn on di hbo she want fi watch showtime
give her di cordless microphone she want di one with line
seem like me and this young gyal ya just cant combine
so its sour like lime
running it down the line mr muffin one time

seh mi take her up and tun her maniac tellin me dat i compliment her natural habitat
well   it seem like she deaf or she blind
want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
and she nah watch no time
and she just nah resign
till she see the sun shine3embed"
