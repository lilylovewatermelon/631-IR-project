yeaheh yeah yeah

verse 1
i can feel a phoenix inside of me
as i march alone to a different beat
slowly swallowing down my fear
yeah yeah
i am ready for the road less traveled
suiting up for my crowning battle
this test is my own cross to bear
but i will get there

prechorus
its never easy to be chosen never easy to be called
standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
and i can see the heavens but i still hear the flames
calling out my name

chorus
i can see the writing on the wall
i cant ignore this war
at the end of it all
who am i living for

verse 2
i can feel this light thats inside of me
growing fast into a bolt of lightning
i know one spark will shock the world
yeah yeah
so i pray for favor like esther
i need your strength to handle the pressure
i know there will be sacrifice
but thats the price
