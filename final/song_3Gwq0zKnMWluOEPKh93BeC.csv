i was a boat drifting out into the sea
i had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
that you would see me
i was a stones throw away from land
but thousands and thousands of miles away
from reaching your hand

verse 2 ryan tedder
the waves that crashed upon
the rocks that you were trying to walk along
and in my head i heard them play a song for you and me
the waves that crashed upon
the rocks that you were trying to step along
and in my head i heard them play a song for you and me

chorus ryan tedder
lets get lost at sea
where they will never find us
got stars at night to guide us
get lost at sea
where they will never find us
got stars at night to guide us
yeah
