well i come a long way from the trips and the shaky hands
if youre lookin down on me i could really give a good goddamn
lotta miles lotta folds im still findin out who i am
lotta miles lotta folds im still findin out who i am

prechorus
and every time its my fault somehow
now i know why you dont trust me now
every time its my fault somehow

chorus
dont you tread on me
i could hardly sleep so i dont
and i could hardly speak so i wont
dont you tread on me
i could hardly sleep so i dont
and i could hardly speak so i wont

verse 2
well i come a long way from the tricks and the easy love
ive been stitchin up my mind
ive been tryin not to hold that grudge
lotta miles lotta folds im still tryin just to get back up
lotta miles lotta folds im still tryin just to get back up
