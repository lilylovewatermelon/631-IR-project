sister it feels like just yesterday
sister dont you forget my number
on this door
youve got something and its so good to see
something wonderful that i could not be
everybody hanging on for their lives
but you cant help them cause you dont have the time

prechorus 1
i know everyone goes any damn place they like
i hope this goes over well on the toxic radio yeah

chorus
you get taken all the time for a fool
i dont know why
youre so gullible but i dont mind
oh thats not the problem
and i dont need anyone with me right now
monday tuesday is my weekend
you get taken for a fool all the time
i dont know why

verse 2
blame yourself for once quit putting it on me
i cant help you cause ive seen what it means
its so early i dont want to wake up
oh were so lucky cause we never grow up
mama it feels like just yesterday
mama dont you forget my number
i dont want to be the one at the door

i know everyone goes any damn place they choose
and i hope everyone well on the toxic radio
a tourist in the ghetto not afraid of anything
except death and anything else that could maybe hurt them oh yeah

chorus
you get taken all the time for a fool
i dont know why
youre so gullible but i dont mind

and i dont need anyone with me right now
