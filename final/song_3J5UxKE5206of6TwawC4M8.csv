i know i dont say youre beautiful enough
but that dont mean it aint on my mind
and i know sometimes we have differences and fight
but i hate when i see you cry

prechorus
and if youre ever worried i got one foot out that door
i can promise you right now baby

chorus
my love wont leave you alone
just so you know
when i say forever girl

well be goin on and on
baby my love wont leave you alone
