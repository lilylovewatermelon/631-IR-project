when im away from you
im happier than ever
wish i could explain it better
i wish it wasnt true

verse 1
give me a day or two to think of something clever
to write myself a letter
to tell me what to do mmmm
do you read my interviews
or do you skip my avenue
when you said you were passin through
was i even on your way
i knew when i asked you to when i asked you to
be cool about what i was tellin you
youd do the opposite of what you said youd do what you said youd do
and id end up more afraid
dont say it isnt fair
you clearly werеnt aware that you made me misеrable
so if you really wanna know

chorus
when im away from you when im away from you
im happier than ever happier than ever
wish i could explain it better wish i could explain it better
i wish it wasnt true mmmm

you call me again drunk in your benz
drivin home under the influence
you scared me to death but im wastin my breath
cause you only listen to your fuckin friends
i dont relate to you
i dont relate to you no
cause id never treat me this shitty
you made me hate this city

verse 3
and i dont talk shit about you on the internet
never told anyone anything bad
cause that shits embarrassing you were my everything
and all that you did was make me fuckin sad
so dont waste the time i dont have
and dont try to make me feel bad
i could talk about every time that you showed up on time
but id have an empty line cause you never did
never paid any mind to my mother or friends so i
shut em all out for you cause i was a kid

outro
you ruined everything good
always said you were misunderstood
made all my moments your own
just fuckin leave me alone yeah fuck you
ah
goddamn
ah
fuck you
fuck you316embed"
