what am i supposed to do with this time
if theres so many holes i stay afloat
but i feel out of control
so petrified im petrified mm
what am i supposed to do to get by
did i lose everything i need to survive
cause at 4 am when the sweat sets in
did you get my message did it send
or did you just get on with your life
oh

chorus
oh im taking time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally find the words to say
but i cant tell you if you turn around
and run away run away

verse 2
what am i supposed to do with these clothes oh
its my twisted way of keeping you close yeah yeah
im a nervous wreck im a broken man
did you get my message did it send
or do you get along on your own

oh im taking time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally find the words to say
but i cant tell you if you turn around
and run away run away

bridge
and it breaks me down when i see your face
you look so different but you feel the same
and i do not understand
i cannot comprehend
the chills your body sends
why did it have to end

chorus
im taking time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally find the words to say
but i cant tell you if you turn around
and run away run away
oh im taking time to think and i
dont think its fair for us to
turn around and say goodbye
i have this feeling when i
finally find the words to say
but i cant tell you if you turn around
and run away run away
outro
runaway runaway runaway
turn around and
runaway runaway runaway
runaway runaway runaway
but i cant tell you if you
runaway runaway runaway
turn around and runaway runaway1embed"
