when i walk beside her
i am the better man
when i look to leave her
i always stagger back again

once i built an ivory tower
so i could worship from above
when i climb down to be set free
she took me in again

chorus
theres a big
a big hard sun
beating on the big people
in a big hard world

verse 2
when she comes to greet me
she is mercy at my feet
and i i see her inner charm
she just throws it back at me

once i dug an early grave
to find a better land
she just smiled and laughed at me
and took her rules back again

she is comfort by my side

verse 4
once i stood to lose her
when i saw what i had done
bowed down and threw away the hours
of her garden and her sun

so i tried to warn her
i turned to see her weep
forty days and forty nights
and its still coming down on me

beating on the big people
in a big hard world
