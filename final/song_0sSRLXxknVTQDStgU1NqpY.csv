leave your phone come to mine
youll catch a hint in due time
i think think that i
could fuck the idea of him outta your mind
he said he rap he aint signed that aint a good sign
change your mind good conversation and some rosé wine
unless theres some other things you gotta mind
you mind me ayy ayy
the smoke got me talkin in dutch
a pill in ibiza so what
she leanin on me im her crutch
she creamin on me im her crush
her photos dont need a retouch
she askin why havent i nut
i didnt know we in a rush
enjoyin the moment so hush
my album was payin her bills
i dont еven need a deluxe
hеr stomach is flat as fuck
she still fit that shit in her gut somehow
the fat musta went in her butt somehow
i dont even ask her whats up
she sayin that shit is natural
dont care if she makin it up
i never put you in no uber girl
im always gon send you a truck
im always gon keep it a buck
you give me that shit and im stuck

30 on my waist
cause a lotta broke niggas round the way ridin round town
and they lookin for my face
gotta pray to god above you girl you know that savage love you
and i hope that you feel the same
tryna be the one for you but my nickname true
and i hope that i can change
girl you know that savage love you girl you know that savage love you

verse 3 drake
i gotta stop goin van cleef condo third week
i like it but im too geeked tryna turn you up
i gotta stop goin lenci rollie first week
youre misreadin me im too geeked tryna turn you up
you were lost until me
i didnt get no finders fee
youre actin like a bridetobe
behind closed doors slimin me
friends are all advisin me
sayin i could die tryna turn you up
theres three sides to this story girl
the one you subtweet
the one your group chat gets to read
the one you come and tell to me
i understand it finally
im tryin to give you highs and youre plannin our goodbyes
but i turn you up
its my fault
burnin cash like its lit on fire
penthouse and some new attire
i fulfilled all of your desires
you dont work but you act retired
cause you know that youre mine and its my fault
its my fault its my fault for once i take accountability
its my fault that you got superpowers on your knees
its my fault for once dont keep you grounded on your feet
its my fault for once i drain accounts to make you love me
its my fault for once its onesided loyalty
my fault for once im payin lawyer fees
doin things just to set you free see you breathe
its my fault for once i got the wagon g
got you ridin round with niggas that are nothin like me
its my fault for once thats how you make it seem
its my fault its my fault
refrain drake
you were lost until me
you were lost until me mmmm mhmmm
you were lost until me

verse 4 drake
my confidence is super low
baby m you know i got a heart of gold
you pawned that shit and hit the road baby
for goodness sakes at this rate
your funeral is finna have like ten caskets on display
one for you the other nine for everything youre takin to the grave
you dont play you dont you dont you
you dont play no games
theres three things i learned from love for free
only thing really worth chasing is a dream
people dont know you play your roles on screen
messy started gettin trendy gotta keep it clean
you know i keep it clean
clean as i can
all weapons formed against me gotta jam
brought you round the dawgs treat you like the fam
shoulda been a wham bam thank you maam
know you got my confidence on sale
case you wanna feel better bout yourself
refrain drake
you were lost until me
you were lost until me6embed"
