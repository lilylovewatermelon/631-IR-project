someone like this before
now we are all alone

a little romance girl is all thats on my mind
tonight we could fly so high
ill do all the things you like

chorus
if its all right can i
come lay next to you girl
if its okay can i play
and climb into your world
i know its late but i cant wait
i need to feel you now
this is my love dream
