born of evil in a fiery volcano
on a mutilated mission to inflict
merciless pain
sacrifice your soul to the deity of death
shes concocted your murder
and youve lost all your defense

he was summoned by the
ancient wizards
to carry demon children in the
poisonous flood

the prophecy was written
on the scrotum of a wizard
in his testicle blood
