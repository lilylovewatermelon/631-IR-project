walking on a dream
how can i explain
talking to myself
will i see again

prechorus
we are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
on and on and on we are calling out out again
never looking down im just in awe of whats in front of me

chorus
is it real now
two people become one
i can feel it
two people become one

verse 2
thought id never see
the love you found in me
now its changing all the time
living in a rhythm where the minutes working over time

prechorus
we are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
on and on and on we are calling out out again
never looking down im just in awe of whats in front of me
