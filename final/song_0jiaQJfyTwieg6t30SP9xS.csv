tell me whats wrong with me
my body face my hair
tell me all my many faults
tell me like you care
when we both know youre cruel
and we both know youre right
i could listen to you like a fool all night

whats wrong with me
how i speak
how i dress
whats wrong with me

you keep me guessing
mama called me beautiful
dont believe her anymore

now im listening to you
what do i do that for
please dont ignore me
mmh mmh

tell me who we hate today
and i will fall in line
hug me while my shoulders tense
and well pretend were fine
you might also likethough we both know one day
therell be blood on the floor
but which one will betray the other more
whats wrong with me
where is my mind
where does it end
maybe i need to find a better friend

whats wrong with me
what can i do
whats wrong with me
could it be you
its probably me
see that you see
whats wrong with me
mmh mmh3embed"
