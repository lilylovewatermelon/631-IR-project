well i love her
but i love to fish
i spend all day out on this lake
and hell is all i catch
but today she met me at the door
said i would have to choose
if i hit that fishing hole today
shed be packing all her things
and shed be gone by noon

chorus
well im gonna miss her
when i get home
but right now im on this lakeshore
and im sitting in the sun
im sure itll hit me
when i walk through that door tonight
yeah im going miss her
oh look there ive got a bite

instrumental break

now theres a chance that if i hurry
i could beg her to stay
but that waters right
and the weathers perfect
no telling what i might catch today

so im gonna miss her
when i get home
but right now im on this lakeshore
and im sitting in the sun
im sure itll hit me
when i walk through that door tonight

oh look there ive got a bite3embed"
