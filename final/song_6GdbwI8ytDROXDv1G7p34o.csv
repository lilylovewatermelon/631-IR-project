theres a hole in your heart begging for adventure
play yourself a new track set traps for the future

prechorus
on your own
can you do it
the unknown
can you face it

chorus
shifting desire
shifting desire
shifting desire

verse 2
rules of conformity heavy clouds of reason
theyre hiding the beauty of your free distortions

prechorus
on your own
can you do it
the unknown
can you face it
with your soul now you see it
the landscape is infinite
