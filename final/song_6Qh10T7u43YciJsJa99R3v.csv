verse 1
some girls wont dance to the beat of the track
she wont walk away but she wont look back
she looks good but her boyfriend says shes a mess
shes a mess shes a mess
now the girl is stressed
shes a mess shes a mess
shes a mess shes a mess
tell em girls

chorus
baby loves to dance in the dark
cause when hes lookin she falls apart
baby loves to dance in the dark
tell em girls
baby loves to dance in the dark
cause when hes lookin she falls apart
baby loves to dance loves to dance in the dark
