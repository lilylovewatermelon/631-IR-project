to the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
to the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
we toss and turn but dont sleep
each breath we take makes us thieves
like causes without rebels
just talk but promise nothing else

chorus
we crawl on our knees for you
under a sky no longer blue
we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through
cause sometimes dreams just dont come true
we wait to reap what we are due

verse 2
to the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
and the blare of the sirens combing the streets
chased down like dogs we run from
your grasp until the sun comes up

chorus
we crawl on our knees for you
under a sky no longer blue
we sweat all day long for you
but we sow seeds to see us through
cause sometimes dreams just dont come true
look now at what theyve done to you
you might also likepostchorus
white needles buried in the red
the engine roars and then it gives
but never dies
cause we dont live
we just survive
on the scraps that you throw away

bridge
i wont crawl on my knees for you
i wont believe the lies that hide the truth
i wont sweat one more drop for you
cause we are the rust upon your gears
we are the insect in your ears
we crawl
we crawl
we crawl
all over you

chorus
we sow the seeds to see us through
our days are precious and so few
we all reap what we are due
under this sky no longer blue
we bring the dawn long overdue
outro
we crawl
we crawl
we crawl
all over you7embed"
