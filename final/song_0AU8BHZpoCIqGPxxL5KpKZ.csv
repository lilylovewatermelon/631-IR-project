oh dear mother i love you
im sorry i wasnt good enough
dear father forgive me
cause in your eyes i just never added up

prechorus
in my heart i know i failed you
but you left me here alone

chorus
if i could hold back the rain would you numb the pain
cause i remember everything
if i could help you forget would you take my regrets
cause i remember everything

verse 2
oh dear brother just dont hate me
for never standing by you or being by your side
dear sister please dont blame me
i only did what i thought was truly right

prechorus
its a long and lonely road
when you know you walk alone
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likechorus
if i could hold back the rain would you numb the pain
cause i remember everything
if i could help you forget would you take my regrets
cause i remember everything

bridge
i feel like running away
im still so far from home
you say that ill never change
but what the fuck do you know
ill burn it all to the ground before i let you in
please forgive me i cant forgive you now
i remember everything

chorus
if i could hold back the rain would you numb the pain
cause i remember everything
if i could help you forget would you take my regrets
cause i remember everything

outro
it all went by so fast
i still cant change the past
i always will remember everything
if we could start again
would that have changed the end
we remember everything
