hey i think you got my number
when i was out with my brother you said hi
and i think i liked you
oh we talked about maybe getting together
a rain check on the weather cloudy skies
then i had to get home
oh those eyes i thought you were a really nice guy
i thought you were just my type but i forgot your name

im a blonde i get crazy
and everybody knows were a little more fun
i like to play it off like im dumb

cause im a blonde
