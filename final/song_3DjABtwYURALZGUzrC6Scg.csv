styles keep achanging the worlds rearranging
but edna youre timeless to me
hemlines are shorter a beer costs a quarter
but time cannot take what comes free

youre like a stinky old cheese babe
just getting riper with age
youre like the fatal disease babe
but theres no cure so let this fever rage

some folks cant stand it say time is a bandit
but i take the opposite view
cause when i need a lift time brings a gift
another day with you

a twist or a waltz its all the same schmaltz
with just a change in the scenery
youll never be old hat thats that
youre timeless to me

edna
oh wilbur i love you

fads keep afading castros invading
but wilbur youre timeless to me
hairdos are higher mine feels like barbed wire
but you say im chic as can be
you might also likeyoure like a rare vintage ripple
a vintage theyll never forget
so pour me a teeny weenie triple
and we can toast the fact we aint dead yet

i cant stop eating your hairlines receding
and soon youll have nothing at all
so youll wear a wig while i roast a pig
hey pass that geritol
glenn miller had brass that chubby checkers at gas
but they all pass eventually
youll never be passé hip hooray
youre timeless to me

wilbur
youre like a broken down chevy

edna
all i need is a fresh coat of paint

wilbur
and edna you got me going hot and heavy
youre fat and old baby boring you aint

together
some folks dont get it but we never fret it
cause we know that time is our friend
yeah its plain to see that youre stuck with me
until the bitter end
and we got a kid whos blowing the lid
off the turnblad family tree

edna
youll always hit the spot big shot
youre timeless to me

wilbur
youll always be du jour mon amor
youre timeless to me

edna
youll always be first string

wilbur
ring a ding ding

together
youre timeless to me

edna
youre timeless to me

wilbur
youre timeless to me
together
youre timeless to meembed"
