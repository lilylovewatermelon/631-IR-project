well that big red sun was sinkin slow
that rising had a haunting glow
i could see those heat waves rising off the ground
we were sittinon go at that old stop sign
headlights shinin on the county line
it was do or die had to get out of that town
well honey you said run
we were so young

hook
tryin to set the world on fire
turn the key and spark the wire
chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
the future was an open road
gone in a cloud of smoke
leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
just you and me girl settin the world on fire

verse 2
yeah we were settin the world on fire
we were blazin down the road like kerouac
no time to stop and cover our tracks
we were too damn hot for any one town to hold
yeah we burned through a few good years
then you started looking back in that rear view mirror
right outside of reno the trail got cold
you said youd had enough of this ramblin love
see jake owen liveget tickets as low as 138you might also likehook
tryin to set the world on fire
turn the key and spark the wire
chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
the future was an open road
gone in a cloud of smoke
leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
just you and me girl settin the world on fire
yeah we were settin the world on fire

bridge
pullin on a lucky strike bout to head west
ridin off into gods sunset
its times like this a always think of you
but honey you know me ill always be

hook
tryin to set the world on fire
turn the key and spark the wire
chasin down a feelin runnin on desire
the future was an open road
gone in a cloud of smoke
leavin a trail of flames behind those tires
just you and me girl settin the world on fire

outro
im settin the world on fire
yeah im settin the world on fire1embed"
