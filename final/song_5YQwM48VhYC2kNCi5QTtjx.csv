welcome home
while away
they have tampered with the locks
and your things they rearranged

we propose a better way
said the note they left behind
in their wake of disarray
you fell in place

dont fall asleep
theyll find us here
i know a place to disappear
as a voice proclaimed

chorus
what we are is the sum of a thousand lies
what we know is almost nothing at all
but we are what we are till the day we die
or till we dont have the strength to go on
till we dont have the strength to go on

verse 2
let us cry
let us be
let us open up our hearts
without fear of anything
you might also likefaith alone
is all we need
to traverse this burning bridge
now before it gets too late you claim its fine

but the heart reveals
what smiles betray
your sad sad eyes gave you away
and dont you know

chorus
what we are is the sum of a thousand lies
what we know is almost nothing at all
but we are what we are till the day we die
or till we dont have the strength to go on
till we dont have the strength to go on

bridge
our shoulders bear an awful weight
but still we trudge on just the same
our colors run then leave a stain
they blacken our once honest name
but how can we argue tell me
over the fury and the fire
how many times can we tell you that we
are not like you we see right through
your poor disguise that fails to fool
the wary eye thats trained on you
chorus
what we are is the sum of a thousand lies
what we know is almost nothing at all
but we are what we are till the day we die
or till we dont have the strength to go on
till we dont have the strength to go on

what we are is the sum of a thousand lies
what we know is almost nothing at all
but we are what we are till the day we die
or till we dont have the strength to go on
till we dont have the strength to go on

yeah we dont have the strength to go on5embed"
