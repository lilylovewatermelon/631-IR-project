this wont break your heart but i just think it could
cause i havent tried as hard as i should
to separate you from everything i do
but i would never want to come between us two

chorus
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me

verse 2
now im thinking back to what i said before
i hope your heart wont have to hurt anymore
cause its really not that sad from here
because the moments i can feel you near

prechorus
they keep you close to me my dear
and if they ever become too clear

chorus
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
you might also likebridge
now youve gone away dont worry its okay
that youre gone away
now youve gone away further than yesterday
but youll never leave these scenes my mind replays

chorus
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me

outro
ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
where in the world have you gone now
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
where in the world have you gone now

ill keep your memory vague so you wont feel bad about me
where in the world have you gone now
ill say the things that you said sometimes so it reminds me
where in the world have you gone nowembed"
