more fragile than life
and easier to destroy
and faster to dissolve
and cheaper to avoid
and riskier to control
and not so forgiving
more fragile than life
is living

verse 2
more fragile than time
and tougher to tell
and simpler to kill
oh and deeper to dwell
and quicker to plash
when both hands are climbing
more fragile than time
is timing

verse 3
more fragile than you
and sweeter inside
and sadder to leave
oh unidentified
and sooner to fade
and harder to trust
more fragile than you
