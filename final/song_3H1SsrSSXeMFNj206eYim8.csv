woman thats what i believe got him reelected
is the people knew that you could believe what he says
george w bush our country is strong 
yet we go forward to defend freedom
and all that is good and just in our world

verse 1
all my devotion betrayed
i am no longer afraid
i was too blinded to see
how much youve stolen from me

you want to know why
i feel so horrified
ive left my innocence die
you want to know why
i cant be pacified
you made me bury something
i wont be sleeping tonight

prechorus
i only wanted a blessing made
now ive been labeled a renegade
it seems so clear now what i must do
youre no immortal—i wont let them
chorus
deify you
they view you as the new messiah
deify you
renew belief in some demented man

verse 2
you want to know why
it seems the passions died
weve all been living this lie
you want to know why
my wills been fortified
you made me hunger again
good luck sleeping tonight

prechorus
i only wanted a blessing made
now ive been labeled a renegade”
it seems so clear now what i must do
youre no immortal—i wont let them

chorus
deify you
they view you as the new messiah
deify you
renew belief in some demented man

how much youve stolen from me
all my devotion betrayed
i am no longer afraid
i was too blinded to see
how much youve stolen from me
