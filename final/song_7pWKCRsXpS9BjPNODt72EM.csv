well debbie thinks this is all about her biological clock
and i
she stopped screaming long enough to tell you that
huh no no no no no the other debbie
debbie the teacher
oh you mean  black debbie
whoa whoa whoa whoa why is she black debbie
no not in a bad way
its just to tell them apart because shes black

verse mf doom
trueâ€”doom rolled on through with a whole crew
that stole owning for holding old brew who told you
even if its crap mind your own business
they raps aint got no gift like a lonely christmas
real phony with beats thats hardly fresh
how they manage to deal is anybodys guess
yours is as good as mine shes sure fine
from the hood where you squeeze your nine
off the free cheese line
all you saw was a ho do a bees line
to where she stood and sipped the nehi grape the sweet kind
circle you thicker by design
behind swingin like bring it back come rewind
uhh excuse me boo
she stuck out her tongue it was purple number two
fda approved played it smoother than a durag
what a brother gotta do to get a taste a some of you
bagged and he dont mean coach
then she saw the mask acted like she seen a roach
the mirror shine reflect colors like your cds
show love to others we all brothers like the bee gees
all except the broads and you
hold your applause they break gods laws
and who pays the taxpayer thats who
catch a rapper by his toe and smack off his tattoos
thats gonna leave a bruise
leave em grievin blues like believin in evenin news
they must be eatin glue
heave it all back and we even steven sue
sprinkle lyrics like seasoning beef stew
and sneezin all in it after breathin in the flu
get a clue his reasonin is askew
as to all the feverin and heavin up goo
either that or dude
leave your girl around this man whore and shes too screwed
just in case shes in a what you wanna do mood
bring your plate to the metal face and get your food chewed
tastes like chicken
he wastes no time like the bassline kickin in
or like a lace eye with you through thick and thin
raw humor face pie to a frickin chin
new yorkn a hell of a finer town
choose your words wisely from the boogie down to chinatown
or be found with a hole in your designer gown
in the role of public opinion it earned a minor frown
if you think youre slick you might can whisper uh
as a few good men set sights to link with your chick
you have to find a new hen fight to drink your liq
ten years later see how enzytell shrink your wallet
as you wallow in a sorrow pit
cheers is that your beer kid then swallow it
or get chased by the sandman on some apollo
flow so weird his own peers couldnt follow it
on the phone he sounded like a real paid whoa whoa whoa
then we met in person he was three shades blacker
thats why he say money over ball and chain dames
we all the same no callin names
you might also likeoutro stormy  quinn
im as smart as him
what i got phds in four scientific disciplines
really why do you think they call me dr quinn
um i just thought that was a nickname
you know like dr dre eastside3embed"
