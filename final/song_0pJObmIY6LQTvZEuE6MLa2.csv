i still feel your kisses in the morning
even though youre not around
maybe i should take it as a warning
that my secrets finally out

and you know that i know that you know just how i feel
and i know that you know that i know this things for real
we lay low but it never feels boring
cause my heart is racing for you

thats all i wanna do do do
i know you want it too too too
its perfect cause theres never any pressure

verse 2
funny how you get me so excited
when were doin nothing at all
simple as a movie at the drivein
or a good long distance call

prechorus 2
but you know that i know that you know just how i feel
and i know that you know that i know this things for real
lets speed off right into the horizon
or just close our eyes and fall
