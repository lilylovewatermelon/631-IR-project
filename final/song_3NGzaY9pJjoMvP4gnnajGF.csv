saw my first pistol in the general store
in the general store when i was thirteen
thought it was the finest thing i ever had seen
i asked if i could have one when i grew up
mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
she really blew up and i didnt understand
mama said the pistol is the devils right hand

she really blew up and i didnt understand
mama said the pistol is the devils right hand
the devils right hand the devils right hand
mama said the pistol is the devils right hand

my very first pistol was a capandball colt
shoot as fast as lightnin but it loads a mite slow
it loads a mite slow and i soon found out
it can get you into trouble but it cant get you out
then i went and bought myself a colt 45
called a peacemaker but i didnt know why
i never knew why and i didnt understand
cause mama said the pistol is the devils right hand

i never knew why i didnt understand
mama said the pistol is the devils right hand
the devils right hand the devils right hand
mama said the pistol is the devils right hand
you might also likei got into a card game in a company town
caught a miner cheating and i shot the dog down
shot the dog down watched the dog fall
never touched his holster never had a chance to draw
the trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
asked me how i pleaded not guilty i said
not guilty i said youve got the wrong man
nothing touched the trigger but the devils right hand

not guilty i said youve got the wrong man
nothing touched the trigger but the devils right hand
the devils right hand the devils right hand
nothing touched the trigger but the devils right handembed"
