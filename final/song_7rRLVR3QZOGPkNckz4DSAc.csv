so make it real
just make it real

verse 1
thats not the reason to fire me
that aint no real reason
its funny things just cheapen when we disagree
if things got any worse then cheap would turn free

chorus 1
calico cats and calico dreams
that aint too real
just make it real
calico cats and calico dreams
that aint too real
just make it real real

verse 2
feel all the seasons flood through you and me
and see what trouble shes in shes in
but thats not a reason to fire me
that aint no real reason

chorus 2
calico cats and calico dreams
that aint too real
just make it real
collisions hurt and abrasions bleed
its hard to deal when all you do is feel
campfires swell into monstrous things
that summer heat thats winter deep thats winter deep
see alien ant farm liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likebridge
and all your wild winds
they couldnt stop me from flying

so

so make it real
just make it real

chorus 2
calico cats and calico dreams
that aint too real
just make it real
collisions hurt and abrasions bleed
its hard to deal when all you do is feel
campfires swell into monstrous things
that summer heat thats winter deep thats winter deep

calico cats and calico dreams
that aint too real
just make it real
just make it real just make it just make it1embed"
