yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
yeah things like this aint built to last
i might just fade like those before me
when will you forget my past
got questions ask you know the stories
and you need to let me know
when youre leaving where you go
can i come
do you believe me are you close
yeah even if you dont
thatll get you sprung

chorus
do i do i do i love
can i can i can i get enough

verse 2
yeah dont run away love
hate love heartbreak will have you bankrupt
too many days in a daze better wake up
i put your face in a place where the space was
nobody makes you feel like you but do i
and you dont know what you should do
you just lookin for someone to make you move ooh tell me do i
i make this planet feel like home
its us versus time the door is closing
so far beyond all our control
you saved a soul so close to broken
its so much better when you wait
forever and a day thats all i got
put it together then it break
all the energy it take it never stop

yeah i never slip i never fall
i tried to tell you bout a better life
and get involved big or small
its been my fault i keep it safe its in the vault
blindfolded keep it going til we hit a wall yeah
im never going through the motions
im just tryna lay your body down slowly
we can only go up
we can only go up
