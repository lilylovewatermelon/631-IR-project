lights out youre talking too loud
so just shut your mouth who the fuck are you now
lights out can you feel it now
were calling you out who the fuck are you now

verse 1 jdog
lifestyles of the young and the reckless
checked in the real world that dont ask questions
dodging em bullets like a fucked up western
drag you on a rope till youre choked out senseless
kings are crowned were the best around
got an underground army yeah we holding it down
we built our base and what we found
it takes blood and sweat and always moving a crowd
no skill when youve gone the fast lane
let me see you dance run from the ak
bullshit now hes droppin names
who you know what you do it all sounds the same
a piece of advice quit droppin mine
youll be gone way before it even is your time
like a stripper in a cage making minimum wage
youll be gone like a dollar bill hitting the stage

chorus danny
lights out youre talking too loud
so just shut your mouth who the fuck are you now
lights out can you feel it now
were calling you out who the fuck are you now

ima light your ass up cause you aint got what it takes
your crews riding my nuts theyll tell you how my dick tastes
yeah im shitfaced in all black looking creepy
its charlie scene this shit is way too easy
ima give it you quick going straight to your throat
or put the burner in your mouth and turn you into a ghost
all these people making music with nothing to show
who doesnt have a band shit i dont know
what kind of sane person drops his own name
what kind of sane person boos his own band offstage
what kind of sane person drops a verse like this
these damn meds aint working im just too damn sick
just you coming out here has got me provoked
now ima cut your ass up like a line of coke
ima roll your crew up like a fat ass roach
and put you in my ashtray cause you just got smoked

chorus danny
lights out youre talking too loud
so just shut your mouth who the fuck are you now
lights out can you feel it now
were calling you out who the fuck are you now

bridge danny  funny man

and its true youre dead wrongits lights out your last song
the world has turned its face youll never learn
and its true youre dead wrong
its lights out your last song
walls closing in theyre falling down
chorus danny
lights out youre talking too loud
so just shut your mouth who the fuck are you now
lights out can you feel it now

lights out youre talking too loud
who the fuck are you now who the fuck are you now
