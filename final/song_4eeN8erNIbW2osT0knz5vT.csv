they say
george washingtons yielding his power and stepping away
‘zat true
i wasnt aware that was something a person could do
im perplexed
are they gonna keep on replacing whoevers in charge
if so whos next
theres nobody else in their country who looms quite as large…
a sentinel whispers in king georges ear

john adams
i know him
that cant be
thats that little guy who spoke to me
all those years ago
what was it eightyfive
that poor man theyre gonna eat him alive
oceans rise
empires fall
next to washington they all look small
all alone
watch them run
they will tear each other into pieces
jesus christ this will be fun
