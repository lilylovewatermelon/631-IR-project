squat made the beat
go grizz
winners circle

chorus
been through some situations and so many problems
them different altercations i still think bout the bottom
on the road to greatness i wonder how come
i got frowns from people i wanted smiles from
just be proud of me
i just want you to be proud of me yeah
how come you dont look so proud of me
i just want you to be proud of me yeah

verse 1
hey be proud of me be proud for me
i know deja and raniya lookin down on me
feel like david and goliath how you frowned on me
how you get to the last round and give out on me
how you get to the last round and start doubting me
i kept it real from the jump you cant vouch for me
i kept it real from the jump you switched out on me
you switched out on me guess thats how it be
guess thats how it is in the life that we live
couldnt even wait your turn so you burnt your bridge
guess you live and you learn in the life we live
but you was posed to be here with me in this f550
