cause theres always a flaw in the diamond
a lightningfork crack in the pearl
a fault in the rock of the island
and its usually shaped like a girl girl

jeff bhasker
leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
nine exits north of las vegas vegas
nine exits north of las vegas vegas
nine exits north of las vegas

jeff bhasker
i was the first one to see her
and you were the first one to fall
like a halfdrunken downhill skier
and she was the oncoming wall
now i get that its all gone awry
a joke i might like to take back
wipe a bright star from the night sky
nothing can fill in the blackyou might also likeembed"
