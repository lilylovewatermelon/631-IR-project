verse
okay lost in my thoughts it feel like i done went crazy
soon as he got famous the walls started cavin
aint nowhere to hide a piece of mind what he chasin
its pain is his eyes its who he is had to face it yeah
hurt me to find out that fame shit really some lame shit
i tried to remain with the ones i came with
i stay away from niggas i know that they hatin
they wanna trade places yeah
cause i got these vultures at my neck and all these hoes want my check
every night im on the edge and i can barely get no rest
no i cant get no sleep i see death when i dream
aint no one to blame but his self yeahyeah
dont want no more fame im cool
it might be strange to you might be insane to you
but soon

prechorus
the music starts fadin and the lights will go down
