in their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
that you love it here youve got to stay
on this rock not a rock an island
on which you found a lover then you twitch
you felt that itch in your petticoat
your pretty pretty petticoat
then you smiled he got wild
you didnt understand that theres money to be made
beauty is a card that must get played
by organisations

chorus
well ooh la she was such a good girl to me
and ooh la the world just chewed her up and spat her out
and ooh la she was such a good girl to me
and ooh la the world just chewed her up and spat her out

verse 2
the world can be a very big place
so be yourself dont feel out of place
love your man and love him twice
go to hollywood and pay the price
oh go to hollywood
and dont be a star its such a drag
take care of yourself dont begin to lag
its a hard life to live so live it well
ill be your friend and not to pretend i know you girl
in all situations
