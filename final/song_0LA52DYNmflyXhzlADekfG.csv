yeah getting it in from here to china
yo
aight let me just kill this right now quickly

verse 1
super trippy riding through the gritty inner city
roll with the committee handle your business or handle the pity
all i see is arse and titties
and a bunch of hippie chicks thats ready to show me tricks
theyre doing the splits im all up in the mix
a choir out the mist im taking trips
im in a ferrari looking sick
im in a ferrari looking slick and letting the engine rip
and gettin the tyre agrippin aslippin and slidin
turning the music up im vibing
now im flying lord strike me if im lying
i aint perfect but im trying
going super saiyan buying anything that catches my eye
cause im a provider getting it in from here to china
its so minor im a survivor never retire
im a black tiger im ready to blaze the fire live wire
now im rolling through the shires
blazing the green to get me higher
now im inspired putting the pressure on the back tyres
making a hasty get away
having a better day in every way than yesterday
i guess thereâ€™s nothing left to say

verse 2
yo yo
wind in my face chilling in versace shades
wearing a fresh pair of gaze looking like ive just been paid
stupid i dont play no games switching out lanes on these lames
switching out dames simple and plain no i cant be contained
plus im raw and untamed im so far from mundane
getting ghost is my aim i suggest you do the same
taking a trip out to spain with my girl mary jane
and she stays on my brain lifes a big gravy train
paparazzi on my case giving chase
cameras flashing in my face
all up in my space gotta pick up the pace
singing amazing grace
im in an amazing place with crazy peeps
i aint like them other lazy apes i used to blaze the tapes
so now i stay hoping for my break making no mistakes
now im rolling with the breaks
but still book time for my original mates
so we dont bubble with hate we just get on with it
you brothers are constipated and your shit is overrated
you should save it
chorus
getting it in from here to china getting it in from here to china
