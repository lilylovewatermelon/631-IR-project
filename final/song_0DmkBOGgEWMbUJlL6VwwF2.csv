ooh
id been consumed
im not for sale
man what the hell

and this aint gon last me forever

prechorus
all that i can be is me and all me
time to get out i dont want you around
all that i can see is you without me
no i cant scold you however

chorus
i tried to play pretend oh
try not to see the end ah
but i couldnt see you the way you saw me
