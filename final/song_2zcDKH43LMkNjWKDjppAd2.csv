alright

verse 1
i laid down i drank the poison and then i passed the fuck out
now let me tell you bout the good life
i have a million different kinds of fun
when im asleep and in a dream that im your only one

chorus
can we create something beautiful and destroy it destroy it
nobody knows i dream about it bout it
this is my imagination

verse 2
if you come over tonight we can travel through time
we can sleep on the ceiling and creep under black lights
i have a million different girls that hide
under my bed and when i let them out they treat me right
oh what a waste of a perfectly good clean wrist
you were screaming til the police came

chorus
can we create something beautiful and destroy it destroy it
nobody knows i dream about it bout it
this is my imagination
if every living thing dies alone
what am i doing here
if every living thing dies alone
what am i doing here
oh fuck it
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
if its the end of the world
if its the end of the world
you and me should spend the rest of it in love

chorus
can we create something beautiful and destroy it destroy it
nobody knows i dream about it bout it
this is my imagination
if every living thing dies alone
what am i doing here
if every living thing dies alone
what am i doing here
what am i doing here oh no38embed"
