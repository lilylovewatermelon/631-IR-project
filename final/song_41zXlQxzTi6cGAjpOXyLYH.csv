dont be that way
fall apart twice a day
i just wish you could feel what you say
show never tell
but i know you too well
got a mood that you wish you could sell

chorus
if teardrops could be bottled
thered be swimming pools filled by models
told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
if i love you was a promise
would you break it if youre honest
tell the mirror what you know shes heard before
i dont wanna be you
anymore

verse 2
hands getting cold
losing feeling is getting old
was i made from a broken mold
hurt i cant shake
weve made every mistake
only you know the way that i break
you might also likechorus
if teardrops could be bottled
thered be swimming pools filled by models
told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
if i love you was a promise
would you break it if youre honest
tell the mirror what you know shes heard before
i dont wanna be you
i dont wanna be you
i dont wanna be you
