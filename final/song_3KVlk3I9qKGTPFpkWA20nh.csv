i dont know whos living in my body
cause i dont recognize a thing about it
that dont even matter im just glad i got into the party
so i can feel your music in my body
cause you the only out of everybody
who can deal with all my ways
i know i got some ways
but you control the flame
so i just wanna stay right here with you

prechorus
it could be a room full of people you still my sight
look at how the whole world is searchin but i got mine
its emotional uncontrollable all i think about is you
so if the tears wanna flood my gates

chorus
let the water flow
just let it fall out from my face
cause i never thought id ever hear me say
i just cant breathe without my baby
ooh you my baby
so come and kiss up on me
as we dance close
come and kiss up on me slow
as we dance close

i dont even really care who knows it
just keep me there keep me in the moment
seen a lot of things but i never seen my spirit glowin
the way you do me got me outta body
cause you the only out of everybody
who gon go out of the way to show me all the ways
come control the flame
i just wanna stay right here with you

prechorus
it could be a room full of people you still my sight
look at how the whole world is searchin but i got mine
its emotional uncontrollable all i think about is you
so if the tears wanna flood my gates

chorus
let the water flow
just let it fall out out from my face
i never thought id ever hear me say
i just cant breathe without my baby
ooh come here baby
so you can kiss up on me
as we dance close
