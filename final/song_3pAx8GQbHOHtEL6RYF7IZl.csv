oh yeah
alright alright alright
alright alright

verse 1
weve been chillin together for a while
and im findin it hard to figure you out
see cause i cant tell if you wanna be my girl
or just cool
first you catch an attitude when my phone goes off
sometimes you act like you dont care at all
things that you say and do leaves me so confused
when you know im feelin you

hook
wont you quit playin baby
why you gone front
wont you just say it
say what you really want
if you aint wit it just stop
leadin me ohohon

verse 2
i dont mean to pressure you baby
but you really need to make up your mind
let me know what you really want and stop wastin
wastin my time
cause on the real real
i could be out and find someone whos down with what im about
instead im waitin on you to decide if im
the one that you want in your life
