in a small corner bar he sits there adrinkin
lost as a ball in a field full of corn
further away than he ever imagined
that hed ever end up from the place he was born
now no more forlorn has a creeker drank whiskey
than the one that you see out the side of your eye
drinkin alone as he looks out the window
at all of the strangers on the corner outside

chorus
and hed rather be dead than alive one more minute
in this godforsaken town
when he was a kid lord hed never adreamt it
all the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

verse 2
now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
and he knew not the how nor the reason for why
you could ever wake up and wanna keep on alivin
in a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find
and for everyone you meet theres a whole mess of people
tryin like hell to pull you on down
to the level theyre on and the trouble theyre tendin
in the mess that theyve made in the gutter they found
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
and hed rather be dead than alive one more minute
in this godforsaken town
when he was a kid lord hed never adreamt it
all the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

some fellas do drugs and things of that nature
some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
some fellas get by on practically nothin
some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

chorus
and theyd rather be dead than alive one more minute
in this godforsaken town
when they were all kids lord theyd never adreamt it
all the ways that the city can bring a country boy downembed"
