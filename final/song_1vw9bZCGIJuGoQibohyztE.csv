damn its been
something
like three years since we came to amends
goodness i
didnt realize
its been that long
but anyways
so good to
hear that youve
moved on and found somebody new
so have i
but still baby
something is wrong

bridge
you dont have
to answer this
if its too personal
dont worry bout it
do your thoughts
of me ever
become sexual
do i ever cross your mind
ever reminisce on us
on the bathroom floor
or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink
cause lately whats been happening
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus
is when im with my girl i call your name
and it just aint right
that ill be sexin her and i i call your name
and it just aint right
girl it aint no little thing that i i call your name
and it just aint right
do you ever do the same cause i i call your name
and it just aint right

verse 2
needless to
say to you
me and my girl are almost through
seems that she
thinks that im not over us
thats crazy aint it
but anyway
just called to see
if you was experiencin the same as me
cause if so
we got some things to discuss

bridge
you dont have
to answer this
if its too personal

verse 3
tell me the truth
could we still be in love could we be in love
think of you
though that i know it aint right
said do you think of me
when you lay with him at night
its not that im lonely baby
but i just cant help myself
i dont know if im still in love with you girl
but when im laying with her girl i call your name

chorus
when im with my girl i call your name
and it just aint right
that ill be sexin her and i i call your name
and it just aint right
girl it aint no little thing that i i call your name
and it just aint right
do you ever do the same i call your name
and it just aint right
outro

i call your name and it just aint rightembed"
