she dont even know exactly where she wants to go
is that a double negative oh never mind lets go
to the next line of the story
i met her at the smoothie king she said seattles best
she may be right think i remember coffee on her breath
she smoked cigarettes i chewed bubble gum

prechorus
i know i shouldnt take it but i think i kinda like it
when she tells me that im dumb
and this may sound pathetic but i think that we can make it
well go on and on and on and on

chorus
love songs suck and fairy tales arent true
and happy ending hollywood is not for me and you
so add it up and break it down its not that hard to figure out
youre crazy and im crazy about you

verse 2
everyone around me says she brings a brother down
and mommy thinks shes great but then again shes not around
to see her throw a fit borderlining conniption
and all this only matters if we listen anyway
and shes all i can think about so i must not be gay
im her lunatic yeah and shes my psychopath
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus
i know i shouldnt take it but i think i kinda like it
when she tells me that im dumb
and this may sound pathetic but i think that we can make it
well go on and on and on and on

chorus
love songs suck and fairy tales arent true
and happy ending hollywood is not for me and you
so add it up and break it down its not that hard to figure out
youre crazy and im crazy about you

bridge
and we are the lucky ones
well get matching tshirts airbrushed at the mall
hang out at the pretzel stand and make fun of people
and laugh if someone falls
watch everyone else hold hands and try so hard
and maybe well start to see
that you and me were not so crazy
michael bolton never liked him
celine dion sold out show in vegas
air supply and nowâ€¦ me

chorus 2
love songs suck and fairy tales arent true
love songs make me sick cause theyre not true
and happy ending hollywood is not for me and you
hollywood california
so add it up and break it down its not that hard to figure out
youre crazy and im crazy about you
outro
love songs make me sick cause theyre not true
youre crazy and im crazy about you
crazy cause im crazy about you
youre crazy and im crazy about you yeahembed"
