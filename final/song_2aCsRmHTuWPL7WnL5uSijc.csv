forget your problems lay it down they start up
the innocence of what you are is what i want
ive ran my colors dripped down and drained out
tried a million things but my hearts been shot
i hope you try to find me im all spun and pacing
i know what you want to say here so say it
forget the words im speaking just want to rearrange
so ill just say it

chorus

i really miss you miss you i said
smile at the chance just to see you again
i really miss you miss you i said
yeah yeah yeah

instrumental postchorus

verse 2
heat stroke deaths like the wrong things that i think are right
i never knew that i could go as far as this
i took a problem recently forgotten
i know who i had been before i slipped
oh i want to change it i will live a life
that makes you smile when im done here and long gone
feverish and peaking just want to see your face
oh what you say what you say
you might also likechorus
ooh yeah
i really miss you miss you i said
smile at the chance just to see you again
i really miss you miss you i said
just look at me now before i walk away
you just might miss me miss me one day
yeah yeah yeah
