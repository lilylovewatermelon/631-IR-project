i settled down a twistedup frown
disguised as a smile well
you wouldve never known
i had it all but not what i wanted
cause hope for me was a place uncharted
and overgrown

prechorus
youd make your way in
id resist you just like this
you cant tell me to feel
the truth never set me free so i did it myself
chorus
you cant be too careful anymore
when all that is waiting for you
wont come any closer
youve got to reach out
a little more more
more more more

verse 2
open your eyes like i opened mine
its only the real world
a life you will never know
shifting your weight to throw off the pain
well you can ignore it
but only for so long
see paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also likeprechorus
you look like i did
you resist me just like this
you cant tell me to heal
and it hurts remembering how it felt to shut down
chorus
cant be too careful anymore
when all that is waiting for you
wont come any closer
youve got to reach out
a little more more
more more more

bridge
the truth never set me free
the truth never set me free
the truth never set me free so ill do it myself
chorus
you cant be too careful anymore
when all that is waiting for you
wont come any closer
youve got to reach out
cant be too careful anymore
when all that is waiting for you
wont come any closer
youve got to reach out
more more
more more more15embed"
