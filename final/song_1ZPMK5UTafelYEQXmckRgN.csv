woke up this morning like i always do
still like to think that im new
time just gets its way
strawberries left to decay
cant find my pants or my bank account
dont you slip away
voices that start to betray

chorus
even though you raised me i will never be your father
king of each and every sunset marquis
even though youre crazy you will never be a bother
youre my old man in the sea

verse 2
i still like to laugh when i make a joke
i still like to think that theres  hope
time just has its say
strawberries left to decay
struck by the sight of an empty hall
dont you fade away
voices that start to betray

chorus
even though you raised me i will never be your father
king of each and every sunset marquis
even though youre crazy you will never be a bother
youre my old man in the sea
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likebridge
the hunter gets hunted
we all get confronted
dont just slip away
voices that start to betray

chorus
even though you raised me i will never be your father
king of each and every sunset marquis
even though youre crazy you will never be a bother
youre my old man in the seaembed"
