aight man yall win
i wont say it
at least for this song
ha hey

verse 1
you say you lookin for the realest well im real as it get
rap to the nigga dealin hard who live in a jet
if its a better nigga well they aint delivered him yet
my mouth big but i got a pistol bigger than that
i live and die bout my respect so i honor the code
peep niggas who be out here flexin stuntin for hoes
and if you aint never chose to remember nuttin before
just know the game aint sumthin ya win its sumthin ya know
but if ya oughta begin again start it go
learn to shoot a pistol flip a o or hard to grow
now if you aint never heard of pimp squad before
you better ask a real nigga or a broad who know
cause you aint ready for the pros just get it outta ya brain
you in over your head and way outta your lane
id be insane to say im filthy rich and got it from caine
so will just say the niggas know if they don got it the same right

chorus
cause you know who to you know what of you know where
goin against me too unfair
cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
now you know i aint no more now then ten folk there
its you know who yeah you know what of you know where
beefin now dont you go there and if you do dont use a cap and deuces he wont care
if he choose to rule alone pimpin he wont share man
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeverse 2
i know you think you out there gettin it in
but whatcha doin i don done it once and did it again
i had a choice between runnin while livin in sin
he don settled down turn nine million to ten
i give a damn if i never sell a million again
i gotta thank you a million for just lettin me in
but now im settlin in gettin used to the view
on top wont stop till im huger than you
gon flop who me pimp ya losin your screws
what kinda dope have you been lettin niggas shoot into you
no you aint ready for the shit im introducing to you
the roof in the back of the bach aint as translucent as you
so now your nigga dressin up man do what you do
i got style pimp its more than just the suit and a shoe
its been proven im the truth stamp government seal
im what it is these other niggas just southern with deals for real

chorus
cause you know who to you know what of you know where
goin against me too unfair
cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
now you know i aint no more now then ten folk there
its you know who yeah you know what of you know where
beefin now dont you go there and if you do dont use a cap and deuces he wont care
if he choose to rule alone pimpin he wont share man1embed"
