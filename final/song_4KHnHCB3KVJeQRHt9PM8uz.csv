dating courtesy a girl is right to assume her date
will perform little acts of courtesy
which are his privilege for you
if you are smart you will allow him
to open doors and hold chairs
dont barge on ahead like a baby elephant for you
youll get attention all right
but it wont be favorable for you
it is correct to pause and let him know
you expect him to act like a gentleman
hell love it and think youre a lady for you
and in return it will flatter his masculine ego

bridge
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you i wonder if
for you i wonder if
for you for you for you

verse 1
excuse me for a second
while i bang my head against this wall
and im starting to suspect
you dont intend to do what you say at all
forgive your loyal sycophant
for leaving lipstick stains upon your shoes
you might also likechorus
for you and i wasted all my favorite melodies for you
and watched best friends turn to enemies for you
you heard i like the bad girls baby maybe thats true
for everybody else except—

refrain
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if

verse 2
excuse me miss but isnt this
your naked body in my bed
and how come it always felt like
you were taking something away
when you were giving head
and its a promise and a threat to say the fword
so be careful who you screw

chorus
for you and i used up all this latent energy for you
tell me was everything you ever said to me just for you
still thinking there was something in a girls underwear
that could change me like i was still in middle school like a fool
refrain
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if

verse 3
for you lonesome poets throwing glitter in their hair
for you doing somersaults and exploding in midair
for you but you dont ever notice or you dont care or both
and when they take off all their clothes
were they still not close enough—

refrain
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if
for you for you
for you i wonder if4embed"
