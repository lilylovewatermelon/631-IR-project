i suppose
shes supposed to be
exactly what they want her to be
so pretty and pink
necklace and ring
don’t be heard just be seen
but thats not who i am

chorus
she said i can feel i can feel too much
and i wish theyd go away go away
’cause its crushing me its crushing me

verse 2
dont you know
that you dont have a say
and the scarlet a on your neck
so pretty in red
eyes are all dead
what they havent said
gets stuck in your head
the silence is deafening
and your heart is bleeding out
but they dont care
no they never cared at all
no they never cared at all
thats not who i am

she said i can feel i can feel too much
and i wish they’d go away go away
’cause its crushing me crushing me
it’s crushing me its crushing me

bridge
she just wants to be free
take it or leave it
eyes like the sunrise colorful rainbow

chorus
she said i can feel i can feel too much
and i wish itd go away go away
cause they’re crushing me
theyre crushing me oh
i can feel i can feel too much
theyre crushing me
i can feel i can feel too much
oh theyre crushing me
i can feel i can feel

outro
crushing me
crash down on me
crash down on meembed"
