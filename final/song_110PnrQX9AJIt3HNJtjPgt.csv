go around go around go around go around
i see what your language is
separate from the sound
speak up speak up speak up speak up loud
i hear what youre saying
but don’t know what thats about

prechorus
light
i try to make way before the prophet
its my time to try to understand this all

chorus
’cause i gotta be somewhere soon
what am i doing here
waiting on someone new in my reflection
i see what i always do
some false direction
leading me away

verse 2
i know i know i know i know now
what i never knew back then hidden in the crowd
does it make a difference if i leave
they pay no attention
nicknames on a sleeve

so ill vote for my approval now

chorus
but i gotta be somewhere soon
what am i doing here
waiting on someone new in my reflection
i see what i always do
some false direction leading me away
its leading me away

try to understand this all
chorus
cause i gotta be somewhere soon
what am i doing here
waiting on someone new to show up in my reflection
cause i see what i always do
that same false direction leading me away from you

what am i doing here
waiting on someone new in my reflection

some false direction leading me away
