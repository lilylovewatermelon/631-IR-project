she put a little money into traveling
now its so slow so slow

baby went to amsterdam
four five days for the big canal
now its so slow so slow

and i was heading up north to a place that i know
eating well sleeping well
but still i was way way out of line
amsterdam was stuck in my mind

oh its some kind of stupid rule
that you cant ignore
oh its some kind of natural fact
sometimes youre just left to be alone

baby went to amsterdam
she put a little money into traveling
now its so slow so slow

baby went to amsterdam
four five days for the big canal
now its so slow so slow
you might also likeand i got to go away to a place of my own
working hard fill my time
from that day on till i hit the bed
amsterdam was stuck in my head

oh its some kind of stupid rule
that you cant ignore
oh its some kind of natural fact
sometimes youre just left to be alone

baby went to amsterdam
she put a little money into traveling
now its so slow so slow

baby went to amsterdam
four five days for the big canal
now its so slow so slow

baby went to amsterdam
she put a little money into traveling
now its so slow so slow

baby went to amsterdam
four five days for the big canal
now its so slow so slow slow2embed"
