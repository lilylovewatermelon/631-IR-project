you never know how things

verse 1
i know you got the best love that i ever had
i swear that when i look at you the time dont pass
intoxicated without a sip from a glass
infatuation was real thought we would last

prechorus
but youre gone away
thought you were gonna stay
i got deceived again
i cant believe

chorus
and now you got someone who dont treat you right treat you right
treat you right treat you right treat you right
you already know who used to treat you right treat you right
treat you right treat you right treat you right
you look for me and you know i be out of sight out of sight
out of sight out of sight out of sight
when you the one who told me to get out ya life out ya life
out ya life out ya life out ya life
thats unfortunate thats unfortunate
that you didnt believe in me
