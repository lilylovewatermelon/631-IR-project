pinch me now
youre caught in my crossfire
fell into my arms but they got tired
we were so good werent we
til it just stopped working
almost like we tore out the same page
and left a lot of room for new mistakes
you never quite let me in
when you felt cracks again

chorus 1
i stopped waving a flag

i went quiet and you went cold
guess that happened when we got older

verse 2
humor me
could taking a break be the better thing
just letting each other breathe
wont you just look at me or am i too draining

chorus 2
you spent hours awake holding back
i know im to blame for the small talk
and tiptoeing over
guess that happened when we got older

hmm hmm hmm hmm

outro
you spent hours awake holding back
i know im to blame for the small talk
and tiptoeing over
guess that happened when we got older1embed"
