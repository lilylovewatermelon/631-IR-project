how do you know where youre going
when you dont know where youve been
you hide the shame that youre not showing
and you wont let anyone in
a crowded street can be a quiet place
when youre walking alone
and now you think that youre the only
one who doesnt

hook
have to try
and you wont have to fail
if youre afraid to fly
then i guess you never will

chorus
you hide behind your walls
of maybe nevers
forgetting that theres something more
than just knowing better
your mistakes do not define you now
they tell you who youre not
youve got to live this life youre given
like its the only one youve got
you might also likeverse 2
memories have left you broken
and the scars have never healed
the emptiness in you is growing
but so little left to fill
youre scared to look back on the days before
youre too tired to move on
and now you think that youre the only one who doesnt

hook
have to try
and you wont have to fail
if youre afraid to fly
then i guess you never will

chorus
you hide behind your walls
of maybe nevers
forgetting that theres something more
than just knowing better
your mistakes do not define you now
they tell you who youre not
youve got to live this life youre given
like its the only one youve got

bridge
what would it take
to get you to say that ill try
and what would you say if
this was the last day of your life
chorus
you hide behind your walls
of maybe nevers
forgetting that theres something more
than just knowing better
your mistakes do not define you now
they tell you who youre not
youve got to live this life youre given
like its the only one youve got
you hide behind your walls
of maybe nevers
forgetting that theres something more
than just knowing better
your mistakes do not define you now
they tell you who youre not
youve got to live this life youre given
like its the only one youve gotembed"
