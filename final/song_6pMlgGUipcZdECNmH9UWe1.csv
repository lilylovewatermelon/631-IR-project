go ahead and make your money off a poor boy just like me
and ill be pacin in my room tonight tryna make some old scars bleed
tryna write a plotline that you dont already know
bout the weekend crowd or a reckless boy or a girl from ohio

verse 2
they tell me i can sell my soul for a dream and a couple of shows
i dont think they understand how deep loyalty goes
for some boys i got in a barn we built out of pure douglas fir
badly written songs next to horses shit is what an okie boy prefers

chorus
go on and tell me what you wanna
while me and mine do what we’re gonna
you can keep your name and burn the cash
tell em i died singin in these hills if they ask

verse 3
i feel ive lived a thousand lives just to get right where i am
some hurtful words and some pabst on ice turned a child into a man
we started this thing grinnin boys i think weve gotta run
the radio man came to fuck it up as he boasts about number ones

chorus
go on and tell me what you wanna
as me and mine do what we’re gonna
you can keep your name and burn the cash
tell em i died singin in these hills if they ask
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeoutro
go ahead and make your money off a poor boy just like me
and ill be pacin in my room tonight tryna make some old scars bleed
tryna write a plotline that you dont already know
bout the weekend crowd or a reckless boy or a girl from ohioembed"
