love

verse 1
every soul
comes to this earth
carried on angels wings
to human birth
born of love
or born of hate
each one is heaven sent
to human fate

chorus
dream little girl dream
dream little boy dream
dreamx2

verse 2
in joy and pain
each born will grow
for wisdom is so much more
than what we know
and every child
will find their way
of living their own life story
day by day
