life is a mystery
everyone must stand alone
i hear you call my name
and it feels like home

chorus
when you call my name
its like a little prayer
im down on my knees
i want to take you there
in the midnight hour
i can feel your power
just like a prayer
you know ill take you there

verse 1
i hear your voice
its like an angel sighing
i have no choice
i hear your voice
feels like flying
i close my eyes
oh god i think im falling
out of the sky
i close my eyes
heaven help me
