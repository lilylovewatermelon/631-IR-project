ive been having a hard time adjusting
i had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting
i didnt know if youd care if i came back
i have a lot of regrets about that
pulled the car off the road to the lookout
couldve followed my fears all the way down
and maybe i dont quite know what to say
but im here in your doorway

chorus
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying

verse 2
they told me all of my cages were mental
so i got wasted like all my potential
and my words shoot to kill when im mad
i have a lot of regrets about that
i was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
fell behind all my classmates and i ended up here
pouring out my heart to a stranger
but i didnt pour the whiskey

chorus
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likepostchorus
at least im trying

bridge
and its hard to be at a party when i feel like an open wound
its hard to be anywhere these days when all i want is you
youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

chorus
and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying

outro
at least im tryingembed"
