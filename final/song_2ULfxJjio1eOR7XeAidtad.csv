songs about louisianaone of the oldest songs about the state is lakes of pontchartrain a folk song from around the time of the war of 1812 not nearly so old but a song that tells a story from louisianas early statehood is johnny hortons battle of new orleans perhaps the most famous song associated with the state is by twotime governor of louisiana jimmie davis who wrote and recorded you are my sunshine one of the official state songs

other famous songs about the state include randy newmans louisiana 1927 leon russells jambalaya on the bayou although oldtimers prefer the hank williams sr version hank williams jrs cajun baby mel mcdaniels louisiana saturday night and doug kershaws calling baton rouge

country music
country music in louisiana is heavily influenced by cajun and blues music its played on the fiddle guitar and other string instruments and like its influencers its bold and expressive  representative of the louisiana country sound is lucinda williams louisiana man jerry reeds amos moses sammy kershaws third rate romance george straits adalida mary chapin carpenters down at the twist and shout and black water brides over you

creole musicthe creole fiddle arrived in south louisiana in the 17th century coming ashore with frenchspeaking africans from saintdomingue the performance of creole fiddle takes a lot of its cues from the african banjo  the 1950s brought zydeco to the forefront with its big accordion sound eclipsing creole music but creole lives on in the homes and small clubs of louisiana and some argue its a better representation of its original than present day zydeco some great creole music can be heard in
cedric watsons la vieille chanson de mardi gras and in the legendary canray fontenots les barres de la prison

zydeco musiczydeco developed in southwest louisiana by french creole speakers and blends blues with rb gid tanner and the skillet lickers were the first to have their music recorded in 1929 with it aint gonna rain no mo  zydeco is sometimes described as polka music but thats really just the accordion if you listen closely what youll hear is the blues performances rely on the back beat with modern bands adding a doublekick bass drum to emphasize the syncopation the accordion almost always plays some blues licks and the guitars echo that listen to boozoo chavis hit a groove with uncle bud and clifton chenier sing tu le ton son ton and  ay tete fee

cajun musiccajun music is one of the oldest forms of music in louisiana the french people who settled in acadia nova scotia brought with them the music rooted in medieval france  after their expulsion by the british in 1755 many of them migrated to southern louisiana there these acadians encountered and intermarried with other ethnic groups fostering their evolution into the cajuns  by the late 19th century they adopted the accordion into their music while it fell out of favor for a while in in the first half of the 20th century it came back in 1964 when dewey balfa performed at the newport folk festival cajun music has enjoyed growing popularity since then and is represented by doug kersahaw with louisiana man dewey balfa with jai ete au bal and the lost bayou ramblers with blue moon special but no discussion of cajun would fail to mention jole blon its practically the cajun national anthem the version here is by waylon jennings
new orleans jazz
new orleans jazz is itself an amalgamation of styles that come from a long musical tradition in new orleans youll find an excellent presentation of its history right here for now give a listen to louis armstrong playing sweet georgia brown the preservation hall jazz band perform a version of  tailgate ramble john boutte sing foot of canal street  and nina simone sing little liza jane
new orleans blues
one of the oldest is the traditional st james infirmary blues but the new orleans blues style didnt really get started until after ww2  its influenced by new orleans jazz and caribbean music and its generally upbeat with a faster tempo than swamp blues youll find examples in professor longhairs walk your blues away johnny copelands devils hand and dr johns im gonna go fishing

swamp blues
evolving from the delta blues swamp blues developed first in  baton rouge during the 1950s it uses a slower tempo and is influenced by cajun music its recognizable in songs like
creedence clearwater revivals suzie q tina turners bayou song lazy lesters im a man lucinda williams cant let go and tony joe whites polk salad annie

swamp rock
some people claim that swamp rock begins and ends with ccr but youll find examples in the meters fire on the bayou little feats hamburger midnight as well as ccrs run through the jungle
