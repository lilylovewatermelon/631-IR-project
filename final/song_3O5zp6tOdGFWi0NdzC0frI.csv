oh oh ohhohoh and i pray

verse 1
i just cant sleep tonight
knowing that things aint right
its in the papers its on the tv its everywhere that i go
children are crying soldiers are dying some people dont have a home

prechorus
but i know theres sunshine beyond that rain
i know theres good times beyond that pain
hey can you tell me how i can make a change

chorus
i close my eyes and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and pray
i close my eyes and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and pray

verse 2
i lose my appetite cant eat cant eat
knowing kids starve tonight
am i a sinner cause of my dinner still there on my plate
ooh i got a vision to make a difference and its starting today
