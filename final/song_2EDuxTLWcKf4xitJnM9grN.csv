i be so sick of you niggas yall contradicting
i be so bored with myself can you come and fuck me
i feel so ordinary sad when you around me

tripping bout your whereabouts
i cant keep no conflict with you boy can we just rub it out

heavy on the missing you
wish it was different than what it was oh no
ive been up baby
lost in the lie of us
lost aint no findin us
