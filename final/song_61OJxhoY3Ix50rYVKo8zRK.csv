i feel close
well maybe im not heaven knows
its a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
why are these the things that im feeling
theres so much time
for me to speak up but i keep quiet
ill complicate the most of the mantra
the powers out and i cant turn the fan on

chorus
so can i call you tonight
im trying to make up my mind
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real
i hear your voice on the phone
now im no longer alone
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real anymore
cause i wouldnt know

verse 2
voice so low
sneaking around so it goes
i always try my best to listen
picking up things that i can fidget
circle speed
pacing around watching my feet
batteries drain i get the memo
i think that i might have to let you go

so can i call you tonight
im trying to make up my mind
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real
i hear your voice on the phone
now im no longer alone
just how i feel
could you tell me whats real anymore
cause i wouldnt know
