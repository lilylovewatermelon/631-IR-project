touch my mouth and hold my tongue
ill never be your chosen one
ill be home safe and tucked away
well you cant tempt me if i dont see the day

verse 2
the pull on my flesh was just too strong
stifled the choice and the air in my lungs
better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
cause when i open my body i breathe a lie

prechorus
but i will not speak of your sin
there was a way out for him
the mirror shows not
your values are all shot
and oh my heart was flawed i knew my weakness
so hold my hand consign me not to darkness

chorus
so crawl on my belly til the sun goes down
ill never wear your broken crown
i took the road and i fucked it all away
now in this twilight how dare you speak of grace
so crawl on my belly til the sun goes down
ill never wear your broken crown
i took the road and i fucked it all away
now in this twilight how dare you speak of grace
you might also likeinstrumental break

outro
so crawl on my belly til the sun goes down
ill never wear your broken crown
i can take the road and i can fuck it all away
but in this twilight our choices seal our fate8embed"
