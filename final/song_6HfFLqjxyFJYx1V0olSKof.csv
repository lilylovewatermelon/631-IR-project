come on out and dance
if you get the chance
were going to spit on the rivals
all i want to know
is how far you want to go
fighting for survival
underneath the stars
where we parked the cars
aint showing signs of stopping
pretty little girls
naked to their curls
ready to lay in a coffin

chorus  kings of leon
if you want to go
im going to go
ive got a fire burning
go on take my hand
when we see the band
babys going to be a big one oh yeah
babys going to be a big one

verse 2  kings of leon
when we see the lights
and we hear the fights
its going to be a stunner
ive got something here
if you give me one more beer
im going to call the runner
i dont want to say
what i have to say
babe im a kicking off now

and we hear the fights
