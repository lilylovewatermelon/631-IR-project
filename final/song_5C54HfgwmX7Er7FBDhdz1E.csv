like a hand you reached out to me
the thunder rolls in with the dark
tiny fingers on the edges
watch it unravel pulling everything apart

verse 2
in the night we sleep together
the walls are shaking in their skin
does it become you troublemaker
watch them unravel you pulling everything apart

chorus
someday out of the blue it will find you
always always a face to remind me
someone like you
someone like you
someone like you

verse 3
you watch the shape these things are taking
do you cry out in your sleep
does it become you when youre under
your heart is racing youre taking everything too hard

prechorus
when you walk away
you show me how
come pull me under
you might also likechorus
someday out of the blue it will find you
always always a face to remind me
someone like you
someone like you
someone like you
someday out of the blue it will find you
always always a face to remind you9embed"
