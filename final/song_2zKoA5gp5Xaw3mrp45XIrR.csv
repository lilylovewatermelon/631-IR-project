verse 1
falling from high places
falling through lost spaces
now that were lonely
now that theres nowhere to go
watching from both sides these
clock towers burning up
i lost my time here
i lost my patience with it all hmm

prechorus
we lost faith in the arms of love

chorus
where you been hiding lately
where you been from hiding from the news
oh hiding lately hiding from the news
because weve been fighting lately
ah weve been fighting with the wolves
oh fighting lately fighting with the wolves
ooh with the wolves
ooh with the wolves

verse 2
oh falling from high places
falling through lost spaces
now that were lonely
now that were so far from home
watching from both sides these
towers been tumbling down
i lost my mind here
i lost my patience with the lord

prechorus
and we lost faith in the arms of love
oh love love love no

chorus
oh where you been hiding lately

oh fighting lately fighting with the wolves
