some of us get a little and some a lot
weve got to make do with whatever we got
we get it hot we cool it down and then we pass it around
oh you can dance for the sake of a golden day
take a chance on getting rid of whatevers in your way
next stop big hop its turning night into day
uhuh sometimes when im lying there all alone
uhuh i think of every little nothing that we could own
uhuh to overthrow all of you who have overgrown

chorus anthony kiedis
all my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
i turn to you i turn into and then i turn it again
here we go all we know heavy load start to float
without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
uhâ€” wow

verse 2 anthony kiedis john frusciante
ive come to learn whatever time i can find to spend
taking flight into whatever light we bend
out on the street i get a beat and then i turn it to ten
uhuh lace boots and the ladies of kazakhstan
uhuh kick them high to the sky all of this just because we can
uhuh i turn to cuba then aruba then the dominican
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
all my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
i turn to you i turn into and then i turn it again

heavy load start to float you make it all okay now
without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
i need to know that you are there

bridge anthony kiedis
weve got to move it if we want to do our best
weve got to shake it if we want to keep it fresh
hah

verse 3 anthony john frusciante
im turning down all the heavy psychology
to cut a rug and i make no apology
i turn a cheek i turn a key and then i turn it for free
uhuh weve got to move it just a little to hit the spot
uhuh a whirling dervish in a flurry a fox to trot
uhuh come clown around a robot uhuh doing the astronaut

chorus anthony kiedis john frusciante
all my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
i turn to you i turn into and then i turn it again
here we go all we know two things i wanna say now
heavy load start to float you make it all okay now
without a doubt we turn it out and then we turn it again
i need to know that you are there
