its not knowing whos about to leave
that makes it harder for you to speak
someone told me to never let anyone go
cause youll never know what you need

chorus
go on and say it now
go on and say it now
go on and say it now
go on and say it now

verse 2
if youre anything like me
youll miss the chance to say what you mean
when youre lonesome and everyone forgets that youre there
all we do is sit patiently

chorus
go on and say it now
go on and say it now
go on and say it now
go on and say it now

verse 3
well the worst is when someone talks
in response you say nothing at all
youre expected to solve all their pain
you just want them to back off
