vibe on this bitch though

verse 1
you work numbers work wonders
you done woke me up from my eternal slumber
im the lightning you’re the thunder
theres a difference tween i need you and i want you
girl i need you
good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper uh
tell me your darkest secrets shit you wouldn’t even tell jesus uh
my karma been tweaking so much i dont even believe in karma
but you give me a reason to thank god for all these recent falls
percocet 30 e 8 ive been gettin off
i done chilled out on the drugs since youve been involved
suck it like its love uh fuck me like its love uhhuh
no protection on my heart goddamnit im gon’ hit it raw
traumatized from my past yeah i keep a log
in my mind in my head where that shit belong
they say you after my bread shit i hope they wrong
you already ran up the bands we could have a ball
hit it from the back humina call a play huddle up

fuck you in the prada poke her face like lady gaga
