what the fuck

refrain
you got a slurpee for free
i caught you lookin at me in the 7eleven
under fluorescent lights

verse 1
we walked in comfy silence
footsteps down familiar sidewalk
knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

chorus
all my ghosts are with me
i know you feel them too
ridin’ shotgun next to your free slurpee
they know all of my habits but they dont know about you
i hope thats true
mmm
mmm hmm

verse 2
we made sangria and failed
i spilled mac and cheese on my pants
and thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights
you might also likechorus
oh all my ghosts are with me
i know you feel them too
oh they just stand there whilе we’re takin shots of brandy
they know all of my habits but thеy dont know about you
i hope thats true

bridge
i can see it now
the wedding of the year
i can see it now
he stands up there and wipes his tears
i can see it now
when all my ghosts disappear
i can see it crystal clear

refrain
you got a slurpee for free
i caught you lookin at me in the 7eleven
under fluorescent lights

chorus
and all my ghosts were with me
i know you felt them too
watchin as i started to get dizzy
cause i hate all of my habits
but i happen to love you
i hope thats true
outro
fuck yeah hahahaha fuck yeah hahahahaembed"
