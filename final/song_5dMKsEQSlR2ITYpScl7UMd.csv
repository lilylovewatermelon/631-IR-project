yeah they say when you grow up
youll understand when youre older
guess im still a kid i dont know if
if ill ever let go of this yeah
say goodbye to the old me
we aint friends anymore you dont know me real music
i know i could die any moment
if i do just remember this

verse 1
yeah handouts create lazy people im not impressed with
you want something in life then why dont you go and get it
actions speak louder than words do—its pretty quiet isnt it
look at the world we live in defined by comment sections woah
surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
not people that nod their head and act like they agree
those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
always be yourself not the person that you pretend to be no
these people gon tell you that you wont ever make it
then when you do they gon say they knew you were goin places
thats just how it works next thing you know youll be overrated
hearing people say they miss the old you—its crazy aint it
and perfect people dont exist so dont pretend to be one
i dont need pats on the back from people for my achievements
when i die i wanna know that i lived for a reason
anyone can take your life but not what you believe in no

i know i could die any moment
if i do just remember this

verse 2
yeah dont take opinions from people that wont listen to yours
if moneys where you find happiness youll always be poor
if you dont like the job you have then what do you do it for
the cure to pain isnt something you buy at liquor stores nah
the real you is not defined by the size of your office
the real you is who you are when aint nobody watchin
you spend your whole life worried about whats in your wallet
for what that money wont show up in your coffin woo
yeah angers a liar he aint got no respect
i fell in love with my pain and i slept with my regrets
happiness saw it happen maybe thats why she up and left
joy called me a cheater said she aint coming back
ive always had a problem with relationships
but thats what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
mistakes can make you grow that doesnt mean youre friends
who you are is up to you dont leave it up to them no
chorus
yeah they say when you grow up
youll understand when youre older
guess im still a kid i dont know if
if ill ever let go of this
say goodbye to the old me
we aint friends anymore you dont know me
i know i could die any moment
if i do just remember this

verse 3
yeah they say you got into music you signed up to be hated
thats kinda weird cause i dont remember signing my name up
coming from people that give advice but never take none
i like my privacy but lately i feel its invaded
i heard that lifes too short dont let it pass you by
we waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
its not about what people think its how you feel inside
my biggest failures in life are knowing i never tried woo
i look at the world from a different angle
people change even satan used to be an angel
think twice before youre bitin on the hand that made you
dont believe what you believe just cause thats how they raised you
think your own thoughts dont let them do it for you
say you want a drink dont wait for people to pour it on you
cut out the liars stay close to people you know are loyal
grab your own glass and fill it dont let your fear destroy you woo134embed"
