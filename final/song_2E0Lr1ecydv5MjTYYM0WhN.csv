she was all that i could see
she was all that was in front of me
try to climb the mountain peaks
what if i only ever reach the sea
would you stay awake and wait for me

chorus
hold me under until i see her light
take it easy on my eyes
take it easy on my eyes
sit and wonder now if im doing fine
hold me close and itll be alright
take it easy on my eyes
take it easy on my eyes

verse 2
she was tired i could see
too late receiving love that slippеd from me
tried to find the words to spеak
what if i only needed time to be
would you have stayed awake to wait for me

chorus
hold me under until i see her light
take it easy on my eyes
take it easy on my eyes
sit and wonder now if im doing fine
hold me close and itll be alright
take it easy on my eyes
take it easy on my eyes

chorus
hold me under until i see her light
take it easy on my eyes
take it easy on my eyes
sit and wonder now if im doing fine
hold me close and itll be alright
take it easy on my eyes
