youll find it hiding in shadows
youll find it hiding in cupboards
it will walk you home safe every night
it will help you remember

chorus kele okereke
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is

verse 2 kele okereke  matt tong
i still feel you in the taste of cigarettes
what could i ever run to
just tell me its tearing you apart
just tell me you cannot sleep

chorus kele okereke
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is
if thats the way it is then thats the way it is

and you didnt even notice when the sky turned blue
and you couldnt tell the difference between me and you
and i nearly didnt notice the gentlest feeling
the gentlest feeling
the gentlest feeling
the gentlest feeling
