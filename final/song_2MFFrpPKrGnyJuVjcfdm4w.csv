break away and make a way to make it

we park after dark at the park by the mansion take your skirt off
oh me cant wait to get all up inside of it
my heart is racing every time im tastin it
wait until the drugs fade out
hate making love when im faded
thats because i wanna feel it

yes girl youre the best take away stress love me to death
even when im a mess
