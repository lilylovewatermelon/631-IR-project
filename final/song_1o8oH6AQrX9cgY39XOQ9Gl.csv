well i dont care what you say
someones always givin me a hard time
well i live day to day

someones always puting me in my place
like i dont know where i am
so ill just sit here in the corner
without any direction

maybe its all its all in my head
i think that its something something you said
i understand that some things
will never change never change

someones always kickin me to the curb
well its grindin up my face
someones always pushing me to the side
like im standing in the way

someones always getting up in my face
like i dont know who i am
so once again im in the corner
without any direction

maybe its its all in my head
i think that its something something you said
i understand that some things
will never change

somebodys always tryin to kill me
understand some things
will never change

why did you have to go and change
couldnt you just have stayed the same
why did you have to go insane
understand some things dont change

maybe its all its all in my head
i think that its something something you said
understand that some things
will never change never change

somebodys always out to get me
somebodys always tryin to kill me
understand some things
will never change

why did you have to go and change
couldnt you just have stayed the same
why did you have to go insane
understand some things dont change

why did you have to go and change
couldnt you just have stayed the same
why did you have to go insane
understand some things dont change
never change
some things never change
some things never changeembed"
