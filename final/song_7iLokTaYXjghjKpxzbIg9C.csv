locked up tight
like i would never feel again
stuck in some kind of love prison
and threw away the key
oh oh
terrified
until i stared into your eyes
made me start to realize the possibilities
so so

chorus
i’m gonna love you like ive never been broken
i’m gonna say it like it’s never been spoken
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go go
i’m gonna give it like its never been taken
i’m gonna fall like i don’t need saving
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go

verse 2
so played out
the same lies with a different face
but there’s something in the words you say
that makes it all feel so real

chorus
i’m gonna love you like ive never been broken
i’m gonna say it like it’s never been spoken
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go go
i’m gonna give it like it’s never been taken
i’m gonna fall like i don’t need saving
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go

no need for me to run run run
you’re making me believe in everything
no need to go and hide hide hide
gonna give you every little piece of me

breakdown
i’m gonna love you like ive never been broken
i’m gonna love you like ive never been broken

chorus
i’m gonna love you like ive never been broken
i’m gonna say it like it’s never been spoken
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go go
i’m gonna give it like it’s never been taken
i’m gonna fall like i don’t need saving
tonight tonight i’m letting go go go6embed"
