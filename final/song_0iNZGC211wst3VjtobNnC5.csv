my father never talked a lot
he just took a walk around the block
til all his anger took a hold of him
and then hed hit
my mother never cried a lot
she took the punches but she never fought
til she said im leaving and ill take the kids
so she did

prechorus
i say theyre just the ones who gave me life
but i truly am my parents child

chorus
scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line

verse 2
its hard to put it into words
how the holidays will always hurt
i watch the fathers with their little girls
and wonder what i did to deserve this
how could you hurt a little kid
i cant forget i cant forgive you
cause now im scared that everyone i love will leave me

scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line

postchorus
from my family line

bridge
ohoh
all that i did to try to undo it
all of my pain and all your excuses
i was a kid but i wasnt clueless
someone who loves you wouldnt do this
all of my past i tried to erase it
but now i see would i even change it
might share a face and share a last name but
we are not the same same

chorus
scattered cross my family line
im so good at telling lies
that came from my mothers side
told a million to survive
scattered cross my family line
god i have my fathers eyes
but my sisters when i cry
i can run but i cant hide
from my family line
outro
