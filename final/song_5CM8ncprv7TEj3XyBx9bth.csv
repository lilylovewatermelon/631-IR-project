yeah they cant keep up with my ocean this another wave

i cant stop for nothin ill figure out another way
the impossible i did that shit the other day
doin whatever it takes to get then win i dont like losin
im the one that say what im gon do and then i do it
i dont feel bad at all you had your chance you went and blew it
if i ever bring it up its facts im ready to prove it

prechorus
cuban links gettin tangled up pretty girls have fun with us
she act out i write her up put her on suspеnsion
she told all her friends about it now im poppin in thеy group chat
i hope all us win i never been no hater i dont do that yeah
tennis chains gettin tangled up they know that they cant hang with us
