i only showed up to tell you ooh
everyone at this partys a vampire ooh ooh
this ain’t red wine ooh
were all food for the bloodsuckers ooh
movin up under the moonlight ooh ooh
like the vampires ooh

verse 1
baby careful inside where you step
can you feel the weight of their eyes on your neck
passin’ you on the way down descendin the stairs
and the whole room is watchin while pretendin to dance
it was close cause you dont know if youre standin a chance
on your own right i know you didn’t make any plans
and when the clock strikes twelve at night
you be doin’ hella white
with somebody you dont even like talkin’ bout your life
one two

prechorus
are we dead is this really red wine
were you feeling left out ah yeah uh
take me back when im feelin stressed out
’cause its nearing that time

verse 2
they can tell that your mind is a mess mind is a mess
take someone you dont even like to your bed
when its over you roll out
you come down the stairs and theres no sound
the party vanished into thin air just like a ghost town
your best friends werent even there
and then the whole time you realized you dont even care
when that alarm strikes seven light pourin on your featherwhite
bed of white lies last night was a set up
one two

prechorus
are we dead is this really red wine
were you feeling left out ah yeah uh
take me back when im feelin stressed out
cause its nearing that time
