take my own life just to save yours
drink it all down just to throw it up
take my own life just to save yours just to save yours
take my own life just to save yours
i got a reputation that i cant deny
youre the superstar entertain us entertain us

bridge
entertain us but please dont wake me up
i betrayed us but us dont give a fuck
kill myself today kill it all away
broken path i made
please just stay away

verse 1
i know i fucked up before but i wont do it again
and i got a lot of things that i wish i wouldve said
and im the same damn fool and im wearin that hat again
i know i fucked up and i cant make it right

verse 2
watch yourself i cant slow down
this is who i am cant be anyonе else so
dont let mе go save yourself
just save yourself just save yourself
i was born to raise hell i was born to take pills
i was born to chase mills i was born to cave in
i was born to fuck hoes i was born to fuck up
i was born what a shame

let me choke on my cigarettes and heavy debt21embed"
