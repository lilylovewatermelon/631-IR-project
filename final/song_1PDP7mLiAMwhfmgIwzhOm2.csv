how much better can i show my love for you
than say i do i do i do
i do i do i do
you may not know right where youre going but
i do i do i do
and all the times you wasnt chosen well ill make it up to you
all of the feelings youre not showing
when your rivers overflowing mmm
its the truth swear to you
i do i do i do i do i do
and all that you are i do
my single line of stars in noon
reflection of the very moon i do
i do i do i do
show my love for you
can i show my love for you
can i show my love for youyou might also like22embed"
