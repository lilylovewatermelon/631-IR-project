you say those city boys living in those high rise condos
only left you feeling low
those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast
but never got you where you wanted to go
all ive ever owned is an old chevy truck
cuddled up get you falling in love on the bench seat

chorus
dont mind me im just talking tennessee
girl dont blame me if i slip and call you baby
thats just my way of letting the lady know shes working on me
there i go letting my south side show
whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
jack and seven sipping hoping that youre digging on me
talking tennessee

verse 2
you say the street lights only ever let you see the skyline
its been a long time
since the milky way jupiter and venus took your breath away
yeah like youre taking mine
what you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars
catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar

chorus
dont mind me im just talking tennessee
girl dont blame me if i slip and call you baby
thats just my way of letting the lady know shes working on me
there i go letting my south side show
whiskey whispering those little sweet nothing southernisms
jack and seven sipping hoping that youre digging on me
talking tennessee

there i go letting my south side show
