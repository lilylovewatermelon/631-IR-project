it is a thursday
i get up early
it is a challenge
im usually lazy

verse 2
i make some coffee
i eat some rice chex
and then i sit down
to check my inbox

prechorus 1
i only read a word or two
i stare across the street and see the churches and the blue

chorus 1
the first orgasm of the morning
is cold and hard as hell
there wont be any second coming
as far as i can tell

verse 3
i arch my back cause
im very close now
its very cold here
by the window

there are some school kids
yelling and running
i barely notice
that i am cumming

chorus 2
the first orgasm of the morning
is like a fire drill
its nice to have a little warning
but not enjoyable

verse 5
i am too busy to have friends
a lover would just complicate my plans
so i will never look for love again
im taking matters into my own hands
im taking matters into my own hands

outro
i think i could last at least a week without someone to hold me
i think i could last at least a week without someone to hold me
wont you hold me
wont you hold me2embed"
