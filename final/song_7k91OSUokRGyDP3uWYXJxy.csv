tear at the seams
frayed
all over the place
thought it was good
everything where it should be
around me

all that depends
on where it ends
it ends
did you pretend
or maybe not comprehend
procrastination baby
are you agitated lately

“cut it up it’s fucked” you say it’s useless
just a couple figures for the different uses
here it comes the sum of all excuses
easier to stay the old refuses

next two verses are repeated over each other
spread it thin
make it bend
help me save him make the ends
i got things to feed to reimburse
and he’s sick i’m alone and it’s getting worse
you might also like“today today” you say it’s useless
just a couple figures for the different uses
here it comes the sum of all excuses
where did you think i got these bruises2embed"
