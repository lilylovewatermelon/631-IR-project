drifting apart getting harder to hold you
days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
are we burning out
swept out of sight rolling out on an ocean
lets cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
if our hearts are alive maybe then they might
send us back to the sun

chorus
now i know i know
were losing light our love is dying
out cold on the floor
like a fallen star that shines no more
take take me back to where it was before
when we were on fire
fire

verse 2
heading down heading underground feeling wasted
cold to the bone so alone i can taste it
lets light it up
streets are alive now and everythings bracing
youre on my mind running in my veins
fueling the flame lets start it again start it again

now i know i know
were losing light our love is dying
out cold on the floor
like a fallen star that shines no more
take take me back to where it was before
when we were on fire
fire
we were on fire

verse 3
oh woahoh oh woahoh oh
now dont tell me no that were burning down
oh woahoh oh woahoh oh
and dont tell me no that were burning now

bridge
cause i know i know
that were losing light and our love is dying
take take me home
back to where it was before
when we were on fire
fire

chorus
now i know i know
were losing light our love is dying
out cold on the floor
like a fallen star that shines no more
take take me back to where it was before
when we were on fire
fire
when we were on fire
