but its not as bleak as it seems
the tears have stained all the pages
it is all a romance to be

since youve been gone ive faded
but i reach out and you go forth
my ears have gone in phases
it is all a romance to me

romance to me
romance i see

theres a joy in my eyes i cant deny
but only to those who knows me
replaced by the sadness and longing
is the romance youd given to me

i still hear the bells when i walk
but the movie has changed its key
im touched by your breath as i sleep
it is all a romance to me

romance to me
romance i see
you might also likeromance to me
romance i seeembed"
