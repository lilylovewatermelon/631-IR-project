hold up they dont love you like i love you
slow down they dont love you like i love you
back up they dont love you like i love you
step down they dont love you like i love you
cant you see theres no other man above you
what a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
hold up they dont love you like i love you
oh down they dont love you like i love you

verse 1
something dont feel right because it aint right
especially comin up after midnight
i smell your secrets and im not too perfect
to ever feel this worthless
how did it come down to this scrolling through your call list
i dont wanna lose my pride but ima fuck me up a bitch
know that i kept it sexy you know i kept it fun
theres something that im missing maybe my head for one
refrain
whats worst lookin jealous or crazy jealous or crazy
or like being walked all over lately walked all over lately
id rather be crazy

chorus
hold up they dont love you like i love you
slow down they dont love you like i love you
back up they dont love you like i love you
step down they dont love you like i love you
cant you see theres no other man above you
what a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
hold up they dont love you like i love you
slow down they dont love you like i love you

lets imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
or mastered wealth they had you labeled as a king
never made it out the cage still out there movin in them streets
never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
would they be down to ride no
they used to hide from you lie to you
but yall know we were made for each other
so i find you and hold you down
me sing se

chorus
hold up they dont love you like i love you
slow down they dont love you like i love you
back up they dont love you like i love you
step down they dont love you like i love you
cant you see theres no other man above you
what a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
hold up they dont love you like i love you
slow down they dont love you like i love you

holly like a boulevard
refrain
