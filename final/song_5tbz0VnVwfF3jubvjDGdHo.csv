give me a second i
i need to get my story straight
my friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the empire state
my lover shes waiting for me just across the bar
my seats been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar and
i know i gave it to you months ago
i know youre trying to forget
but between the drinks and subtle things
the holes in my apologies you know
im trying hard to take it back
so if by the time the bar closes
and you feel like falling down
ill carry you home

chorus
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
wе can burn brighter than the sun

tonight
we arе young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

now i know that im not
all that you got
i guess that i i just thought
maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
but our friends are back
so lets raise a cup
cause i found someone to carry me home

chorus
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

bridge
carry me home tonight
just carry me home tonight
carry me home tonight
just carry me home tonight
the moon is on my side carry me home tonight
i have no reason to run carry me home tonight
so will someone come and carry me home tonight
the angels never arrived carry me home tonight
but i can hear the choir carry me home tonight
so will someone come and carry me home

chorus
tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

tonight
we are young
so lets set the world on fire
we can burn brighter than the sun

outro
so if by the time the bar closes
and you feel like falling down
ill carry you home tonightembed"
