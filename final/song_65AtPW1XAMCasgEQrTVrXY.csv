verse 6 dj paul
i seen how tv can hurt and plus platinum plaques to match
and add them twenties and vogues and gucci jackets on backs
we got them bentlys and benzes and all them lexus on lock
the pictures gettin kind of clearer i see why them bitches hot
you hoes is strugglin and starvin and bummin rides in the hood
its cold im crankin up heat and you wish you could
yall wish yall could get back with us and maybe then you could shine
like the rappers you wish you was and get off the grind
im keepin one in the chamber because im filled up with anger
and when i see yo little ho n you knowin your life in danger
i do a show yall in the borough hollerin no kind of shit
is that the best way that you know to get attention lil bitch
i understand how they feel they feelin that they left out
and we the ones movin on so we the ones talked about
but niggas keep it your best and one day then youll get a crown
but until then take you a hit of coke and keep feelin down
cause suckas thats real
