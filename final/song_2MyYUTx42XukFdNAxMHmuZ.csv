i dreamed about the top
ive been the man i am and who im not

ive fallen to the floor
ive spat out my own teeth but im back for more

cause im ready
so come on everyone believe me its about to get heavy

all i know is these times are changing
all i know is these times are changing
everythings about to get crazy
cause all i know is these times are changing

i made it to the stage
ive done a thousand shows
all the blood and sweat lets see how far it goes
ive been to new york city
ive met the rolling stones
moments you cannot buy with your weight in gold

are you ready baby
cause im ready
so come on everyone believe me its about to get heavy
