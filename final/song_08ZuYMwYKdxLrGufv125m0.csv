theres miles of land in front of us
and were dying with every step we take
were dying with every breath we make
and ill fall in line
a strangers back is all i see
hes only a few feet in front of me
and ill look left and right sometimes
but ill fall in line

verse 2
no one looks up anymore
cause you might get a raindrop in your eye
and heaven forbid they see you cry
as we fall in line
and about this time of every year
the line will go to the ocean pier
and walk right off into the sea
and then we fall asleep

verse 3
and as we near the end of land
and our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
i ask myself the question why i fall in line
and then out of the corner of my eye
i see a spaceship in the sky
and hear a voice inside my head
you might also likechorus
follow me instead
follow me instead
follow me

verse 4
then the wages of war will start
inside my head with my counterparts
and the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
this lines the only way
and then i start down the sand
my eyes are focused on the end of land
but again the voice inside my head says

chorus
follow me instead
follow me instead
follow me
follow me instead
follow me instead
follow me instead
follow me instead
follow me instead

verse 5
take me up seal the door
i dont want to march here anymore
i realize that this line is dead
so ill follow you instead
so then you put me back in my place
so i might start another day
and once again i will be
in a march to the sea46embed"
