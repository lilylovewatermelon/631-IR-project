we are damned we are dead
all gods children to be sent
to our perfect place
in the sun in the dirt
theres a windshield in my heart
we are bugs so smeared and scarred
could you stop the meat from thinking fore i swallow all of it
could you please

chorus
put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me your dying god

verse 2
angels with needles poked through our eyes
let the ugly light world in
we were no longer blind
we were no longer blind

chorus
put me in the motorcade
put me in the death parade
dress me up and take me
dress me up and make me your dying god

now we hold the ugly head
the marywhore is at the bed
they cast the shadow of our perfect death
in the sun and in the dirt1embed"
