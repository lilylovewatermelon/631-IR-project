cant stop i need some help
fuck you im by myself
is it a truth or lie
its what you cant deny
cause its the way you think
mixed with the pills and drink
brought back to the way you are
float up till youre close to god
you know that hiding aint gon keep you safe
because the tears on your face they leak and leave a trace
so just when you think that true loves begun
it goes off at any second just like a loaded gun
chorus danny
you know i can take you straight to heaven if you let me
you know i i can make your body levitate if you let me
you know that i can make your body levitate lelevitate
i can make your body levitate lelevitate you know

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
cant stop the feeling high as the ceiling
i got the money whos fucking dealing
you feel the heat like the barrel of a gun
i forgot the last time i saw the sun
weve got this disease thats digging deeper in me
its like my mind is leaving but my heart keeps beating
so ill paint the walls red drip from the nose
where it goes nobody really knows
hit the bottle shes gone ill follow
i fall asleep there aint no tomorrow
gone so far no one can save me
who needs you when i got my baby
my babys beautiful she loves me true
and if she dies i hope i die too

you know i can take you straight to heaven if you let me
you know i i can make your body levitate if you let me
you know that i can make your body levitate lelevitate
i can make your body levitate lelevitate you know

verse 3 charlie scene
imma put down on another sack of them
then its straight back to the flask again
i cant help stop whats happening
on the wrong track yeah im back again
up shits creek and im paddling
blacked out room in a travel inn
good ideas im lacking them
im too fucked up now im babbling
wonderin how to fix these damages
all these goddamn damages
covered myself with bandages
from all these ddamn damages
wonderin how to fix these damages
all these goddamn damages
covered myself with bandages
from all these goddamn damages

chorus danny
you know i can take you straight to heaven if you let me
you know i i can make your body levitate if you let me
you know that i can make your body levitate lelevitate
i can make your body levitate lelevitate you know
