verse 1
gaze into her killing jar id sometimes stare for hours
sometimes stare for hours
she even poked the holes so i can breathe

prechorus
she bought the last line im just the worst kind
of guy to argue with what you might find
and for the last night i lie
could i lie with you

chorus
alright give up get down its just the hardest part of living
alright she wants it all to come down this time

verse 2
im lost in the prescription shes got something else in mind something else in mind
check into the hotel bella muerte

prechorus
it gives the weak flight it gives the blind sight
until the cops come or by the last light
and for the last night i lie
could i lie next to you

alright give up get down its just the hardest part of living
alright she wants it all to come down this time
alright give up get down its just the hardest part of living
alright she wants it all to come down this time

bridge
pull the plug but id like to learn your name
when holding on well i hope you do the same oh sugar
slip into the tragedy
youve spun this chamber dry

chorus
alright give up get down its just the hardest part of living
alright she wants it all to come down this time
alright give up get down its just the hardest part of living
alright she wants it all to come down this time

outro
pull the plug but id like to learn your name
and holding on well i hope you do the same oh sugar21embed"
