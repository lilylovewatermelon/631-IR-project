the emotion it was electric
and the stars they all aligned
i knew i had to make my decision
but i never made the time
no i never made the time

chorus
in the dark for a while now
i cant stay so far
i cant stay much longer
riding my decision home

verse 2
exoneration lost his eraser
but my forgiver found the sun
and there are twisted days that i take comfort
because im not the only one
no im not the only one

chorus
in the dark for a while now
i cant stay very far
i cant stay much longer
riding my decision home
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likebridge
now theres a majesty at my doorstep
and theres a little boy in her arms
now well parade around without game plans
obligation or alarm

chorus
in the dark for a while now
i cant stay very far
i cant stay much longer
riding my decision home
in the dark for a while now
i cant stay so far
i cant stay much longer
riding my decision home
in the dark4embed"
