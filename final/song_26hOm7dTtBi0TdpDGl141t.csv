swear i couldnt sleep a wink last night
no point in turning off the lights
not the same without your head on my shoulders
growing pains but i dont wanna get older
almost like we left it all on read
couple feelings never laid to rest
didnt know that the party was over
and its true that i need you here closer

prechorus
burning photos
had to learn to let go
i used to be
somebody in another skin another skin

chorus
i heard that youre happy without me
and i hope its true i hope i hope its true
it kills me a little thats okay
cause id die for you
you know id still die for you

verse 2
i hopе youre getting evеrything you needed
found the puzzle piece and feel completed
just wanted you to know every reason
hope you really know that i mean that
i couldnt see the forest from the trees
only time we speak only time we speak
is in my dreams
