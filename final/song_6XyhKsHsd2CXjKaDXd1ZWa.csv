turn on the lights paint me a tapestry
go start a fire get close to the gasoline
i followed you to the deep end
i was helpless but still you pulled me in

prechorus
now i’m caught in the tide
lost in the eyes of envy
for whom it concerns
some never learn

chorus 1
she lacerated me exposing me piece by piece
she saw a weakness in me and used it against me
she lacerated me she lacerated me

verse 2
turn on the lights make me a porcelain doll
and whisper your secrets can’t get to the truth at all
i reached out again and again
i could never believe you’d do me in

prechorus
now i’m caught in the tide
lost in the eyes of envy
for whom it concerns
some never learn

she lacerated me exposing me piece by piece
she saw a weakness in me and used it against me
she lacerated me and now i have nowhere to go
she lacerated me she lacerated me

chorus 3
she lacerated me and now i have nowhere to go
she saw a weakness in me release me from all i see
she lacerated me
she lacerated me she lacerated meembed"
