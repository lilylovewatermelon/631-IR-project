ive been sleeping barely dreaming
through one year and one half
found another called him my lover
helped me get my old self back

it was youououou

let me help you wake you up
let me help you break you up
let me help you open up
im in love im alive
oh im burning

verse 2
oh i was reckless once was breathless
running from that day i snapped
