yeah go squad
ayy
look

verse
i wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
the first second they speak to me im not with all the secrecy
secretly beefin me behind closed doors
but playin it peacefully for the streets to see
my nigga have some decency
dont move like a puto
could at least keep it a buck like antetokounmpo
i made north of the border like vito rizzuto
throwin parties in miami they lovin us mucho
with the ho ratio im like david caruso
thеres a mad shortage of peoplе givin me kudos
i been doin this since tpain was pourin us nuvo
you tell em i run the country theyll say true though
papi chulo grippin culo
and i got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
you boys reachin new lows
lettin me take the rap for that casper the ghost shit
while you findin all of the loopholes
you niggas move too cold
see the watch collection and assume i got time
cause of the ruby rose twotone
or switch it to the one i call rip nipsey
cause i swear to god the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
maybe im gettin too stoned
calacatta marble for my tombstone
here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
or any of his old songs
they sing them shits like folk songs
kumbaya boombaye
know the owl stay on me
bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
tryna get the earl grey on me
but i aint really into talkin names
only tee youre getting from me is one for the walk of shame
heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
high fashion and my life is full of climaxes
and my wishes come true without blowin eyelashes
up in bron crib fishbowl wineglasses
thats how we passin time
hundred thousand on the line
at the table prayin banker shows a natural nine
it never happens half the time
my losing nights are still a vibe
thats the things i accept
you over there in denial we not neck and neck
its been a lot of years since we seen you comin correct
man fuck a respectfully i just want my respect
they tried to label me mean i say what i mean
people that couldve stayed on the team
they played inbetween
clouds is hanging over you now cause im reigning supreme
some of these niggas say what they mean it aint what it seems
had to pull my niggas out the mud like im trainin marines
you niggas hot to them little kids you aint famous to me
told you im aimin straight for the head not aiming to please
i could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
have somebody put you on a gildan you play with my seed
trust me theres some shit you really gotta come see to believe
thats why your people not believers they all leavin ya
thats why you buyin into the hype that the press feedin ya
you know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
isnt that an ironic revelation
give that address to your driver make it your destination
stead of just a post out of desperation
this me reachin the deepest state of my meditation
while you over there tryna impress the nation
minds runnin wild with the speculation
why the fuck we peacemakin doin the explanations
if we just gon be right back in that bitch without hesitation
but let me digress on behalf of the association
ill play it cool with you then mark a nigga like copenhagen
see they gettin loose with the line like open cages
in the la ferrari my emotions racin dancin out a condo ocean bathin
niggas textin bro but we are not of no close relation
i was down to give these niggas credit but hold the payment
somehow im the greatest in the game to my own amazement
the greatest in the world theres no debatin
you boys bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin
far as the drake era man we in the golden ages
look at the total wages
and look at the heroes fallin from grace in their older ages
if we talkin top three then you been slidin to third like stolen bases
toss around rollies with frozen faces
they used to tell me back in the day boy youre going places
never understood where i could really take it
