im so gone
anyone could see that im wasted
you cut through
and i just wanna know whats in your head
write it on a piece of paper honey mmm
put it in my coat before i go
hidden in a place you know ill find it oh ohh
later when im sitting all alone

prechorus
let me in
everything starts at your skin so new
your loves always finding me out
who am i kidding
if all my defences come down oh baby

chorus
will you lay it all on me now
lay it all on me now
lay it all on me now
lay it all on me now

verse 2
snow comes down
everything is new
and different
i found you
hidden in plain sight
whyd i take so long
write it on a piece of paper honey mmm
put it in my coat before i go
