mom and dad they quite dont understand it
all the kids they laugh as if they planned it
why do girls wanna pierce their nose
and walk around in torn pantyhose oh yeah

verse 2 tom delonge
i like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
i like the kids who fight against how they were brought up
they hate the trends and think its fucked to care
its cool when they piss people off with what they wear oh yeah

chorus tom delonge
so give me one good reason
why we need to be like them
kids will have fun and offend
they dont want to and dont fit in

verse 3 tom delonge
hate the jocks and preps the hippie fucking scumbags
heavy metalers with their awful pussy hairbands
counting seconds until we can get away
ditching school almost every single day oh yeah

chorus tom delonge
so give me one good reason
why we need to be like them
kids will have fun and offend
they dont want to and dont fit in

why we need to be like them
