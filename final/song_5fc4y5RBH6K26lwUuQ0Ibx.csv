going upstairs to pack my leavin trunk
i aint seen no whiskey
woman made me sloppy
seen no whiskey
woman made me drunk
going back home
where i had much better luck

verse 2
look here darlin
want me to be your king
said youre kidding darlin
got to keep it hid
dont let your main man
your husband catch me here
dont let your main man
your husband catch me hereyou might also likeembed"
