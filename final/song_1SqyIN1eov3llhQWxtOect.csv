its looking like a limb torn off
or all together just taken apart
were willing through an endless fog
we are the everliving ghost of what once was

chorus
but no one
is gonna ever love you more than i do
no ones gonna love you more than i do

verse 2
and anything to make you smile
its a better side of of you to admire
but they should never take so long
just to be over then back to another one

chorus
but no one
is gonna ever love you more than i do
no ones gonna love you more than i do

bridge
someone should have warned you
when things start splitting at the seams and now
the whole things tumbling down
things start splitting at the seams and now
if things start splitting at the seams and now
its tumbling down hard

did anything to make you smile
you are the everliving ghost of what once was
i never want to hear you say
that youre better off or you liked it that way

chorus
cause no one
is gonna ever love you more than i do
no ones gonna love you more than i do

bridgeoutro
they really should have warned you
when things start splitting at the seams and now
the whole things tumbling down
things start splitting at the seams and now
if things start splitting at the seams and now
its tumbling down hard1embed"
