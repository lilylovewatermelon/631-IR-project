i need a little space in my mind
i need that little hope i can find
i need a little i need a little faith
is that too much to ask for
i need to feel my soul come alive
i need to feel the strength to get by
i need a little i need a little faith
is that too much to ask for
too much to ask for
too much to ask for
too much to ask for

i need a little space in my mind
i need that little hope i can find
i need a little i need a little faith
is that too much to ask for
i need to feel my soul come alive
i need to feel the strength to get by
i need a little i need a little faith
is that too much to ask for
too much to ask for
too much to ask for
too much to ask for
