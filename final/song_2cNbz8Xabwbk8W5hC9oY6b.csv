i roll the window down and then begin to breathe in
the darkest country road and the strong scent of evergreen
from the passenger seat as
you are driving me home
then looking upwards i strain my eyes and try
to tell the difference between shooting stars and satellites
from the passenger seat as
you are driving me home

bridge
do they collide i ask and you smile
with my feet on the dash the world doesnt matter

outro
when you feel embarrassed then ill be your pride
when you need directions then ill be the guide
for all time
for all timesee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like18embed"
