the summer nights are dead
the fall is coming
we were careless hearts
who got caught up in this

you were shy
to the night you drove me wild
and you crashed into me
and i wont lie
i wish it lasted a lifetime

please stayayay
wont you stayayay
tonight

breathe in deep
and say goodbye
the saddest song
ill ever write
for anyone anytime

breathe in deep
before i say
i can feel us slip away
youre almost gone
youre good as gone
august is over
you might also likenow we wait
cause august had to end
all our bags are packed
just two broken hearts
that got caught up in this

i deny
that tomorrow youll be gone
and so far from me
its something strange
never love the same way

please stayayay
wont you stayayay
tonight

breathe in deep
and say goodbye
the saddest song
ill ever write
for anyone anytime

breathe in deep
before i say
i can feel us slip away
youre almost gone
youre good as gone
we can try to drown it out
but it never stops breathing
we can take it all in
but it never slows down
weve come down from that cloud

well sayayay
what you gotta sayayay
please sayayay
what you gotta say
whoaaohoh
whoaaohoh

breathe in deep
and say goodbye
the saddest song
ill ever write
for anyone anytime

breathe in deep
before i say
i can feel us slip away
youre almost gone
youre good as gone
august is over
were not the reason
august is overembed"
