we came to fill the gap in the game
the helicopter man took and bought him a plane

to place cross the face of my new runway
international roller while yall still ridin round local
crusin through in somethin chopped off at the roof
tearin up my baby doll new hairdo
candy painted sittin on some brand new shoes
aint studying nothin lesser than them 22s

to the windowwwwwwwwww dual pipes and vogues
sippin gin head in the wind you seen it before
you know how we roll cars both sides of the road
like a motherfuckin pimp nigga watch me hoe
cut that shit down what he talking bout
