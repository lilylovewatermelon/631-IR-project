every street in this city
is the same to me
everyones got a place to be
but theres no room for me
am i to blame
when the guilt and the shame
hang over me
like a dark cloud
that chases you down
in the pouring rain

chorus
its so hard to find someone
who cares about you
but its easy enough to find someone who looks down on you
why is it so hard to find someone
who cares about you
when its easy enough to find someone who looks down on you

verse 2
its not what it seems
when youre not on the scene
theres a chill in the air
but theres people like me
that nobody sees
so nobody cares
you might also likechorus
why is it so hard to find someone
who cares about you
when its easy enough to find someone who looks down on you
why is it so hard to find someone
who can keep it together when youve come undone
why is it so hard to find someone who cares about you

bridge
i swear this time it wont turn out the same
cause now ive got myself to blame
and youll know when we end up on the streets
that its easy enough to find someone who looks down on you

chorus
why is it so hard to find someone
who cares about you
when its easy enough to find someone who looks down on you
why is it so hard to find someone
who can keep it together when youve come undone
why is it so hard to find someone who cares about you4embed"
