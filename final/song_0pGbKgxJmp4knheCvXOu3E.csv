walking down this lonely stretch of beach
she and i walked down a thousand times
i just cant force myself to give her up
like all the things she left behind
gone are the days when id wake up
with her warm body next to mine

chorus
it gets cold here in the wintertime
and my mind drifts away
to that house across the bay
a long talk and a glass of wine
and wed love the night away
but that was yesterday
in that house across the bay

verse 2
her laughter was contagious
her walk her talk her smile lit up every room
they say things happen for a reason
but i cant find one good reason why shes gone so soon
life just seems to hang on every thought
and everything we used to be

chorus
it gets cold here in the wintertime
and my mind drifts away
to that house across the bay
a long talk and a glass of wine
and wed love the night away
but that was yesterday
in that house across the bay

there was sunshine everyday
and wed love the night away
in that house across the bayembed"
