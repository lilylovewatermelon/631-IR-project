an appetite for expensive taste
they made the angels in her mold
feels at home in a centerfold

dont try lines and dont try jokes
she eats up men like hall and oates
theres no tricks that you can try
theres no gifts money can buy

put your hands up
before she turns and walks away
this is your one shot
time for your ace in the hole

put your hands up
before she turns and walks away
this is your one shot
time for your ace in the hole
time for your ace in the hole

put your quarters in the slot
hope and pray for a jackpot
better chances with the dice
than take her home with you tonight
see saint motel liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeshe doesnt bother finding love
there is no man thats good enough
lucky sevens come up eights
rabbits feet wont help your fate

put your hands up
before she turns and walks away
this is your one shot
time for your ace in the hole

put your hands up
before she turns and walks away
this is your one shot
time for your ace in the hole
time for your ace in the hole

time for your ace in the hole
time for your ace in the hole
time for your ace in the hole8embed"
