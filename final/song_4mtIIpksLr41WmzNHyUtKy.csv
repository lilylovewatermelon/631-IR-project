here we go

verse 1
you wear your smile like a summer sky
just shining down on me and you
i swear your heart is a free bird
on a lazy sunday afternoon
i love the way that you were up for anything
never worried bout what people say
thats right oh thats right
what we got is

chorus
just like driving on an open highway
never knowing what were gonna find
just like two kids baby always tryin to live it up
whoa yeah thats our kind of love
mmm thats our kind of love

verse 2
skipping rocks and leaving footprints
down along the riverbank
always holding hands never making plans
just living in the moment babe
you get me laughing with those funny faces
you somehow always know just what to say
thats right oh thats right
what we got is
