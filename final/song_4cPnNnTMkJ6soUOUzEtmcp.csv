you try to run me through hold on
think again dont you know
what youre starting
but you sure aint got a clue how bad
this will go dont you know
know my art art of war

prechorus
and as you look to the horizon not a cloud
but then stormy weathers caught you cold
seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around
you its not quite what you foretold

chorus
youll never see it coming
youll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
youre done in
by the time its hit you your last surprise
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh

verse 2
you think you got your game planned out
to a t yet im two steps ahead yeah
so you step into my way stand down
its a trap one more step and youre dead
yeah youre dead

why just a picosecond ago clear blue skies
but now lightnings struck your last resolve
its not an accident that no one hears your cries
as your last strength seems to dissolve

chorus
youll never see it coming
youll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
youre done in
by the time its hit you your last surprise
im coming for you
my games always so fast so fine
youre spun in
by the net you didnt catch it in time
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh

bridge
better think about your game
are you sure your next moves the right one for you
are you sure
you wont get outmaneuvered again
and again my friend

chorus
youll never see it coming
youll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
youre done in
by the time its hit you your last surprise
im coming for you
my games always so fast so fine
youre spun in
by the net you didnt catch it in time
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh11embed"
