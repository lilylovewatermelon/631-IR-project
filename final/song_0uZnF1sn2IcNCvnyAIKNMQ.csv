youve got a hold on me
dont even know your power
i stand a hundred feet
but i fall when im around ya
show me an open door
and you go and slam it on me
i cant take anymore

hook
im saying
baby please have mercy on me
take it easy on my heart
even though you dont mean to hurt me
you keep tearing me apart
would you please have mercy mercy on my heart
would you please have mercy mercy on my heart

verse 2
id drive through the night
just to be near you baby
heart open testify
tell me that im not crazy
im not asking for a lot
just that youre honest with me
and my pride is all i got
hook
im saying
baby please have mercy on me
take it easy on my heart
even though you dont mean to hurt me
you keep tearing me apart
would you please have mercy on me
im a puppet on your strings
and even though you got good intentions
i need you to set me free
would you please have mercy mercy on my heart
would you please have mercy mercy on my heart

bridge
consuming all the air inside my lungs
ripping all the skin from off my bones
im prepared to sacrifice my life
i would gladly do it twice
consuming all the air inside my lungs
ripping all the skin from off my bones
im prepared to sacrifice my life
i would gladly do it twice

hook
oh please have mercy on me
take it easy on my heart
even though you dont mean to hurt me
you keep tearing me apart
would you please have mercy on me
im a puppet on your string
and even though you got good intentions
i need you to set me free
im begging you for mercy mercy
