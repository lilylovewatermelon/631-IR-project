somebody shakes when the wind blows
somebodys missing a friend hold on
somebodys lacking a hero
and they have not a clue
when its all gonna end again

verse 2
stories buried and untold
someone is hiding the truth hold on
when will this mystery unfold
and will the sun ever shine
in the blind mans eyes when he cries

chorus
you can change the world i cant do it by myself
you can touch the sky gonna take somebodys help
youre the chosen one im gonna need some kind of sign
if we all cry at the same time tonight

verse 3
people laugh when theyre feeling sad
someone is takin a life hold on
respect to believe in your dreams
tell me where were you
when your children cried last night
