when i looked out today
and saw that the sky was gray
i thought about the way
you loved days like this

verse 2
and driving in to town
it really started coming down
bringing me back around
to all that i miss

it feels like its raining you
it feels like its raining you

verse 3
i didnt even run inside
or worry about staying dry
besides there nowhere i can hide
these feeling now

running down my face
takes me to another place
i cant think of a better way to drown

verse 4
it feels like its raining you
i cant explain it
but i am baptized anew
it feels like its raining you
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 5
if i had my way
it would do this every day
i would never see the sun
because the closest i get
to holding you again
is every time that sky opens up

verse 6
it feels like its raining you
i cant explain it
but i am baptized anew
it feels like its raining you
it feels like its raining youembed"
