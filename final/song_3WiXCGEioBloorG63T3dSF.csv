just stop
enough of the limitless critical comments
on my life
just drop
the judgment and all of your pseudoinvolvement
in my life

step back
a moment and look at the miracle started
in our life
dont stop
the moment and let the incredible happen
knowing that

chorus
all that you want is to criticize
something for nothing
and all that i want is forgiveness one more time
to be the best in the world

verse 2
just stop
with all your little deliberate problems
with my life
enough
of all of the crippling terrible pain
we feel inside
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likestep back
a moment remember how the miracle started
in our life
take back
the torment i wont be enjoying this moment
knowing that

chorus
all that you want is to criticize
something for nothing
and all that i want is
forgiveness one more time
i know that all that we want is to feel inside
some kind of comfort
and all that weve done we cant hide
well be the best in the world

bridge
all i ever wanted was to be a real source of
compassion for the moment
that we find ourselves drowning in
all i ever wanted was to be a real source of
compassion for the moment
that we find ourselves drowning in

chorus
all that you want is to criticize
something for nothing
and all that i want is
forgiveness one more time
i know that all that we want is to feel inside
some kind of comfort
and all that weve done we cant hide
well be the best in the world
well be the best in the world
outro
just stop
enough of the limitless critical comments
on my life
just drop
the judgment and all of your pseudoinvolvement
in my lifeembed"
