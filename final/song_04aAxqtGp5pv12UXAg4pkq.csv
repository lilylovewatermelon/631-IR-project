chorus
some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
and just one mistake
is all it will take
well go down in history
remember me for centuries
hey hey hey
remember me for centuries

verse 1
mummified my teenage dreams
no it’s nothing wrong with me
the kids are all wrong the story’s all off
heavy metal broke my heart
come on come on and let me in
bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
and this is supposed to match
the darkness that you felt
i never meant for you to fix yourself
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
some legends are told

but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
and just one mistake
is all it will take
well go down in history
remember me for centuries
hey hey hey

verse 2
and i cant stop til the whole world knows my name
cause i was only born inside my dreams
until you die for me as long as theres a light my shadows over you
cause i am the opposite of amnesia
and youre a cherry blossom
youre about to bloom
you look so pretty but youre gone so soon

chorus
some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
and just one mistake
is all it will take
well go down in history
remember me for centuries
hey hey hey
remember me for centuries
bridge
we’ve been here forever
and here’s the frozen proof
i could scream forever
we are the poisoned youth

chorus
some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
and just one mistake
is all it will take
well go down in history
remember me for centuries
