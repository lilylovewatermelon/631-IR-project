oohooh oohooh

verse 1
split mind dont need to decide when
straightforward eyes on the climbin
i decide no matter the climate
birthin bitches in my third trimester
shift eyes they tell me you lyin
dont care just lay here beside me
hang time chasin the rewind
hang time

prechorus
i need more space and security security
i need less voices just you and me just you and me
i need your touch not your scrutiny scrutiny
squeezin too tight boy youre losin me
boy youre losin

chorus
gone gone girl gonе girl
you better learn how to facе it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl
never replace her
shes gone gone girl gone girl
you better learn how to face it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl

cant think its too hard to process
get around you and i regress
i decide what demons i digest
im just tired of repeatin i digress
tryna find deeper meanin in nonsense
tryna grow without hatin the process
tired of anticipating the worst yet
still anticipating the worst worst

prechorus
i need more space and security security
i need less voices just you and me you and me
i need your touch not your scrutiny scrutiny
squeezin too tight boy youre losin me
boy youre losin

chorus
gone gone girl gone girl
you better learn how to face it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl
never replace her
shes gone gone girl gone girl
you better learn how to face it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl
bridge
inward i go when theres no one around me
and memories drown me the further i go
and aint nobody talkin bout the damage pretendin like its all okay
i tried to erase i live to escape

chorus
gone gone girl gone girl
you better learn how to face it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl
shes gone gone girl gone girl
you better learn how to face it
shes gone gone girl so gone girl6embed"
