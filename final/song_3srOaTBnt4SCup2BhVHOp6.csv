shit tired of gettin shot at
tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
a spot where we belong thats just for us
niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be hollywood
yknahmean where do niggas go when we die
aint no heaven for a thug nigga
thats why we go to thug mansion
thats the only place where thugs get in free
and you gotta be a g at thug mansion
verse 1 2pac
a place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
so much pressure in this life of mine
i cry at times i once contemplated suicide
and wouldve tried but when i held that 9
all i could see was my mamas eyes
no one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
picture me inside the misery of poverty
no man alive has ever witnessed struggles i survived
prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
me and my dogs aint have a choice but to roll on
we found a family spot to kick it
where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
a spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we gs
we still visualize places that we can roll in peace
and in my minds eye i see this place the players go and pass it
i got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion

every corner every city
theres a place where lifes a little easy
little hennessy laid back and cool
every hour ‘cause its all good
leave all the stress from the world outside

nothing but peace love
and street passion i wanna go nigga
every ghetto needs a thug mansion

verse 2 nas
a place where death doesnt reside just thugs who collide
not to start beef but spark trees no cops rollin by
no policemen no homicide no chalk on the streets
no reason for nobodys mama to cry
see im a good guy im tryin to stick around for my daughter
but if i should die i know all of my albums support her
this whole years been crazy asked the holy spirit to save me
only difference from me and ossie davis gray hair maybe
‘cause i feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
im just 20someodd years i done lost my mother and i cried tears of joy
i know she smiles on her boy
i dream of you more my love goes to afeni shakur
‘cause like ann jones she raised a ghetto king in a war
and just for that alone she shouldnt feel no pain no more
‘cause one day well all be together sippin heavenly champagne
where angels soar with golden wings in thugs mansion

every corner every city

verse 3 2pac
dear mama dont cry your baby boys doin good
tell the homies im in heaven and they aint got hoods
seen a show with marvin gaye last night it had me shook
drinkin peppermint schnapps with jackie wilson and sam cooke
then some lady named billie holiday sang
sittin there kickin it with malcolm til the day came
little latasha sure grown
tell the lady in the liquor store that shes forgiven so come home
maybe in time youll understand only god can save us
when miles davis cuttin lose with the band
just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on they in heaven found peace at last
picture a place that they exist together
there has to be a place better than this in heaven
so right before i sleep dear god what im askin
remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
hook j phoenix  2pac
every corner every city
theres a place where lifes a little easy
at thugss mansion
little hennessy laid back and cool
every hour ‘cause its all good
leave all the stress from the world outside
every wrong done will be alright
nothing but peace love and street passion
