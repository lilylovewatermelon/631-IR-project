you seem a girl so sound
lights up the ground
if you give up new york
ill give you tennessee
the only place to be
the cowboys burning eyes
dont like the sight of me
just straight enough to breathe
i like your point of view
so dont you shy away
ride out the wave
ride out the wave
ride out the wave

ride out the wave
ride out the wave

you had me holding of
all the time and place
ride out the wave
bury yourself away
the one and only face
ride out the wave
ride out the wave
ride out the wavesee kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also like8embed"
