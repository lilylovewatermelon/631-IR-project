shaking your head like its all wrong
before youre here youre already gone
and even with the light all around you
youre all alone in the dark

chorus
youre breaking your own heart
taking it too far down a lonely road
you say you just want love
but when its close enough you just let it go
the very thing youve been the most afraid of
youve been doing it from the start
breaking your own heart

verse 2
too many tears too many falls
its easier here behind these walls
but you dont have to walk in the shadows
where life is so hard

chorus
youre breaking your own heart
taking it too far down a lonely road
you say you just want love
but when its close enough you just let it go
the very thing youve been the most afraid of
youve been doing it from the start
breaking your own heart
youre breaking your own heart

chorus
youre breaking your own heart
taking your own heart down a lonely road down a lonely road
you say you just want love
but when its close enough you just let it go you just let it go you just let it go
the very thing youve been the most afraid of
youve been doing it from the start
breaking your own heart
