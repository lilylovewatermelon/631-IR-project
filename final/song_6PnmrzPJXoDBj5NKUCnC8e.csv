yeah uh

verse 1 aap rocky
i thought you said youd never leave leave
i think back as i took a puff puff
know what happens every time you leave leave
always come back cause you wanna fuck
always come back cause you wanna fuss
holdin back aint no turnin back when you fall in love love
know what happens every time you speed speed
always fall flat cause you wanna rush rush
huh so we could take it slow slow
separate the highs from the lows lows
separate the evens from the odds odds
i just hope you put me back together when i come apart

chorus florence welch
i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and favor for me i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever cant last forever
cant last forever cant last forever
cant last forever yeah

verse 2 aap rocky
i woke up today high
felt a little less pressure from you
and im here to say i
may have even learned a lesson from you
if you find a way to fight the pain which we endure dure
if you fly away then rest assured
you might also likechorus florence welch
i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and favor for me i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever cant last forever
cant last forever

bridge florence welch
youre the eye but im tearing all the time
always there to catch me but im never coming down
reconstructing all the pieces i left in my way
i guess you know in control
chaos i create
i come apart

verse 3 aap rocky
you made a bet with me now youre in debt with me
made my bed lied in it then you slept with me
its ruthless she the closest thing next to me
the truth is that she blew it and you left with me
especially hard to express to me
european attitude but born in west philly
she just have a smokin gina where the wet willies
i come apart im in her heart on her left titty
chorus florence welch
i come apart and you keep it together
i come apart and i cant stand the pressure
in all your grace and favor for me i cannot compare
i come apart this cant last forever cant last forever
cant last forever cant last forever
cant last forever
