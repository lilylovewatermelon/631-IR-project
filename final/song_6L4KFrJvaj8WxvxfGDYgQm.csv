oh yeah
when i first saw you
on that daytime tv show

i knew that you were no ordinary cat

haters will hate on you and make negative comments
such as that cat looks scared
and a cat should not be eating spaghetti
but you just keep on eating that spaghetti
because you will always be

spaghetti cat i weep for you
spaghetti cat oh spaghetti cat its all i can do
spaghetti cat spaghetti cat yeah to keep from falling apart
