1 the great sages approached manu who was seated with a collected mind and having duly worshipped him spoke as follows

2 deign divine one to declare to us precisely and in due order the sacred laws of each of the four chief castes varna and of the intermediate ones

3 for thou o lord alone knowest the purport ie the rites and the knowledge of the soul taught in this whole ordinance of the selfexistent svayambhu which is unknowable and unfathomable

4 he whose power is measureless being thus asked by the highminded great sages duly honoured them and answered listen

5 this universe existed in the shape of darkness unperceived destitute of distinctive marks unattainable by reasoning unknowable wholly immersed as it were in deep sleep

6 then the divine selfexistent svayambhu himself indiscernible but making all this the great elements and the rest discernible appeared with irresistible creative power dispelling the darkness

7 he who can be perceived by the internal organ alone who is subtile indiscernible and eternal who contains all created beings and is inconceivable shone forth of his own will

8 he desiring to produce beings of many kinds from his own body first with a thought created the waters and placed his seed in them

9 that seed became a golden egg in brilliancy equal to the sun in that egg he himself was born as brahman the progenitor of the whole world

10 the waters are called narah for the waters are indeed the offspring of nara as they were his first residence ayana he thence is named narayana

11 from that first cause which is indiscernible eternal and both real and unreal was produced that male purusha who is famed in this world under the appellation of brahman

12 the divine one resided in that egg during a whole year then he himself by his thought alone divided it into two halves
13 and out of those two halves he formed heaven and earth between them the middle sphere the eight points of the horizon and the eternal abode of the waters

14 from himself atmanah he also drew forth the mind which is both real and unreal likewise from the mind egoism which possesses the function of selfconsciousness and is lordly

15 moreover the great one the soul and all products affected by the three qualities and in their order the five organs which perceive the objects of sensation

16 but joining minute particles even of those six which possess measureless power with particles of himself he created all beings

17 because those six kinds of minute particles which form the creators frame enter asri these creatures therefore the wise call his frame sarira the body

18 that the great elements enter together with their functions and the mind through its minute parts the framer of all beings the imperishable one

19 but from minute body framing particles of these seven very powerful purushas springs this world the perishable from the imperishable

20 among them each succeeding element acquires the quality of the preceding one and whatever place in the sequence each of them occupies even so many qualities it is declared to possess

21 but in the beginning he assigned their several names actions and conditions to all created beings even according to the words of the veda

22 he the lord also created the class of the gods who are endowed with life and whose nature is action and the subtile class of the sadhyas and the eternal sacrifice

23 but from fire wind and the sun he drew forth the threefold eternal veda called rik yagus and saman for the due performance of the sacrifice

24 time and the divisions of time the lunar mansions and the planets the rivers the oceans the mountains plains and uneven ground

25 austerity speech pleasure desire and anger this whole creation he likewise produced as he desired to call these beings into existence
26 moreover in order to distinguish actions he separated merit from demerit and he caused the creatures to be affected by the pairs of opposites such as pain and pleasure

27 but with the minute perishable particles of the five elements which have been mentioned this whole world is framed in due order

28 but to whatever course of action the lord at first appointed each kind of beings that alone it has spontaneously adopted in each succeeding creation

29 whatever he assigned to each at the first creation noxiousness or harmlessness gentleness or ferocity virtue or sin truth or falsehood that clung afterwards spontaneously to it

30 as at the change of the seasons each season of its own accord assumes its distinctive marks even so corporeal beings resume in new births their appointed course of action

31 but for the sake of the prosperity of the worlds he caused the brahmana the kshatriya the vaisya and the sudra to proceed from his mouth his arms his thighs and his feet

32 dividing his own body the lord became half male and half female with that female he produced virag

33 but know me o most holy among the twiceborn to be the creator of this whole world whom that male virag himself produced having performed austerities

34 then i desiring to produce created beings performed very difficult austerities and thereby called into existence ten great sages lords of created beings

35 mariki atri angiras pulastya pulaha kratu praketas vasishtha bhrigu and narada

36 they created seven other manus possessing great brilliancy gods and classes of gods and great sages of measureless power

37 yakshas the servants of kubera the demons called rakshasas and pisakas gandharvas or musicians of the gods apsarases the dancers of the gods asuras the snakedeities called nagas and sarpas the birddeities called suparnas and the several classes of the manes

38 lightnings thunderbolts and clouds imperfect rohita and perfect rainbows falling meteors supernatural noises comets and heavenly lights of many kinds
39 horsefaced kinnaras monkeys fishes birds of many kinds cattle deer men and carnivorous beasts with two rows of teeth

40 small and large worms and beetles moths lice flies bugs all stinging and biting insects and the several kinds of immovable things

41 thus was this whole creation both the immovable and the movable produced by those highminded ones by means of austerities and at my command each being according to the results of its actions

42 but whatever act is stated to belong to each of those creatures here below that i will truly declare to you as well as their order in respect to birth

43 cattle deer carnivorous beasts with two rows of teeth rakshasas pisakas and men are born from the womb

44 from eggs are born birds snakes crocodiles fishes tortoises as well as similar terrestrial and aquatic animals

45 from hot moisture spring stinging and biting insects lice flies bugs and all other creatures of that kind which are produced by heat

46 all plants propagated by seed or by slips grow from shoots annual plants are those which bearing many flowers and fruits perish after the ripening of their fruit

47 those trees which bear fruit without flowers are called vanaspati lords of the forest but those which bear both flowers and fruit are called vriksha

48 but the various plants with many stalks growing from one or several roots the different kinds of grasses the climbing plants and the creepers spring all from seed or from slips

49 these plants which are surrounded by multiform darkness the result of their acts in former existences possess internal consciousness and experience pleasure and pain

50 the various conditions in this always terrible and constantly changing circle of births and deaths to which created beings are subject are stated to begin with that of brahman and to end with that of these just mentioned immovable creatures

51 when he whose power is incomprehensible had thus produced the universe and men he disappeared in himself repeatedly suppressing one period by means of the other

52 when that divine one wakes then this world stirs when he slumbers tranquilly then the universe sinks to sleep

53 but when he reposes in calm sleep the corporeal beings whose nature is action desist from their actions and mind becomes inert

54 when they are absorbed all at once in that great soul then he who is the soul of all beings sweetly slumbers free from all care and occupation

55 when this soul has entered darkness it remains for a long time united with the organs of sensation but performs not its functions it then leaves the corporeal frame

56 when being clothed with minute particles only it enters into vegetable or animal seed it then assumes united with the fine body a new corporeal frame

57 thus he the imperishable one by alternately waking and slumbering incessantly revivifies and destroys this whole movable and immovable creation

58 but he having composed these institutes of the sacred law himself taught them according to the rule to me alone in the beginning next i taught them to mariki and the other sages

59 bhrigu here will fully recite to you these institutes for that sage learned the whole in its entirety from me

60 then that great sage bhrigu being thus addressed by manu spoke pleased in his heart to all the sages listen

61 six other highminded very powerful manus who belong to the race of this manu the descendant of the selfexistent svayambhu and who have severally produced created beings

62 are svarokisha auttami tamasa raivata kakshusha possessing great lustre and the son of vivasvat

63 these seven very glorious manus the first among whom is svayambhuva produced and protected this whole movable and immovable creation each during the period allotted to him

64 eighteen nimeshas twinklings of the eye are one kashtha thirty kashthas one kala thirty kalas one muhurta and as many muhurtas one day and night

65 the sun divides days and nights both human and divine the night being intended for the repose of created beings and the day for exertion

66 a month is a day and a night of the manes but the division is according to fortnights the dark fortnight is their day for active exertion the bright fortnight their night for sleep

67 a year is a day and a night of the gods their division is as follows the half year during which the sun progresses to the north will be the day that during which it goes southwards the night

68 but hear now the brief description of the duration of a night and a day of brahman and of the several ages of the world yuga according to their order

69 they declare that the krita age consists of four thousand years of the gods the twilight preceding it consists of as many hundreds and the twilight following it of the same number

70 in the other three ages with their twilights preceding and following the thousands and hundreds are diminished by one in each

71 these twelve thousand years which thus have been just mentioned as the total of four human ages are called one age of the gods

72 but know that the sum of one thousand ages of the gods makes one day of brahman and that his night has the same length

73 those only who know that the holy day of brahman indeed ends after the completion of one thousand ages of the gods and that his night lasts as long are really men acquainted with the length of days and nights

74 at the end of that day and night he who was asleep awakes and after awaking creates mind which is both real and unreal

75 mind impelled by brahmans desire to create performs the work of creation by modifying itself thence ether is produced they declare that sound is the quality of the latter

76 but from ether modifying itself springs the pure powerful wind the vehicle of all perfumes that is held to possess the quality of touch

77 next from wind modifying itself proceeds the brilliant light which illuminates and dispels darkness that is declared to possess the quality of colour

78 and from light modifying itself is produced water possessing the quality of taste from water earth which has the quality of smell such is the creation in the beginning

79 the beforementioned age of the gods or twelve thousand of their years being multiplied by seventyone constitutes what is here named the period of a manu manvantara

80 the manvantaras the creations and destructions of the world are numberless sporting as it were brahman repeats this again and again

81 in the krita age dharma is fourfooted and entire and so is truth nor does any gain accrue to men by unrighteousness

82 in the other three ages by reason of unjust gains agama dharma is deprived successively of one foot and through the prevalence of theft falsehood and fraud the merit gained by men is diminished by one fourth in each

83 men are free from disease accomplish all their aims and live four hundred years in the krita age but in the treta and in each of the succeeding ages their life is lessened by one quarter

84 the life of mortals mentioned in the veda the desired results of sacrificial rites and the supernatural power of embodied spirits are fruits proportioned among men according to the character of the age

85 one set of duties is prescribed for men in the krita age different ones in the treta and in the dvapara and again another set in the kali in a proportion as those ages decrease in length

86 in the krita age the chief virtue is declared to be the performance of austerities in the treta divine knowledge in the dvapara the performance of sacrifices in the kali liberality alone

87 but in order to protect this universe he the most resplendent one assigned separate duties and occupations to those who sprang from his mouth arms thighs and feet

88 to brahmanas he assigned teaching and studying the veda sacrificing for their own benefit and for others giving and accepting of alms

89 the kshatriya he commanded to protect the people to bestow gifts to offer sacrifices to study the veda and to abstain from attaching himself to sensual pleasures

90 the vaisya to tend cattle to bestow gifts to offer sacrifices to study the veda to trade to lend money and to cultivate land

91 one occupation only the lord prescribed to the sudra to serve meekly even these other three castes

92 man is stated to be purer above the navel than below hence the selfexistent svayambhu has declared the purest part of him to be his mouth

93 as the brahmana sprang from brahmans mouth as he was the firstborn and as he possesses the veda he is by right the lord of this whole creation

94 for the selfexistent svayambhu having performed austerities produced him first from his own mouth in order that the offerings might be conveyed to the gods and manes and that this universe might be preserved

95 what created being can surpass him through whose mouth the gods continually consume the sacrificial viands and the manes the offerings to the dead

96 of created beings the most excellent are said to be those which are animated of the animated those which subsist by intelligence of the intelligent mankind and of men the brahmanas

97 of brahmanas those learned in the veda of the learned those who recognise the necessity and the manner of performing the prescribed duties of those who possess this knowledge those who perform them of the performers those who know the brahman

98 the very birth of a brahmana is an eternal incarnation of the sacred law for he is born to fulfil the sacred law and becomes one with brahman

99 a brahmana coming into existence is born as the highest on earth the lord of all created beings for the protection of the treasury of the law

100 whatever exists in the world is the property of the brahmana on account of the excellence of his origin the brahmana is indeed entitled to all

101 the brahmana eats but his own food wears but his own apparel bestows but his own in alms other mortals subsist through the benevolence of the brahmana

102 in order to clearly settle his duties those of the other castes according to their order wise manu sprung from the selfexistent composed these institutes of the sacred law

103 a learned brahmana must carefully study them and he must duly instruct his pupils in them but nobody else shall do it

104 a brahmana who studies these institutes and faithfully fulfils the duties prescribed therein is never tainted by sins arising from thoughts words or deeds

105 he sanctifies any company which he may enter seven ancestors and seven descendants and he alone deserves to possess this whole earth

106 to study this work is the best means of securing welfare it increases understanding it procures fame and long life it leads to supreme bliss

107 in this work the sacred law has been fully stated as well as the good and bad qualities of human actions and the immemorial rule of conduct to be followed by all the four castes varna

108 the rule of conduct is transcendent law whether it be taught in the revealed texts or in the sacred tradition hence a twiceborn man who possesses regard for himself should be always careful to follow it

109 a brahmana who departs from the rule of conduct does not reap the fruit of the veda but he who duly follows it will obtain the full reward

110 the sages who saw that the sacred law is thus grounded on the rule of conduct have taken good conduct to be the most excellent root of all austerity

111 the creation of the universe the rule of the sacraments the ordinances of studentship and the respectful behaviour towards gurus the most excellent rule of bathing on return from the teachers house

112 the law of marriage and the description of the various marriagerites the regulations for the great sacrifices and the eternal rule of the funeral sacrifices

113 the description of the modes of gaining subsistence and the duties of a snataka the rules regarding lawful and forbidden food the purification of men and of things

114 the laws concerning women the law of hermits the manner of gaining final emancipation and of renouncing the world the whole duty of a king and the manner of deciding lawsuits

115 the rules for the examination of witnesses the laws concerning husband and wife the law of inheritance and division the law concerning gambling and the removal of men nocuous like thorns

116 the law concerning the behaviour of vaisyas and sudras the origin of the mixed castes the law for all castes in times of distress and the law of penances

117 the threefold course of transmigrations the result of good or bad actions the manner of attaining supreme bliss and the examination of the good and bad qualities of actions

118 the primeval laws of countries of castes gati of families and the rules concerning heretics and companies of traders and the like all that manu has declared in these institutes

119 as manu in reply to my questions formerly promulgated these institutes even so learn ye also the whole work from me



chapter ii

1 learn that sacred law which is followed by men learned in the veda and assented to in their hearts by the virtuous who are ever exempt from hatred and inordinate affection

2 to act solely from a desire for rewards is not laudable yet an exemption from that desire is not to be found in this world for on that desire is grounded the study of the veda and the performance of the actions prescribed by the veda

3 the desire for rewards indeed has its root in the conception that an act can yield them and in consequence of that conception sacrifices are performed vows and the laws prescribing restraints are all stated to be kept through the idea that they will bear fruit

4 not a single act here below appears ever to be done by a man free from desire for whatever man does it is the result of the impulse of desire

5 he who persists in discharging these prescribed duties in the right manner reaches the deathless state and even in this life obtains the fulfilment of all the desires that he may have conceived

6 the whole veda is the first source of the sacred law next the tradition and the virtuous conduct of those who know the veda further also the customs of holy men and finally selfsatisfaction

7 whatever law has been ordained for any person by manu that has been fully declared in the veda for that sage was omniscient

8 but a learned man after fully scrutinising all this with the eye of knowledge should in accordance with the authority of the revealed texts be intent on the performance of his duties

9 for that man who obeys the law prescribed in the revealed texts and in the sacred tradition gains fame in this world and after death unsurpassable bliss

10 but by sruti revelation is meant the veda and by smriti tradition the institutes of the sacred law those two must not be called into question in any matter since from those two the sacred law shone forth

11 every twiceborn man who relying on the institutes of dialectics treats with contempt those two sources of the law must be cast out by the virtuous as an atheist and a scorner of the veda

12 the veda the sacred tradition the customs of virtuous men and ones own pleasure they declare to be visibly the fourfold means of defining the sacred law

13 the knowledge of the sacred law is prescribed for those who are not given to the acquisition of wealth and to the gratification of their desires to those who seek the knowledge of the sacred law the supreme authority is the revelation sruti

14 but when two sacred texts sruti are conflicting both are held to be law for both are pronounced by the wise to be valid law

15 thus the agnihotra sacrifice may be optionally performed at any time after the sun has risen before he has risen or when neither sun nor stars are visible that is declared by vedic texts

16 know that he for whom the performance of the ceremonies beginning with the rite of impregnation garbhadhana and ending with the funeral rite antyeshti is prescribed while sacred formulas are being recited is entitled to study these institutes but no other man whatsoever

17 that land created by the gods which lies between the two divine rivers sarasvati and drishadvati the sages call brahmavarta

18 the custom handed down in regular succession since time immemorial among the four chief castes varna and the mixed races of that country is called the conduct of virtuous men

19 the plain of the kurus the country of the matsyas pankalas and surasenakas these form indeed the country of the brahmarshis brahmanical sages which ranks immediately after brahmavarta

20 from a brahmana born in that country let all men on earth learn their several usages

21 that country which lies between the himavat and the vindhya mountains to the east of prayaga and to the west of vinasana the place where the river sarasvati disappears is called madhyadesa the central region

22 but the tract between those two mountains just mentioned which extends as far as the eastern and the western oceans the wise call aryavarta the country of the aryans

23 that land where the black antelope naturally roams one must know to be fit for the performance of sacrifices the tract different from that is the country of the mlekkhas barbarians

24 let twiceborn men seek to dwell in those abovementioned countries but a sudra distressed for subsistence may reside anywhere

25 thus has the origin of the sacred law been succinctly described to you and the origin of this universe learn now the duties of the castes varna

26 with holy rites prescribed by the veda must the ceremony on conception and other sacraments be performed for twiceborn men which sanctify the body and purify from sin in this life and after death

27 by burnt oblations during the mothers pregnancy by the gatakarman the ceremony after birth the kauda tonsure and the maungibandhana the tying of the sacred girdle of munga grass is the taint derived from both parents removed from twiceborn men

28 by the study of the veda by vows by burnt oblations by the recitation of sacred texts by the acquisition of the threefold sacred science by offering to the gods rishis and manes by the procreation of sons by the great sacrifices and by srauta rites this human body is made fit for union with brahman

29 before the navelstring is cut the gatakarman birthrite must be performed for a male child and while sacred formulas are being recited he must be fed with gold honey and butter

30 but let the father perform or cause to be performed the namadheya the rite of naming the child on the tenth or twelfth day after birth or on a lucky lunar day in a lucky muhurta under an auspicious constellation

31 let the first part of a brahmanas name denote something auspicious a kshatriyas be connected with power and a vaisyas with wealth but a sudras express something contemptible

32 the second part of a brahmanas name shall be a word implying happiness of a kshatriyas a word implying protection of a vaisyas a term expressive of thriving and of a sudras an expression denoting service

33 the names of women should be easy to pronounce not imply anything dreadful possess a plain meaning be pleasing and auspicious end in long vowels and contain a word of benediction

34 in the fourth month the nishkramana the first leaving of the house of the child should be performed in the sixth month the annaprasana first feeding with rice and optionally any other auspicious ceremony required by the custom of the family

35 according to the teaching of the revealed texts the kudakarman tonsure must be performed for the sake of spiritual merit by all twiceborn men in the first or third year

36 in the eighth year after conception one should perform the initiation upanayana of a brahmana in the eleventh after conception that of a kshatriya but in the twelfth that of a vaisya

37 the initiation of a brahmana who desires proficiency in sacred learning should take place in the fifth year after conception that of a kshatriya who wishes to become powerful in the sixth and that of a vaisya who longs for success in his business in the eighth

38 the time for the savitri initiation of a brahmana does not pass until the completion of the sixteenth year after conception of a kshatriya until the completion of the twentysecond and of a vaisya until the completion of the twentyfourth

39 after those periods men of these three castes who have not received the sacrament at the proper time become vratyas outcasts excluded from the savitri initiation and despised by the aryans

40 with such men if they have not been purified according to the rule let no brahmana ever even in times of distress form a connexion either through the veda or by marriage

41 let students according to the order of their castes wear as upper dresses the skins of black antelopes spotted deer and hegoats and lower garments made of hemp flax or wool

42 the girdle of a brahmana shall consist of a of a triple cord of munga grass smooth and soft that of a kshatriya of a bowstring made of murva fibres that of a vaisya of hempen threads

43 if munga grass and so forth be not procurable the girdles may be made of kusa asmantaka and balbaga fibres with a single threefold knot or with three or five knots according to the custom of the family

44 the sacrificial string of a brahmana shall be made of cotton shall be twisted to the right and consist of three threads that of a kshatriya of hempen threads and that of a vaisya of woollen threads

45 a brahmana shall carry according to the sacred law a staff of bilva or palasa a kshatriya of vata or khadira and a vaisya of pilu or udumbara

46 the staff of a brahmana shall be made of such length as to reach the end of his hair that of a kshatriya to reach his forehead and that of a vaisya to reach the tip of his nose

47 let all the staves be straight without a blemish handsome to look at not likely to terrify men with their bark perfect unhurt by fire

48 having taken a staff according to his choice having worshipped the sun and walked round the fire turning his right hand towards it the student should beg alms according to the prescribed rule

49 an initiated brahmana should beg beginning his request with the word lady bhavati a kshatriya placing the word lady in the middle but a vaisya placing it at the end of the formula

50 let him first beg food of his mother or of his sister or of his own maternal aunt or of some other female who will not disgrace him by a refusal

51 having collected as much food as is required from several persons and having announced it without guile to his teacher let him eat turning his face towards the east and having purified himself by sipping water

52 his meal will procure long life if he eats facing the east fame if he turns to the south prosperity if he turns to the west truthfulness if he faces the east

53 let a twiceborn man always eat his food with concentrated mind after performing an ablution and after he has eaten let him duly cleanse himself with water and sprinkle the cavities of his head

54 let him always worship his food and eat it without contempt when he sees it let him rejoice show a pleased face and pray that he may always obtain it

55 food that is always worshipped gives strength and manly vigour but eaten irreverently it destroys them both

56 let him not give to any man what he leaves and beware of eating between the two mealtimes let him not overeat himself nor go anywhere without having purified himself after his meal

57 excessive eating is prejudicial to health to fame and to bliss in heaven it prevents the acquisition of spiritual merit and is odious among men one ought for these reasons to avoid it carefully

58 let a brahmana always sip water out of the part of the hand tirtha sacred to brahman or out of that sacred to ka pragapati or out of that sacred to the gods never out of that sacred to the manes

59 they call the part at the root of the thumb the tirtha sacred to brahman that at the root of the little finger the tirtha sacred to ka pragapati that at the tips of the fingers the tirtha sacred to the gods and that below between the index and the thumb the tirtha sacred to the manes

60 let him first sip water thrice next twice wipe his mouth and lastly touch with water the cavities of the head the seat of the soul and the head

61 he who knows the sacred law and seeks purity shall always perform the rite of sipping with water neither hot nor frothy with the prescribed tirtha in a lonely place and turning to the east or to the north

62 a brahmana is purified by water that reaches his heart a kshatriya by water reaching his throat a vaisya by water taken into his mouth and a sudra by water touched with the extremity of his lips

63 a twiceborn man is called upavitin when his right arm is raised and the sacrificial string or the dress passed under it rests on the left shoulder when his left arm is raised and the string or the dress passed under it rests on the right shoulder he is called prakinavitin and nivitin when it hangs down straight from the neck

64 his girdle the skin which serves as his upper garment his staff his sacrificial thread and his waterpot he must throw into water when they have been damaged and take others reciting sacred formulas

65 the ceremony called kesanta clipping the hair is ordained for a brahmana in the sixteenth year from conception for a kshatriya in the twentysecond and for a vaisya two years later than that

66 this whole series of ceremonies must be performed for females also in order to sanctify the body at the proper time and in the proper order but without the recitation of sacred texts

67 the nuptial ceremony is stated to be the vedic sacrament for women and to be equal to the initiation serving the husband equivalent to the residence in the house of the teacher and the household duties the same as the daily worship of the sacred fire

68 thus has been described the rule for the initiation of the twiceborn which indicates a new birth and sanctifies learn now to what duties they must afterwards apply themselves

69 having performed the rite of initiation the teacher must first instruct the pupil in the rules of personal purification of conduct of the fireworship and of the twilight devotions

70 but a student who is about to begin the study of the veda shall receive instruction after he has sipped water in accordance with the institutes of the sacred law has made the brahmangali has put on a clean dress and has brought his organs under due control

71 at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the veda he must always clasp both the feet of his teacher and he must study joining his hands that is called the brahmangali joining the palms for the sake of the veda

72 with crossed hands he must clasp the feet of the teacher and touch the left foot with his left hand the right foot with his right hand

73 but to him who is about to begin studying the teacher always unwearied must say ho recite he shall leave off when the teacher says let a stoppage take place

74 let him always pronounce the syllable om at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the veda for unless the syllable om precede the lesson will slip away from him and unless it follow it will fade away

75 seated on blades of kusa grass with their points to the east purified by pavitras blades of kusa grass and sanctified by three suppressions of the breath pranayama he is worthy to pronounce the syllable om

76 pragapati the lord of creatures milked out as it were from the three vedas the sounds a u and m and the vyahritis bhuh bhuvah svah

77 moreover from the three vedas pragapati who dwells in the highest heaven parameshthin milked out as it were that rikverse sacred to savitri savitri which begins with the word tad one foot from each

78 a brahmana learned in the veda who recites during both twilights that syllable and that verse preceded by the vyahritis gains the whole merit which the recitation of the vedas confers

79 a twiceborn man who daily repeats those three one thousand times outside the village will be freed after a month even from great guilt as a snake from its slough

80 the brahmana the kshatriya and the vaisya who neglect the recitation of that rikverse and the timely performance of the rites prescribed for them will be blamed among virtuous men

81 know that the three imperishable mahavyahritis preceded by the syllable om and followed by the threefooted savitri are the portal of the veda and the gate leading to union with brahman

82 he who daily recites that verse untired during three years will enter after death the highest brahman move as free as air and assume an ethereal form

83 the monosyllable om is the highest brahman three suppressions of the breath are the best form of austerity but nothing surpasses the savitri truthfulness is better than silence

84 all rites ordained in the veda burnt oblations and other sacrifices pass away but know that the syllable om is imperishable and it is brahman and the lord of creatures pragapati

85 an offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice performed according to the rules of the veda a prayer which is inaudible to others surpasses it a hundred times and the mental recitation of sacred texts a thousand times

86 the four pakayagnas and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the veda are all together not equal in value to a sixteenth part of the sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers

87 but undoubtedly a brahmana reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only whether he perform other rites or neglect them he who befriends all creatures is declared to be a true brahmana

88 a wise man should strive to restrain his organs which run wild among alluring sensual objects like a charioteer his horses

89 those eleven organs which former sages have named i will properly and precisely enumerate in due order

90 viz the ear the skin the eyes the tongue and the nose as the fifth the anus the organ of generation hands and feet and the organ of speech named as the tenth

91 five of them the ear and the rest according to their order they call organs of sense and five of them the anus and the rest organs of action

92 know that the internal organ manas is the eleventh which by its quality belongs to both sets when that has been subdued both those sets of five have been conquered

93 through the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure a man doubtlessly will incur guilt but if he keep them under complete control he will obtain success in gaining all his aims

94 desire is never extinguished by the enjoyment of desired objects it only grows stronger like a fire fed with clarified butter

95 if one man should obtain all those sensual enjoyments and another should renounce them all the renunciation of all pleasure is far better than the attainment of them

96 those organs which are strongly attached to sensual pleasures cannot so effectually be restrained by abstinence from enjoyments as by a constant pursuit of true knowledge

97 neither the study of the vedas nor liberality nor sacrifices nor any selfimposed restraint nor austerities ever procure the attainment of rewards to a man whose heart is contaminated by sensuality

98 that man may be considered to have really subdued his organs who on hearing and touching and seeing on tasting and smelling anything neither rejoices nor repines

99 but when one among all the organs slips away from control thereby mans wisdom slips away from him even as the water flows through the one open foot of a watercarriers skin

100 if he keeps all the ten organs as well as the mind in subjection he may gain all his aims without reducing his body by the practice of yoga

101 let him stand during the morning twilight muttering the savitri until the sun appears but let him recite it seated in the evening until the constellations can be seen distinctly

102 he who stands during the morning twilight muttering the savitri removes the guilt contracted during the previous night but he who recites it seated in the evening destroys the sin he committed during the day

103 but he who does not worship standing in the morning nor sitting in the evening shall be excluded just like a sudra from all the duties and rights of an aryan

104 he who desires to perform the ceremony of the daily recitation may even recite the savitri near water retiring into the forest controlling his organs and concentrating his mind

105 both when one studies the supplementary treatises of the veda and when one recites the daily portion of the veda no regard need be paid to forbidden days likewise when one repeats the sacred texts required for a burnt oblation

106 there are no forbidden days for the daily recitation since that is declared to be a brahmasattra an everlasting sacrifice offered to brahman at that the veda takes the place of the burnt oblations and it is meritorious even when natural phenomena requiring a cessation of the vedastudy take the place of the exclamation vashat

107 for him who being pure and controlling his organs during a year daily recites the veda according to the rule that daily recitation will ever cause sweet and sour milk clarified butter and honey to flow

108 let an aryan who has been initiated daily offer fuel in the sacred fire beg food sleep on the ground and do what is beneficial to this teacher until he performs the ceremony of samavartana on returning home

109 according to the sacred law the following ten persons viz the teachers son one who desires to do service one who imparts knowledge one who is intent on fulfilling the law one who is pure a person connected by marriage or friendship one who possesses mental ability one who makes presents of money one who is honest and a relative may be instructed in the veda

110 unless one be asked one must not explain anything to anybody nor must one answer a person who asks improperly let a wise man though he knows the answer behave among men as if he were an idiot

111 of the two persons him who illegally explains anything and him who illegally asks a question one or both will die or incur the others enmity

112 where merit and wealth are not obtained by teaching nor at least due obedience in such soil sacred knowledge must not be sown just as good seed must not be thrown on barren land

113 even in times of dire distress a teacher of the veda should rather die with his knowledge than sow it in barren soil

114 sacred learning approached a brahmana and said to him i am thy treasure preserve me deliver me not to a scorner so preserved i shall become supremely strong

115 but deliver me as to the keeper of thy treasure to a brahmana whom thou shalt know to be pure of subdued senses chaste and attentive

116 but he who acquires without permission the veda from one who recites it incurs the guilt of stealing the veda and shall sink into hell

117 a student shall first reverentially salute that teacher from whom he receives knowledge referring to worldly affairs to the veda or to the brahman

118 a brahmana who completely governs himself though he know the savitri only is better than he who knows the three vedas but does not control himself eats all sorts of food and sells all sorts of goods

119 one must not sit down on a couch or seat which a superior occupies and he who occupies a couch or seat shall rise to meet a superior and afterwards salute him

120 for the vital airs of a young man mount upwards to leave his body when an elder approaches but by rising to meet him and saluting he recovers them

121 he who habitually salutes and constantly pays reverence to the aged obtains an increase of four things viz length of life knowledge fame and strength

122 after the word of salutation a brahmana who greets an elder must pronounce his name saying i am n n

123 to those persons who when a name is pronounced do not understand the meaning of the salutation a wise man should say it is i and he should address in the same manner all women

124 in saluting he should pronounce after his name the word bhoh for the sages have declared that the nature of bhoh is the same as that of all proper names

125 a brahmana should thus be saluted in return mayst thou be longlived o gentle one and the vowel a must be added at the end of the name of the person addressed the syllable preceding it being drawn out to the length of three moras

126 a brahmana who does not know the form of returning a salutation must not be saluted by a learned man as a sudra even so is he

127 let him ask a brahmana on meeting him after his health with the word kusala a kshatriya with the word anamaya a vaisya with the word kshema and a sudra with the word anarogya

128 he who has been initiated to perform a srauta sacrifice must not be addressed by his name even though he be a younger man he who knows the sacred law must use in speaking to such a man the particle bhoh and the pronoun bhavat your worship

129 but to a female who is the wife of another man and not a bloodrelation he must say lady bhavati or beloved sister

130 to his maternal and paternal uncles fathersinlaw officiating priests and other venerable persons he must say i am n n and rise to meet them even though they be younger than himself

131 a maternal aunt the wife of a maternal uncle a motherinlaw and a paternal aunt must be honoured like the wife of ones teacher they are equal to the wife of ones teacher

132 the feet of the wife of ones brother if she be of the same caste varna must be clasped every day but the feet of wives of other paternal and maternal relatives need only be embraced on ones return from a journey

133 towards a sister of ones father and of ones mother and towards ones own elder sister one must behave as towards ones mother but the mother is more venerable than they

134 fellowcitizens are called friends and equals though one be ten years older than the other men practising the same fine art though one be five years older than the other srotriyas though three years intervene between their ages but bloodrelations only if the difference of age be very small

135 know that a brahmana of ten years and kshatriya of a hundred years stand to each other in the relation of father and son but between those two the brahmana is the father

136 wealth kindred age the due performance of rites and fifthly sacred learning are titles to respect but each laternamed cause is more weighty than the preceding ones

137 whatever man of the three highest castes possesses most of those five both in number and degree that man is worthy of honour among them and so is also a sudra who has entered the tenth decade of his life

138 way must be made for a man in a carriage for one who is above ninety years old for one diseased for the carrier of a burden for a woman for a snataka for the king and for a bridegroom

139 among all those if they meet at one time a snataka and the king must be most honoured and if the king and a snataka meet the latter receives respect from the king

140 they call that brahmana who initiates a pupil and teaches him the veda together with the kalpa and the rahasyas the teacher akarya of the latter

141 but he who for his livelihood teaches a portion only of the veda or also the angas of the veda is called the subteacher upadhyaya

142 that brahmana who performs in accordance with the rules of the veda the rites the garbhadhana conceptionrite and so forth and gives food to the child is called the guru the venerable one

143 he who being duly chosen for the purpose performs the agnyadheya the pakayagnas and the srauta sacrifices such as the agnishtoma for another man is called his officiating priest

144 that man who truthfully fills both his ears with the veda the pupil shall consider as his father and mother he must never offend him

145 the teacher akarya is ten times more venerable than a subteacher upadhyaya the father a hundred times more than the teacher but the mother a thousand times more than the father

146 of him who gives natural birth and him who gives the knowledge of the veda the giver of the veda is the more venerable father for the birth for the sake of the veda ensures eternal rewards both in this life and after death

147 let him consider that he received a mere animal existence when his parents begat him through mutual affection and when he was born from the womb of his mother

148 but that birth which a teacher acquainted with the whole veda in accordance with the law procures for him through the savitri is real exempt from age and death

149 the pupil must know that that man also who benefits him by instruction in the veda be it little or much is called in these institutes his guru in consequence of that benefit conferred by instruction in the veda

150 that brahmana who is the giver of the birth for the sake of the veda and the teacher of the prescribed duties becomes by law the father of an aged man even though he himself be a child

151 young kavi the son of angiras taught his relatives who were old enough to be fathers and as he excelled them in sacred knowledge he called them little sons

152 they moved with resentment asked the gods concerning that matter and the gods having assembled answered the child has addressed you properly

153 for a man destitute of sacred knowledge is indeed a child and he who teaches him the veda is his father for the sages have always said child to an ignorant man and father to a teacher of the veda

154 neither through years nor through white hairs nor through wealth nor through powerful kinsmen comes greatness the sages have made this law he who has learnt the veda together with the angas anukana is considered great by us

155 the seniority of brahmanas is from sacred knowledge that of kshatriyas from valour that of vaisyas from wealth in grain and other goods but that of sudras alone from age

156 a man is not therefore considered venerable because his head is gray him who though young has learned the veda the gods consider to be venerable

157 as an elephant made of wood as an antelope made of leather such is an unlearned brahmana those three have nothing but the names of their kind

158 as a eunuch is unproductive with women as a cow with a cow is unprolific and as a gift made to an ignorant man yields no reward even so is a brahmana useless who does not know the rikas

159 created beings must be instructed in what concerns their welfare without giving them pain and sweet and gentle speech must be used by a teacher who desires to abide by the sacred law

160 he forsooth whose speech and thoughts are pure and ever perfectly guarded gains the whole reward which is conferred by the vedanta

161 let him not even though in pain speak words cutting others to the quick let him not injure others in thought or deed let him not utter speeches which make others afraid of him since that will prevent him from gaining heaven

162 a brahmana should always fear homage as if it were poison and constantly desire to suffer scorn as he would long for nectar

163 for he who is scorned nevertheless may sleep with an easy mind awake with an easy mind and with an easy mind walk here among men but the scorner utterly perishes

164 a twiceborn man who has been sanctified by the employment of the means described above in due order shall gradually and cumulatively perform the various austerities prescribed for those who study the veda

165 an aryan must study the whole veda together with the rahasyas performing at the same time various kinds of austerities and the vows prescribed by the rules of the veda

166 let a brahmana who desires to perform austerities constantly repeat the veda for the study of the veda is declared to be in this world the highest austerity for a brahmana

167 verily that twiceborn man performs the highest austerity up to the extremities of his nails who though wearing a garland daily recites the veda in private to the utmost of his ability

168 a twiceborn man who not having studied the veda applies himself to other and worldly study soon falls even while living to the condition of a sudra and his descendants after him

169 according to the injunction of the revealed texts the first birth of an aryan is from his natural mother the second happens on the tying of the girdle of munga grass and the third on the initiation to the performance of a srauta sacrifice

170 among those three the birth which is symbolised by the investiture with the girdle of munga grass is his birth for the sake of the veda they declare that in that birth the sivitri verse is his mother and the teacher his father

171 they call the teacher the pupils father because he gives the veda for nobody can perform a sacred rite before the investiture with the girdle of munga grass

172 he who has not been initiated should not pronounce any vedic text excepting those required for the performance of funeral rites since he is on a level with a sudra before his birth from the veda

173 the student who has been initiated must be instructed in the performance of the vows and gradually learn the veda observing the prescribed rules

174 whatever dress of skin sacred thread girdle staff and lower garment are prescribed for a student at the initiation the like must again be used at the performance of the vows

175 but a student who resides with his teacher must observe the following restrictive rules duly controlling all his organs in order to increase his spiritual merit

176 every day having bathed and being purified he must offer libations of water to the gods sages and manes worship the images of the gods and place fuel on the sacred fire

177 let him abstain from honey meat perfumes garlands substances used for flavouring food women all substances turned acid and from doing injury to living creatures

178 from anointing his body applying collyrium to his eyes from the use of shoes and of an umbrella or parasol from sensual desire anger covetousness dancing singing and playing musical instruments

179 from gambling idle disputes backbiting and lying from looking at and touching women and from hurting others

180 let him always sleep alone let him never waste his manhood for he who voluntarily wastes his manhood breaks his vow

181 a twiceborn student who has involuntarily wasted his manly strength during sleep must bathe worship the sun and afterwards thrice mutter the rikverse which begins again let my strength return to me

182 let him fetch a pot full of water flowers cowdung earth and kusa grass as much as may be required by his teacher and daily go to beg food

183 a student being pure shall daily bring food from the houses of men who are not deficient in the knowledge of the veda and in performing sacrifices and who are famous for following their lawful occupations

184 let him not beg from the relatives of his teacher nor from his own or his mothers bloodrelations but if there are no houses belonging to strangers let him go to one of those named above taking the lastnamed first

185 or if there are no virtuous men of the kind mentioned above he may go to each house in the village being pure and remaining silent but let him avoid abhisastas those accused of mortal sin

186 having brought sacred fuel from a distance let him place it anywhere but on the ground and let him unwearied make with it burnt oblations to the sacred fire both evening and morning

187 he who without being sick neglects during seven successive days to go out begging and to offer fuel in the sacred fire shall perform the penance of an avakirnin one who has broken his vow

188 he who performs the vow of studentship shall constantly subsist on alms but not eat the food of one person only the subsistence of a student on begged food is declared to be equal in merit to fasting

189 at his pleasure he may eat when invited the food of one man at a rite in honour of the gods observing however the conditions on his vow or at a funeral meal in honor of the manes behaving however like a hermit

190 this duty is prescribed by the wise for a brahmana only but no such duty is ordained for a kshatriya and a vaisya

191 both when ordered by his teacher and without a special command a student shall always exert himself in studying the veda and in doing what is serviceable to his teacher

192 controlling his body his speech his organs of sense and his mind let him stand with joined hands looking at the face of his teacher

193 let him always keep his right arm uncovered behave decently and keep his body well covered and when he is addressed with the words be seated he shall sit down facing his teacher

194 in the presence of his teacher let him always eat less wear a less valuable dress and ornaments than the former and let him rise earlier from his bed and go to rest later

195 let him not answer or converse with his teacher reclining on a bed nor sitting nor eating nor standing nor with an averted face

196 let him do that standing up if his teacher is seated advancing towards him when he stands going to meet him if he advances and running after him when he runs

197 going round to face the teacher if his face is averted approaching him if he stands at a distance but bending towards him if he lies on a bed and if he stands in a lower place

198 when his teacher is nigh let his bed or seat be low but within sight of his teacher he shall not sit carelessly at ease

199 let him not pronounce the mere name of his teacher without adding an honorific title behind his back even and let him not mimic his gait speech and deportment

200 wherever people justly censure or falsely defame his teacher there he must cover his ears or depart thence to another place

201 by censuring his teacher though justly he will become in his next birth an ass by falsely defaming him a dog he who lives on his teachers substance will become a worm and he who is envious of his merit a larger insect

202 he must not serve the teacher by the intervention of another while he himself stands aloof nor when he himself is angry nor when a woman is near if he is seated in a carriage or on a raised seat he must descend and afterwards salute his teacher

203 let him not sit with his teacher to the leeward or to the windward of him nor let him say anything which his teacher cannot hear

204 he may sit with his teacher in a carriage drawn by oxen horses or camels on a terrace on a bed of grass or leaves on a mat on a rock on a wooden bench or in a boat

205 if his teachers teacher is near let him behave towards him as towards his own teacher but let him unless he has received permission from his teacher not salute venerable persons of his own family

206 this is likewise ordained as his constant behaviour towards other instructors in science towards his relatives to whom honour is due towards all who may restrain him from sin or may give him salutary advice

207 towards his betters let him always behave as towards his teacher likewise towards sons of his teacher born by wives of equal caste and towards the teachers relatives both on the side of the father and of the mother

208 the son of the teacher who imparts instruction in his fathers stead whether younger or of equal age or a student of the science of sacrifices or of other angas deserves the same honour as the teacher

209 a student must not shampoo the limbs of his teachers son nor assist him in bathing nor eat the fragments of his food nor wash his feet

210 the wives of the teacher who belong to the same caste must be treated as respectfully as the teacher but those who belong to a different caste must be honoured by rising and salutation

211 let him not perform for a wife of his teacher the offices of anointing her assisting her in the bath shampooing her limbs or arranging her hair

212 a pupil who is full twenty years old and knows what is becoming and unbecoming shall not salute a young wife of his teacher by clasping her feet

213 it is the nature of women to seduce men in this world for that reason the wise are never unguarded in the company of females

214 for women are able to lead astray in this world not only a fool but even a learned man and to make him a slave of desire and anger

215 one should not sit in a lonely place with ones mother sister or daughter for the senses are powerful and master even a learned man

216 but at his pleasure a young student may prostrate himself on the ground before the young wife of a teacher in accordance with the rule and say i n n worship thee o lady

217 on returning from a journey he must clasp the feet of his teachers wife and daily salute her in the manner just mentioned remembering the duty of the virtuous

218 as the man who digs with a spade into the ground obtains water even so an obedient pupil obtains the knowledge which lies hidden in his teacher

219 a student may either shave his head or wear his hair in braids or braid one lock on the crown of his head the sun must never set or rise while he lies asleep in the village

220 if the sun should rise or set while he is sleeping be it that he offended intentionally or unintentionally he shall fast during the next day muttering the savitri

221 for he who lies sleeping while the sun sets or rises and does not perform that penance is tainted by great guilt

222 purified by sipping water he shall daily worship during both twilights with a concentrated mind in a pure place muttering the prescribed text according to the rule

223 if a woman or a man of low caste perform anything leading to happiness let him diligently practise it as well as any other permitted act in which his heart finds pleasure

224 some declare that the chief good consists in the acquisition of spiritual merit and wealth others place it in the gratification of desire and the acquisition of wealth others in the acquisition of spiritual merit alone and others say that the acquisition of wealth alone is the chief good here below but the correct decision is that it consists of the aggregate of those three

225 the teacher the father the mother and an elder brother must not be treated with disrespect especially by a brahmana though one be grievously offended by them

226 the teacher is the image of brahman the father the image of pragipati the lord of created beings the mother the image of the earth and an elder full brother the image of oneself

227 that trouble and pain which the parents undergo on the birth of their children cannot be compensated even in a hundred years

228 let him always do what is agreeable to those two and always what may please his teacher when those three are pleased he obtains all those rewards which austerities yield

229 obedience towards those three is declared to be the best form of austerity let him not perform other meritorious acts without their permission

230 for they are declared to be the three worlds they the three principal orders they the three vedas and they the three sacred fires

231 the father forsooth is stated to be the garhapatya fire the mother the dakshinagni but the teacher the ahavaniya fire this triad of fires is most venerable

232 he who neglects not those three even after he has become a householder will conquer the three worlds and radiant in body like a god he will enjoy bliss in heaven

233 by honouring his mother he gains this nether world by honouring his father the middle sphere but by obedience to his teacher the world of brahman

234 all duties have been fulfilled by him who honours those three but to him who honours them not all rites remain fruitless

235 as long as those three live so long let him not independently perform any other meritorious acts let him always serve them rejoicing to do what is agreeable and beneficial to them

236 he shall inform them of everything that with their consent he may perform in thought word or deed for the sake of the next world

237 by honouring these three all that ought to be done by man is accomplished that is clearly the highest duty every other act is a subordinate duty

238 he who possesses faith may receive pure learning even from a man of lower caste the highest law even from the lowest and an excellent wife even from a base family

239 even from poison nectar may be taken even from a child good advice even from a foe a lesson in good conduct and even from an impure substance gold

240 excellent wives learning the knowledge of the law the rules of purity good advice and various arts may be acquired from anybody

241 it is prescribed that in times of distress a student may learn the veda from one who is not a brahmana and that he shall walk behind and serve such a teacher as long as the instruction lasts

242 he who desires incomparable bliss in heaven shall not dwell during his whole life in the house of a nonbrahmanical teacher nor with a brahmana who does not know the whole veda and the angas

243 but if a student desires to pass his whole life in the teachers house he must diligently serve him until he is freed from this body

244 a brahmana who serves his teacher till the dissolution of his body reaches forthwith the eternal mansion of brahman

245 he who knows the sacred law must not present any gift to his teacher before the samavartana but when with the permission of his teacher he is about to take the final bath let him procure a present for the venerable man according to his ability

246 viz a field gold a cow a horse a parasol and shoes a seat grain even vegetables and thus give pleasure to his teacher

247 a perpetual student must if his teacher dies serve his son provided he be endowed with good qualities or his widow or his sapinda in the same manner as the teacher

248 should none of these be alive he must serve the sacred fire standing by day and sitting during the night and thus finish his life

249 a brahmana who thus passes his life as a student without breaking his vow reaches after death the highest abode and will not be born again in this world



chapter iii

1 the vow of studying the three vedas under a teacher must be kept for thirtysix years or for half that time or for a quarter or until the student has perfectly learnt them

2 a student who has studied in due order the three vedas or two or even one only without breaking the rules of studentship shall enter the order of householders

3 he who is famous for the strict performance of his duties and has received his heritage the veda from his father shall be honoured sitting on a couch and adorned with a garland with the present of a cow and the honeymixture

4 having bathed with the permission of his teacher and performed according to the rule the samavartana the rite on returning home a twiceborn man shall marry a wife of equal caste who is endowed with auspicious bodily marks

5 a damsel who is neither a sapinda on the mothers side nor belongs to the same family on the fathers side is recommended to twiceborn men for wedlock and conjugal union

6 in connecting himself with a wife let him carefully avoid the ten following families be they ever so great or rich in kine horses sheep grain or other property

7 viz one which neglects the sacred rites one in which no male children are born one in which the veda is not studied one the members of which have thick hair on the body those which are subject to hemorrhoids phthisis weakness of digestion epilepsy or white or black leprosy

8 let him not marry a maiden with reddish hair nor one who has a redundant member nor one who is sickly nor one either with no hair on the body or too much nor one who is garrulous or has red eyes

9 nor one named after a constellation a tree or a river nor one bearing the name of a low caste or of a mountain nor one named after a bird a snake or a slave nor one whose name inspires terror

10 let him wed a female free from bodily defects who has an agreeable name the graceful gait of a hamsa or of an elephant a moderate quantity of hair on the body and on the head small teeth and soft limbs

11 but a prudent man should not marry a maiden who has no brother nor one whose father is not known through fear lest in the former case she be made an appointed daughter and in the latter lest he should commit sin

12 for the first marriage of twiceborn men wives of equal caste are recommended but for those who through desire proceed to marry again the following females chosen according to the direct order of the castes are most approved

13 it is declared that a sudra woman alone can be the wife of a sudra she and one of his own caste the wives of a vaisya those two and one of his own caste the wives of a kshatriya those three and one of his own caste the wives of a brahmana

14 a sudra woman is not mentioned even in any ancient story as the first wife of a brahmana or of a kshatriya though they lived in the greatest distress

15 twiceborn men who in their folly wed wives of the low sudra caste soon degrade their families and their children to the state of sudras

16 according to atri and to gautama the son of utathya he who weds a sudra woman becomes an outcast according to saunaka on the birth of a son and according to bhrigu he who has male offspring from a sudra female alone

17 a brahmana who takes a sudra wife to his bed will after death sink into hell if he begets a child by her he will lose the rank of a brahmana

18 the manes and the gods will not eat the offerings of that man who performs the rites in honour of the gods of the manes and of guests chiefly with a sudra wifes assistance and such a man will not go to heaven

19 for him who drinks the moisture of a sudras lips who is tainted by her breath and who begets a son on her no expiation is prescribed

20 now listen to the brief description of the following eight marriagerites used by the four castes varna which partly secure benefits and partly produce evil both in this life and after death

21 they are the rite of brahman brahma that of the gods daiva that of the rishis arsha that of pragapati pragapatya that of the asuras asura that of the gandharvas gandharva that of the rhashasas rakshasa and that of the pisakas paisaka

22 which is lawful for each caste varna and which are the virtues or faults of each rite all this i will declare to you as well as their good and evil results with respect to the offspring

23 one may know that the first six according to the order followed above are lawful for a brahmana the four last for a kshatriya and the same four excepting the rakshasa rite for a vaisya and a sudra

24 the sages state that the first four are approved in the case of a brahmana one the rakshasa rite in the case of a kshatriya and the asura marriage in that of a vaisya and of a sudra

25 but in these institutes of the sacred law three of the five last are declared to be lawful and two unlawful the paisaka and the asura rites must never be used

26 for kshatriyas those beforementioned two rites the gandharva and the rakshasa whether separate or mixed are permitted by the sacred tradition

27 the gift of a daughter after decking her with costly garments and honouring her by presents of jewels to a man learned in the veda and of good conduct whom the father himself invites is called the brahma rite

28 the gift of a daughter who has been decked with ornaments to a priest who duly officiates at a sacrifice during the course of its performance they call the daiva rite

29 when the father gives away his daughter according to the rule after receiving from the bridegroom for the fulfilment of the sacred law a cow and a bull or two pairs that is named the arsha rite

30 the gift of a daughter by her father after he has addressed the couple with the text may both of you perform together your duties and has shown honour to the bridegroom is called in the smriti the pragapatya rite

31 when the bridegroom receives a maiden after having given as much wealth as he can afford to the kinsmen and to the bride herself according to his own will that is called the asura rite

32 the voluntary union of a maiden and her lover one must know to be the gandharva rite which springs from desire and has sexual intercourse for its purpose

33 the forcible abduction of a maiden from her home while she cries out and weeps after her kinsmen have been slain or wounded and their houses broken open is called the rakshasa rite

34 when a man by stealth seduces a girl who is sleeping intoxicated or disordered in intellect that is the eighth the most base and sinful rite of the pisakas

35 the gift of daughters among brahmanas is most approved if it is preceded by a libation of water but in the case of other castes it may be performed by the expression of mutual consent

36 listen now to me ye brahmanas while i fully declare what quality has been ascribed by manu to each of these marriagerites

37 the son of a wife wedded according to the brahma rite if he performs meritorious acts liberates from sin ten ancestors ten descendants and himself as the twentyfirst

38 the son born of a wife wedded according to the daiva rite likewise saves seven ancestors and seven descendants the son of a wife married by the arsha rite three in the ascending and descending lines and the son of a wife married by the rite of ka pragapati six in either line

39 from the four marriages enumerated successively which begin with the brahma rite spring sons radiant with knowledge of the veda and honoured by the sishtas good men

40 endowded with the qualities of beauty and goodness possessing wealth and fame obtaining as many enjoyments as they desire and being most righteous they will live a hundred years

41 but from the remaining four blamable marriages spring sons who are cruel and speakers of untruth who hate the veda and the sacred law

42 in the blameless marriages blameless children are born to men in blamable marriages blamable offspring one should therefore avoid the blamable forms of marriage

43 the ceremony of joining the hands is prescribed for marriages with women of equal caste varna know that the following rule applies to weddings with females of a different caste varna

44 on marrying a man of a higher caste a kshatriya bride must take hold of an arrow a vaisya bride of a goad and a sudra female of the hem of the bridegrooms garment

45 let the husband approach his wife in due season being constantly satisfied with her alone he may also being intent on pleasing her approach her with a desire for conjugal union on any day excepting the parvans

46 sixteen days and nights in each month including four days which differ from the rest and are censured by the virtuous are called the natural season of women

47 but among these the first four the eleventh and the thirteenth are declared to be forbidden the remaining nights are recommended

48 on the even nights sons are conceived and daughters on the uneven ones hence a man who desires to have sons should approach his wife in due season on the even nights

49 a male child is produced by a greater quantity of male seed a female child by the prevalence of the female if both are equal a hermaphrodite or a boy and a girl if both are weak or deficient in quantity a failure of conception results

50 he who avoids women on the six forbidden nights and on eight others is equal in chastity to a student in whichever order he may live

51 no father who knows the law must take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter for a man who through avarice takes a gratuity is a seller of his offspring

52 but those male relations who in their folly live on the separate property of women eg appropriate the beasts of burden carriages and clothes of women commit sin and will sink into hell

53 some call the cow and the bull given at an arsha wedding a gratuity but that is wrong since the acceptance of a fee be it small or great is a sale of the daughter

54 when the relatives do not appropriate for their use the gratuity given it is not a sale in that case the gift is only a token of respect and of kindness towards the maidens

55 women must be honoured and adorned by their fathers brothers husbands and brothersinlaw who desire their own welfare

56 where women are honoured there the gods are pleased but where they are not honoured no sacred rite yields rewards

57 where the female relations live in grief the family soon wholly perishes but that family where they are not unhappy ever prospers

58 the houses on which female relations not being duly honoured pronounce a curse perish completely as if destroyed by magic

59 hence men who seek their own welfare should always honour women on holidays and festivals with gifts of ornaments clothes and dainty food

60 in that family where the husband is pleased with his wife and the wife with her husband happiness will assuredly be lasting

61 for if the wife is not radiant with beauty she will not attract her husband but if she has no attractions for him no children will be born

62 if the wife is radiant with beauty the whole house is bright but if she is destitute of beauty all will appear dismal

63 by low marriages by omitting the performance of sacred rites by neglecting the study of the veda and by irreverence towards brahmanas great families sink low

64 by practising handicrafts by pecuniary transactions by begetting children on sudra females only by trading in cows horses and carriages by the pursuit of agriculture and by taking service under a king

65 by sacrificing for men unworthy to offer sacrifices and by denying the future rewards for good works families deficient in the knowledge of the veda quickly perish

66 but families that are rich in the knowledge of the veda though possessing little wealth are numbered among the great and acquire great fame

67 with the sacred fire kindled at the wedding a householder shall perform according to the law the domestic ceremonies and the five great sacrifices and with that he shall daily cook his food

68 a householder has five slaughterhouses as it were viz the hearth the grindingstone the broom the pestle and mortar the watervessel by using which he is bound with the fetters of sin

69 in order to successively expiate the offences committed by means of all these five the great sages have prescribed for householders the daily performance of the five great sacrifices

70 teaching and studying is the sacrifice offered to brahman the offerings of water and food called tarpana the sacrifice to the manes the burnt oblation the sacrifice offered to the gods the bali offering that offered to the bhutas and the hospitable reception of guests the offering to men

71 he who neglects not these five great sacrifices while he is able to perform them is not tainted by the sins committed in the five places of slaughter though he constantly lives in the order of house holders

72 but he who does not feed these five the gods his guests those whom he is bound to maintain the manes and himself lives not though he breathes

73 they call these five sacrifices also ahuta huta prahuta brahmyahuta and prasita

74 ahuta not offered in the fire is the muttering of vedic texts huta the burnt oblation offered to the gods prahuta offered by scattering it on the ground the bali offering given to the bhutas brahmyahuta offered in the digestive fire of brahmanas the respectful reception of brahmana guests and prasita eaten the daily oblation to the manes called tarpana

75 let every man in this second order at least daily apply himself to the private recitation of the veda and also to the performance of the offering to the gods for he who is diligent in the performance of sacrifices supports both the movable and the immovable creation

76 an oblation duly thrown into the fire reaches the sun from the sun comes rain from rain food therefrom the living creatures derive their subsistence

77 as all living creatures subsist by receiving support from air even so the members of all orders subsist by receiving support from the householder

78 because men of the three other orders are daily supported by the householder with gifts of sacred knowledge and food therefore the order of householders is the most excellent order

79 the duties of this order which cannot be practised by men with weak organs must be carefully observed by him who desires imperishable bliss in heaven and constant happiness in this life

80 the sages the manes the gods the bhutas and guests ask the householders for offerings and gifts hence he who knows the law must give to them what is due to each

81 let him worship according to the rule the sages by the private recitation of the veda the gods by burnt oblations the manes by funeral offerings sraddha men by gifts of food and the bhutas by the bali offering

82 let him daily perform a funeral sacrifice with food or with water or also with milk roots and fruits and thus please the manes

83 let him feed even one brahmana in honour of the manes at the sraddha which belongs to the five great sacrifices but let him not feed on that occasion any brahmana on account of the vaisvadeva offering

84 a brahmana shall offer according to the rule of his grihyasutra a portion of the cooked food destined for the vaisvadeva in the sacred domestic fire to the following deities

85 first to agni and next to soma then to both these gods conjointly further to all the gods visve devah and then to dhanvantari

86 further to kuhu the goddess of the newmoon day to anumati the goddess of the fullmoon day to pragapati the lord of creatures to heaven and earth conjointly and finally to agni svishtakrit the fire which performs the sacrifice well

87 after having thus duly offered the sacrificial food let him throw bali offerings in all directions of the compass proceeding from the east to the south to indra yama varuna and soma as well as to the servants of these deities

88 saying adoration to the maruts he shall scatter some food near the door and some in water saying adoration to the waters he shall throw some on the pestle and the mortar speaking thus adoration to the trees

89 near the head of the bed he shall make an offering to sri fortune and near the foot of his bed to bhadrakali in the centre of the house let him place a bali for brahman and for vastoshpati the lord of the dwelling conjointly

90 let him throw up into the air a bali for all the gods and in the daytime one for the goblins roaming about by day and in the evening one for the goblins that walk at night

91 in the upper story let him offer a bali to sarvatmabhuti but let him throw what remains from these offerings in a southerly direction for the manes

92 let him gently place on the ground some food for dogs outcasts kandalas svapak those afflicted with diseases that are punishments of former sins crows and insects

93 that brahmana who thus daily honours all beings goes endowed with a resplendent body by a straight road to the highest dwellingplace ie brahman

94 having performed this bali offering he shall first feed his guest and according to the rule give alms to an ascetic and to a student

95 a twiceborn householder gains by giving alms the same reward for his meritorious act which a student obtains for presenting in accordance with the rule a cow to his teacher

96 let him give in accordance with the rule to a brahmana who knows the true meaning of the veda even a small portion of food as alms or a pot full of water having garnished the food with seasoning or the pot with flowers and fruit

97 the oblations to gods and manes made by men ignorant of the law of gifts are lost if the givers in their folly present shares of them to brahmanas who are mere ashes

98 an offering made in the mouthfire of brahmanas rich in sacred learning and austerities saves from misfortune and from great guilt

99 but let him offer in accordance with the rule to a guest who has come of his own accord a seat and water as well as food garnished with seasoning according to his ability

100 a brahmana who stays unhonoured in the house takes away with him all the spiritual merit even of a man who subsists by gleaning ears of corn or offers oblations in five fires

101 grass room for resting water and fourthly a kind word these things never fail in the houses of good men

102 but a brahmana who stays one night only is declared to be a guest atithi for because he stays sthita not long anityam he is called atithi a guest

103 one must not consider as a guest a brahmana who dwells in the same village nor one who seeks his livelihood by social intercourse even though he has come to a house where there is a wife and where sacred fires are kept

104 those foolish householders who constantly seek to live on the food of others become in consequence of that baseness after death the cattle of those who give them food

105 a guest who is sent by the setting sun in the evening must not be driven away by a householder whether he have come at supper time or at an inopportune moment he must not stay in the house without entertainment

106 let him not eat any dainty food which he does not offer to his guest the hospitable reception of guests procures wealth fame long life and heavenly bliss

107 let him offer to his guests seats rooms beds attendance on departure and honour while they stay to the most distinguished in the best form to the lower ones in a lower form to equals in an equal manner

108 but if another guest comes after the vaisvadeva offering has been finished the householder must give him food according to his ability but not repeat the bali offering

109 a brahmana shall not name his family and vedic gotra in order to obtain a meal for he who boasts of them for the sake of a meal is called by the wise a foul feeder vantasin

110 but a kshatriya who comes to the house of a brahmana is not called a guest atithi nor a vaisya nor a sudra nor a personal friend nor a relative nor the teacher

111 but if a kshatriya comes to the house of a brahmana in the manner of a guest the householder may feed him according to his desire after the abovementioned brahmanas have eaten

112 even a vaisya and a sudra who have approached his house in the manner of guests he may allow to eat with his servants showing thereby his compassionate disposition

113 even to others personal friends and so forth who have come to his house out of affection he may give food garnished with seasoning according to his ability at the same time with his wife

114 without hesitation he may give food even before his guests to the following persons viz to newlymarried women to infants to the sick and to pregnant women

115 but the foolish man who eats first without having given food to these persons does while he crams not know that after death he himself will be devoured by dogs and vultures

116 after the brahmanas the kinsmen and the servants have dined the householder and his wife may afterwards eat what remains

117 having honoured the gods the sages men the manes and the guardian deities of the house the householder shall eat afterwards what remains

118 he who prepares food for himself alone eats nothing but sin for it is ordained that the food which remains after the performance of the sacrifices shall be the meal of virtuous men

119 let him honour with the honeymixture a king an officiating priest a snataka the teacher a soninlaw a fatherinlaw and a maternal uncle if they come again after a full year has elapsed since their last visit

120 a king and a srotriya who come on the performance of a sacrifice must be honoured with the honeymixture but not if no sacrifice is being performed that is a settled rule

121 but the wife shall offer in the evening a portion of the dressed food as a balioblation without the recitation of sacred formulas for that rite which is called the vaisvadeva is prescribed both for the morning and the evening

122 after performing the pitriyagna a brahmana who keeps a sacred fire shall offer month by month on the newmoon day the funeral sacrifice sraddha called pindanvaharyaka

123 the wise call the monthly funeral offering to the manes anvaharya to be offered after the cakes and that must be carefully performed with the approved sorts of flesh mentioned below

124 i will fully declare what and how many brahmanas must be fed on that occasion who must be avoided and on what kinds of food they shall dine

125 one must feed two brahmanas at the offering to the gods and three at the offering to the manes or one only on either occasion even a very wealthy man shall not be anxious to entertain a large company

126 a large company destroys these five advantages the respectful treatment of the invited the propriety of place and time purity and the selection of virtuous brahmana guests he therefore shall not seek to entertain a large company

127 famed is this rite for the dead called the sacrifice sacred to the manes and performed on the newmoon day if a man is diligent in performing that the reward of the rite for the dead which is performed according to smarta rules reaches him constantly

128 oblations to the gods and manes must be presented by the givers to a srotriya alone what is given to such a most worthy brahmana yields great reward

129 let him feed even one learned man at the sacrifice to the gods and one at the sacrifice to the manes thus he will gain a rich reward not if he entertains many who are unacquainted with the veda

130 let him make inquiries even regarding the remote ancestors of a brahmana who has studied an entire recension of the veda if descended from a virtuous race such a man is a worthy recipient of gifts consisting of food offered to the gods or to the manes he is declared to procure as great rewards as a guest atithi

131 though a million of men unaquainted with the rikas were to dine at a funeral sacrifice yet a single man learned in the veda who is satisfied with his entertainment is worth them all as far as the production of spiritual merit is concerned

132 food sacred to the manes or to the gods must be given to a man distinguished by sacred knowledge for hands smeared with blood cannot be cleansed with blood

133 as many mouthfuls as an ignorant man swallows at a sacrifice to the gods or to the manes so many redhot spikes spears and iron balls must the giver of the repast swallow after death

134 some brahmanas are devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and others to the performance of austerities some to austerities and to the recitation of the veda and others to the performance of sacred rites

135 oblations to the manes ought to be carefully presented to those devoted to knowledge but offerings to the gods in accordance with the reason of the sacred law to men of all the four abovementioned classes

136 if there is a father ignorant of the sacred texts whose son has learned one whole recension of the veda and the angas and a son ignorant of the sacred texts whose father knows an entire recension of the veda and the angas

137 know that he whose father knows the veda is the more venerable one of the two yet the other one is worthy of honour because respect is due to the veda which he has learned

138 let him not entertain a personal friend at a funeral sacrifice he may gain his affection by other valuable gifts let him feed at a sraddha a brahmana whom he considers neither as a foe nor as a friend

139 he who performs funeral sacrifices and offerings to the gods chiefly for the sake of gaining friends reaps after death no reward for sraddhas and sacrifices

140 that meanest among twiceborn men who in his folly contracts friendships through a funeral sacrifice loses heaven because he performed a sraddha for the sake of friendship

141 a gift of food by twiceborn men consumed with friends and relatives is said to be offered to the pisakas it remains in this world alone like a blind cow in one stable

142 as a husbandman reaps no harvest when he has sown the seed in barren soil even so the giver of sacrificial food gains no reward if he presented it to a man unacquainted with the rikas

143 but a present made in accordance with the rules to a learned man makes the giver and the recipient partakers of rewards both in this life and after death

144 if no learned brahmana be at hand he may rather honour a virtuous friend than an enemy though the latter may be qualified by learning and so forth for sacrificial food eaten by a foe bears no reward after death

145 let him take pains to feed at a sraddha an adherent of the rigveda who has studied one entire recension of that veda or a follower of the yagurveda who has finished one sakha or a singer of samans who likewise has completed the study of an entire recension

146 if one of these three dines duly honoured at a funeral sacrifice the ancestors of him who gives the feast as far as the seventh person will be satisfied for a very long time

147 this is the chief rule to be followed in offering sacrifices to the gods and manes know that the virtuous always observe the following subsidiary rule

148 one may also entertain on such occasions ones maternal grandfather a maternal uncle a sisters son a fatherinlaw ones teacher a daughters son a daughters husband a cognate kinsman ones own officiating priest or a man for whom one offers sacrifices

149 for a rite sacred to the gods he who knows the law will not make too close inquiries regarding an invited brahmana but when one performs a ceremony in honour of the manes one must carefully examine the qualities and parentage of the guest

150 manu has declared that those brahmanas who are thieves outcasts eunuchs or atheists are unworthy to partake of oblations to the gods and manes

151 let him not entertain at a sraddha one who wears his hair in braids a student one who has not studied the veda one afflicted with a skindisease a gambler nor those who sacrifice for a multitude of sacrificers

152 physicians templepriests sellers of meat and those who subsist by shopkeeping must be avoided at sacrifices offered to the gods and to the manes

153 a paid servant of a village or of a king man with deformed nails or black teeth one who opposes his teacher one who has forsaken the sacred fire and a usurer

154 one suffering from consumption one who subsists by tending cattle a younger brother who marries or kindles the sacred fire before the elder one who neglects the five great sacrifices an enemy of the brahmana race an elder brother who marries or kindles the sacred fire after the younger and one who belongs to a company or corporation

155 an actor or singer one who has broken the vow of studentship one whose only or first wife is a sudra female the son of a remarried woman a oneeyed man and he in whose house a paramour of his wife resides

156 he who teaches for a stipulated fee and he who is taught on that condition he who instructs sudra pupils and he whose teacher is a sudra he who speaks rudely the son of an adulteress and the son of a widow

157 he who forsakes his mother his father or a teacher without a sufficient reason he who has contracted an alliance with outcasts either through the veda or through a marriage

158 an incendiary a prisoner he who eats the food given by the son of an adulteress a seller of soma he who undertakes voyages by sea a bard an oilman a suborner to perjury

159 he who wrangles or goes to law with his father the keeper of a gamblinghouse a drunkard he who is afflicted with a disease in punishment of former crimes he who is accused of a mortal sin a hypocrite a seller of substances used for flavouring food

160 a maker of bows and of arrows he who lasciviously dallies with a brothers widow the betrayer of a friend one who subsists by gambling he who learns the veda from his son

161 an epileptic man who suffers from scrofulous swellings of the glands one afflicted with white leprosy an informer a madman a blind man and he who cavils at the veda must all be avoided

162 a trainer of elephants oxen horses or camels he who subsists by astrology a birdfancier and he who teaches the use of arms

163 he who diverts watercourses and he who delights in obstructing them an architect a messenger and he who plants trees for money

164 a breeder of sportingdogs a falconer one who defiles maidens he who delights in injuring living creatures he who gains his subsistence from sudras and he who offers sacrifices to the ganas

165 he who does not follow the rule of conduct a man destitute of energy like a eunuch one who constantly asks for favours he who lives by agriculture a clubfooted man and he who is censured by virtuous men

166 a shepherd a keeper of buffaloes the husband of a remarried woman and a carrier of dead bodies all these must be carefully avoided

167 a brahmana who knows the sacred law should shun at sacrifices both to the gods and to the manes these lowest of twiceborn men whose conduct is reprehensible and who are unworthy to sit in the company at a repast

168 as a fire of dry grass is unable to consume the offerings and is quickly extinguished even so is it with an unlearned brahmana sacrificial food must not be given to him since it would be offered in ashes

169 i will fully declare what result the giver obtains after death if he gives food destined for the gods or manes to a man who is unworthy to sit in the company

170 the rakshasas indeed consume the food eaten by brahmanas who have not fulfilled the vow of studentship by a parivettri and so forth and by other men not admissible into the company

171 he must be considered as a parivettri who marries or begins the performance of the agnihotra before his elder brother but the latter as a parivitti

172 the elder brother who marries after the younger the younger brother who marries before the elder the female with whom such a marriage is contracted he who gives her away and the sacrificing priest as the fifth all fall into hell

173 he who lasciviously dallies with the widow of a deceased brother though she be appointed to bear a child by him in accordance with the sacred law must be known to be a didhishupati

174 two kinds of sons a kunda and a golaka are born by wives of other men he who is born while the husband lives will be a kunda and he who is begotten after the husbands death a golaka

175 but those two creatures who are born of wives of other men cause to the giver the loss of the rewards both in this life and after death for the food sacred to gods or manes which has been given to them

176 the foolish giver of a funeral repast does not reap the reward for as many worthy guests as a man inadmissible into company can look on while they are feeding

177 a blind man by his presence causes to the giver of the feast the loss of the reward for ninety guests a oneeyed man for sixty one who suffers from white leprosy for a hundred and one punished by a terrible disease for a thousand

178 the giver of a sraddha loses the reward due for such a nonsacrificial gift for as many brahmanas as a guest who sacrifices for sudras may touch during the meal with his limbs

179 and if a brahmana though learned in the veda accepts through covetousness a gift from such a man he will quickly perish like a vessel of unburnt clay in water

180 food given to a seller of soma becomes ordure that given to a physician pus and blood but that presented to a templepriest is lost and that given to a usurer finds no place in the world of the gods

181 what has been given to a brahmana who lives by trade that is not useful in this world and the next and a present to a brahmana born of a remarried woman resembles an oblation thrown into ashes

182 but the wise declare that the food which is offered to other unholy inadmissible men enumerated above is turned into adipose secretions blood flesh marrow and bone

183 now hear by what chief of twiceborn men a company defiled by the presence of unworthy guests is purified and the full description of the brahmanas who sanctify a company

184 those men must be considered as the sanctifiers of a company who are most learned in all the vedas and in all the angas and who are the descendants of srotriyas

185 a trinakiketa one who keeps five sacred fires a trisuparna one who is versed in the six angas the son of a woman married according to the brahma rite one who sings the gyeshthasaman

186 one who knows the meaning of the veda and he who expounds it a student one who has given a thousand cows and a centenarian must be considered as brahmanas who sanctify a company

187 on the day before the sraddharite is performed or on the day when it takes place let him invite with due respect at least three brahmanas such as have been mentioned above

188 a brahmana who has been invited to a rite in honour of the manes shall always control himself and not recite the veda and he who performs the sraddha must act in the same manner

189 for the manes attend the invited brahmanas follow them when they walk like the wind and sit near them when they are seated

190 but a brahmana who being duly invited to a rite in honour of the gods or of the manes in any way breaks the appointment becomes guilty of a crime and in his next birth a hog

191 but he who being invited to a sraddha dallies with a sudra woman takes upon himself all the sins which the giver of the feast committed

192 the manes are primeval deities free from anger careful of purity ever chaste averse from strife and endowed with great virtues

193 now learn fully from whom all these manes derive their origin and with what ceremonies they ought to be worshipped

194 the various classes of the manes are declared to be the sons of all those sages mariki and the rest who are children of manu the son of hiranyagarbha

195 the somasads the sons of virag are stated to be the manes of the sadhyas and the agnishvattas the children of mariki are famous in the world as the manes of the gods

196 the barhishads born of atri are recorded to be the manes of the daityas danavas yakshas gandharvas snakedeities rakshasas suparnas and a kimnaras

197 the somapas those of the brahmanas the havirbhugs those of the kshatriyas the agyapas those of the vaisyas but the sukalins those of the sudras

198 the somapas are the sons of kavi bhrigu the havishmats the children of angiras the agyapas the offspring of pulastya but the sukalins the issue of vasishtha

199 one should know that other classes the agnidagdhas the anagnidagdhas the kavyas the barhishads the agnishvattas and the saumyas are the manes of the brahmanas alone

200 but know also that there exist in this world countless sons and grandsons of those chief classes of manes which have been enumerated

201 from the sages sprang the manes from the manes the gods and the danavas but from the gods the whole world both the movable and the immovable in due order

202 even water offered with faith to the manes in vessels made of silver or adorned with silver produces endless bliss

203 for twiceborn men the rite in honour of the manes is more important than the rite in honour of the gods for the offering to the gods which precedes the sraddhas has been declared to be a means of fortifying the latter

204 let him first invite a brahmana in honour of the gods as a protection for the offering to the manes for the rakshasas destroy a funeral sacrifice which is left without such a protection

205 let him make the sraddha begin and end with a rite in honour of the gods it shall not begin and end with a rite to the manes for he who makes it begin and end with a rite in honour of the manes soon perishes together with his progeny

206 let him smear a pure and secluded place with cowdung and carefully make it sloping towards the south

207 the manes are always pleased with offerings made in open naturally pure places on the banks of rivers and in secluded spots

208 the sacrificer shall make the invited brahmanas who have duly performed their ablutions sit down on separate prepared seats on which blades of kusa grass have been placed

209 having placed those blameless brahmanas on their seats he shall honour them with fragrant garlands and perfumes beginning with those who are invited in honour of the gods

210 having presented to them water sesamum grains and blades of kusa grass the brahmana sacrificer shall offer oblations in the sacred fire after having received permission to do so from all the brahmana guests conjointly

211 having first according to the rule performed as a means of protecting the sraddha oblations to agni to soma and to yama let him afterwards satisfy the manes by a gift of sacrificial food

212 but if no sacred fire is available he shall place the offerings into the hand of a brahmana for brahmanas who know the sacred texts declare what fire is even such is a brahmana

213 they also call those first of twiceborn men the ancient deities of the funeral sacrifice free from anger easily pleased employed in making men prosper

214 after he has performed the oblations in the fire and the whole series of ceremonies in such a manner that they end in the south let him sprinkle water with his right hand on the spot where the cakes are to be placed

215 but having made three cakes out of the remainder of that sacrificial food he must concentrating his mind and turning towards the south place them on kusa grass exactly in the same manner in which he poured out the libations of water

216 having offered those cakes according to the prescribed rule being pure let him wipe the same hand with the roots of those blades of kusa grass for the sake of the three ancestors who partake of the wipings lepa

217 having next sipped water turned round towards the north and thrice slowly suppressed his breath the sacrificer who knows the sacred texts shall worship the guardian deities of the six seasons and the manes

218 let him gently pour out the remainder of the water near the cakes and with fixed attention smell those cakes in the order in which they were placed on the ground

219 but taking successively very small portions from the cakes he shall make those seated brahmana eat them in accordance with the rule before their dinner

220 but if the sacrificers father is living he must offer the cakes to three remoter ancestors or he may also feed his father at the funeral sacrifice as one of the brahmana guests

221 but he whose father is dead while his grandfather lives shall after pronouncing his fathers name mention that of his greatgrandfather

222 manu has declared that either the grandfather may eat at that sraddha as a guest or the grandson having received permission may perform it as he desires

223 having poured water mixed with sesamum in which a blade of kusa grass has been placed into the hands of the guests he shall give to each that abovementioned portion of the cake saying to those svadha

224 but carrying the vessel filled with food with both hands the sacrificer himself shall gently place it before the brahmanas meditating on the manes

225 the malevolent asuras forcibly snatch away that food which is brought without being held with both hands

226 let him being pure and attentive carefully place on the ground the seasoning for the rice such as broths and pot herbs sweet and sour milk and honey

227 as well as various kinds of hard food which require mastication and of soft food roots fruits savoury meat and fragrant drinks

228 all this he shall present to his guests being pure and attentive successively invite them to partake of each dish proclaiming its qualities

229 let him on no account drop a tear become angry or utter an untruth nor let him touch the food with his foot nor violently shake it

230 a tear sends the food to the pretas anger to his enemies a falsehood to the dogs contact with his foot to the rakshasas a shaking to the sinners

231 whatever may please the brahmanas let him give without grudging it let him give riddles from the veda for that is agreeable to the manes

232 at a sacrifice in honour of the manes he must let his guests hear the veda the institutes of the sacred law legends tales puranas and khilas

233 himself being delighted let him give delight to the brahmanas cause them to partake gradually and slowly of each dish and repeatedly invite them to eat by offering the food and praising its qualities

234 let him eagerly entertain at a funeral sacrifice a daughters son though he be a student and let him place a nepal blanket on the on the seat of each guest scattering sesamum grains on the ground

235 there are three means of sanctification to be used at a sraddha a daughters son a nepal blanket and sesamum grains and they recommend three other things for it cleanliness suppression of anger and absence of haste

236 all the food must be very hot and the guests shall eat in silence even though asked by the giver of the feast the brahmanas shall not proclaim the qualities of the sacrificial food

237 as long as the food remains warm as long as they eat in silence as long as the qualities of the food are not proclaimed so long the manes partake of it

238 what a guest eats covering his head what he eats with his face turned towards the south what he eats with sandals on his feet that the rakshasas consume

239 a kandala a village pig a cock a dog a menstruating woman and a eunuch must not look at the brahmanas while they eat

240 what any of these sees at a burntoblation at a solemn gift at a dinner given to brahmanas or at any rite in honour of the gods and manes that produces not the intended result

241 a boar makes the rite useless by inhaling the smell of the offerings a cock by the air of his wings a dog by throwing his eye on them a lowcaste man by touching them

242 if a lame man a oneeyed man one deficient in a limb or one with a redundant limb be even the servant of the performer of the sraddha he must be removed from that place where the sraddha is held

243 to a brahmana householder or to an ascetic who comes for food he may with the permission of his brahmana guests show honour according to his ability

244 let him mix all the kinds of food together sprinkle them with water and put them scattering them on kusa grass down on the ground in front of his guests when they have finished their meal

245 the remnant in the dishes and the portion scattered on kusa grass shall be the share of deceased children who received not the sacrament of cremation and of those who unjustly forsook noble wives

246 they declare the fragments which have fallen on the ground at a sraddha to the manes to be the share of honest dutiful servants

247 but before the performance of the sapindikarana one must feed at the funeral sacrifice in honour of a recently deceased aryan one brahmana without making an offering to the gods and give one cake only

248 but after the sapindikarana of the deceased father has been performed according to the sacred law the sons must offer the cakes with those ceremonies described above

249 the foolish man who after having eaten a sraddha dinner gives the leavings to a sudra falls headlong into the kalasutra hell

250 if the partaker of a sraddha dinner enters on the same day the bed of a sudra female the manes of his ancestors will lie during that month in her ordure

251 having addressed the question have you dined well to his guests let him give water for sipping to them who are satisfied and dismiss them after they have sipped water with the words rest either here or at home

252 the brahmana guests shall then answer him let there be svadha for at all rites in honour of the manes the word svadha is the highest benison

253 next let him inform his guests who have finished their meal of the food which remains with the permission of the brahmanas let him dispose of that as they may direct

254 at a sraddha in honour of the manes one must use in asking of the guests if they are satisfied the word svaditam at a goshthisraddha the word susrutam at a vriddhisraddha the word sampannam and at a rite in honour of the gods the word rukitam

255 the afternoon kusa grass the due preparation of the dwelling sesamum grains liberality the careful preparation of the food and the company of distinguished brahmanas are true riches at all funeral sacrifices

256 know that kusa grass purificatory texts the morning sacrificial viands of all kinds and those means of purification mentioned above are blessings at a sacrifice to the gods

257 the food eaten by hermits in the forest milk somajuice meat which is not prepared with spices and salt unprepared by art are called on account of their nature sacrificial food

258 having dismissed the invited brahmanas let him with a concentrated mind silent and pure look towards the south and ask these blessings of the manes

259 may liberal men abound with us may our knowledge of the vedas and our progeny increase may faith not forsake us may we have much to give to the needy

260 having thus offered the cakes let him after the prayer cause a cow a brahmana a goat or the sacred fire to consume those cakes or let him throw them into water

261 some make the offering of the cakes after the dinner some cause them to be eaten by birds or throw them into fire or into water

262 the sacrificers first wife who is faithful and intent on the worship of the manes may eat the middlemost cake if she be desirous of bearing a son

263 thus she will bring forth a son who will be longlived famous intelligent rich the father of numerous offspring endowed with the quality of goodness and righteous

264 having washed his hands and sipped water let him prepare food for his paternal relations and after giving it to them with due respect let him feed his maternal relatives also

265 but the remnants shall be left where they lie until the brahmanas have been dismissed afterwards he shall perform the daily domestic balioffering that is a settled rule of the sacred law

266 i will now fully declare what kind of sacrificial food given to the manes according to the rule will serve for a long time or for eternity

267 the ancestors of men are satisfied for one month with sesamum grains rice barley masha beans water roots and fruits which have been given according to the prescribed rule

268 two months with fish three months with the meat of gazelles four with mutton and five indeed with the flesh of birds

269 six months with the flesh of kids seven with that of spotted deer eight with that of the black antelope but nine with that of the deer called ruru

270 ten months they are satisfied with the meat of boars and buffaloes but eleven months indeed with that of hares and tortoises

271 one year with cowmilk and milkrice from the flesh of a longeared white hegoat their satisfaction endures twelve years

272 the vegetable called kalasaka the fish called mahasalka the flesh of a rhinoceros and that of a red goat and all kinds of food eaten by hermits in the forest serve for an endless time

273 whatever food mixed with honey one gives on the thirteenth lunar day in the rainy season under the asterism of maghah that also procures endless satisfaction

274 may such a man the manes say be born in our family who will give us milkrice with honey and clarified butter on the thirteenth lunar day of the month of bhadrapada and in the afternoon when the shadow of an elephant falls towards the east

275 whatever a man full of faith duly gives according to the prescribed rule that becomes in the other world a perpetual and imperishable gratification for the manes

276 the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the tenth but excepting the fourteenth are recommended for a funeral sacrifice it is not thus with the others

277 he who performs it on the even lunar days and under the even constellations gains the fulfilment of all his wishes he who honours the manes on odd lunar days and under odd constellations obtains distinguished offspring

278 as the second half of the month is preferable to the first half even so the afternoon is better for the performance of a funeral sacrifice than the forenoon

279 let him untired duly perform the rites in honour of the manes in accordance with the prescribed rule passing the sacred thread over the right shoulder proceeding from the left to the right and holding kusa grass in his hands up to the end of the ceremony

280 let him not perform a funeral sacrifice at night because the night is declared to belong to the rakshasas nor in the twilight nor when the sun has just risen

281 let him offer here below a funeral sacrifice according to the rule given above at least thrice a year in winter in summer and in the rainy season but that which is included among the five great sacrifices every day

282 the burntoblation offered at a sacrifice to the manes must not be made in a common fire a brahmana who keeps a sacred fire shall not perform a funeral sacrifice except on the newmoon day

283 even when a brahmana after bathing satisfies the manes with water he obtains thereby the whole reward for the performance of the daily sraddha

284 they call the manes of fathers vasus those of grandfathers rudras and those of greatgrandfathers adityas thus speaks the eternal veda

285 let him daily partake of the vighasa and daily eat amrita ambrosia but vighasa is what remains from the meal of brahmana guests and the remainder of a sacrifice is called amrita

286 thus all the ordinances relating to the five daily great sacrifices have been declared to you hear now the law for the manner of living fit for brahmanas



chapter iv

1 having dwelt with a teacher during the fourth part of a mans life a brahmana shall live during the second quarter of his existence in his house after he has wedded a wife

2 a brahmana must seek a means of subsistence which either causes no or at least little pain to others and live by that except in times of distress

3 for the purpose of gaining bare subsistence let him accumulate property by following those irreproachable occupations which are prescribed for his caste without unduly fatiguing his body

4 he may subsist by rita truth and amrita ambrosia or by mrita death and by pramrita what causes many deaths or even by the mode called satyanrita a mixture of truth and falsehood but never by svavritti a dogs mode of life

5 by rita shall be understood the gleaning of corn by amrita what is given unasked by mrita food obtained by begging and agriculture is declared to be pramrita

6 but trade and moneylending are satyanrita even by that one may subsist service is called svavritti therefore one should avoid it

7 he may either possess enough to fill a granary or a store filling a grainjar or he may collect what suffices for three days or make no provision for the morrow

8 moreover among these four brahmana householders each laternamed must be considered more distinguished and through his virtue to have conquered the world more completely

9 one of these follows six occupations another subsists by three one by two but the fourth lives by the brahmasattra

10 he who maintains himself by picking up grains and ears of corn must be always intent on the performance of the agnihotra and constantly offer those ishtis only which are prescribed for the days of the conjunction and opposition of the moon and for the solstices

11 let him never for the sake of subsistence follow the ways of the world let him live the pure straightforward honest life of a brahmana

12 he who desires happiness must strive after a perfectly contented disposition and control himself for happiness has contentment for its root the root of unhappiness is the contrary disposition

13 a brahmana who is a snataka and subsists by one of the abovementioned modes of life must discharge the following duties which secure heavenly bliss long life and fame

17 let him avoid all means of acquiring wealth which impede the study of the veda let him maintain himself anyhow but study because that devotion to the vedastudy secures the realisation of his aims

18 let him walk here on earth bringing his dress speech and thoughts to a conformity with his age his occupation his wealth his sacred learning and his race

19 let him daily pore over those institutes of science which soon give increase of wisdom those which teach the acquisition of wealth those which are beneficial for other worldly concerns and likewise over the nigamas which explain the veda

20 for the more a man completely studies the institutes of science the more he fully understands them and his great learning shines brightly

21 let him never if he is able to perform them neglect the sacrifices to the sages to the gods to the bhutas to men and to the manes

22 some men who know the ordinances for sacrificial rites always offer these great sacrifices in their organs of sensation without any external effort

23 knowing that the performance of the sacrifice in their speech and their breath yields imperishable rewards some always offer their breath in their speech and their speech in their breath

24 other brahmanas seeing with the eye of knowledge that the performance of those rites has knowledge for its root always perform them through knowledge alone

25 a brahmana shall always offer the agnihotra at the beginning or at the end of the day and of the night and the darsa and paurnamasa ishtis at the end of each halfmonth

103 manu has stated that when lightning thunder and rain are observed together or when large fiery meteors fall on all sides the recitation must be interrupted until the same hour on the next day counting from the occurrence of the event

104 when one perceives these phenomena all together in the twilight after the sacred fires have been made to blaze for the performance of the agnihotra then one must know the recitation of the veda to be forbidden and also when clouds appear out of season

105 on the occasion of a preternatural sound from the sky of an earthquake and when the lights of heaven are surrounded by a halo let him know that the vedastudy must be stopped until the same hour on the next day even if these phenomena happen in the rainy season

106 but when lightning and the roar of thunder are observed after the sacred fires have been made to blaze the stoppage shall last as long as the light of the sun or of the stars is visible if the remaining abovenamed phenomenon rain occurs the reading shall cease both in the daytime and at night

107 for those who wish to acquire exceedingiy great merit a continual interruption of the vedastudy is prescribed in villages and in towns and the vedastudy must always cease when any kind of foul smell is perceptible

108 in a village where a corpse lies in the presence of a man who lives as unrighteously as a sudra while the sound of weeping is heard and in a crowd of men the recitation of the veda must be stopped

109 in water during the middle part of the night while he voids excrements or is impure and after he has partaken of a funeral dinner a man must not even think in his heart of the sacred texts

111 as long as the smell and the stains of the food given in honour of one ancestor remain on the body of a learned brahmana so long he must not recite the veda

112 while lying on a bed while his feet are raised on a bench while he sits on his hams with a cloth tied round his knees let him not study nor when he has eaten meat or food given by a person impure on account of a birth or a death

113 nor during a fog nor while the sound of arrows is audible nor during both the twilights nor on the newmoon day nor on the fourteenth and the eighth days of each halfmonth nor on the fullmoon day

114 the newmoon day destroys the teacher the fourteenth day the pupil the eighth and the fullmoon days destroy all remembrance of the veda let him therefore avoid reading on those days

115 a brahmana shall not recite the veda during a duststorm nor while the sky is preternaturally red nor while jackals howl nor while the barking of dogs the braying of donkeys or the grunting of camels is heard nor while he is seated in a company

118 when the village has been beset by robbers and when an alarm has been raised by fire let him know that the vedastudy must be interrupted until the same hour on the next day and on the occurrence of all portents

122 nor without receiving permission from a guest who stays in his house nor while the wind blows vehemently nor while blood flows from his body nor when he is wounded by a weapon

123 let him never recite the rigveda or the yagurveda while the saman melodies are heard let him stop all vedastudy for a day and a night after finishing a veda or after reciting an aranyaka

124 the rigveda is declared to be sacred to the gods the yagurveda sacred to men and the samaveda sacred to the manes hence the sound of the latter is impure as it were

125 knowing this the learned daily repeat first in due order the essence of the three vedas and afterwards the text of the veda

126 know that the vedastudy must be interrupted for a day and a night when cattle a frog a cat a dog a snake an ichneumon or a rat pass between the teacher and his pupil

127 let a twiceborn man always carefully interrupt the vedastudy on two occasions viz when the place where he recites is impure and when he himself is unpurified

128 a twiceborn man who is a snataka shall remain chaste on the newmoon day on the eighth lunar day of each halfmonth on the fullmoon day and on the fourteenth even if they fall in the period proper for conjugal intercourse

129 let him not bathe immediately after a meal nor when he is sick nor in the middle of the night nor frequently dressed in all his garments nor in a pool which he does not perfectly know

130 let him not intentionally step on the shadow of images of the gods of a guru of a king of a snataka of his teacher of a reddishbrown animal or of one who has been initiated to the performance of a srauta sacrifice dikshita

131 at midday and at midnight after partaking of meat at a funeral dinner and in the two twilights let him not stay long on a crossroad

132 let him not step intentionally on things used for cleansing the body on water used for a bath on urine or ordure on blood on mucus and on anything spat out or vomited

133 let him not show particular attention to an enemy to the friend of an enemy to a wicked man to a thief or to the wife of another man

134 for in this world there is nothing so detrimental to long life as criminal conversation with another mans wife

135 let him who desires prosperity indeed never despise a kshatriya a snake and a learned brahmana be they ever so feeble

136 because these three when treated with disrespect may utterly destroy him hence a wise man must never despise them

137 let him not despise himself on account of former failures until death let him seek fortune nor despair of gaining it

138 let him say what is true let him say what is pleasing let him utter no disagreeable truth and let him utter no agreeable falsehood that is the eternal law

139 what is well let him call well or let him say well only let him not engage in a useless enmity or dispute with anybody

140 let him not journey too early in the morning nor too late in the evening nor just during the midday heat nor with an unknown companion nor alone nor with sudras

141 let him not insult those who have redundant limbs or are deficient in limbs nor those destitute of knowledge nor very aged men nor those who have no beauty or wealth nor those who are of low birth

142 a brahmana who is impure must not touch with his hand a cow a brahmana or fire nor being in good health let him look at the luminaries in the sky while he is impure

143 if he has touched these while impure let him always sprinkle with his hand water on the organs of sensation all his limbs and the navel

144 except when sick he must not touch the cavities of the body without a reason and he must avoid to touch the hair on the secret parts

145 let him eagerly follow the customs which are auspicious and the rule of good conduct be careful of purity and control all his organs let him mutter prayers and untired daily offer oblations in the fire

146 no calamity happens to those who eagerly follow auspicious customs and the rule of good conduct to those who are always careful of purity and to those who mutter sacred texts and offer burntoblations

147 let him without tiring daily mutter the veda at the proper time for they declare that to be ones highest duty all other observances are called secondary duties

148 by daily reciting the veda by the observance of the rules of purification by practising austerities and by doing no injury to created beings one obtains the faculty of remembering former births

149 he who recollecting his former existences again recites the veda gains endless bliss by the continual study of the veda

150 let him always offer on the parvadays oblations to savitri and such as avert evil omens and on the ashtakas and anvashtakas let him constantly worship the manes

151 far from his dwelling let him remove urine and ordure far let him remove the water used for washing his feet and far the remnants of food and the water from his bath

152 early in the morning only let him void faeces decorate his body bathe clean his teeth apply collyrium to his eyes and worship the gods

153 but on the parvadays let him go to visit the images of the gods and virtuous brahmanas and the ruler of the country for the sake of protection as well as his gurus

154 let him reverentially salute venerable men who visit him give them his own seat let him sit near them with joined hands and when they leave accompany them walking behind them

155 let him untired follow the conduct of virtuous men connected with his occupations which has been fully declared in the revealed texts and in the sacred tradition smriti and is the root of the sacred law

156 through virtuous conduct he obtains long life through virtuous conduct desirable offspring through virtuous conduct imperishable wealth virtuous conduct destroys the effect of inauspicious marks

157 for a man of bad conduct is blamed among people constantly suffers misfortunes is afflicted with diseases and shortlived

158 a man who follows the conduct of the virtuous has faith and is free from envy lives a hundred years though he be entirely destitute of auspicious marks

159 let him carefully avoid all undertakings the success of which depends on others but let him eagerly pursue that the accomplishment of which depends on himself

160 everything that depends on others gives pain everything that depends on oneself gives pleasure know that this is the short definition of pleasure and pain

161 when the performance of an act gladdens his heart let him perform it with diligence but let him avoid the opposite

162 let him never offend the teacher who initiated him nor him who explained the veda nor his father and mother nor any other guru nor cows nor brahmanas nor any men performing austerities

163 let him avoid atheism cavilling at the vedas contempt of the gods hatred want of modesty pride anger and harshness

164 let him when angry not raise a stick against another man nor strike anybody except a son or a pupil those two he may beat in order to correct them

165 a twiceborn man who has merely threatened a brahmana with the intention of doing him a corporal injury will wander about for a hundred years in the tamisra hell

166 having intentionally struck him in anger even with a blade of grass he will be born during twentyone existences in the wombs of such beings where men are born in punishment of their sins

167 a man who in his folly caused blood to flow from the body of a brahmana who does not attack him will suffer after death exceedingly great pain

168 as many particles of dust as the blood takes up from the ground during so many years the spiller of the blood will be devoured by other animals in the next world

169 a wise man should therefore never threaten a brahmana nor strike him even with a blade of grass nor cause his blood to flow

170 neither a man who lives unrighteously nor he who acquires wealth by telling falsehoods nor he who always delights in doing injury ever attain happiness in this world

171 let him though suffering in consequence of his righteousness never turn his heart to unrighteousness for he will see the speedy overthrow of unrighteous wicked men

172 unrighteousness practised in this world does not at once produce its fruit like a cow but advancing slowly it cuts off the roots of him who committed it

173 if the punishment falls not on the offender himself it falls on his sons if not on the sons at least on his grandsons but an iniquity once committed never fails to produce fruit to him who wrought it

174 he prospers for a while through unrighteousness then he gains great good fortune next he conquers his enemies but at last he perishes branch and root

175 let him always delight in truthfulness obedience to the sacred law conduct worthy of an aryan and purity let him chastise his pupils according to the sacred law let him keep his speech his arms and his belly under control

176 let him avoid the acquisition of wealth and the gratification of his desires if they are opposed to the sacred law and even lawful acts which may cause pain in the future or are offensive to men

177 let him not be uselessly active with his hands and feet or with his eyes nor crooked in his ways nor talk idly nor injure others by deeds or even think of it

178 let him walk in that path of holy men which his fathers and his grandfathers followed while he walks in that he will not suffer harm

179 with an officiating or a domestic priest with a teacher with a maternal uncle a guest and a dependant with infants aged and sick men with learned men with his paternal relatives connexions by marriage and maternal relatives

180 with his father and his mother with female relatives with a brother with his son and his wife with his daughter and with his slaves let him not have quarrels

181 if he avoids quarrels with these persons he will be freed from all sins and by suppressing all such quarrels a householder conquers all the following worlds

182 the teacher is the lord of the world of brahman the father has power over the world of the lord of created beings pragapati a guest rules over the world of indra and the priests over the world of the gods

183 the female relatives have power over the world of the apsarases the maternal relatives over that of the visve devas the connexions by marriage over that of the waters the mother and the maternal uncle over the earth

184 infants aged poor and sick men must be considered as rulers of the middle sphere the eldest brother as equal to ones father ones wife and ones son as ones own body

185 ones slaves as ones shadow ones daughter as the highest object of tenderness hence if one is offended by any one of these one must bear it without resentment

186 though by his learning and sanctity he may be entitled to accept presents let him not attach himself too much to that habit for through his accepting many presents the divine light in him is soon extinguished

187 without a full knowledge of the rules prescribed by the sacred law for the acceptance of presents a wise man should not take anything even though he may pine with hunger

188 but an ignorant man who accepts gold land a horse a cow food a dress sesamumgrains or clarified butter is reduced to ashes like a piece of wood

189 gold and food destroy his longevity land and a cow his body a horse his eye sight a garment his skin clarified butter his energy sesamumgrains his offspring

190 a brahmana who neither performs austerities nor studies the veda yet delights in accepting gifts sinks with the donor into hell just as he who attempts to cross over in a boat made of stone is submerged in the water

191 hence an ignorant man should be afraid of accepting any presents for by reason of a very small gift even a fool sinks into hell as a cow into a morass

192 a man who knows the law should not offer even water to a brahmana who acts like a cat nor to a brahmana who acts like a heron nor to one who is unacquainted with the veda

193 for property though earned in accordance with prescribed rules which is given to these three persons causes in the next world misery both to the giver and to the recipient

194 as he who attempts to cross water in a boat of stone sinks to the bottom even so an ignorant donor and an ignorant donee sink low

195 a man who ever covetous displays the flag of virtue who is a hypocrite a deceiver of the people intent on doing injury and a detractor from the merits of all men one must know to be one who acts like a cat

196 that brahmana who with downcast look of a cruel disposition is solely intent on attaining his own ends dishonest and falsely gentle is one who acts like a heron

197 those brahmanas who act like herons and those who display the characteristics of cats fall in consequence of that wicked mode of acting into the hell called andhatamisra

198 when he has committed a sin let him not perform a penance under the pretence that the act is intended to gain spiritual merit thus hiding his sin under the pretext of a vow and deceiving women and sudras

199 such brahmanas are reprehended after death and in this life by those who expound the veda and a vow performed under a false pretence goes to the rakshasas

200 he who without being a student gains his livelihood by wearing the dress of a student takes upon himself the guilt of all students and is born again in the womb of an animal

201 let him never bathe in tanks belonging to other men if he bathes in such a one he is tainted by a portion of the guilt of him who made the tank

202 he who uses without permission a carriage a bed a seat a well a garden or a house belonging to an other man takes upon himself one fourth of the owners guilt

203 let him always bathe in rivers in ponds dug by the gods themselves in lakes and in waterholes or springs

204 a wise man should constantly discharge the paramount duties called yama but not always the minor ones called niyama for he who does not discharge the former while he obeys the latter alone becomes an outcast

205 a brahmana must never eat a dinner given at a sacrifice that is offered by one who is not a srotriya by one who sacrifices for a multitude of men by a woman or by a eunuch

206 when those persons offer sacrificial viands in the fire it is unlucky for holy men it displeases the gods let him therefore avoid it

207 let him never eat food given by intoxicated angry or sick men nor that in which hair or insects are found nor what has been touched intentionally with the foot

208 nor that at which the slayer of a learned brahmana has looked nor that which has been touched by a menstruating woman nor that which has been pecked at by birds or touched by a dog

209 nor food at which a cow has smelt nor particularly that which has been offered by an invitation to all comers nor that given by a multitude or by harlots nor that which is declared to be had by a learned man

210 nor the food given by a thief a musician a carpenter a usurer one who has been initiated for the performance of a srauta sacrifice a miser one bound with fetters

211 by one accused of a mortal sin abhisasta a hermaphrodite an unchaste woman or a hypocrite nor any sweet thing that has turned sour nor what has been kept a whole night nor the food of a sudra nor the leavings of another man

212 nor the food given by a physician a hunter a cruel man one who eats the fragments of anothers meal nor the food of an ugra nor that prepared for a woman in childbed nor that given at a dinner where a guest rises prematurely and sips water nor that given by a woman whose ten days of impurity have not elapsed

213 nor food given without due respect nor that which contains meat eaten for no sacred purpose nor that given by a female who has no male relatives nor the food of an enemy nor that given by the lord of a town nor that given by outcasts nor that on which anybody has sneezed

214 nor the food given by an informer by one who habitually tells falsehoods or by one who sells the rewards for sacrifices nor the food given by an actor a tailor or an ungrateful man

215 by a blacksmith a nishada a stageplayer a goldsmith a basketmaker or a dealer in weapons

216 by trainers of hunting dogs publicans a washerman a dyer a pitiless man and a man in whose house lives a paramour of his wife

217 nor the food given by those who knowingly bear with paramours of their wives and by those who in all matters are ruled by women nor food given by men whose ten days of impurity on account of a death have not passed nor that which is unpalatable

218 the food of a king impairs his vigour the food of a sudra his excellence in sacred learning the food of a goldsmith his longevity that of a leathercutter his fame

219 the food of an artisan destroys his offspring that of a washerman his bodily strength the food of a multitude and of harlots excludes him from the higher worlds

220 the food of a physician is as vile as pus that of an unchaste woman equal to semen that of a usurer as vile as ordure and that of a dealer in weapons as bad as dirt

221 the food of those other persons who have been successively enumerated as such whose food must not be eaten the wise declare to be as impure as skin bones and hair

222 if he has unwittingly eaten the food of one of those he must fast for three days if he has eaten it intentionally or has swallowed semen ordure or urine he must perform a krikkhra penance

223 a brahmana who knows the law must not eat cooked food given by a sudra who performs no sraddhas but on failure of other means of subsistence he may accept raw grain sufficient for one night and day

224 the gods having considered the respective merits of a niggardly srotriya and of a liberal usurer declared the food of both to be equal in quality

225 the lord of created beings pragapati came and spake to them do not make that equal which is unequal the food of that liberal usurer is purified by faith that of the of the other man is defiled by a want of faith

226 let him without tiring always offer sacrifices and perform works of charity with faith for offerings and charitable works made with faith and with lawfullyearned money procure endless rewards

227 let him always practise according to his ability with a cheerful heart the duty of liberality both by sacrifices and by charitable works if he finds a worthy recipient for his gifts

228 if he is asked let him always give something be it ever so little without grudging for a worthy recipient will perhaps be found who saves him from all guilt

229 a giver of water obtains the satisfaction of his hunger and thirst a giver of food imperishable happiness a giver of sesamum desirable offspring a giver of a lamp a most excellent eyesight

230 a giver of land obtains land a giver of gold long life a giver of a house most excellent mansions a giver of silver rupya exquisite beauty rupa

231 a giver of a garment a place in the world of the moon a giver of a horse asva a place in the world of the asvins a giver of a draughtox great good fortune a giver of a cow the world of the sun

232 a giver of a carriage or of a bed a wife a giver of protection supreme dominion a giver of grain eternal bliss a giver of the veda brahman union with brahman

233 the gift of the veda surpasses all other gifts water food cows land clothes sesamum gold and clarified butter

234 for whatever purpose a man bestows any gift for that same purpose he receives in his next birth with due honour its reward

235 both he who respectfully receives a gift and he who respectfully bestows it go to heaven in the contrary case they both fall into hell

236 let him not be proud of his austerities let him not utter a falsehood after he has offered a sacrifice let him not speak ill of brahmanas though he be tormented by them when he has bestowed a gift let him not boast of it

237 by falsehood a sacrifice becomes vain by selfcomplacency the reward for austerities is lost longevity by speaking evil of brahmanas and the reward of a gift by boasting

238 giving no pain to any creature let him slowly accumulate spiritual merit for the sake of acquiring a companion to the next world just as the white ant gradually raises its hill

239 for in the next world neither father nor mother nor wife nor sons nor relations stay to be his companions spiritual merit alone remains with him

240 single is each being born single it dies single it enjoys the reward of its virtue single it suffers the punishment of its sin

241 leaving the dead body on the ground like a log of wood or a clod of earth the relatives depart with averted faces but spiritual merit follows the soul

242 let him therefore always slowly accumulate spiritual merit in order that it may be his companion after death for with merit as his companion he will traverse a gloom difficult to traverse

243 that companion speedily conducts the man who is devoted to duty and effaces his sins by austerities to the next world radiant and clothed with an ethereal body

244 let him who desires to raise his race ever form connexions with the most excellent men and shun all low ones

245 a brahmana who always connects himself with the most excellent ones and shuns all inferior ones himself becomes most distinguished by an opposite conduct he becomes a sudra

246 he who is persevering gentle and patient shuns the company of men of cruel conduct and does no injury to living creatures gains if he constantly lives in that manner by controlling his organs and by liberality heavenly bliss

247 he may accept from any man fuel water roots fruit food offered without asking and honey likewise a gift which consists in a promise of protection

248 the lord of created beings pragapati has declared that alms freely offered and brought by the giver himself may be accepted even from a sinful man provided the gift had not been asked for or promised beforehand

249 during fifteen years the manes do not eat the food of that man who disdains a freelyoffered gift nor does the fire carry his offerings to the gods

250 a couch a house kusa grass perfumes water flowers jewels sour milk grain fish sweet milk meat and vegetables let him not reject if they are voluntarily offered

251 he who desires to relieve his gurus and those whom he is bound to maintain or wishes to honour the gods and guests may accept gifts from anybody but he must not satisfy his own hunger with such presents

252 but if his gurus are dead or if he lives separate from them in another house let him when he seeks a subsistence accept presents from good men alone

253 his labourer in tillage a friend of his family his cowherd his slave and his barber are among sudras those whose food he may eat likewise a poor man who offers himself to be his slave

254 as his character is as the work is which he desires to perform and as the manner is in which he means to serve even so a voluntary slave must offer himself

255 he who describes himself to virtuous men in a manner contrary to truth is the most sinful wretch in this world he is a thief who makes away with his own self

256 all things have their nature determined by speech speech is their root and from speech they proceed but he who is dishonest with respect to speech is dishonest in everything

257 when he has paid according to the law his debts to the great sages to the manes and to the gods let him make over everything to his son and dwell in his house not caring for any worldly concerns

258 alone let him constantly meditate in solitude on that which is salutary for his soul for he who meditates in solitude attains supreme bliss

259 thus have been declared the means by which a brahmana householder must always subsist and the summary of the ordinances for a snataka which cause an increase of holiness and are praiseworthy

260 a brahmana who being learned in the lore of the vedas conducts himself in this manner and daily destroys his sins will be exalted in brahmans world



chapter v

1 the sages having heard the duties of a snataka thus declared spoke to greatsouled bhrigu who sprang from fire

2 how can death have power over brahmanas who know the sacred science the veda and who fulfil their duties as they have been explained by thee o lord 

3 righteous bhrigu the son of manu thus answered the great sages hear in punishment of what faults death seeks to shorten the lives of brahmanas

4 through neglect of the vedastudy through deviation from the rule of conduct through remissness in the fulfilment of duties and through faults committed by eating forbidden food death becomes eager to shorten the lives of brahmanas

5 garlic leeks and onions mushrooms and all plants springing from impure substances are unfit to be eaten by twiceborn men

6 one should carefully avoid red exudations from trees and juices flowing from incisions the selu fruit and the thickened milk of a cow which she gives after calving

7 rice boiled with sesamum wheat mixed with butter milk and sugar milkrice and flourcakes which are not prepared for a sacrifice meat which has not been sprinkled with water while sacred texts were recited food offered to the gods and sacrificial viands

8 the milk of a cow or other female animal within ten days after her calving that of camels of onehoofed animals of sheep of a cow in heat or of one that has no calf with her

9 the milk of all wild animals excepting buffalocows that of women and all substances turned sour must be avoided

10 among things turned sour sour milk and all food prepared of it may be eaten likewise what is extracted from pure flowers roots and fruit

11 let him avoid all carnivorous birds and those living in villages and onehoofed animals which are not specially permitted to be eaten and the tittibha parra jacana

12 the sparrow the plava the hamsa the brahmani duck the villagecock the sarasa crane the raggudala the woodpecker the parrot and the starling

13 those which feed striking with their beaks webfooted birds the koyashti those which scratch with their toes those which dive and live on fish meat from a slaughterhouse and dried meat

14 the baka and the balaka crane the raven the khangaritaka animals that eat fish villagepigs and all kinds of fishes

15 he who eats the flesh of any animal is called the eater of the flesh of that particular creature he who eats fish is an eater of every kind of flesh let him therefore avoid fish

16 but the fish called pathina and that called rohita may be eaten if used for offerings to the gods or to the manes one may eat likewise ragivas simhatundas and sasalkas on all occasions

17 let him not eat solitary or unknown beasts and birds though they may fall under the categories of eatable creatures nor any fivetoed animals

18 the porcupine the hedgehog the iguana the rhinoceros the tortoise and the hare they declare to be eatable likewise those domestic animals that have teeth in one jaw only excepting camels

19 a twiceborn man who knowingly eats mushrooms a villagepig garlic a villagecock onions or leeks will become an outcast

20 he who unwittingly partakes of any of these six shall perform a samtapana krikkhra or the lunar penance kandrayana of ascetics in case he who has eaten any other kind of forbidden food he shall fast for one day and a night 

21 once a year a brahmana must perform a krikkhra penance in order to atone for unintentionally eating forbidden food but for intentionally eating forbidden food he must perform the penances prescribed specially

22 beasts and birds recommended for consumption may be slain by brahmanas for sacrifices and in order to feed those whom they are bound to maintain for agastya did this of old

23 for in ancient times the sacrificial cakes were made of the flesh of eatable beasts and birds at the sacrifices offered by brahmanas and kshatriyas

24 all lawful hard or soft food may be eaten though stale after having been mixed with fatty substances and so may the remains of sacrificial viands

25 but all preparations of barley and wheat as well as preparations of milk may be eaten by twiceborn men without being mixed with fatty substances though they may have stood for a long time

26 thus has the food allowed and forbidden to twiceborn men been fully described i will now propound the rules for eating and avoiding meat

27 one may eat meat when it has been sprinkled with water while mantras were recited when brahmanas desire ones doing it when one is engaged in the performance of a rite according to the law and when ones life is in danger

28 the lord of creatures pragapati created this whole world to be the sustenance of the vital spirit both the immovable and the movable creation is the food of the vital spirit

29 what is destitute of motion is the food of those endowed with locomotion animals without fangs are the food of those with fangs those without hands of those who possess hands and the timid of the bold

30 the eater who daily even devours those destined to be his food commits no sin for the creator himself created both the eaters and those who are to be eaten for those special purposes

31 the consumption of meat is befitting for sacrifices that is declared to be a rule made by the gods but to persist in using it on other occasions is said to be a proceeding worthy of rakshasas

32 he who eats meat when he honours the gods and manes commits no sin whether he has bought it or himself has killed the animal or has received it as a present from others

33 a twiceborn man who knows the law must not eat meat except in conformity with the law for if he has eaten it unlawfully he will unable to save himself be eaten after death by his victims

34 after death the guilt of one who slays deer for gain is not as great as that of him who eats meat for no sacred purpose

35 but a man who being duly engaged to officiate or to dine at a sacred rite refuses to eat meat becomes after death an animal during twentyone existences

36 a brahmana must never eat the flesh of animals unhallowed by mantras but obedient to the primeval law he may eat it consecrated with vedic texts

37 if he has a strong desire for meat he may make an animal of clarified butter or one of flour and eat that but let him never seek to destroy an animal without a lawful reason

38 as many hairs as the slain beast has so often indeed will he who killed it without a lawful reason suffer a violent death in future births

39 svayambhu the selfexistent himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices sacrifices have been instituted for the good of this whole world hence the slaughtering of beasts for sacrifices is not slaughtering in the ordinary sense of the word

40 herbs trees cattle birds and other animals that have been destroyed for sacrifices receive being reborn higher existences

41 on offering the honeymixture to a guest at a sacrifice and at the rites in honour of the manes but on these occasions only may an animal be slain that rule manu proclaimed

42 a twiceborn man who knowing the true meaning of the veda slays an animal for these purposes causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state

43 a twiceborn man of virtuous disposition whether he dwells in his own house with a teacher or in the forest must never even in times of distress cause an injury to any creature which is not sanctioned by the veda

44 know that the injury to moving creatures and to those destitute of motion which the veda has prescribed for certain occasions is no injury at all for the sacred law shone forth from the veda

45 he who injures innoxious beings from a wish to give himself pleasure never finds happiness neither living nor dead

46 he who does not seek to cause the sufferings of bonds and death to living creatures but desires the good of all beings obtains endless bliss

47 he who does not injure any creature attains without an effort what he thinks of what he undertakes and what he fixes his mind on

48 meat can never be obtained without injury to living creatures and injury to sentient beings is detrimental to the attainment of heavenly bliss let him therefore shun the use of meat

49 having well considered the disgusting origin of flesh and the cruelty of fettering and slaying corporeal beings let him entirely abstain from eating flesh

50 he who disregarding the rule given above does not eat meat like a pisaka becomes dear to men and will not be tormented by diseases

51 he who permits the slaughter of an animal he who cuts it up he who kills it he who buys or sells meat he who cooks it he who serves it up and he who eats it must all be considered as the slayers of the animal

52 there is no greater sinner than that man who though not worshipping the gods or the manes seeks to increase the bulk of his own flesh by the flesh of other beings

53 he who during a hundred years annually offers a horsesacrifice and he who entirely abstains from meat obtain the same reward for their meritorious conduct

54 by subsisting on pure fruit and roots and by eating food fit for ascetics in the forest one does not gain so great a reward as by entirely avoiding the use of flesh

55 me he mam sah will devour in the next world whose flesh i eat in this life the wise declare this to be the real meaning of the word flesh mamsah

56 there is no sin in eating meat in drinking spirituous liquor and in carnal intercourse for that is the natural way of created beings but abstention brings great rewards

57 i will now in due order explain the purification for the dead and the purification of things as they are prescribed for the four castes varna

58 when a child dies that has teethed or that before teething has received the sacrament of the tonsure kudakarana or of the initiation all relatives become impure and on the birth of a child the same rule is prescribed

59 it is ordained that among sapindas the impurity on account of a death shall last ten days or until the bones have been collected or three days or one day only

60 but the sapindarelationship ceases with the seventh person in the ascending and descending lines the samanodakarelationship when the common origin and the existence of a common family name are no longer known

61 as this impurity on account of a death is prescribed for all sapindas even so it shall be held on a birth by those who desire to be absolutely pure

62 or while the impurity on account of a death is common to all sapindas that caused by a birth falls on the parents alone or it shall fall on the mother alone and the father shall become pure by bathing

63 but a man having spent his strength is purified merely by bathing after begetting a child on a remarried female he shall retain the impurity during three days

64 those who have touched a corpse are purified after one day and night added to three periods of three days those who give libations of water after three days

65 a pupil who performs the pitrimedha for his deceased teacher becomes also pure after ten days just like those who carry the corpse out to the burialground

66 a woman is purified on a miscarriage in as many days and nights as months elapsed after conception and a menstruating female becomes pure by bathing after the menstrual secretion has ceased to flow

67 on the death of children whose tonsure kudakarman has not been performed the sapindas are declared to become pure in one day and night on the death of those who have received the tonsure but not the initiation the law ordains that the purification takes place after three days

68 a child that has died before the completion of its second year the relatives shall carry out of the village decked with flowers and bury it in pure ground without collecting the bones afterwards

69 such a child shall not be burnt with fire and no libations of water shall be offered to it leaving it like a log of wood in the forest the relatives shall remain impure during three days only

70 the relatives shall not offer libations to a child that has not reached the third year but if it had teeth or the ceremony of naming it namakarman had been performed the offering of water is optional

71 if a fellowstudent has died the smriti prescribes an impurity of one day on a birth the purification of the samanodakas is declared to take place after three days and nights

72 on the death of females betrothed but not married the bridegroom and his relatives are purified after three days and the paternal relatives become pure according to the same rule

73 let mourners eat food without factitious salt bathe during three days abstain from meat and sleep separate on the ground

74 the above rule regarding impurity on account of a death has been prescribed for cases where the kinsmen live near the deceased sapinda kinsmen and samanodaka relatives must know the following rule to refer to cases where deceased lived at a distance from them

75 he who may hear that a relative residing in a distant country has died before ten days after his death have elapsed shall be impure for the remainder of the period of ten days and nights only

76 if the ten days have passed he shall be impure during three days and nights but if a year has elapsed since the occurrence of the death he becomes pure merely by bathing

77 a man who hears of a sapinda relatives death or of the birth of a son after the ten days of impurity have passed becomes pure by bathing dressed in his garments

78 if an infant that has not teethed or a grownup relative who is not a sapinda die in a distant country one becomes at once pure after bathing in ones clothes

79 if within the ten days of impurity another birth or death happens a brahmana shall remain impure only until the first period of ten days has expired

80 they declare that when the teacher akarya has died the impurity lasts three days if the teachers son or wife is dead it lasts a day and a night that is a settled rule

81 for a srotriya who resides with him out of affection a man shall be impure for three days for a maternal uncle a pupil an officiating priest or a maternal relative for one night together with the preceding and following days

82 if the king in whose realm he resides is dead he shall be impure as long as the light of the sun or stars shines but for an intimate friend who is not a srotriya the impurity lasts for a whole day likewise for a guru who knows the veda and the angas

83 a brahmana shall be pure after ten days a kshatriya after twelve a vaisya after fifteen and a sudra is purified after a month

84 let him not unnecessarily lengthen the period of impurity nor interrupt the rites to be performed with the sacred fires for he who performs that agnihotra rite will not be impure though he be a sapinda relative

85 when he has touched a kandala a menstruating woman an outcast a woman in childbed a corpse or one who has touched a corpse he becomes pure by bathing

86 he who has purified himself by sipping water shall on seeing any impure thing or person always mutter the sacred texts addressed to surya and the pavamani verses

87 a brahmana who has touched a human bone to which fat adheres becomes pure by bathing if it be free from fat by sipping water and by touching afterwards a cow or looking at the sun

88 he who has undertaken the performance of a vow shall not pour out libations to the dead until the vow has been completed but when he has offered water after its completion he becomes pure in three days only

89 libations of water shall not be offered to those who neglect the prescribed rites and may be said to have been born in vain to those born in consequence of an illegal mixture of the castes to those who are ascetics of heretical sects and to those who have committed suicide

90 to women who have joined a heretical sect who through lust live with many men who have caused an abortion have killed their husbands or drink spirituous liquor

91 a student does not break his vow by carrying out to the place of cremation his own dead teacher akarya subteacher upadhyaya father mother or guru

92 let him carry out a dead sudra by the southern gate of the town but the corpses of twiceborn men as is proper by the western northern or eastern gates

93 the taint of impurity does not fall on kings and those engaged in the performance of a vow or of a sattra for the first are seated on the throne of indra and the last two are ever pure like brahman

94 for a king on the throne of magnanimity immediate purification is prescribed and the reason for that is that he is seated there for the protection of his subjects

95 the same rule applies to the kinsmen of those who have fallen in a riot or a battle of those who have been killed by lightning or by the king and of those who perished fighting for cows and brahmanas and to those whom the king wishes to be pure

96 a king is an incarnation of the eight guardian deities of the world the moon the fire the sun the wind indra the lords of wealth and water kubera and varuna and yama

97 because the king is pervaded by those lords of the world no impurity is ordained for him for purity and impurity of mortals is caused and removed by those lords of the world

98 by him who is slain in battle with brandished weapons according to the law of the kshatriyas a srauta sacrifice is instantly completed and so is the period of impurity caused by his death that is a settled rule

99 at the end of the period of impurity a brahmana who has performed the necessary rites becomes pure by touching water a kshatriya by touching the animal on which he rides and his weapons a vaisya by touching his goad or the nosestring of his oxen a sudra by touching his staff

100 thus the purification required on the death of sapindas has been explained to you o best of twiceborn men hear now the manner in which men are purified on the death of any relative who is not a sapinda

101 a brahmana having carried out a dead brahmana who is not a sapinda as if he were a near relative or a near relative of his mother becomes pure after three days

102 but if he eats the food of the sapindas of the deceased he is purified in ten days but in one day if he does not eat their food nor dwells in their house

103 having voluntarily followed a corpse whether that of a paternal kinsman or of a stranger he becomes pure by bathing dressed in his clothes by touching fire and eating clarified butter

104 let him not allow a dead brahmana to be carried out by a sudra while men of the same caste are at hand for that burntoffering which is defiled by a sudras touch is detrimental to the deceaseds passage to heaven

105 the knowledge of brahman austerities fire holy food earth restraint of the internal organ water smearing with cowdung the wind sacred rites the sun and time are the purifiers of corporeal beings

106 among all modes of purification purity in the acquisition of wealth is declared to be the best for he is pure who gains wealth with clean hands not he who purifies himself with earth and water

107 the learned are purified by a forgiving disposition those who have committed forbidden actions by liberality secret sinners by muttering sacred texts and those who best know the veda by austerities

108 by earth and water is purified what ought to be made pure a river by its current a woman whose thoughts have been impure by the menstrual secretion a brahmana by abandoning the world samnyasa

109 the body is cleansed by water the internal organ is purified by truthfulness the individual soul by sacred learning and austerities the intellect by true knowledge

110 thus the precise rules for the purification of the body have been declared to you hear now the decision of the law regarding the purification of the various inanimate things

111 the wise ordain that all objects made of metal gems and anything made of stone are to be cleansed with ashes earth and water

112 a golden vessel which shows no stains becomes pure with water alone likewise what is produced in water as shells and coral what is made of stone and a silver vessel not enchased

113 from the union of water and fire arose the glittering gold and silver those two therefore are best purified by the elements from which they sprang

114 copper iron brass pewter tin and lead must be cleansed as may be suitable for each particular case by alkaline substances acids or water

115 the purification prescribed for all sorts of liquids is by passing two blades of kusa grass through them for solid things by sprinkling them with water for objects made of wood by planing them

116 at sacrifices the purification of the soma cups called kamasas and grahas and of other sacrificial vessels takes place by rubbing them with the hand and afterwards rinsing them with water

117 the karu and the spoons called sruk and sruva must be cleaned with hot water likewise the wooden sword called sphya the winnowingbasket surpa the cart for bringing the grain the pestle and the mortar

118 the manner of purifying large quantities of grain and of cloth is to sprinkle them with water but the purification of small quantities is prescribed to take place by washing them

119 skins and objects made of split cane must be cleaned like clothes vegetables roots and fruit like grain

120 silk and woollen stuffs with alkaline earth blankets with pounded arishta fruit amsupattas with bel fruit linen cloth with a paste of yellow mustard

121 a man who knows the law must purify conchshells horn bone and ivory like linen cloth or with a mixture of cows urine and water

122 grass wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water a house by sweeping and smearing it with cowdung or whitewash an earthen vessel by a second burning

123 an earthen vessel which has been defiled by spirituous liquor urine ordure saliva pus or blood cannot be purified by another burning

124 land is purified by the following five modes viz by sweeping by smearing it with cowdung by sprinkling it with cows urine or milk by scraping and by cows staying on it during a day and night

125 food which has been pecked at by birds smelt at by cows touched with the foot sneezed on or defiled by hair or insects becomes pure by scattering earth over it

126 as long as the foul smell does not leave an object defiled by impure substances and the stain caused by them does not disappear so long must earth and water be applied in cleansing inanimate things

127 the gods declared three things to be pure to brahmanas that on which no taint is visible what has been washed with water and what has been commended as pure by the word of a brahmana

128 water sufficient in quantity in order to slake the thirst of a cow possessing the proper smell colour and taste and unmixed with impure substances is pure if it is collected on pure ground

129 the hand of an artisan is always pure so is every vendible commodity exposed for sale in the market and food obtained by begging which a student holds in his hand is always fit for use that is a settled rule

130 the mouth of a woman is always pure likewise a bird when he causes a fruit to fall a calf is pure on the flowing of the milk and a dog when he catches a deer

131 manu has declared that the flesh of an animal killed by dogs is pure likewise that of a beast slain by carnivorous animals or by men of low caste dasyu such as kandalas

132 all those cavities of the body which lie above the navel are pure but those which are below the navel are impure as well as excretions that fall from the body

133 flies drops of water a shadow a cow a horse the rays of the sun dust earth the wind and fire one must know to be pure to the touch

134 in order to cleanse the organs by which urine and faeces are ejected earth and water must be used as they may be required likewise in removing the remaining ones among twelve impurities of the body

135 oily exudations semen blood the fatty substance of the brain urine faeces the mucus of the nose earwax phlegm tears the rheum of the eyes and sweat are the twelve impurities of human bodies

136 he who desires to be pure must clean the organ by one application of earth the anus by applying earth three times the left hand alone by applying it ten times and both hands by applying it seven times

137 such is the purification ordained for householders it shall be double for students treble for hermits but quadruple for ascetics

138 when he has voided urine or faeces let him after sipping water sprinkle the cavities likewise when he is going to recite the veda and always before he takes food

139 let him who desires bodily purity first sip water three times and then twice wipe his mouth but a woman and a sudra shall perform each act once only

140 sudras who live according to the law shall each month shave their heads their mode of purification shall be the same as that of vaisyas and their food the fragments of an aryans meal

141 drops of water from the mouth which do not fall on a limb do not make a man impure nor the hair of the moustache entering the mouth nor what adheres to the teeth

142 drops which trickle on the feet of him who offers water for sipping to others must be considered as equal to water collected on the ground they render him not impure

143 he who while carrying anything in any manner is touched by an impure person or thing shall become pure if he performs an ablution without putting down that object

144 he who has vomited or purged shall bathe and afterwards eat clarified butter but if the attack comes on after he has eaten let him only sip water bathing is prescribed for him who has had intercourse with a woman

145 though he may be already pure let him sip water after sleeping sneezing eating spitting telling untruths and drinking water likewise when he is going to study the veda

146 thus the rules of personal purification for men of all castes and those for cleaning inanimate things have been fully declared to you hear now the duties of women

147 by a girl by a young woman or even by an aged one nothing must be done independently even in her own house

148 in childhood a female must be subject to her father in youth to her husband when her lord is dead to her sons a woman must never be independent

149 she must not seek to separate herself from her father husband or sons by leaving them she would make both her own and her husbands families contemptible

150 she must always be cheerful clever in the management of her household affairs careful in cleaning her utensils and economical in expenditure

151 him to whom her father may give her or her brother with the fathers permission she shall obey as long as he lives and when he is dead she must not insult his memory

152 for the sake of procuring good fortune to brides the recitation of benedictory texts svastyayana and the sacrifice to the lord of creatures pragapati are used at weddings but the betrothal by the father or guardian is the cause of the husbands dominion over his wife

153 the husband who wedded her with sacred texts always gives happiness to his wife both in season and out of season in this world and in the next

154 though destitute of virtue or seeking pleasure elsewhere or devoid of good qualities yet a husband must be constantly worshipped as a god by a faithful wife

155 no sacrifice no vow no fast must be performed by women apart from their husbands if a wife obeys her husband she will for that reason alone be exalted in heaven

156 a faithful wife who desires to dwell after death with her husband must never do anything that might displease him who took her hand whether he be alive or dead

157 at her pleasure let her emaciate her body by living on pure flowers roots and fruit but she must never even mention the name of another man after her husband has died

158 until death let her be patient of hardships selfcontrolled and chaste and strive to fulfil that most excellent duty which is prescribed for wives who have one husband only

159 many thousands of brahmanas who were chaste from their youth have gone to heaven without continuing their race

160 a virtuous wife who after the death of her husband constantly remains chaste reaches heaven though she have no son just like those chaste men

161 but a woman who from a desire to have offspring violates her duty towards her deceased husband brings on herself disgrace in this world and loses her place with her husband in heaven

162 offspring begotten by another man is here not considered lawful nor does offspring begotten on another mans wife belong to the begetter nor is a second husband anywhere prescribed for virtuous women

163 she who cohabits with a man of higher caste forsaking her own husband who belongs to a lower one will become contemptible in this world and is called a remarried woman parapurva

164 by violating her duty towards her husband a wife is disgraced in this world after death she enters the womb of a jackal and is tormented by diseases the punishment of her sin

165 she who controlling her thoughts words and deeds never slights her lord resides after death with her husband in heaven and is called a virtuous wife

166 in reward of such conduct a female who controls her thoughts speech and actions gains in this life highest renown and in the next world a place near her husband

167 a twiceborn man versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of equal caste who conducts herself thus and dies before him with the sacred fires used for the agnihotra and with the sacrificial implements

168 having thus at the funeral given the sacred fires to his wife who dies before him he may marry again and again kindle the fires

169 living according to the preceding rules he must never neglect the five great sacrifices and having taken a wife he must dwell in his own house during the second period of his life



chapter vi

1 a twiceborn snataka who has thus lived according to the law in the order of householders may taking a firm resolution and keeping his organs in subjection dwell in the forest duly observing the rules given below

2 when a householder sees his skin wrinkled and his hair white and the sons of his sons then he may resort to the forest

3 abandoning all food raised by cultivation and all his belongings he may depart into the forest either committing his wife to his sons or accompanied by her

4 taking with him the sacred fire and the implements required for domestic sacrifices he may go forth from the village into the forest and reside there duly controlling his senses

5 let him offer those five great sacrifices according to the rule with various kinds of pure food fit for ascetics or with herbs roots and fruit

6 let him wear a skin or a tattered garment let him bathe in the evening or in the morning and let him always wear his hair in braids the hair on his body his beard and his nails being unclipped

7 let him perform the balioffering with such food as he eats and give alms according to his ability let him honour those who come to his hermitage with alms consisting of water roots and fruit

8 let him be always industrious in privately reciting the veda let him be patient of hardships friendly towards all of collected mind ever liberal and never a receiver of gifts and compassionate towards all living creatures

9 let him offer according to the law the agnihotra with three sacred fires never omitting the newmoon and fullmoon sacrifices at the proper time

10 let him also offer the nakshatreshti the agrayana and the katurmasya sacrifices as well as the turayana and likewise the dakshayana in due order

11 with pure grains fit for ascetics which grow in spring and in autumn and which he himself has collected let him severally prepare the sacrificial cakes purodasa and the boiled messes karu as the law directs

12 having offered those most pure sacrificial viands consisting of the produce of the forest he may use the remainder for himself mixed with salt prepared by himself

13 let him eat vegetables that grow on dry land or in water flowers roots and fruits the productions of pure trees and oils extracted from forestfruits

14 let him avoid honey flesh and mushrooms growing on the ground or elsewhere the vegetables called bhustrina and sigruka and the sleshmantaka fruit

15 let him throw away in the month of asvina the food of ascetics which he formerly collected likewise his wornout clothes and his vegetables roots and fruit

16 let him not eat anything grown on ploughed land though it may have been thrown away by somebody nor roots and fruit grown in a village though he may be tormented by hunger

17 he may eat either what has been cooked with fire or what has been ripened by time he either may use a stone for grinding or his teeth may be his mortar

18 he may either at once after his daily meal cleanse his vessel for collecting food or lay up a store sufficient for a month or gather what suffices for six months or for a year

19 having collected food according to his ability he may either eat at night only or in the daytime only or at every fourth mealtime or at every eighth

20 or he may live according to the rule of the lunar penance kandrayana daily diminishing the quantity of his food in the bright half of the month and increasing it in the dark half or he may eat on the last days of each fortnight once a day only boiled barleygruel

21 or he may constantly subsist on flowers roots and fruit alone which have been ripened by time and have fallen spontaneously following the rule of the institutes of vikhanas

22 let him either roll about on the ground or stand during the day on tiptoe or let him alternately stand and sit down going at the savanas at sunrise at midday and at sunset to water in the forest in order to bathe

23 in summer let him expose himself to the heat of five fires during the rainy season live under the open sky and in winter be dressed in wet clothes thus gradually increasing the rigour of his austerities

24 when he bathes at the three savanas sunrise midday and sunset let him offer libations of water to the manes and the gods and practising harsher and harsher austerities let him dry up his bodily frame

25 having reposited the three sacred fires in himself according to the prescribed rule let him live without a fire without a house wholly silent subsisting on roots and fruit

26 making no effort to procure things that give pleasure chaste sleeping on the bare ground not caring for any shelter dwelling at the roots of trees

27 from brahmanas who live as ascetics let him receive alms barely sufficient to support life or from other householders of the twiceborn castes who reside in the forest

28 or the hermit who dwells in the forest may bring food from a village receiving it either in a hollow dish of leaves in his naked hand or in a broken earthen dish and may eat eight mouthfuls

29 these and other observances must a brahmana who dwells in the forest diligently practise and in order to attain complete union with the supreme soul he must study the various sacred texts contained in the upanishads

30 as well as those rites and texts which have been practised and studied by the sages rishis and by brahmana householders in order to increase their knowledge of brahman and their austerity and in order to sanctify their bodies

31 or let him walk fully determined and going straight on in a northeasterly direction subsisting on water and air until his body sinks to rest

32 a brahmana having got rid of his body by one of those modes practised by the great sages is exalted in the world of brahman free from sorrow and fear

33 but having thus passed the third part of a mans natural term of life in the forest he may live as an ascetic during the fourth part of his existence after abandoning all attachment to worldly objects

34 he who after passing from order to order after offering sacrifices and subduing his senses becomes tired with giving alms and offerings of food an ascetic gains bliss after death

35 when he has paid the three debts let him apply his mind to the attainment of final liberation he who seeks it without having paid his debts sinks downwards

36 having studied the vedas in accordance with the rule having begat sons according to the sacred law and having offered sacrifices according to his ability he may direct his mind to the attainment of final liberation

37 a twiceborn man who seeks final liberation without having studied the vedas without having begotten sons and without having offered sacrifices sinks downwards

38 having performed the ishti sacred to the lord of creatures pragapati where he gives all his property as the sacrificial fee having reposited the sacred fires in himself a brahmana may depart from his house as an ascetic

39 worlds radiant in brilliancy become the portion of him who recites the texts regarding brahman and departs from his house as an ascetic after giving a promise of safety to all created beings

40 for that twiceborn man by whom not the smallest danger even is caused to created beings there will be no danger from any quarter after he is freed from his body

41 departing from his house fully provided with the means of purification pavitra let him wander about absolutely silent and caring nothing for enjoyments that may be offered to him

42 let him always wander alone without any companion in order to attain final liberation fully understanding that the solitary man who neither forsakes nor is forsaken gains his end

43 he shall neither possess a fire nor a dwelling he may go to a village for his food he shall be indifferent to everything firm of purpose meditating and concentrating his mind on brahman

44 a potsherd instead of an almsbowl the roots of trees for a dwelling coarse wornout garments life in solitude and indifference towards everything are the marks of one who has attained liberation

45 let him not desire to die let him not desire to live let him wait for his appointed time as a servant waits for the payment of his wages

46 let him put down his foot purified by his sight let him drink water purified by straining with a cloth let him utter speech purified by truth let him keep his heart pure

47 let him patiently bear hard words let him not insult anybody and let him not become anybodys enemy for the sake of this perishable body

48 against an angry man let him not in return show anger let him bless when he is cursed and let him not utter speech devoid of truth scattered at the seven gates

49 delighting in what refers to the soul sitting in the postures prescribed by the yoga independent of external help entirely abstaining from sensual enjoyments with himself for his only companion he shall live in this world desiring the bliss of final liberation

50 neither by explaining prodigies and omens nor by skill in astrology and palmistry nor by giving advice and by the exposition of the sastras let him ever seek to obtain alms

51 let him not in order to beg go near a house filled with hermits brahmanas birds dogs or other mendicants

52 his hair nails and beard being clipped carrying an almsbowl a staff and a waterpot let him continually wander about controlling himself and not hurting any creature

53 his vessels shall not be made of metal they shall be free from fractures it is ordained that they shall be cleansed with water like the cups called kamasa at a sacrifice

54 a gourd a wooden bowl an earthen dish or one made of split cane manu the son of svayambhu has declared to be vessels suitable for an ascetic

55 let him go to beg once a day let him not be eager to obtain a large quantity of alms for an ascetic who eagerly seeks alms attaches himself also to sensual enjoyments

56 when no smoke ascends from the kitchen when the pestle lies motionless when the embers have been extinguished when the people have finished their meal when the remnants in the dishes have been removed let the ascetic always go to beg

57 let him not be sorry when he obtains nothing nor rejoice when he obtains something let him accept so much only as will sustain life let him not care about the quality of his utensils

58 let him disdain all food obtained in consequence of humble salutations for even an ascetic who has attained final liberation is bound with the fetters of the samsara by accepting food given in consequence of humble salutations

59 by eating little and by standing and sitting in solitude let him restrain his senses if they are attracted by sensual objects

60 by the restraint of his senses by the destruction of love and hatred and by the abstention from injuring the creatures he becomes fit for immortality

61 let him reflect on the transmigrations of men caused by their sinful deeds on their falling into hell and on the torments in the world of yama

62 on the separation from their dear ones on their union with hated men on their being overpowered by age and being tormented with diseases

63 on the departure of the individual soul from this body and its new birth in another womb and on its wanderings through ten thousand millions of existences

64 on the infliction of pain on embodied spirits which is caused by demerit and the gain of eternal bliss which is caused by the attainment of their highest aim gained through spiritual merit

65 by deep meditation let him recognise the subtile nature of the supreme soul and its presence in all organisms both the highest and the lowest

66 to whatever order he may be attached let him though blemished by a want of the external marks fulfil his duty equalminded towards all creatures for the external mark of the order is not the cause of the acquisition of merit

67 though the fruit of the kataka tree the clearingnut makes water clear yet the latter does not become limpid in consequence of the mention of the fruits name

68 in order to preserve living creatures let him always by day and by night even with pain to his body walk carefully scanning the ground

69 in order to expiate the death of those creatures which he unintentionally injures by day or by night an ascetic shall bathe and perform six suppressions of the breath

70 three suppressions of the breath even performed according to the rule and accompanied with the recitation of the vyahritis and of the syllable om one must know to be the highest form of austerity for every brahmana

71 for as the impurities of metallic ores melted in the blast of a furnace are consumed even so the taints of the organs are destroyed through the suppression of the breath

72 let him destroy the taints through suppressions of the breath the production of sin by fixed attention all sensual attachments by restraining his senses and organs and all qualities that are not lordly by meditation

73 let him recognise by the practice of meditation the progress of the individual soul through beings of various kinds a progress hard to understand for unregenerate men

74 he who possesses the true insight into the nature of the world is not fettered by his deeds but he who is destitute of that insight is drawn into the circle of births and deaths

75 by not injuring any creatures by detaching the senses from objects of enjoyment by the rites prescribed in the veda and by rigorously practising austerities men gain that state even in this world

7677 let him quit this dwelling composed of the five elements where the bones are the beams which is held together by tendons instead of cords where the flesh and the blood are the mortar which is thatched with the skin which is foulsmelling filled with urine and ordure infested by old age and sorrow the seat of disease harassed by pain gloomy with passion and perishable

78 he who leaves this body be it by necessity as a tree that is torn from the riverbank or freely like a bird that quits a tree is freed from the misery of this world dreadful like a shark

79 making over the merit of his own good actions to his friends and the guilt of his evil deeds to his enemies he attains the eternal brahman by the practice of meditation

80 when by the disposition of his heart he becomes indifferent to all objects he obtains eternal happiness both in this world and after death

81 he who has in this manner gradually given up all attachments and is freed from all the pairs of opposites reposes in brahman alone

82 all that has been declared above depends on meditation for he who is not proficient in the knowledge of that which refers to the soul reaps not the full reward of the performance of rites

83 let him constantly recite those texts of the veda which refer to the sacrifice those referring to the deities and those which treat of the soul and are contained in the concluding portions of the veda vedanta

84 that is the refuge of the ignorant and even that the refuse of those who know the meaning of the veda that is the protection of those who seek bliss in heaven and of those who seek endless beatitude

85 a twiceborn man who becomes an ascetic after the successive performance of the abovementioned acts shakes off sin here below and reaches the highest brahman

86 thus the law valid for selfrestrained ascetics has been explained to you now listen to the particular duties of those who give up the rites prescribed by the veda

87 the student the householder the hermit and the ascetic these constitute four separate orders which all spring from the order of householders

88 but all or even any of these orders assumed successively in accordance with the institutes of the sacred law lead the brahmana who acts by the preceding rules to the highest state

89 and in accordance with the precepts of the veda and of the smriti the housekeeper is declared to be superior to all of them for he supports the other three

90 as all rivers both great and small find a restingplace in the ocean even so men of all orders find protection with householders

91 by twiceborn men belonging to any of these four orders the tenfold law must be ever carefully obeyed

92 contentment forgiveness selfcontrol abstention from unrighteously appropriating anything obedience to the rules of purification coercion of the organs wisdom knowledge of the supreme soul truthfulness and abstention from anger form the tenfold law

93 those brahmanas who thoroughly study the tenfold law and after studying obey it enter the highest state

94 a twiceborn man who with collected mind follows the tenfold law and has paid his three debts may after learning the vedanta according to the prescribed rule become an ascetic

95 having given up the performance of all rites throwing off the guilt of his sinful acts subduing his organs and having studied the veda he may live at his ease under the protection of his son

96 he who has thus given up the performance of all rites who is solely intent on his own particular object and free from desires destroys his guilt by his renunciation and obtains the highest state

97 thus the fourfold holy law of brahmanas which after death yields imperishable rewards has been declared to you now learn the duty of kings



chapter vii

1 i will declare the duties of kings and show how a king should conduct himself how he was created and how he can obtain highest success

2 a kshatriya who has received according to the rule the sacrament prescribed by the veda must duly protect this whole world

3 for when these creatures being without a king through fear dispersed in all directions the lord created a king for the protection of this whole creation

4 taking for that purpose eternal particles of indra of the wind of yama of the sun of fire of varuna of the moon and of the lord of wealth kubera

5 because a king has been formed of particles of those lords of the gods he therefore surpasses all created beings in lustre

6 and like the sun he burns eyes and hearts nor can anybody on earth even gaze on him

7 through his supernatural power he is fire and wind he sun and moon he the lord of justice yama he kubera he varuna he great indra

8 even an infant king must not be despised from an idea that he is a mere mortal for he is a great deity in human form

9 fire burns one man only if he carelessly approaches it the fire of a kings anger consumes the whole family together with its cattle and its hoard of property

10 having fully considered the purpose his power and the place and the time he assumes by turns many different shapes for the complete attainment of justice

11 he in whose favour resides padma the goddess of fortune in whose valour dwells victory in whose anger abides death is formed of the lustre of all gods

12 the man who in his exceeding folly hates him will doubtlessly perish for the king quickly makes up his mind to destroy such a man

13 let no man therefore transgress that law which favourites nor his orders which inflict pain on those in disfavour

14 for the kings sake the lord formerly created his own son punishment the protector of all creatures an incarnation of the law formed of brahmans glory

15 through fear of him all created beings both the immovable and the movable allow themselves to be enjoyed and swerve not from their duties

16 having fully considered the time and the place of the offence the strength and the knowledge of the offender let him justly inflict that punishment on men who act unjustly

17 punishment is in reality the king and the male that the manager of affairs that the ruler and that is called the surety for the four orders obedience to the law

18 punishment alone governs all created beings punishment alone protects them punishment watches over them while they sleep the wise declare punishment to be identical with the law

19 if punishment is properly inflicted after due consideration it makes all people happy but inflicted without consideration it destroys everything

20 if the king did not without tiring inflict punishment on those worthy to be punished the stronger would roast the weaker like fish on a spit

21 the crow would eat the sacrificial cake and the dog would lick the sacrificial viands and ownership would not remain with any one the lower ones would usurp the place of the higher ones

22 the whole world is kept in order by punishment for a guiltless man is hard to find through fear of punishment the whole world yields the enjoyments which it owes

23 the gods the danavas the gandharvas the rakshasas the bird and snake deities even give the enjoyments due from them only if they are tormented by the fear of punishment

24 all castes varna would be corrupted by intermixture all barriers would be broken through and all men would rage against each other in consequence of mistakes with respect to punishment

25 but where punishment with a black hue and red eyes stalks about destroying sinners there the subjects are not disturbed provided that he who inflicts it discerns well

26 they declare that king to be a just inflicter of punishment who is truthful who acts after due consideration who is wise and who knows the respective value of virtue pleasure and wealth

27 a king who properly inflicts punishment prospers with respect to those three means of happiness but he who is voluptuous partial and deceitful will be destroyed even through the unjust punishment which he inflicts

28 punishment possesses a very bright lustre and is hard to be administered by men with unimproved minds it strikes down the king who swerves from his duty together with his relatives

29 next it will afflict his castles his territories the whole world together with the movable and immovable creation likewise the sages and the gods who on the failure of offerings ascend to the sky

30 punishment cannot be inflicted justly by one who has no assistant nor by a fool nor by a covetous man nor by one whose mind is unimproved nor by one addicted to sensual pleasures

31 by him who is pure and faithful to his promise who acts according to the institutes of the sacred law who has good assistants and is wise punishment can be justly inflicted

32 let him act with justice in his own domain with rigour chastise his enemies behave without duplicity towards his friends and be lenient towards brahmanas

33 the fame of a king who behaves thus even though he subsist by gleaning is spread in the world like a drop of oil on water

34 but the fame of a king who acts in a contrary manner and who does not subdue himself diminishes in extent among men like a drop of clarified butter in water

35 the king has been created to be the protector of the castes varna and orders who all according to their rank discharge their several duties

36 whatever must be done by him and by his servants for the protection of his people that i will fully declare to you in due order

37 let the king after rising early in the morning worship brahmanas who are well versed in the threefold sacred science and learned in polity and follow their advice

38 let him daily worship aged brahmanas who know the veda and are pure for he who always worships aged men is honoured even by rakshasas

39 let him though he may already be modest constantly learn modesty from them for a king who is modest never perishes

40 through a want of modesty many kings have perished together with their belongings through modesty even hermits in the forest have gained kingdoms

41 through a want of humility vena perished likewise king nahusha sudas the son of pigavana sumukha and nemi

42 but by humility prithu and manu gained sovereignty kubera the position of the lord of wealth and the son of gadhi the rank of a brahmana

43 from those versed in the three vedas let him learn the threefold sacred science the primeval science of government the science of dialectics and the knowledge of the supreme soul from the people the theory of the various trades and professions

44 day and night he must strenuously exert himself to conquer his senses for he alone who has conquered his own senses can keep his subjects in obedience

45 let him carefully shun the ten vices springing from love of pleasure and the eight proceeding from wrath which all end in misery

46 for a king who is attached to the vices springing from love of pleasure loses his wealth and his virtue but he who is given to those arising from anger loses even his life

47 hunting gambling sleeping by day censoriousness excess with women drunkenness an inordinate love for dancing singing and music and useless travel are the tenfold set of vices springing from love of pleasure

48 talebearing violence treachery envy slandering unjust seizure of property reviling and assault are the eightfold set of vices produced by wrath

49 that greediness which all wise men declare to be the root even of both these sets let him carefully conquer both sets of vices are produced by that

50 drinking dice women and hunting these four which have been enumerated in succession he must know to be the most pernicious in the set that springs from love of pleasure

51 doing bodily injury reviling and the seizure of property these three he must know to be the most pernicious in the set produced by wrath

52 a selfcontrolled king should know that in this set of seven which prevails everywhere each earliernamed vice is more abominable than those named later

53 on a comparison between vice and death vice is declared to be more pernicious a vicious man sinks to the nethermost hell he who dies free from vice ascends to heaven

54 let him appoint seven or eight ministers whose ancestors have been royal servants who are versed in the sciences heroes skilled in the use of weapons and descended from noble families and who have been tried

55 even an undertaking easy in itself is sometimes hard to be accomplished by a single man how much harder is it for a king especially if he has no assistant to govern a kingdom which yields great revenues

56 let him daily consider with them the ordinary business referring to peace and war the four subjects called sthana the revenue the manner of protecting himself and his kingdom and the sanctification of his gains by pious gifts

57 having first ascertained the opinion of each minister separately and then the views of all together let him do what is most beneficial for him in his affairs

58 but with the most distinguished among them all a learned brahmana let the king deliberate on the most important affairs which relate to the six measures of royal policy

59 let him full of confidence always entrust to that official all business having taken his final resolution with him let him afterwards begin to act

60 he must also appoint other officials men of integrity who are wise firm well able to collect money and well tried

61 as many persons as the due performance of his business requires so many skilful and clever men free from sloth let him appoint

62 among them let him employ the brave the skilful the highborn and the honest in offices for the collection of revenue eg in mines manufactures and storehouses but the timid in the interior of his palace

63 let him also appoint an ambassador who is versed in all sciences who understands hints expressions of the face and gestures who is honest skilful and of noble family

64 such an ambassador is commended to a king who is loyal honest skilful possessing a good memory who knows the proper place and time for action who is handsome fearless and eloquent

65 the army depends on the official placed in charge of it the due control of the subjects on the army the treasury and the government of the realm on the king peace and its opposite war on the ambassador

66 for the ambassador alone makes kings allies and separates allies the ambassador transacts that business by which kings are disunited or not

67 with respect to the affairs let the ambassador explore the expression of the countenance the gestures and actions of the foreign king through the gestures and actions of his confidential advisers and discover his designs among his servants

68 having learnt exactly from his ambassador the designs of the foreign king let the king take such measures that he does not bring evil on himself

69 let him settle in a country which is open and has a dry climate where grain is abundant which is chiefly inhabited by aryans not subject to epidemic diseases or similar troubles and pleasant where the vassals are obedient and his own people easily find their livelihood

70 let him build there a town making for his safety a fortress protected by a desert or a fortress built of stone and earth or one protected by water or trees or one formed by an encampment of armed men or a hillfort

71 let him make every effort to secure a hillfort for amongst all those fortresses mentioned a hillfort is distinguished by many superior qualities

72 the first three of those various kinds of fortresses are inhabited by wild beasts animals living in holes and aquatic animals the last three by monkeys men and gods respectively

73 as enemies do not hurt these beings when they are sheltered by their fortresses even so foes can not injure a king who has taken refuge in his fort

74 one bowman placed on a rampart is a match in battle for one hundred foes one hundred for ten thousand hence it is prescribed in the sastras that a king will posses a fortress

75 let that fort be well supplied with weapons money grain and beasts of burden with brahmanas with artisans with engines with fodder and with water

76 let him cause to be built for himself in the centre of it a spacious palace well protected habitable in every season resplendent with whitewash supplied with water and trees

77 inhabiting that let him wed a consort of equal caste varna who possesses auspicious marks on her body and is born in a great family who is charming and possesses beauty and excellent qualities

78 let him appoint a domestic priest purohita and choose officiating priests ritvig they shall perform his domestic rites and the sacrifices for which three fires are required

79 a king shall offer various srauta sacrifices at which liberal fees are distributed and in order to acquire merit he shall give to brahmanas enjoyments and wealth

80 let him cause the annual revenue in his kingdom to be collected by trusty officials let him obey the sacred law in his transactions with the people and behave like a father towards all men

81 for the various branches of business let him appoint intelligent supervisors they shall inspect all the acts of those men who transact his business

82 let him honour those brahmanas who have returned from their teachers house after studying the veda for that money which is given to brahmanas is declared to be an imperishable treasure for kings

83 neither thieves nor foes can take it nor can it be lost hence an imperishable store must be deposited by kings with brahmanas

84 the offering made through the mouth of a brahmana which is neither spilt nor falls on the ground nor ever perishes is far more excellent than agnihotras

85 a gift to one who is not a brahmana yields the ordinary reward a gift to one who calls himself a brahmana a double reward a gift to a wellread brahmana a hundredthousandfold reward a gift to one who knows the veda and the angas vedaparaga a reward without end

86 for according to the particular qualities of the recipient and according to the faith of the giver a small or a great reward will be obtained for a gift in the next world

87 a king who while he protects his people is defied by foes be they equal in strength or stronger or weaker must not shrink from battle remembering the duty of kshatriyas

88 not to turn back in battle to protect the people to honour the brahmanas is the best means for a king to secure happiness

89 those kings who seeking to slay each other in battle fight with the utmost exertion and do not turn back go to heaven

90 when he fights with his foes in battle let him not strike with weapons concealed in wood nor with such as are barbed poisoned or the points of which are blazing with fire

91 let him not strike one who in flight has climbed on an eminence nor a eunuch nor one who joins the palms of his hands in supplication nor one who flees with flying hair nor one who sits down nor one who says i am thine

92 nor one who sleeps nor one who has lost his coat of mail nor one who is naked nor one who is disarmed nor one who looks on without taking part in the fight nor one who is fighting with another foe

93 nor one whose weapons are broken nor one afflicted with sorrow nor one who has been grievously wounded nor one who is in fear nor one who has turned to flight but in all these cases let him remember the duty of honourable warriors

94 but the kshatriya who is slain in battle while he turns back in fear takes upon himself all the sin of his master whatever it may be

95 and whatever merit a man who is slain in flight may have gained for the next world all that his master takes

96 chariots and horses elephants parasols money grain cattle women all sorts of marketable goods and valueless metals belong to him who takes them singly conquering the possessor

97 a text of the veda declares that the soldiers shall present a choice portion of the booty to the king what has not been taken singly must be distributed by the king among all the soldiers

98 thus has been declared the blameless primeval law for warriors from this law a kshatriya must not depart when he strikes his foes in battle

99 let him strive to gain what he has not yet gained what he has gained let him carefully preserve let him augment what he preserves and what he has augmented let him bestow on worthy men

100 let him know that these are the four means for securing the aims of human existence let him without ever tiring properly employ them

101 what he has not yet gained let him seek to gain by his army what he has gained let him protect by careful attention what he has protected let him augment by various modes of increasing it and what he has augmented let him liberally bestow on worthy men

102 let him be ever ready to strike his prowess constantly displayed and his secrets constantly concealed and let him constantly explore the weaknesses of his foe

103 of him who is always ready to strike the whole world stands in awe let him therefore make all creatures subject to himself even by the employment of force

104 let him ever act without guile and on no account treacherously carefully guarding himself let him always fathom the treachery which his foes employ

105 his enemy must not know his weaknesses but he must know the weaknesses of his enemy as the tortoise hides its limbs even so let him secure the members of his government against treachery let him protect his own weak points

106 let him plan his undertakings patiently meditating like a heron like a lion let him put forth his strength like a wolf let him snatch his prey like a hare let him double in retreat

107 when he is thus engaged in conquest let him subdue all the opponents whom he may find by the four expedients conciliation and the rest

108 if they cannot be stopped by the three first expedients then let him overcoming them by force alone gradually bring them to subjection

109 among the four expedients conciliation and the rest the learned always recommend conciliation and the employment of force for the prosperity of kingdoms

110 as the weeder plucks up the weeds and preserves the corn even so let the king protect his kingdom and destroy his opponents

111 that king who through folly rashly oppresses his kingdom will together with his relatives ere long be deprived of his life and of his kingdom

112 as the lives of living creatures are destroyed by tormenting their bodies even so the lives of kings are destroyed by their oppressing their kingdoms

113 in governing his kingdom let him always observe the following rules for a king who governs his kingdom well easily prospers

114 let him place a company of soldiers commanded by a trusty officer the midst of two three five or hundreds of villages to be a protection of the kingdom

115 let him appoint a lord over each village as well as lords of ten villages lords of twenty lords of a hundred and lords of a thousand

116 the lord of one village himself shall inform the lord of ten villages of the crimes committed in his village and the ruler of ten shall make his report to the ruler of twenty

117 but the ruler of twenty shall report all such matters to the lord of a hundred and the lord of a hundred shall himself give information to the lord of a thousand

118 those articles which the villagers ought to furnish daily to the king such as food drink and fuel the lord of one village shall obtain

119 the ruler of ten villages shall enjoy one kula as much land as suffices for one family the ruler of twenty five kulas the superintendent of a hundred villages the revenues of one village the lord of a thousand the revenues of a town

120 the affairs of these officials which are connected with their villages and their separate business another minister of the king shall inspect who must be loyal and never remiss

121 and in each town let him appoint one superintendent of all affairs elevated in rank formidable resembling a planet among the stars

122 let that man always personally visit by turns all those other officials let him properly explore their behaviour in their districts through spies appointed to each

123 for the servants of the king who are appointed to protect the people generally become knaves who seize the property of others let him protect his subjects against such men

124 let the king confiscate the whole property of those officials who evilminded may take money from suitors and banish them

125 for women employed in the royal service and for menial servants let him fix a daily maintenance in proportion to their position and to their work

126 one pana must be given daily as wages to the lowest six to the highest likewise clothing every six months and one drona of grain every month

127 having well considered the rates of purchase and of sale the length of the road the expense for food and condiments the charges of securing the goods let the king make the traders pay duty

128 after due consideration the king shall always fix in his realm the duties and taxes in such a manner that both he himself and the man who does the work receive their due reward

129 as the leech the calf and the bee take their food little by little even so must the king draw from his realm moderate annual taxes

130 a fiftieth part of the increments on cattle and gold may be taken by the king and the eighth sixth or twelfth part of the crops

131 he may also take the sixth part of trees meat honey clarified butter perfumes medical herbs substances used for flavouring food flowers roots and fruit

132 of leaves potherbs grass objects made of cane skins of earthen vessels and all articles made of stone

133 though dying with want a king must not levy a tax on srotriyas and no srotriya residing in his kingdom must perish from hunger

134 the kingdom of that king in whose dominions a srotriya pines with hunger will even ere long be afflicted by famine

135 having ascertained his learning in the veda and the purity of his conduct the king shall provide for him means of subsistence in accordance with the sacred law and shall protect him in every way as a father protects the lawful son of his body

136 whatever meritorious acts such a brahmana performs under the full protection of the king thereby the kings length of life wealth and kingdom increase

137 let the king make the common inhabitants of his realm who live by traffic pay annually some trifle which is called a tax

138 mechanics and artisans as well as sudras who subsist by manual labour he may cause to work for himself one day in each month

139 let him not cut up his own root by levying no taxes nor the root of other men by excessive greed for by cutting up his own root or theirs he makes himself or them wretched

140 let the king having carefully considered each affair be both sharp and gentle for a king who is both sharp and gentle is highly respected

141 when he is tired with the inspection of the business of men let him place on that seat of justice his chief minister who must be acquainted with the law wise selfcontrolled and descended from a noble family

142 having thus arranged all the affairs of his government he shall zealously and carefully protect his subjects

143 that monarch whose subjects are carried off by robbers dasyu from his kingdom while they loudly call for help and he and his servants are quietly looking on is a dead and not a living king

144 the highest duty of a kshatriya is to protect his subjects for the king who enjoys the rewards just mentioned is bound to discharge that duty

145 having risen in the last watch of the night having performed the rite of personal purification having with a collected mind offered oblations in the fire and having worshipped brahmanas he shall enter the hall of audience which must possess the marks considered auspicious for a dwelling

146 tarrying there he shall gratify all subjects who come to see him by a kind reception and afterwards dismiss them having dismissed his subjects he shall take counsel with his ministers

147 ascending the back of a hill or a terrace and retiring there in a lonely place or in a solitary forest let him consult with them unobserved

148 that king whose secret plans other people though assembled for the purpose do not discover will enjoy the whole earth though he be poor in treasure

149 at the time of consultation let him cause to be removed idiots the dumb the blind and the deaf animals very aged men women barbarians the sick and those deficient in limbs

150 such despicable persons likewise animals and particularly women betray secret council for that reason he must be careful with respect to them

151 at midday or at midnight when his mental and bodily fatigues are over let him deliberate either with himself alone or with his ministers on virtue pleasure and wealth

152 on reconciling the attainment of these aims which are opposed to each other on bestowing his daughters in marriage and on keeping his sons from harm

153 on sending ambassadors on the completion of undertakings already begun on the behaviour of the women in his harem and on the doings of his spies

154 on the whole eightfold business and the five classes of spies on the goodwill or enmity and the conduct of the circle of neighbours he must carefully reflect

155 on the conduct of the middlemost prince on the doings of him who seeks conquest on the behaviour of the neutral king and on that of the foe let him sedulously meditate

156 these four constituents prakriti form briefly speaking the foundation of the circle of neighbours besides eight others are enumerated in the institutes of polity and thus the total is declared to be twelve

157 the minister the kingdom the fortress the treasury and the army are five other constituent elements of the circle for these are mentioned in connexion with each of the first twelve thus the whole circle consists briefly speaking of seventytwo constituent parts

158 let the king consider as hostile his immediate neighbour and the partisan of such a foe as friendly the immediate neighbour of his foe and as neutral the king beyond those two

159 let him overcome all of them by means of the four expedients conciliation and the rest employed either singly or conjointly or by bravery and policy alone

160 let him constantly think of the six measures of royal policy guna viz alliance war marching halting dividing the army and seeking protection

161 having carefully considered the business in hand let him resort to sitting quiet or marching alliance or war dividing his forces or seeking protection as the case may require

162 but the king must know that there are two kinds of alliances and of wars likewise two of both marching and sitting quiet and two occasions for seeking protection

163 an alliance which yields present and future advantages one must know to be of two descriptions viz that when one marches together with an ally and the contrary when the allies act separately

164 war is declared to be of two kinds viz that which is undertaken in season or out of season by oneself and for ones own purposes and that waged to avenge an injury done to a friend

165 marching to attack is said to be twofold viz that undertaken by one alone when an urgent matter has suddenly arisen and that undertaken by one allied with a friend

166 sitting quiet is stated to be of two kinds viz that incumbent on one who has gradually been weakened by fate or in consequence of former acts and that in favour of a friend

167 if the army stops in one place and its master in another in order to effect some purpose that is called by those acquainted with the virtues of the measures of royal policy the twofold division of the forces

168 seeking refuge is declared to be of two kinds first for the purpose of attaining an advantage when one is harassed by enemies secondly in order to become known among the virtuous as the protege of a powerful king

169 when the king knows that at some future time his superiority is certain and that at the time present he will suffer little injury then let him have recourse to peaceful measures

170 but when he thinks all his subjects to be exceedingly contented and that he himself is most exalted in power then let him make war

171 when he knows his own army to be cheerful in disposition and strong and that of his enemy the reverse then let him march against his foe

172 but if he is very weak in chariots and beasts of burden and in troops then let him carefully sit quiet gradually conciliating his foes

173 when the king knows the enemy to be stronger in every respect then let him divide his army and thus achieve his purpose

174 but when he is very easily assailable by the forces of the enemy then let him quickly seek refuge with a righteous powerful king

175 that prince who will coerce both his disloyal subjects and the army of the foe let him ever serve with every effort like a guru

176 when even in that condition he sees that evil is caused by such protection let him without hesitation have recourse to war

177 by all the four expedients a politic prince must arrange matters so that neither friends nor neutrals nor foes are superior to himself

178 let him fully consider the future and the immediate results of all undertakings and the good and bad sides of all past actions

179 he who knows the good and the evil which will result from his acts in the future is quick in forming resolutions for the present and understands the consequences of past actions will not be conquered

180 let him arrange everything in such a manner that no ally no neutral or foe may injure him that is the sum of political wisdom

181 but if the king undertakes an expedition against a hostile kingdom then let him gradually advance in the following manner against his foes capital

182 let the king undertake his march in the fine month margasirsha or towards the months of phalguna and kaitra according to the condition of his army

183 even at other times when he has a certain prospect of victory or when a disaster has befallen his foe he may advance to attack him

184 but having duly arranged all affairs in his original kingdom and what relates to the expedition having secured a basis for his operations and having duly dispatched his spies

185 having cleared the three kinds of roads and having made his sixfold army efficient let him leisurely proceed in the manner prescribed for warfare against the enemys capital

186 let him be very much on his guard against a friend who secretly serves the enemy and against deserters who return from the enemys camp for such men are the most dangerous foes

187 let him march on his road arraying his troops like a staff ie in an oblong or like a waggon ie in a wedge or like a boar ie in a rhombus or like a makara ie in two triangles with the apices joined or like a pin ie in a long line or like a garuda ie in a rhomboid with farextended wings

188 from whatever side he apprehends danger in that direction let him extend his troops and let him always himself encamp in an array shaped like a lotus

189 let him allot to the commanderinchief to the subordinate general and to the superior officers places in all directions and let him turn his front in that direction whence he fears danger

190 on all sides let him place troops of soldiers on whom he can rely with whom signals have been arranged who are expert both in sustaining a charge and in charging fearless and loyal

191 let him make a small number of soldiers fight in close order at his pleasure let him extend a large number in loose ranks or let him make them fight arranging a small number in the needlearray and a large number in the thunderboltarray

192 on even ground let him fight with chariots and horses in waterbound places with boats and elephants on ground covered with trees and shrubs with bows on hilly ground with swords targets and other weapons

193 men born in kurukshetra matsyas pankalas and those born in surasena let him cause to fight in the van of the battle as well as others who are tall and light

194 after arranging his troops he should encourage them by an address and carefully inspect them he should also mark the behaviour of the soldiers when they engage the enemy

195 when he has shut up his foe in a town let him sit encamped harass his kingdom and continually spoil his grass food fuel and water

196 likewise let him destroy the tanks ramparts and ditches and let him assail the foe unawares and alarm him at night

197 let him instigate to rebellion those who are open to such instigations let him be informed of his foes doings and when fate is propitious let him fight without fear trying to conquer

198 he should however try to conquer his foes by conciliation by wellapplied gifts and by creating dissension used either separately or conjointly never by fighting if it can be avoided

199 for when two princes fight victory and defeat in the battle are as experience teaches uncertain let him therefore avoid an engagement

200 but if even those three beforementioned expedients fail then let him duly exerting himself fight in such a manner that he may completely conquer his enemies

201 when he has gained victory let him duly worship the gods and honour righteous brahmanas let him grant exemptions and let him cause promises of safety to be proclaimed

202 but having fully ascertained the wishes of all the conquered let him place there a relative of the vanquished ruler on the throne and let him impose his conditions

203 let him make authoritative the lawful customs of the inhabitants just as they are stated to be and let him honour the new king and his chief servants with precious gifts

204 the seizure of desirable property which causes displeasure and its distribution which causes pleasure are both recommendable if they are resorted to at the proper time

205 all undertakings in this world depend both on the ordering of fate and on human exertion but among these two the ways of fate are unfathomable in the case of mans work action is possible

206 or the king bent on conquest considering a friend gold and land to be the triple result of an expedition may using diligent care make peace with his foe and return to his realm

207 having paid due attention to any king in the circle of neighbouring states who might attack him in the rear and to his supporter who opposes the latter let the conqueror secure the fruit of the expedition from the prince whom he attacks whether he may have become friendly or remained hostile

208 by gaining gold and land a king grows not so much in strength as by obtaining a firm friend who though weak may become powerful in the future

209 a weak friend even is greatly commended who is righteous and grateful whose people are contented who is attached and persevering in his undertakings

210 the wise declare him to be a most dangerous foe who is wise of noble race brave clever liberal grateful and firm

211 behaviour worthy of an aryan knowledge of men bravery a compassionate disposition and great liberality are the virtues of a neutral who may be courted

212 let the king without hesitation quit for his own sake even a country which is salubrious fertile and causing an increase of cattle

213 for times of need let him preserve his wealth at the expense of his wealth let him preserve his wife let him at all events preserve himself even by giving up his wife and his wealth

214 a wise king seeing that all kinds of misfortunes violently assail him at the same time should try all the four expedients be it together or separately in order to save himself

215 on the person who employs the expedients on the business to be accomplished and on all the expedients collectively on these three let him ponder and strive to accomplish his ends

216 having thus consulted with his ministers on all these matters having taken exercise and having bathed afterwards the king may enter the harem at midday in order to dine

217 there he may eat food which has been prepared by faithful incorruptible servants who know the proper time for dining which has been well examined and hallowed by sacred texts that destroy poison

218 let him mix all his food with medicines that are antidotes against poison and let him always be careful to wear gems which destroy poison

219 welltried females whose toilet and ornaments have been examined shall attentively serve him with fans water and perfumes

220 in like manner let him be careful about his carriages bed seat bath toilet and all his ornaments

221 when he has dined he may divert himself with his wives in the harem but when he has diverted himself he must in due time again think of the affairs of state

222 adorned with his robes of state let him again inspect his fighting men all his chariots and beasts of burden the weapons and accoutrements

223 having performed his twilightdevotions let him well armed hear in an inner apartment the doings of those who make secret reports and of his spies

224 but going to another secret apartment and dismissing those people he may enter the harem surrounded by female servants in order to dine again

225 having eaten there something for the second time and having been recreated by the sound of music let him go to rest and rise at the proper time free from fatigue

226 a king who is in good health must observe these rules but if he is indisposed he may entrust all this business to his servants



chapter viii

1 a king desirous of investigating law cases must enter his court of justice preserving a dignified demeanour together with brahmanas and with experienced councillors

2 there either seated or standing raising his right arm without ostentation in his dress and ornaments let him examine the business of suitors

3 daily deciding one after another all cases which fall under the eighteen titles of the law according to principles drawn from local usages and from the institutes of the sacred law

4 of those titles the first is the nonpayment of debts then follow 2 deposit and pledge 3 sale without ownership 4 concerns among partners and 5 resumption of gifts

5 6 nonpayment of wages 7 nonperformance of agreements 8 rescission of sale and purchase 9 disputes between the owner of cattle and his servants

6 10 disputes regarding boundaries 11 assault and 12 defamation 13 theft 14 robbery and violence 15 adultery

7 16 duties of man and wife 17 partition of inheritance 18 gambling and betting these are in this world the eighteen topics which give rise to lawsuits

8 depending on the eternal law let him decide the suits of men who mostly contend on the titles just mentioned

9 but if the king does not personally investigate the suits then let him appoint a learned brahmana to try them

10 that man shall enter that most excellent court accompanied by three assessors and fully consider all causes brought before the king either sitting down or standing

11 where three brahmanas versed in the vedas and the learned judge appointed by the king sit down they call that the court of fourfaced brahman

12 but where justice wounded by injustice approaches and the judges do not extract the dart there they also are wounded by that dart of injustice

13 either the court must not be entered or the truth must be spoken a man who either says nothing or speaks falsely becomes sinful

14 where justice is destroyed by injustice or truth by falsehood while the judges look on there they shall also be destroyed

15 justice being violated destroys justice being preserved preserves therefore justice must not be violated lest violated justice destroy us

16 for divine justice is said to be a bull vrisha that man who violates it kurute lam the gods consider to be a man despicable like a sudra vrishala let him therefore beware of violating justice

17 the only friend who follows men even after death is justice for everything else is lost at the same time when the body perishes

18 one quarter of the guilt of an unjust decision falls on him who committed the crime one quarter on the false witness one quarter on all the judges one quarter on the king

19 but where he who is worthy of condemnation is condemned the king is free from guilt and the judges are saved from sin the guilt falls on the perpetrator of the crime alone

20 a brahmana who subsists only by the name of his caste gati or one who merely calls himself a brahmana though his origin be uncertain may at the kings pleasure interpret the law to him but never a sudra

21 the kingdom of that monarch who looks on while a sudra settles the law will sink low like a cow in a morass

22 that kingdom where sudras are very numerous which is infested by atheists and destitute of twiceborn inhabitants soon entirely perishes afflicted by famine and disease

23 having occupied the seat of justice having covered his body and having worshipped the guardian deities of the world let him with a collected mind begin the trial of causes

24 knowing what is expedient or inexpedient what is pure justice or injustice let him examine the causes of suitors according to the order of the castes varna

25 by external signs let him discover the internal disposition of men by their voice their colour their motions their aspect their eyes and their gestures

26 the internal working of the mind is perceived through the aspect the motions the gait the gestures the speech and the changes in the eye and of the face

27 the king shall protect the inherited and other property of a minor until he has returned from his teachers house or until he has passed his minority

28 in like manner care must be taken of barren women of those who have no sons of those whose family is extinct of wives and widows faithful to their lords and of women afflicted with diseases

29 a righteous king must punish like thieves those relatives who appropriate the property of such females during their lifetime

30 property the owner of which has disappeared the king shall cause to be kept as a deposit during three years within the period of three years the owner may claim it after that term the king may take it

31 he who says this belongs to me must be examined according to the rule if he accurately describes the shape and the number of the articles found and so forth he is the owner and ought to receive that property

32 but if he does not really know the time and the place where it was lost its colour shape and size he is worthy of a fine equal in value to the object claimed

33 now the king remembering the duty of good men may take onesixth part of property lost and afterwards found or onetenth or at least onetwelfth

34 property lost and afterwards found by the kings servants shall remain in the keeping of special officials those whom the king may convict of stealing it he shall cause to be slain by an elephant

35 from that man who shall truly say with respect to treasuretrove this belongs to me the king may take onesixth or onetwelfth part

36 but he who falsely says so shall be fined in oneeighth of his property or a calculation of the value of the treasure having been made in some smaller portion of that

37 when a learned brahmana has found treasure deposited in former times he may take even the whole of it for he is master of everything

38 when the king finds treasure of old concealed in the ground let him give one half to brahmanas and place the other half in his treasury

39 the king obtains one half of ancient hoards and metals found in the ground by reason of his giving protection and because he is the lord of the soil

40 property stolen by thieves must be restored by the king to men of all castes varna a king who uses such property for himself incurs the guilt of a thief

41 a king who knows the sacred law must inquire into the laws of castes gati of districts of guilds and of families and thus settle the peculiar law of each

42 for men who follow their particular occupations and abide by their particular duty become dear to people though they may live at a distance

43 neither the king nor any servant of his shall themselves cause a lawsuit to be begun or hush up one that has been brought before them by some other man

44 as a hunter traces the lair of a wounded deer by the drops of blood even so the king shall discover on which side the right lies by inferences from the facts

45 when engaged in judicial proceedings he must pay full attention to the truth to the object of the dispute and to himself next to the witnesses to the place to the time and to the aspect

46 what may have been practised by the virtuous by such twiceborn men as are devoted to the law that he shall establish as law if it be not opposed to the customs of countries families and castes gati

47 when a creditor sues before the king for the recovery of money from a debtor let him make the debtor pay the sum which the creditor proves to be due

48 by whatever means a creditor may be able to obtain possession of his property even by those means may he force the debtor and make him pay

49 by moral suasion by suit of law by artful management or by the customary proceeding a creditor may recover property lent and fifthly by force

50 a creditor who himself recovers his property from his debtor must not be blamed by the king for retaking what is his own

51 but him who denies a debt which is proved by good evidence he shall order to pay that debt to the creditor and a small fine according to his circumstances

52 on the denial of a debt by a debtor who has been required in court to pay it the complainant must call a witness who was present when the loan was made or adduce other evidence

53 the plaintiff who calls a witness not present at the transaction who retracts his statements or does not perceive that his statements are confused or contradictory

54 or who having stated what he means to prove afterwards varies his case or who being questioned on a fact duly stated by himself does not abide by it

55 or who converses with the witnesses in a place improper for such conversation or who declines to answer a question properly put or leaves the court

56 or who being ordered to speak does not answer or does not prove what he has alleged or who does not know what is the first point and what the second fails in his suit

57 him also who says i have witnesses and being ordered to produce them produces them not the judge must on these same grounds declare to be nonsuited

58 if a plaintiff does not speak he may be punished corporally or fined according to the law if a defendant does not plead within three fortnights he has lost his cause

59 in the double of that sum which a defendant falsely denies or on which the plaintiff falsely declares shall those two men offending against justice be fined by the king

60 a defendant who being brought into court by the creditor and being questioned denies the debt shall be convicted of his falsehood by at least three witnesses who must depose in the presence of the brahmana appointed by the king

61 i will fully declare what kind of men may be made witnesses in suits by creditors and in what manner those witnesses must give true evidence

62 householders men with male issue and indigenous inhabitants of the country be they kshatriyas vaisyas or sudras are competent when called by a suitor to give evidence not any persons whatever their condition may be except in cases of urgency

63 trustworthy men of all the four castes varna may be made witnesses in lawsuits men who know their whole duty and are free from covetousness but let him reject those of an opposite character

64 those must not be made witnesses who have an interest in the suit nor familiar friends companions and enemies of the parties nor men formerly convicted of perjury nor persons suffering under severe illness nor those tainted by mortal sin

65 the king cannot be made a witness nor mechanics and actors nor a srotriya nor a student of the veda nor an ascetic who has given up all connexion with the world

66 nor one wholly dependent nor one of bad fame nor a dasyu nor one who follows forbidden occupations nor an aged man nor an infant nor one man alone nor a man of the lowest castes nor one deficient in organs of sense

67 nor one extremely grieved nor one intoxicated nor a madman nor one tormented by hunger or thirst nor one oppressed by fatigue nor one tormented by desire nor a wrathful man nor a thief

68 women should give evidence for women and for twiceborn men twiceborn men of the same kind virtuous sudras for sudras and men of the lowest castes for the lowest

69 but any person whatsoever who has personal knowledge of an act committed in the interior apartments of a house or in a forest or of a crime causing loss of life may give evidence between the parties

70 on failure of qualified witnesses evidence may given in such cases by a woman by an infant by an aged man by a pupil by a relative by a slave or by a hired servant

71 but the judge should consider the evidence of infants aged and diseased men who are apt to speak untruly as untrustworthy likewise that of men with disordered minds

72 in all cases of violence of theft and adultery of defamation and assault he must not examine the competence of witnesses too strictly

73 on a conflict of the witnesses the king shall accept as true the evidence of the majority if the conflicting parties are equal in number that of those distinguished by good qualities on a difference between equally distinguished witnesses that of the best among the twiceborn

74 evidence in accordance with what has actually been seen or heard is admissible a witness who speaks truth in those cases neither loses spiritual merit nor wealth

75 a witness who deposes in an assembly of honourable men arya anything else but what he has seen or heard falls after death headlong into hell and loses heaven

76 when a man originally not appointed to be a witness sees or hears anything and is afterwards examined regarding it he must declare it exactly as he saw or heard it

77 one man who is free from covetousness may be accepted as witness but not even many pure women because the understanding of females is apt to waver nor even many other men who are tainted with sin

78 what witnesses declare quite naturally that must be received on trials depositions differing from that which they make improperly are worthless for the purposes of justice

79 the witnesses being assembled in the court in the presence of the plaintiff and of the defendant let the judge examine them kindly exhorting them in the following manner

80 what ye know to have been mutually transacted in this matter between the two men before us declare all that in accordance with the truth for ye are witnesses in this cause

81 a witness who speaks the truth in his evidence gains after death the most excellent regions of bliss and here below unsurpassable fame such testimony is revered by brahman himself

82 he who gives false evidence is firmly bound by varunas fetters helpless during one hundred existences let men therefore give true evidence

83 by truthfulness a witness is purified through truthfulness his merit grows truth must therefore be spoken by witnesses of all castes varna

84 the soul itself is the witness of the soul and the soul is the refuge of the soul despise not thy own soul the supreme witness of men

85 the wicked indeed say in their hearts nobody sees us but the gods distinctly see them and the male within their own breasts

86 the sky the earth the waters the male in the heart the moon the sun the fire yama and the wind the night the two twilights and justice know the conduct of all corporeal beings

87 the judge being purified shall ask in the forenoon the twiceborn witnesses who also have been purified and stand facing the north or the east to give true evidence in the presence of images of the gods and of brahmanas

88 let him examine a brahmana beginning with speak a kshatriya beginning with speak the truth a vaisya admonishing him by mentioning his kine grain and gold a sudra threatening him with the guilt of every crime that causes loss of caste

89 saying whatever places of torment are assigned by the sages to the slayer of a brahmana to the murderer of women and children to him who betrays a friend and to an ungrateful man those shall be thy portion if thou speakest falsely

90 the reward of all meritorious deeds which thou good man hast done since thy birth shall become the share of the dogs if in thy speech thou departest from the truth

91 if thou thinkest o friend of virtue with respect to thyself i am alone know that that sage who witnesses all virtuous acts and all crimes ever resides in thy heart

92 if thou art not at variance with that divine yama the son of vivasvat who dwells in thy heart thou needest neither visit the ganges nor the land of the kurus

93 naked and shorn tormented with hunger and thirst and deprived of sight shall the man who gives false evidence go with a potsherd to beg food at the door of his enemy

94 headlong in utter darkness shall the sinful man tumble into hell who being interrogated in a judicial inquiry answers one question falsely

95 that man who in a court of justice gives an untrue account of a transaction or asserts a fact of which he was not an eyewitness resembles a blind man who swallows fish with the bones

96 the gods are acquainted with no better man in this world than him of whom his conscious soul has no distrust when he gives evidence

97 learn now o friend from an enumeration in due order how many relatives he destroys who gives false evidence in several particular cases

98 he kills five by false testimony regarding small cattle he kills ten by false testimony regarding kine he kills a hundred by false evidence concerning horses and a thousand by false evidence concerning men

99 by speaking falsely in a cause regarding gold he kills the born and the unborn by false evidence concerning land he kills everything beware therefore of false evidence concerning land

100 they declare false evidence concerning water concerning the carnal enjoyment of women and concerning all gems produced in water or consisting of stones to be equally wicked as a lie concerning land

101 marking well all the evils which are produced by perjury declare thou openly everything as thou hast heard or seen it

102 brahmanas who tend cattle who trade who are mechanics actors or singers menial servants or usurers the judge shall treat like sudras

103 in some cases a man who though knowing the facts to be different gives such false evidence from a pious motive does not lose heaven such evidence they call the speech of the gods

104 whenever the death of a sudra of a vaisya of a kshatriya or of a brahmana would be caused by a declaration of the truth a falsehood may be spoken for such falsehood is preferable to the truth

105 such witnesses must offer to sarasvati oblations of boiled rice karu which are sacred to the goddess of speech thus performing the best penance in order to expiate the guilt of that falsehood

106 or such a witness may offer according to the rule clarified butter in the fire reciting the kushmanda texts or the rik sacred to varuna untie o varuna the uppermost fetter or the three verses addressed to the waters

107 a man who without being ill does not give evidence in cases of loans and the like within three fortnights after the summons shall become responsible for the whole debt and pay a tenth part of the whole as a fine to the king

108 the witness to whom within seven days after he has given evidence happens a misfortune through sickness a fire or the death of a relative shall be made to pay the debt and a fine

109 if two parties dispute about matters for which no witnesses are available and the judge is unable to really ascertain the truth he may cause it to be discovered even by an oath

110 both by the great sages and the gods oaths have been taken for the purpose of deciding doubtful matters and vasishtha even swore an oath before king sudas the son of pigavana

111 let no wise man swear an oath falsely even in a trifling matter for he who swears an oath falsely is lost in this world and after death

112 no crime causing loss of caste is committed by swearing falsely to women the objects of ones desire at marriages for the sake of fodder for a cow or of fuel and in order to show favour to a brahmana

113 let the judge cause a brahmana to swear by his veracity a kshatriya by his chariot or the animal he rides on and by his weapons a vaisya by his kine grain and gold and a sudra by imprecating on his own head the guilt of all grievous offences pataka

114 or the judge may cause the party to carry fire or to dive under water or severally to touch the heads of his wives and children

115 he whom the blazing fire burns not whom the water forces not to come quickly up who meets with no speedy misfortune must be held innocent on the strength of his oath

116 for formerly when vatsa was accused by his younger brother the fire the spy of the world burned not even a hair of his by reason of his veracity

117 whenever false evidence has been given in any suit let the judge reverse the judgment and whatever has been done must be considered as undone

118 evidence given from covetousness distraction terror friendship lust wrath ignorance and childishness is declared to be invalid

119 i will propound in due order the particular punishments for him who gives false evidence from any one of these motives

120 he who commits perjury through covetousness shall be fined one thousand panas he who does it through distraction in the lowest amercement if a man does it through fear two middling amercements shall be paid as a fine if he does it through friendship four times the amount of the lowest amercement

121 he who does it through lust shall pay ten times the lowest amercement but he who does it through wrath three times the next or second amercement he who does it through ignorance two full hundreds but he who does it through childishness one hundred panas

122 they declare that the wise have prescribed these fines for perjury in order to prevent a failure of justice and in order to restrain injustice

123 but a just king shall fine and banish men of the three lower castes varna who have given false evidence but a brahmana he shall only banish

124 manu the son of the selfexistent svayambhu has named ten places on which punishment may be made to fall in the cases of the three lower castes varna but a brahmana shall depart unhurt from the country

125 these are the organ the belly the tongue the two hands and fifthly the two feet the eye the nose the two ears likewise the whole body

126 let the king having fully ascertained the motive the time and place of the offence and having considered the ability of the criminal to suffer and the nature of the crime cause punishment to fall on those who deserve it

127 unjust punishment destroys reputation among men and fame after death and causes even in the next world the loss of heaven let him therefore beware of inflicting it

128 a king who punishes those who do not deserve it and punishes not those who deserve it brings great infamy on himself and after death sinks into hell

129 let him punish first by gentle admonition afterwards by harsh reproof thirdly by a fine after that by corporal chastisement

130 but when he cannot restrain such offenders even by corporal punishment then let him apply to them even all the four modes cojointly

131 those technical names of certain quantities of copper silver and gold which are generally used on earth for the purpose of business transactions among men i will fully declare

132 the very small mote which is seen when the sun shines through a lattice they declare to be the least of all quantities and to be called a trasarenu a floating particle of dust

133 know that eight trasarenus are equal in bulk to a liksha the egg of a louse three of those to one grain of black mustard ragasarshapa and three of the latter to a white mustardseed

134 six grains of white mustard are one middlesized barleycorn and three barleycorns one krishnala raktika or gungaberry five krishnalas are one masha bean and sixteen of those one suvarna

135 four suvarnas are one pala and ten palas one dharana two krishnalas of silver weighed together must be considered one mashaka of silver

136 sixteen of those make a silver dharana or purana but know that a karsha of copper is a karshapana or pana

137 know that ten dharanas of silver make one satamana four suvarnas must be considered equal in weight to a nishka

138 two hundred and fifty panas are declared to be the first or lowest amercement five hundred are considered as the mean or middlemost but one thousand as the highest

139 a debt being admitted as due the defendant shall pay five in the hundred as a fine if it be denied and proved twice as much that is the teaching of manu

140 a moneylender may stipulate as an increase of his capital for the interest allowed by vasishtha and take monthly the eightieth part of a hundred

141 or remembering the duty of good men he may take two in the hundred by the month for he who takes two in the hundred becomes not a sinner for gain

142 just two in the hundred three four and five and not more he may take as monthly interest according to the order of the castes varna

143 but if a beneficial pledge ie one from which profit accrues has been given he shall receive no interest on the loan nor can he after keeping such a pledge for a very long time give or sell it

144 a pledge to be kept only must not be used by force the creditor so using it shall give up his whole interest or if it has been spoilt by use he shall satisfy the owner by paying its original price else he commits a theft of the pledge

145 neither a pledge nor a deposit can be lost by lapse of time they are both recoverable though they have remained long with the bailee

146 things used with friendly assent a cow a camel a ridinghorse and a beast made over for breaking in are never lost to the owner

147 but in general whatever chattel an owner sees enjoyed by others during ten years while though present he says nothing that chattel he shall not recover

148 if the owner is neither an idiot nor a minor and if his chattel is enjoyed by another before his eyes it is lost to him by law the adverse possessor shall retain that property

149 a pledge a boundary the property of infants an open deposit a sealed deposit women the property of the king and the wealth of a srotriya are not lost in consequence of adverse enjoyment

150 the fool who uses a pledge without the permission of the owner shall remit half of his interest as a compensation for such use

151 in money transactions interest paid at one time not by instalments shall never exceed the double of the principal on grain fruit wool or hair and beasts of burden it must not be more than five times the original amount

152 stipulated interest beyond the legal rate being against the law cannot be recovered they call that a usurious way of lending the lender is in no case entitled to more than five in the hundred

153 let him not take interest beyond the year nor such as is unapproved nor compound interest periodical interest stipulated interest and corporal interest

154 he who unable to pay a debt at the fixed time wishes to make a new contract may renew the agreement after paying the interest which is due

155 if he cannot pay the money due as interest he may insert it in the renewed agreement he must pay as much interest as may be due

156 he who has made a contract to carry goods by a wheeled carriage for money and has agreed to a certain place or time shall not reap that reward if he does not keep to the place and the time stipulated

157 whatever rate men fix who are expert in seavoyages and able to calculate the profit according to the place the time and the objects carried that has legal force in such cases with respect to the payment to be made

158 the man who becomes a surety in this world for the appearance of a debtor and produces him not shall pay the debt out of his own property

159 but money due by a surety or idly promised or lost at play or due for spirituous liquor or what remains unpaid of a fine and a tax or duty the son of the party owing it shall not be obliged to pay

160 this just mentioned rule shall apply to the case of a surety for appearance only if a surety for payment should die the judge may compel even his heirs to discharge the debt

161 on what account then is it that after the death of a surety other than for payment whose affairs are fully known the creditor may in some cases afterwards demand the debt of the heirs

162 if the surety had received money from him for whom he stood bail and had money enough to pay then the heir of him who received it shall pay the debt out of his property that is the settled rule

163 a contract made by a person intoxicated or insane or grievously disordered by disease and so forth or wholly dependent by an infant or very aged man or by an unauthorised party is invalid

164 that agreement which has been made contrary to the law or to the settled usage of the virtuous can have no legal force though it be established by proofs

165 a fraudulent mortgage or sale a fraudulent gift or acceptance and any transaction where he detects fraud the judge shall declare null and void

166 if the debtor be dead and the money borrowed was expended for the family it must be paid by the relatives out of their own estate even if they are divided

167 should even a person wholly dependent make a contract for the behoof of the family the master of the house whether living in his own country or abroad shall not rescind it

168 what is given by force what is enjoyed by force also what has been caused to be written by force and all other transactions done by force manu has declared void

169 three suffer for the sake of others witnesses a surety and judges but four enrich themselves through others a brahmana a moneylender a merchant and a king

170 no king however indigent shall take anything that ought not to be taken nor shall he however wealthy decline taking that which he ought to take be it ever so small

171 in consequence of his taking what ought not to be taken or of his refusing what ought to be received a king will be accused of weakness and perish in this world and after death

172 by taking his due by preventing the confusion of the castes varna and by protecting the weak the power of the king grows and he prospers in this world and after death

173 let the prince therefore like yama not heeding his own likings and dislikings behave exactly like yama suppressing his anger and controlling himself

174 but that evilminded king who in his folly decides causes unjustly his enemies soon subjugate

175 if subduing love and hatred he decides the causes according to the law the hearts of his subjects turn towards him as the rivers run towards the ocean

176 the debtor who complains to the king that his creditor recovers the debt independently of the court shall be compelled by the king to pay as a fine one quarter of the sum and to his creditor the money due

177 even by personal labour shall the debtor make good what he owes to his creditor if he be of the same caste or of a lower one but a debtor of a higher caste shall pay it gradually when he earns something

178 according to these rules let the king equitably decide between men who dispute with each other the matters which are proved by witnesses and other evidence

179 a sensible man should make a deposit only with a person of good family of good conduct well acquainted with the law veracious having many relatives wealthy and honourable arya

180 in whatever manner a person shall deposit anything in the hands of another in the same manner ought the same thing to be received back by the owner as the delivery was so must be the redelivery

181 he who restores not his deposit to the depositor at his request may be tried by the judge in the depositors absence

182 on failure of witnesses let the judge actually deposit gold with that defendant under some pretext or other through spies of suitable age and appearance and afterwards demand it back

183 if the defendant restores it in the manner and shape in which it was bailed there is nothing of that description in his hands for which others accuse him

184 but if he restores not that gold as be ought to those spies then he shall be compelled by force to restore both deposits that is a settled rule of law

185 an open or a sealed deposit must never be returned to a near relative of the depositor during the latters lifetime for if the recipient dies without delivering them they are lost but if he does not die they are not lost

186 but a depositary who of his own accord returns them to a near relative of a deceased depositor must not be harassed about them by the king or by the depositors relatives

187 and in doubtful cases he should try to obtain that object by friendly means without having recourse to artifice or having inquired into depositarys conduct he should settle the matter with gentle means

188 such is the rule for obtaining back all those open deposits in the case of a sealed deposit the depositary shall incur no censure unless he has taken out something

189 a deposit which has been stolen by thieves or washed away by water or burned by fire the bailee shall not make it good unless he took part of it for himself

190 him who appropriates a deposit and him who asks for it without having made it the judge shall try by all sorts of means and by the oaths prescribed in the veda

191 he who does not return a deposit and he who demands what he never bailed shall both be punished like thieves or be compelled to pay a fine equal to the value of the object retained or claimed

192 the king should compel him who does not restore an open deposit and in like manner him who retains a sealed deposit to pay a fine equal to its value

193 that man who by false pretences may possess himself of anothers property shall be publicly punished by various modes of corporal or capital chastisement together with his accomplices

194 if a deposit of a particular description or quantity is bailed by anybody in the presence of a number of witnesses it must be known to be of that particular description and quantity the depositary who makes a false statement regarding it is liable to a fine

195 but if anything is delivered or received privately it must be privately returned as the bailment was so should be the redelivery

196 thus let the king decide causes concerning a deposit and a friendly loan for use without showing undue rigour to the depositary

197 if anybody sells the property of another man without being the owner and without the assent of the owner the judge shall not admit him who is a thief though he may not consider himself as a thief as a witness in any case

198 if the offender is a kinsman of the owner he shall be fined six hundred panas if he is not a kinsman nor has any excuse he shall be guilty of theft

199 a gift or sale made by anybody else but the owner must be considered as null and void according to the rule in judicial proceedings

200 where possession is evident but no title is perceived there the title shall be a proof of ownership not possession such is the settled rule

201 he who obtains a chattel in the market before a number of witnesses acquires that chattel with a clear legal title by purchase

202 if the original seller be not producible the buyer being exculpated by a public sale must be dismissed by the king without punishment but the former owner who lost the chattel shall receive it back from the buyer

203 one commodity mixed with another must not be sold as pure nor a bad one as good nor less than the proper quantity or weight nor anything that is not at hand or that is concealed

204 if after one damsel has been shown another be given to the bridegroom he may marry them both for the same price that manu ordained

205 he who gives a damsel in marriage having first openly declared her blemishes whether she be insane or afflicted with leprosy or have lost her virginity is not liable to punishment

206 if an officiating priest chosen to perform a sacrifice abandons his work a share only of the fee in proportion to the work done shall be given to him by those who work with him

207 but he who abandons his work after the sacrificial fees have been given shall obtain his full share and cause to be performed what remains by another priest

208 but if specific fees are ordained for the several parts of a rite shall he who performs the part receive them or shall they all share them

209 the adhvaryu priest shall take the chariot and the brahman at the kindling of the fires agnyadhana a horse the hotri priest shall also take a horse and the udgatri the cart used when the soma is purchased

210 the four chief priests among all the sixteen who are entitled to one half shall receive a moiety of the fee the next four one half of that the set entitled to a third share one third and those entitled to a fourth a quarter

211 by the application of these principles the allotment of shares must be made among those men who here below perform their work conjointly

212 should money be given or promised for a pious purpose by one man to another who asks for it the gift shall be void if the money is afterwards not used in the manner stated

213 but if the recipient through pride or greed tries to enforce the fulfilment of the promise he shall be compelled by the king to pay one suvarna as an expiation for his theft

214 thus the lawful subtraction of a gift has been fully explained i will next propound the law for the nonpayment of wages

215 a hired servant or workman who without being ill out of pride fails to perform his work according to the agreement shall be fined eight krishnalas and no wages shall be paid to him

216 but if he is really ill and after recovery performs his work according to the original agreement he shall receive his wages even after the lapse of a very long time

217 but if he whether sick or well does not perform or cause to be performed by others his work according to his agreement the wages for that work shall not be given to him even if it be only slightly incomplete

218 thus the law for the nonpayment of wages has been completely stated i will next explain the law concerning men who break an agreement

219 if a man belonging to a corporation inhabiting a village or a district after swearing to an agreement breaks it through avarice the king shall banish him from his realm

220 and having imprisoned such a breaker of an agreement he shall compel him to pay six nishkas each of four suvarnas and one satamana of silver

221 a righteous king shall apply this law of fines in villages and castes gati to those who break an agreement

222 if anybody in this world after buying or selling anything repent of his bargain he may return or take back that chattel within ten days

223 but after the lapse of ten days he may neither give nor cause it to be given back both he who takes it back and he who gives it back except by consent shall be fined by the king six hundred panas

224 but the king himself shall impose a fine of ninetysix panas on him who gives a blemished damsel to a suitor without informing him of the blemish

225 but that man who out of malice says of a maiden she is not a maiden shall be fined one hundred panas if he cannot prove her blemish

226 the nuptial texts are applied solely to virgins and nowhere among men to females who have lost their virginity for such females are excluded from religious ceremonies

227 the nuptial texts are a certain proof that a maiden has been made a lawful wife but the learned should know that they and the marriage ceremony are complete with the seventh step of the bride around the sacred fire

228 if anybody in this world repent of any completed transaction the king shall keep him on the road of rectitude in accordance with the rules given above

229 i will fully declare in accordance with the true law the rules concerning the disputes arising from the transgressions of owners of cattle and of herdsmen

230 during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman during the night on the owner provided they are in his house if it be otherwise the herdsman will be responsible for them also during the night

231 a hired herdsman who is paid with milk may milk with the consent of the owner the best cow out of ten such shall be his hire if no other wages are paid

232 the herdsman alone shall make good the loss of a beast strayed destroyed by worms killed by dogs or by falling into a pit if he did not duly exert himself to prevent it

233 but for an animal stolen by thieves though he raised an alarm the herdsman shall not pay provided he gives notice to his master at the proper place and time

234 if cattle die let him carry to his master their ears skin tails bladders tendons and the yellow concrete bile and let him point out their particular marks

235 but if goats or sheep are surrounded by wolves and the herdsman does not hasten to their assistance lie shall be responsible for any animal which a wolf may attack and kill

236 but if they kept in proper order graze together in the forest and a wolf suddenly jumping on one of them kills it the herdsman shall bear in that case no responsibility

237 on all sides of a village a space one hundred dhanus or three samyathrows in breadth shall be reserved for pasture and thrice that space round a town

238 if the cattle do damage to unfenced crops on that common the king shall in that case not punish the herdsmen

239 the owner of the field shall make there a hedge over which a camel cannot look and stop every gap through which a dog or a boar can thrust his head

240 if cattle do mischief in an enclosed field near a highway or near a village the herdsman shall be fined one hundred panas but cattle unattended by a herdsman the watchman in the field shall drive away

241 for damage in other fields each head of cattle shall pay a fine of one pana and a quarter and in all cases the value of the crop destroyed shall be made good to the owner of the field that is the settled rule

242 but manu has declared that no fine shall be paid for damage done by a cow within ten days after her calving by bulls and by cattle sacred to the gods whether they are attended by a herdsman or not

243 if the crops are destroyed by the husbandmans own fault the fine shall amount to ten times as much as the kings share but the fine shall be only half that amount if the fault lay with the servants and the farmer had no knowledge of it

244 to these rules a righteous king shall keep in all cases of transgressions by masters their cattle and herdsmen

245 if a dispute has arisen between two villages concerning a boundary the king shall settle the limits in the month of gyaishtha when the landmarks are most distinctly visible

246 let him mark the boundaries by trees eg nyagrodhas asvatthas kimsukas cottontrees salas palmyra palms and trees with milky juice

247 by clustering shrubs bamboos of different kinds samis creepers and raised mounds reeds thickets of kubgaka thus the boundary will not be forgotten

248 tanks wells cisterns and fountains should be built where boundaries meet as well as temples

249 and as he will see that through mens ignorance of the boundaries trespasses constantly occur in the world let him cause to be made other hidden marks for boundaries

250 stones bones cows hair chaff ashes potsherds dry cowdung bricks cinders pebbles and sand

251 and whatever other things of a similar kind the earth does not corrode even after a long time those he should cause to be buried where one boundary joins the other

252 by these signs by long continued possession and by constantly flowing streams of water the king shall ascertain the boundary of the land of two disputing parties

253 if there be a doubt even on inspection of the marks the settlement of a dispute regarding boundaries shall depend on witnesses

254 the witnesses giving evidence regarding a boundary shall be examined concerning the landmarks in the presence of the crowd of the villagers and also of the two litigants

255 as they being questioned unanimously decide even so he shall record the boundary in writing together with their names

256 let them putting earth on their heads wearing chaplets of red flowers and red dresses being sworn each by the rewards for his meritorious deeds settle the boundary in accordance with the truth

257 if they determine the boundary in the manner stated they are guiltless being veracious witnesses but if they determine it unjustly they shall be compelled to pay a fine of two hundred panas

258 on failure of witnesses from the two villages men of the four neighbouring villages who are pure shall make as witnesses a decision concerning the boundary in the presence of the king

259 on failure of neighbours who are original inhabitants of the country and can be witnesses with respect to the boundary the king may hear the evidence even of the following inhabitants of the forest

260 viz hunters fowlers herdsmen fishermen rootdiggers snakecatchers gleaners and other foresters

261 as they being examined declare the marks for the meeting of the boundaries to be even so the king shall justly cause them to be fixed between the two villages

262 the decision concerning the boundarymarks of fields wells tanks of gardens and houses depends upon the evidence of the neighbours

263 should the neighbours give false evidence when men dispute about a boundarymark the king shall make each of them pay the middlemost amercement as a fine

264 he who by intimidation possesses himself of a house a tank a garden or a field shall be fined five hundred panas if he trespassed through ignorance the fine shall be two hundred panas

265 if the boundary cannot be ascertained by any evidence let a righteous king with the intention of benefiting them all himself assign his land to each that is the settled rule

266 thus the law for deciding boundary disputes has been fully declared i will next propound the manner of deciding cases of defamation

267 a kshatriya having defamed a brahmana shall be fined one hundred panas a vaisya one hundred and fifty or two hundred a sudra shall suffer corporal punishment

268 a brahmana shall be fined fifty panas for defaming a kshatriya in the case of a vaisya the fine shall be twentyfive panas in the case of a sudra twelve

269 for offences of twiceborn men against those of equal caste varna the fine shall be also twelve panas for speeches which ought not to be uttered that and every fine shall be double

270 a onceborn man a sudra who insults a twiceborn man with gross invective shall have his tongue cut out for he is of low origin

271 if he mentions the names and castes gati of the twiceborn with contumely an iron nail ten fingers long shall be thrust redhot into his mouth

272 if he arrogantly teaches brahmanas their duty the king shall cause hot oil to be poured into his mouth and into his ears

273 he who through arrogance makes false statements regarding the learning of a castefellow his country his caste gati or the rites by which his body was sanctified shall be compelled to pay a fine of two hundred panas

274 he who even in accordance with the true facts contemptuously calls another man oneeyed lame or the like names shall be fined at least one karshapana

275 he who defames his mother his father his wife his brother his son or his teacher and he who gives not the way to his preceptor shall be compelled to pay one hundred panas

276 for mutual abuse by a brahmana and a kshatriya a fine must be imposed by a discerning king on the brahmana the lowest amercement but on the kshatriya the middlemost

277 a vaisya and a sudra must be punished exactly in the same manner according to their respective castes but the tongue of the sudra shall not be cut out that is the decision

278 thus the rules for punishments applicable to cases of defamation have been truly declared i will next propound the decision of cases of assault

279 with whatever limb a man of a low caste does hurt to a man of the three highest castes even that limb shall be cut off that is the teaching of manu

280 he who raises his hand or a stick shall have his hand cut off he who in anger kicks with his foot shall have his foot cut off

281 a lowcaste man who tries to place himself on the same seat with a man of a high caste shall be branded on his hip and be banished or the king shall cause his buttock to be gashed

282 if out of arrogance he spits on a superior the king shall cause both his lips to be cut off if he urines on him the penis if he breaks wind against him the anus

283 if he lays hold of the hair of a superior let the king unhesitatingly cut off his hands likewise if he takes him by the feet the beard the neck or the scrotum

284 he who breaks the skin of an equal or fetches blood from him shall be fined one hundred panas he who cuts a muscle six nishkas he who breaks a bone shall be banished

285 according to the usefulness of the several kinds of trees a fine must be inflicted for injuring them that is the settled rule

286 if a blow is struck against men or animals in order to give them pain the judge shall inflict a fine in proportion to the amount of pain caused

287 if a limb is injured a wound is caused or blood flows the assailant shall be made to pay to the sufferer the expenses of the cure or the whole both the usual amercement and the expenses of the cure as a fine to the king

288 he who damages the goods of another be it intentionally or unintentionally shall give satisfaction to the owner and pay to the king a fine equal to the damage

289 in the case of damage done to leather or to utensils of leather of wood or of clay the fine shall be five times their value likewise in the case of damage to flowers roots and fruit

290 they declare with respect to a carriage its driver and its owner that there are ten cases in which no punishment for damage done can be inflicted in other cases a fine is prescribed

291 when the nosestring is snapped when the yoke is broken when the carriage turns sideways or back when the axle or a wheel is broken

292 when the leatherthongs the rope around the neck or the bridle are broken and when the driver has loudly called out make way manu has declared that in all these cases no punishment shall be inflicted

293 but if the cart turns off the road through the drivers want of skill the owner shall be fined if damage is done two hundred panas

294 if the driver is skilful but negligent he alone shall be fined if the driver is unskilful the occupants of the carriage also shall be each fined one hundred panas

295 but if he is stopped on his way by cattle or by another carriage and he causes the death of any living being a fine shall without doubt be imposed

296 if a man is killed his guilt will be at once the same as that of a thief for large animals such as cows elephants camels or horses half of that

297 for injuring small cattle the fine shall be two hundred panas the fine for beautiful wild quadrupeds and birds shall amount to fifty panas

298 for donkeys sheep and goats the fine shall be five mashas but the punishment for killing a dog or a pig shall be one masha

299 a wife a son a slave a pupil and a younger brother of the full blood who have committed faults may be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo

300 but on the back part of the body only never on a noble part he who strikes them otherwise will incur the same guilt as a thief

301 thus the whole law of assault and hurt has been declared completely i will now explain the rules for the decision in cases of theft

302 let the king exert himself to the utmost to punish thieves for if he punishes thieves his fame grows and his kingdom prospers

303 that king indeed is ever worthy of honour who ensures the safety of his subjects for the sacrificial session sattra which he as it were performs thereby ever grows in length the safety of his subjects representing the sacrificial fee

304 a king who duly protects his subjects receives from each and all the sixth part of their spiritual merit if he does not protect them the sixth part of their demerit also will fall on him

305 whatever merit a man gains by reading the veda by sacrificing by charitable gifts or by worshipping gurus and gods the king obtains a sixth part of that in consequence of his duly protecting his kingdom

306 a king who protects the created beings in accordance with the sacred law and smites those worthy of corporal punishment daily offers as it were sacrifices at which hundred thousands are given as fees

307 a king who does not afford protection yet takes his share in kind his taxes tolls and duties daily presents and fines will after death soon sink into hell

308 they declare that a king who affords no protection yet receives the sixth part of the produce takes upon himself all the foulness of his whole people

309 know that a king who heeds not the rules of the law who is an atheist and rapacious who does not protect his subjects but devours them will sink low after death

310 let him carefully restrain the wicked by three methods by imprisonment by putting them in fetters and by various kinds of corporal punishments

311 for by punishing the wicked and by favouring the virtuous kings are constantly sanctified just as twiceborn men by sacrifices

312 a king who desires his own welfare must always forgive litigants infants aged and sick men who inveigh against him

313 he who being abused by men in pain pardons them will in reward of that act be exalted in heaven but he who proud of his kingly state forgives them not will for that reason sink into hell

314 a thief shall running approach the king with flying hair confessing that theft and saying thus have i done punish me

315 and he must carry on his shoulder a pestle or a club of khadira wood or a spear sharp at both ends or an iron staff

316 whether he be punished or pardoned the thief is freed from the guilt of theft but the king if he punishes not takes upon himself the guilt of the thief

317 the killer of a learned brahmana throws his guilt on him who eats his food an adulterous wife on her negligent husband a sinning pupil or sacrificer on their negligent teacher or priest a thief on the king who pardons him

318 but men who have committed crimes and have been punished by the king go to heaven being pure like those who performed meritorious deeds

319 he who steals the rope or the waterpot from a well or damages a hut where water is distributed shall pay one masha as a fine and restore the article abstracted or damaged in its proper place

320 on him who steals more than ten kumbhas of grain corporal punishment shall be inflicted in other cases he shall be fined eleven times as much and shall pay to the owner the value of his property

321 so shall corporal punishment be inflicted for stealing more than a hundred palas of articles sold by the weight ie of gold silver and so forth and of most excellent clothes

322 for stealing more than fifty palas it is enacted that the hands of the offender shall be cut off but in other cases let him inflict a fine of eleven times the value

323 for stealing men of noble family and especially women and the most precious gems the offender deserves corporal or capital punishment

324 for stealing large animals weapons or medicines let the king fix a punishment after considering the time and the purpose for which they were destined

325 for stealing cows belonging to brahmanas piercing the nostrils of a barren cow and for stealing other cattle belonging to brahmanas the offender shall forthwith lose half his feet

326 for stealing thread cotton drugs causing fermentation cowdung molasses sour milk sweet milk buttermilk water or grass

327 vessels made of bamboo or other cane salt of various kinds earthen vessels earth and ashes

328 fish birds oil clarified butter meat honey and other things that come from beasts

329 or other things of a similar kind spirituous liquor boiled rice and every kind of cooked food the fine shall be twice the value of the stolen article

330 for flowers green corn shrubs creepers trees and other unhusked grain the fine shall be five krishnalas

331 for husked grain vegetables roots and fruit the fine shall be one hundred panas if there is no connexion between the owner and the thief fifty panas if such a connexion exists

332 an offence of this description which is committed in the presence of the owner and with violence will be robbery if it is committed in his absence it will be theft likewise if the possession of anything is denied after it has been taken

333 on that man who may steal any of the abovementioned articles when they are prepared for use let the king inflict the first or lowest amercement likewise on him who may steal a sacred fire out of the room in which it is kept

334 with whatever limb a thief in any way commits an offence against men even of that the king shall deprive him in order to prevent a repetition of the crime

335 neither a father nor a teacher nor a friend nor a mother nor a wife nor a son nor a domestic priest must be left unpunished by a king if they do not keep within their duty

336 where another common man would be fined one karshapana the king shall be fined one thousand that is the settled rule

337 in a case of theft the guilt of a sudra shall be eightfold that of a vaisya sixteenfold that of a kshatriya twoandthirtyfold

338 that of a brahmana sixtyfourfold or quite a hundredfold or even twice fourandsixtyfold each of them knowing the nature of the offence

339 the taking of roots and of fruit from trees of wood for a sacrificial fire and of grass for feeding cows manu has declared to be no theft

340 a brahmana seeking to obtain property from a man who took what was not given to him either by sacrificing for him or by teaching him is even like a thief

341 a twiceborn man who is travelling and whose provisions are exhausted shall not be fined if he takes two stalks of sugarcane or two esculent roots from the field of another man

342 he who ties up unbound or sets free tied up cattle of other men he who takes a slave a horse or a carriage will have incurred the guilt of a thief

343 a king who punishes thieves according to these rules will gain fame in this world and after death unsurpassable bliss

344 a king who desires to gain the throne of indra and imperishable eternal fame shall not even for a moment neglect to punish the man who commits violence

345 he who commits violence must be considered as the worst offender more wicked than a defamer than a thief and than he who injures another with a staff

346 but that king who pardons the perpetrator of violence quickly perishes and incurs hatred

347 neither for friendships sake nor for the sake of great lucre must a king let go perpetrators of violence who cause terror to all creatures

348 twiceborn men may take up arms when they are hindered in the fulfilment of their duties when destruction threatens the twiceborn castes varna in evil times

349 in their own defence in a strife for the fees of officiating priests and in order to protect women and brahmanas he who under such circumstances kills in the cause of right commits no sin

350 one may slay without hesitation an assassin who approaches with murderous intent whether he be ones teacher a child or an aged man or a brahmana deeply versed in the vedas

351 by killing an assassin the slayer incurs no guilt whether he does it publicly or secretly in that case fury recoils upon fury

352 men who commit adultery with the wives of others the king shall cause to be marked by punishments which cause terror and afterwards banish

353 for by adultery is caused a mixture of the castes varna among men thence follows sin which cuts up even the roots and causes the destruction of everything

354 a man formerly accused of such offences who secretly converses with another mans wife shall pay the first or lowest amercement

355 but a man not before accused who thus speaks with a woman for some reasonable cause shall not incur any guilt since in him there is no transgression

356 he who addresses the wife of another man at a tirtha outside the village in a forest or at the confluence of rivers suffer the punishment for adulterous acts samgrahana

357 offering presents to a woman romping with her touching her ornaments and dress sitting with her on a bed all these acts are considered adulterous acts samgrahana

358 if one touches a woman in a place which ought not to be touched or allows oneself to be touched in such a spot all such acts done with mutual consent are declared to be adulterous samgrahana

359 a man who is not a brahmana ought to suffer death for adultery samgrahana for the wives of all the four castes even must always be carefully guarded

360 mendicants bards men who have performed the initiatory ceremony of a vedic sacrifice and artisans are not prohibited from speaking to married women

361 let no man converse with the wives of others after he has been forbidden to do so but he who converses with them in spite of a prohibition shall be fined one suvarna

362 this rule does not apply to the wives of actors and singers nor of those who live on the intrigues of their own wives for such men send their wives to others or concealing themselves allow them to hold criminal intercourse

363 yet he who secretly converses with such women or with female slaves kept by one master and with female ascetics shall be compelled to pay a small fine

364 he who violates an unwilling maiden shall instantly suffer corporal punishment but a man who enjoys a willing maiden shall not suffer corporal punishment if his caste be the same as hers

365 from a maiden who makes advances to a man of high caste he shall not take any fine but her who courts a man of low caste let him force to live confined in her house

366 a man of low caste who makes love to a maiden of the highest caste shall suffer corporal punishment he who addresses a maiden on equal caste shall pay the nuptial fee if her father desires it

367 but if any man through insolence forcibly contaminates a maiden two of his fingers shall be instantly cut off and he shall pay a fine of six hundred panas

368 a man of equal caste who defiles a willing maiden shall not suffer the amputation of his fingers but shall pay a fine of two hundred panas in order to deter him from a repetition of the offence

369 a damsel who pollutes another damsel must be fined two hundred panas pay the double of her nuptial fee and receive ten lashes with a rod

370 but a woman who pollutes a damsel shall instantly have her head shaved or two fingers cut off and be made to ride through the town on a donkey

371 if a wife proud of the greatness of her relatives or her own excellence violates the duty which she owes to her lord the king shall cause her to be devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many

372 let him cause the male offender to be burnt on a redhot iron bed they shall put logs under it until the sinner is burned to death

373 on a man once convicted who is again accused within a year a double fine must be inflicted even thus must the fine be doubled for repeated intercourse with a vratya and a kandali

374 a sudra who has intercourse with a woman of a twiceborn caste varna guarded or unguarded shall be punished in the following manner if she was unguarded he loses the part offending and all his property if she was guarded everything even his life

375 for intercourse with a guarded brahmana a vaisya shall forfeit all his property after imprisonment for a year a kshatriya shall be fined one thousand panas and be shaved with the urine of an ass

376 if a vaisya or a kshatriya has connexion with an unguarded brahmana let him fine the vaisya five hundred panas and the kshatriya one thousand

377 but even these two if they offend with a brahmani not only guarded but the wife of an eminent man shall be punished like a sudra or be burnt in a fire of dry grass

378 a brahmana who carnally knows a guarded brahmani against her will shall be fined one thousand panas but he shall be made to pay five hundred if he had connexion with a willing one

379 tonsure of the head is ordained for a brahmana instead of capital punishment but men of other castes shall suffer capital punishment

380 let him never slay a brahmana though he have committed all possible crimes let him banish such an offender leaving all his property to him and his body unhurt

381 no greater crime is known on earth than slaying a brahmana a king therefore must not even conceive in his mind the thought of killing a brahmana

382 if a vaisya approaches a guarded female of the kshatriya caste or a kshatriya a guarded vaisya woman they both deserve the same punishment as in the case of an unguarded brahmana female

383 a brahmana shall be compelled to pay a fine of one thousand panas if he has intercourse with guarded females of those two castes for offending with a guarded sudra female a fine of one thousand panas shall be inflicted on a kshatriya or a vaisya

384 for intercourse with an unguarded kshatriya a fine of five hundred panas shall fall on a vaisya but for the same offence a kshatriya shall be shaved with the urine of a donkey or pay the same fine

385 a brahmana who approaches unguarded females of the kshatriya or vaisya castes or a sudra female shall be fined five hundred panas but for intercourse with a female of the lowest castes one thousand

386 that king in whose town lives no thief no adulterer no defamer no man guilty of violence and no committer of assaults attains the world of sakra indra

387 the suppression of those five in his dominions secures to a king paramount sovereignty among his peers and fame in the world

388 a sacrificer who forsakes an officiating priest and an officiating priest who forsakes a sacrificer each being able to perform his work and not contaminated by grievous crimes must each be fined one hundred panas

389 neither a mother nor a father nor a wife nor a son shall be cast off he who casts them off unless guilty of a crime causing loss of caste shall be fined six hundred panas

390 if twiceborn men dispute among each other concerning the duty of the orders a king who desires his own welfare should not hastily decide what is the law

391 having shown them due honor he should with the assistance of brahmanas first soothe them by gentle speech and afterwards teach them their duty

392 a brahmana who does not invite his next neighbour and his neighbour next but one though both he worthy of the honour to a festival at which twenty brahmanas are entertained is liable to a fine of one masha

393 a srotriya who does not entertain a virtuous srotriya at auspicious festive rites shall be made to pay him twice the value of the meal and a masha of gold as a fine to the king

394 a blind man an idiot a cripple who moves with the help of a board a man full seventy years old and he who confers benefits on srotriyas shall not be compelled by any king to pay a tax

395 let the king always treat kindly a srotriya a sick or distressed man an infant and an aged or indigent man a man of high birth and an honourable man arya

396 a washerman shall wash the clothes of his employers gently on a smooth board of salmaliwood he shall not return the clothes of one person for those of another nor allow anybody but the owner to wear them

397 a weaver who has received ten palas of thread shall return cloth weighing one pala more he who acts differently shall be compelled to pay a fine of twelve panas

398 let the king take onetwentieth of that amount which men well acquainted with the settlement of tolls and duties and skilful in estimating the value of all kinds of merchandise may fix as the value for each saleable commodity

399 let the king confiscate the whole property of a trader who out of greed exports goods of which the king has a monopoly or the export of which is forbidden

400 he who avoids a customhouse or a toll he who buys or sells at an improper time or he who makes a false statement in enumerating his goods shall be fined eight times the amount of duty which he tried to evade

401 let the king fix the rates for the purchase and sale of all marketable goods having duly considered whence they come whither they go how long they have been kept the probable profit and the probable outlay

402 once in five nights or at the close of each fortnight let the king publicly settle the prices for the merchants

403 all weights and measures must be duly marked and once in six months let him reexamine them

404 at a ferry an empty cart shall be made to pay one pana a mans load half a pana an animal and a woman one quarter of a pana an unloaded man onehalf of a quarter

405 carts laden with vessels full of merchandise shall be made to pay toll at a ferry according to the value of the goods empty vessels and men without luggage some trifle

406 for a long passage the boathire must be proportioned to the places and times know that this rule refers to passages along the banks of rivers at sea there is no settled freight

407 but a woman who has been pregnant two months or more an ascetic a hermit in the forest and brahmanas who are students of the veda shall not be made to pay toll at a ferry

408 whatever may be damaged in a boat by the fault of the boatmen that shall be made good by the boatmen collectively each paying his share

409 this decision in suits brought by passengers holds good only in case the boatmen are culpably negligent on the water in the case of an accident caused by the will of the gods no fine can be inflicted on them

410 the king should order a vaisya to trade to lend money to cultivate the land or to tend cattle and a sudra to serve the twiceborn castes

411 some wealthy brahmana shall compassionately support both a kshatriya and a vaisya if they are distressed for a livelihood employing them on work which is suitable for their castes

412 but a brahmana who because he is powerful out of greed makes initiated men of the twiceborn castes against their will do the work of slaves shall be fined by the king six hundred panas

413 but a sudra whether bought or unbought he may compel to do servile work for he was created by the selfexistent svayambhu to be the slave of a brahmana

414 a sudra though emancipated by his master is not released from servitude since that is innate in him who can set him free from it

415 there are slaves of seven kinds viz he who is made a captive under a standard he who serves for his daily food he who is born in the house he who is bought and he who is given he who is inherited from ancestors and he who is enslaved by way of punishment

416 a wife a son and a slave these three are declared to have no property the wealth which they earn is acquired for him to whom they belong

417 a brahmana may confidently seize the goods of his sudra slave for as that slave can have no property his master may take his possessions

418 the king should carefully compel vaisyas and sudra to perform the work prescribed for them for if these two castes swerved from their duties they would throw this whole world into confusion

419 let him daily look after the completion of his undertakings his beasts of burden and carriages the collection of his revenues and the disbursements his mines and his treasury

420 a king who thus brings to a conclusion all the legal business enumerated above and removes all sin reaches the highest state of bliss



chapter ix

1 i will now propound the eternal laws for a husband and his wife who keep to the path of duty whether they be united or separated

2 day and night woman must be kept in dependence by the males of their families and if they attach themselves to sensual enjoyments they must be kept under ones control

3 her father protects her in childhood her husband protects her in youth and her sons protect her in old age a woman is never fit for independence

4 reprehensible is the father who gives not his daughter in marriage at the proper time reprehensible is the husband who approaches not his wife in due season and reprehensible is the son who does not protect his mother after her husband has died

5 women must particularly be guarded against evil inclinations however trifling they may appear for if they are not guarded they will bring sorrow on two families

6 considering that the highest duty of all castes even weak husbands must strive to guard their wives

7 he who carefully guards his wife preserves the purity of his offspring virtuous conduct his family himself and his means of acquiring merit

8 the husband after conception by his wife becomes an embryo and is born again of her for that is the wifehood of a wife gaya that he is born gayate again by her

9 as the male is to whom a wife cleaves even so is the son whom she brings forth let him therefore carefully guard his wife in order to keep his offspring pure

10 no man can completely guard women by force but they can be guarded by the employment of the following expedients

11 let the husband employ his wife in the collection and expenditure of his wealth in keeping everything clean in the fulfilment of religious duties in the preparation of his food and in looking after the household utensils

12 women confined in the house under trustworthy and obedient servants are not well guarded but those who of their own accord keep guard over themselves are well guarded

13 drinking spirituous liquor associating with wicked people separation from the husband rambling abroad sleeping at unseasonable hours and dwelling in other mens houses are the six causes of the ruin of women

14 women do not care for beauty nor is their attention fixed on age thinking it is enough that he is a man they give themselves to the handsome and to the ugly

15 through their passion for men through their mutable temper through their natural heartlessness they become disloyal towards their husbands however carefully they may be guarded in this world

16 knowing their disposition which the lord of creatures laid in them at the creation to be such every man should most strenuously exert himself to guard them

17 when creating them manu allotted to women a love of their bed of their seat and of ornament impure desires wrath dishonesty malice and bad conduct

18 for women no sacramental rite is performed with sacred texts thus the law is settled women who are destitute of strength and destitute of the knowledge of vedic texts are as impure as falsehood itself that is a fixed rule

19 and to this effect many sacred texts are sung also in the vedas in order to make fully known the true disposition of women hear now those texts which refer to the expiation of their sins

20 if my mother going astray and unfaithful conceived illicit desires may my father keep that seed from me that is the scriptural text

21 if a woman thinks in her heart of anything that would pain her husband the abovementioned text is declared to be a means for completely removing such infidelity

22 whatever be the qualities of the man with whom a woman is united according to the law such qualities even she assumes like a river united with the ocean

23 akshamala a woman of the lowest birth being united to vasishtha and sarangi being united to mandapala became worthy of honour

24 these and other females of low birth have attained eminence in this world by the respective good qualities of their husbands

25 thus has been declared the ever pure popular usage which regulates the relations between husband and wife hear next the laws concerning children which are the cause of happiness in this world and after death

26 between wives striyah who are destined to bear children who secure many blessings who are worthy of worship and irradiate their dwellings and between the goddesses of fortune sriyah who reside in the houses of men there is no difference whatsoever

27 the production of children the nurture of those born and the daily life of men of these matters woman is visibly the cause

28 offspring the due performance on religious rites faithful service highest conjugal happiness and heavenly bliss for the ancestors and oneself depend on ones wife alone

29 she who controlling her thoughts speech and acts violates not her duty towards her lord dwells with him after death in heaven and in this world is called by the virtuous a faithful wife sadhvi

30 but for disloyalty to her husband a wife is censured among men and in her next life she is born in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases the punishment of her sin

31 listen now to the following holy discussion salutary to all men which the virtuous of the present day and the ancient great sages have held concerning male offspring

32 they all say that the male issue of a woman belongs to the lord but with respect to the meaning of the term lord the revealed texts differ some call the begetter of the child the lord others declare that it is the owner of the soil

33 by the sacred tradition the woman is declared to be the soil the man is declared to be the seed the production of all corporeal beings takes place through the union of the soil with the seed

34 in some cases the seed is more distinguished and in some the womb of the female but when both are equal the offspring is most highly esteemed

35 on comparing the seed and the receptacle of the seed the seed is declared to be more important for the offspring of all created beings is marked by the characteristics of the seed

36 whatever kind on seed is sown in a field prepared in due season a plant of that same kind marked with the peculiar qualities of the seed springs up in it

37 this earth indeed is called the primeval womb of created beings but the seed develops not in its development any properties of the womb

38 in this world seeds of different kinds sown at the proper time in the land even in one field come forth each according to its kind

39 the rice called vrihi and that called sali mudgabeans sesamum mashabeans barley leeks and sugarcane all spring up according to their seed

40 that one plant should be sown and another be produced cannot happen whatever seed is sown a plant of that kind even comes forth

41 never therefore must a prudent welltrained man who knows the veda and its angas and desires long life cohabit with anothers wife

42 with respect to this matter those acquainted with the past recite some stanzas sung by vayu the wind to show that seed must not be sown by any man on that which belongs to another

43 as the arrow shot by a hunter who afterwards hits a wounded deer in the wound made by another is shot in vain even so the seed sown on what belongs to another is quickly lost to the sower

44 sages who know the past call this earth prithivi even the wife of prithu they declare a field to belong to him who cleared away the timber and a deer to him who first wounded it

45 he only is a perfect man who consists of three persons united his wife himself and his offspring thus says the veda and learned brahmanas propound this maxim likewise the husband is declared to be one with the wife

46 neither by sale nor by repudiation is a wife released from her husband such we know the law to be which the lord of creatures pragapati made of old

47 once is the partition of the inheritance made once is a maiden given in marriage and once does a man say i will give each of those three acts is done once only

48 as with cows mares female camels slavegirls buffalocows shegoats and ewes it is not the begetter or his owner who obtains the offspring even thus it is with the wives of others

49 those who having no property in a field but possessing seedcorn sow it in anothers soil do indeed not receive the grain of the crop which may spring up

50 if one mans bull were to beget a hundred calves on another mans cows they would belong to the owner of the cows in vain would the bull have spent his strength

51 thus men who have no marital property in women but sow their seed in the soil of others benefit the owner of the woman but the giver of the seed reaps no advantage

52 if no agreement with respect to the crop has been made between the owner of the field and the owner of the seed the benefit clearly belongs to the owner of the field the receptacle is more important than the seed

53 but if by a special contract a field is made over to another for sowing then the owner of the seed and the owner of the soil are both considered in this world as sharers of the crop

54 if seed be carried by water or wind into somebodys field and germinates there the plant sprung from that seed belongs even to the owner of the field the owner of the seed does not receive the crop

55 know that such is the law concerning the offspring of cows mares slavegirls female camels shegoats and ewes as well as of females of birds and buffalocows

56 thus the comparative importance of the seed and of the womb has been declared to you i will next propound the law applicable to women in times of misfortune

57 the wife of an elder brother is for his younger brother the wife of a guru but the wife of the younger is declared to be the daughterinlaw of the elder

58 an elder brother who approaches the wife of the younger and a younger brother who approaches the wife of the elder except in times of misfortune both become outcasts even though they were duly authorised

59 on failure of issue by her husband a woman who has been authorised may obtain in the proper manner prescribed the desired offspring by cohabitation with a brotherinlaw or with some other sapinda of the husband

60 he who is appointed to cohabit with the widow shall approach her at night anointed with clarified butter and silent and beget one son by no means a second

61 some sages versed in the law considering the purpose of the appointment not to have been attained by those two on the birth of the first think that a second son may be lawfully procreated on such women

62 but when the purpose of the appointment to cohabit with the widow bas been attained in accordance with the law those two shall behave towards each other like a father and a daughterinlaw

63 if those two being thus appointed deviate from the rule and act from carnal desire they will both become outcasts as men who defile the bed of a daughterinlaw or of a guru

64 by twiceborn men a widow must not be appointed to cohabit with any other than her husband for they who appoint her to another man will violate the eternal law

65 in the sacred texts which refer to marriage the appointment of widows is nowhere mentioned nor is the remarriage of widows prescribed in the rules concerning marriage

66 this practice which is reprehended by the learned of the twiceborn castes as fit for cattle is said to have occurred even among men while vena ruled

67 that chief of royal sages who formerly possessed the whole world caused a confusion of the castes varna his intellect being destroyed by lust

68 since that time the virtuous censure that man who in his folly appoints a woman whose husband died to bear children to another man

69 if the future husband of a maiden dies after troth verbally plighted her brotherinlaw shall wed her according to the following rule

70 having according to the rule espoused her who must be clad in white garments and be intent on purity he shall approach her once in each proper season until issue be had

71 let no prudent man after giving his daughter to one man give her again to another for he who gives his daughter whom he had before given incurs the guilt of speaking falsely regarding a human being

72 though a man may have accepted a damsel in due form he may abandon her if she be blemished diseased or deflowered and if she have been given with fraud

73 if anybody gives away a maiden possessing blemishes without declaring them the bridegroom may annul that contract with the evilminded giver

74 a man who has business abroad may depart after securing a maintenance for his wife for a wife even though virtuous may be corrupted if she be distressed by want of subsistence

75 if the husband went on a journey after providing for her the wife shall subject herself to restraints in her daily life but if he departed without providing for her she may subsist by blameless manual work

76 if the husband went abroad for some sacred duty she must wait for him eight years if he went to acquire learning or fame six years if he went for pleasure three years

77 for one year let a husband bear with a wife who hates him but after the lapse of a year let him deprive her of her property and cease to cohabit with her

78 she who shows disrespect to a husband who is addicted to some evil passion is a drunkard or diseased shall be deserted for three months and be deprived of her ornaments and furniture

79 but she who shows aversion towards a mad or outcast husband a eunuch one destitute of manly strength or one afflicted with such diseases as punish crimes shall neither be cast off nor be deprived of her property

80 she who drinks spirituous liquor is of bad conduct rebellious diseased mischievous or wasteful may at any time be superseded by another wife

81 a barren wife may be superseded in the eighth year she whose children all die in the tenth she who bears only daughters in the eleventh but she who is quarrelsome without delay

82 but a sick wife who is kind to her husband and virtuous in her conduct may be superseded only with her own consent and must never be disgraced

83 a wife who being superseded in anger departs from her husbands house must either be instantly confined or cast off in the presence of the family

84 but she who though having been forbidden drinks spirituous liquor even at festivals or goes to public spectacles or assemblies shall be fined six krishnalas

85 if twiceborn men wed women of their own and of other lower castes the seniority honour and habitation of those wives must be settled according to the order of the castes varna

86 among all twiceborn men the wife of equal caste alone not a wife of a different caste by any means shall personally attend her husband and assist him in his daily sacred rites

87 but he who foolishly causes that duty to be performed by another while his wife of equal caste is alive is declared by the ancients to be as despicable as a kandala sprung from the brahmana caste

88 to a distinguished handsome suitor of equal caste should a father give his daughter in accordance with the prescribed rule though she have not attained the proper age

89 but the maiden though marriageable should rather stop in the fathers house until death than that he should ever give her to a man destitute of good qualities

90 three years let a damsel wait though she be marriageable but after that time let her choose for herself a bridegroom of equal caste and rank

91 if being not given in marriage she herself seeks a husband she incurs no guilt nor does he whom she weds

92 a maiden who choses for herself shall not take with her any ornaments given by her father or her mother or her brothers if she carries them away it will be theft

93 but he who takes to wife a marriageable damsel shall not pay any nuptial fee to her father for the latter will lose his dominion over her in consequence of his preventing the legitimate result of the appearance of her enemies

94 a man aged thirty years shall marry a maiden of twelve who pleases him or a man of twentyfour a girl eight years of age if the performance of his duties would otherwise be impeded he must marry sooner

95 the husband receives his wife from the gods he does not wed her according to his own will doing what is agreeable to the gods he must always support her while she is faithful

96 to be mothers were women created and to be fathers men religious rites therefore are ordained in the veda to be performed by the husband together with the wife

97 if after the nuptial fee has been paid for a maiden the giver of the fee dies she shall be given in marriage to his brother in case she consents

98 even a sudra ought not to take a nuptial fee when he gives away his daughter for he who takes a fee sell his daughter covering the transaction by another name

99 neither ancients nor moderns who were good men have done such a deed that after promising a daughter to one man they have her to another

100 nor indeed have we heard even in former creations of such a thing as the covert sale of a daughter for a fixed price called a nuptial fee

101 let mutual fidelity continue until death this may be considered as the summary of the highest law for husband and wife

102 let man and woman united in marriage constantly exert themselves that they may not be disunited and may not violate their mutual fidelity

103 thus has been declared to you the law for a husband and his wife which is intimately connected with conjugal happiness and the manner of raising offspring in times of calamity learn now the law concerning the division of the inheritance

104 after the death of the father and of the mother the brothers being assembled may divide among themselves in equal shares the paternal and the maternal estate for they have no power over it while the parents live

105 or the eldest alone may take the whole paternal estate the others shall live under him just as they lived under their father

106 immediately on the birth of his firstborn a man is called the father of a son and is freed from the debt to the manes that son therefore is worthy to receive the whole estate

107 that son alone on whom he throws his debt and through whom he obtains immortality is begotten for the fulfilment of the law all the rest they consider the offspring of desire

108 as a father supports his sons so let the eldest support his younger brothers and let them also in accordance with the law behave towards their eldest brother as sons behave towards their father

109 the eldest son makes the family prosperous or on the contrary brings it to ruin the eldest is considered among men most worthy of honour the eldest is not treated with disrespect by the virtuous

110 if the eldest brother behaves as an eldest brother ought to do he must be treated like a mother and like a father but if he behaves in a manner unworthy of an eldest brother he should yet be honoured like a kinsman

111 either let them thus live together or apart if each desires to gain spiritual merit for by their living separate their merit increases hence separation is meritorious

112 the additional share deducted for the eldest shall be onetwentieth of the estate and the best of all chattels for the middlemost half of that but for the youngest onefourth

113 both the eldest and the youngest shall take their shares according to the rule just stated each of those who are between the eldest and the youngest shall have the share prescribed for the middlemost

114 among the goods of every kind the eldest shall take the best article and even a single chattel which is particularly good as well as the best of ten animals

115 but among brothers equally skilled in their occupations there is no additional share consisting of the best animal among ten some trifle only shall be given to the eldest as a token of respect

116 if additional shares are thus deducted one must allot equal shares out of the residue to each but if no deduction is made the allotment of the shares among them shall be made in the following manner

117 let the eldest son take one share in excess the brother born next after him one share and a half the younger ones one share each thus the law is settled

118 but to the maiden sisters the brothers shall severally give portions out of their shares each out of his share onefourth part those who refuse to give it will become outcasts

119 let him never divide the value of a single goat or sheep or a single beast with uncloven hoofs it is prescribed that a single goat or sheep remaining after an equal division belongs to the eldest alone

120 if a younger brother begets a son on the wife of the elder the division must then be made equally this the law is settled

121 the representative the son begotten on the wife is not invested with the right of the principal the eldest brother to an additional share the principal became a father on the procreation of a son by his younger brother hence one should give a share to the son begotten on the wife of the elder brother according to the rule stated above

122 if there be a doubt how the division shall be made in case the younger son is born of the elder wife and the elder son of the younger wife

123 then the son born of the first wife shall take as his additional share one most excellent bull the next best bulls shall belong to those who are inferior on account of their mothers

124 but the eldest son being born of the eldest wife shall receive fifteen cows and a bull the other sons may then take shares according to the seniority of their mothers that is a settled rule

125 between sons born of wives equal in caste and without any other distinction no seniority in right of the mother exists seniority is declared to be according to birth

126 and with respect to the subrahmanya texts also it is recorded that the invocation of indra shall be made by the firstborn of twins likewise conceived at one time in the wombs of their mothers the seniority is declared to depend on actual birth

127 he who has no son may make his daughter in the following manner an appointed daughter putrika saying to her husband the male child born of her shall perform my funeral rites

128 according to this rule daksha himself lord of created beings formerly made all his female offspring appointed daughters in order to multiply his race

129 he gave ten to dharma thirteen to kasyapa twentyseven to king soma honouring them with an affectionate heart

130 a son is even as oneself such a daughter is equal to a son how can another heir take the estate while such an appointed daughter who is even oneself lives

131 but whatever may be the separate property of the mother that is the share of the unmarried daughter alone and the son of an appointed daughter shall take the whole estate of his maternal grandfather who leaves no son

132 the son of an appointed daughter indeed shall also take the estate of his own father who leaves no other son he shall then present two funeral cakes to his own father and to his maternal grandfather

133 between a sons son and the son of an appointed daughter there is no difference neither with respect to worldly matters nor to sacred duties for their father and mother both sprang from the body of the same man

134 but if after a daughter has been appointed a son be born to her father the division of the inheritance must in that case be equal for there is no right of primogeniture for a woman

135 but if an appointed daughter by accident dies without leaving a son the husband of the appointed daughter may without hesitation take that estate

136 through that son whom a daughter either not appointed or appointed may bear to a husband of equal caste his maternal grandfather has a sons son he shall present the funeral cake and take the estate

137 through a son he conquers the worlds through a sons son he obtains immortality but through his sons grandson he gains the world of the sun

138 because a son delivers trayate his father from the hell called put he was therefore called puttra a deliverer from put by the selfexistent svayambhu himself

139 between a sons son and the son of a daughter there exists in this world no difference for even the son of a daughter saves him who has no sons in the next world like the sons son

140 let the son of an appointed daughter first present a funeral cake to his mother the second to her father the funeral to his fathers father

141 of the man who has an adopted datrima son possessing all good qualities that same son shall take the inheritance though brought from another family

142 an adopted son shall never take the family name and the estate of his natural father the funeral cake follows the family name and the estate the funeral offerings of him who gives his son in adoption cease as far as that son is concerned

143 the son of a wife not appointed to have issue by another and he whom an appointed female already the mother of a son bears to her brotherinlaw are both unworthy of a share one being the son of an adulterer and the other produced through mere lust

144 even the male child of a female duly appointed not begotten according to the rule given above is unworthy of the paternal estate for he was procreated by an outcast

145 a son legally begotten on such an appointed female shall inherit like a legitimate son of the body for that seed and the produce belong according to the law to the owner of the soil

146 he who takes care of his deceased brothers estate and of his widow shall after raising up a son for his brother give that property even to that son

147 if a woman duly appointed bears a son to her brotherinlaw or to another sapinda that son if he is begotten through desire they declare to be incapable of inheriting and to be produced in vain

148 the rules given above must be understood to apply to a distribution among sons of women of the same caste hear now the law concerning those begotten by one man on many wives of different castes

149 if there be four wives of a brahmana in the direct order of the castes the rule for the division of the estate among the sons born of them is as follows

150 the slave who tills the field the bull kept for impregnating cows the vehicle the ornaments and the house shall be given as an additional portion to the brahmana son and one most excellent share

151 let the son of the brahmana wife take three shares of the remainder of the estate the son of the kshatriya two the son of the vaisya a share and a half and the son of the sudra may take one share

152 or let him who knows the law make ten shares of the whole estate and justly distribute them according to the following rule

153 the brahmana son shall take four shares son of the kshatriya wife three the son of the vaisya shall have two parts the son of the sudra may take one share

154 whether a brahmana have sons or have no sons by wives of the twiceborn castes the heir must according to the law give to the son of a sudra wife no more than a tenth part of his estate

155 the son of a brahmana a kshatriya and a vaisya by a sudra wife receives no share of the inheritance whatever his father may give to him that shall be his property

156 all the sons of twiceborn men born of wives of the same caste shall equally divide the estate after the others have given to the eldest an additional share

157 for a sudra is ordained a wife of his own caste only and no other those born of her shall have equal shares even if there be a hundred sons

158 among the twelve sons of men whom manu sprung from the selfexistent svayambhu enumerates six are kinsmen and heirs and six not heirs but kinsmen

159 the legitimate son of the body the son begotten on a wife the son adopted the son made the son secretly born and the son cast off are the six heirs and kinsmen

160 the son of an unmarried damsel the son received with the wife the son bought the son begotten on a remarried woman the son selfgiven and the son of a sudra female are the six who are not heirs but kinsmen

161 whatever result a man obtains who tries to cross a sheet of water in an unsafe boat even that result obtains he who tries to pass the gloom of the next world with the help of bad substitutes for a real son

162 if the two heirs of one man be a legitimate son of his body and a son begotten on his wife each of the two sons to the exclusion of the other shall take the estate of his natural father

163 the legitimate son of the body alone shall be the owner of the paternal estate but in order to avoid harshness let him allow a maintenance to the rest

164 but when the legitimate son of the body divides the paternal estate he shall give onesixth or onefifth part of his fathers property to the son begotten on the wife

165 the legitimate son and the son of the wife thus share the fathers estate but the other tell become members of the family and inherit according to their order each later named on failure of those named earlier

166 him whom a man begets on his own wedded wife let him know to be a legitimate son of the body aurasa the first in rank

167 he who was begotten according to the peculiar law of the niyoga on the appointed wife of a dead man of a eunuch or of one diseased is called a son begotten on a wife kshetraga

168 that boy equal by caste whom his mother or his father affectionately give confirming the gift with a libation of water in times of distress to a man as his son must be considered as an adopted son datrima

169 but he is considered a son made kritrima whom a man makes his son he being equal by caste acquainted with the distinctions between right and wrong and endowed with filial virtues

170 if a child be born in a mans house and his father be not known he is a son born secretly in the house gudhotpanna and shall belong to him of whose wife he was born

171 he whom a man receives as his son after he has been deserted by his parents or by either of them is called a son cast off apaviddha

172 a son whom a damsel secretly bears in the house of her father one shall name the son of an unmarried damsel kanina and declare such offspring of an unmarried girl to belong to him who weds her afterwards

173 if one marries either knowingly or unknowingly a pregnant bride the child in her womb belongs to him who weds her and is called a son received with the bride sahodha

174 if a man buys a boy whether equal or unequal in good qualities from his father and mother for the sake of having a son that child is called a son bought kritaka

175 if a woman abandoned by her husband or a widow of her own accord contracts a second marriage and bears a son he is called the son of a remarried woman paunarbhava

176 if she be still a virgin or one who returned to her first husband after leaving him she is worthy to again perform with her second or first deserted husband the nuptial ceremony

177 he who having lost his parents or being abandoned by them without just cause gives himself to a man is called a son selfgiven svayamdatta

178 the son whom a brahmana begets through lust on a sudra female is though alive parayan a corpse sava and hence called a parasava a living corpse

179 a son who is begotten by a sudra on a female slave or on the female slave of his slave may if permitted by his father take a share of the inheritance thus the law is settled

180 these eleven the son begotten on the wife and the rest as enumerated above the wise call substitutes for a son taken in order to prevent a failure of the funeral ceremonies

181 those sons who have been mentioned in connection with the legitimate son of the body being begotten by strangers belong in reality to him from whose seed they sprang but not to the other man who took them

182 if among brothers sprung from one father one have a son manu has declared them all to have male offspring through that son

183 if among all the wives of one husband one have a son manu declares them all to be mothers of male children through that son

184 on failure of each better son each next inferior one is worthy of the inheritance but if there be many of equal rank they shall all share the estate

185 not brothers nor fathers but sons take the paternal estate but the father shall take the inheritance of a son who leaves no male issue and his brothers

186 to three ancestors water must be offered to three the funeral cake is given the fourth descendant is the giver of these oblations the fifth has no connection with them

187 always to that relative within three degrees who is nearest to the deceased sapinda the estate shall belong afterwards a sakulya shall be the heir then the spiritual teacher or the pupil

188 but on failure of all heirs brahmanas shall share the estate who are versed the in the three vedas pure and selfcontrolled thus the law is not violated

189 the property of a brahmana must never be taken by the king that is a settled rule but the property of men of other castes the king may take on failure of all heirs

190 if the widow of a man who died without leaving issue raises up to him a son by a member of the family sagotra she shall deliver to that son the whole property which belonged to the deceased

191 but if two sons begotten by two different men contend for the property in the hands of their mother each shall take to the exclusion of the other what belonged to his father

192 but when the mother has died all the uterine brothers and the uterine sisters shall equally divide the mothers estate

193 even to the daughters of those daughters something should be given as is seemly out of the estate of their maternal grandmother on the score of affection

194 what was given before the nuptial fire what was given on the bridal procession what was given in token of love and what was received from her brother mother or father that is called the sixfold property of a woman

195 such property as well as a gift subsequent and what was given to her by her affectionate husband shall go to her offspring even if she dies in the lifetime of her husband

196 it is ordained that the property of a woman married according to the brahma the daiva the arsha the gandharva or the pragapatya rite shall belong to her husband alone if she dies without issue

197 but it is prescribed that the property which may have been given to a wife on an asura marriage or one of the other blamable marriages shall go to her mother and to her father if she dies without issue

198 whatever property may have been given by her father to a wife who has cowives of different castes that the daughter of the brahmani wife shall take or that daughters issue

199 women should never make a hoard from the property of their families which is common to many nor from their own husbands particular property without permission

200 the ornaments which may have been worn by women during their husbands lifetime his heirs shall not divide those who divide them become outcasts

201 eunuchs and outcasts persons born blind or deaf the insane idiots and the dumb as well as those deficient in any organ of action or sensation receive no share

202 but it is just that a man who knows the law should give even to all of them food and raiment without stint according to his ability he who gives it not will become all outcast

203 if the eunuch and the rest should somehow or other desire to take wives the offspring of such among them as have children is worthy of a share

204 whatever property the eldest son acquires by his own exertion after the fathers death a share of that shall belong to his younger brothers provided they have made a due progress in learning

205 but if all of them being unlearned acquire property by their labour the division of that shall be equal as it is not property acquired by the father that is a settled rule

206 property acquired by learning belongs solely to him to whom it was given likewise the gift of a friend a present received on marriage or with the honeymixture

207 but if one of the brothers being able to maintain himself by his own occupation does not desire a share of the family property he may be made separate by the others receiving a trifle out of his share to live upon

208 what one brother may acquire by his labour without using the patrimony that acquisition made solely by his own effort he shall not share unless by his own will with his brothers

209 but if a father recovers lost ancestral property he shall not divide it unless by his own will with his sons for it is selfacquired property

210 if brothers once divided and living again together as coparceners make a second partition the division shall in that case be equal in such a case there is no right of primogeniture

211 if the eldest or the youngest brother is deprived of his share or if either of them dies his share is not lost to his immediate heirs

212 his uterine brothers having assembled together shall equally divide it and those brothers who were reunited with him and the uterine sisters

213 an eldest brother who through avarice may defraud the younger ones shall no longer hold the position of the eldest shall not receive an eldest sons additional share and shall be punished by the king

214 all brothers who habitually commit forbidden acts are unworthy of a share of the property and the eldest shall not make anything his separate property without giving an equivalent to his younger brothers

215 if undivided brethren living with their father together make an exertion for gain the father shall on no account give to them unequal shares on a division of the estate

216 but a son born after partition shall alone take the property of his father or if any of the other sons be reunited with the father he shall share with them

217 a mother shall obtain the inheritance of a son who dies without leaving issue and if the mother be dead the paternal grandmother shall take the estate

218 and if after all the debts and assets have been duly distributed according to the rule any property be afterwards discovered one must divide it equally

219 a dress a vehicle ornaments cooked food water and female slaves property destined for pious uses or sacrifices and a pastureground they declare to be indivisible

220 the division of the property and the rules for allotting shares to the several sons those begotten on a wife and the rest in due order have been thus declared to you hear now the laws concerning gambling

221 gambling and betting let the king exclude from his realm those two vices cause the destruction of the kingdoms of princes

222 gambling and betting amount to open theft the king shall always exert himself in suppressing both of them

223 when inanimate things are used for staking money on them that is called among men gambling dyuta when animate beings are used for the same purpose one must know that to be betting samahvaya

224 let the king corporally punish all those persons who either gamble and bet or afford an opportunity for it likewise sudras who assume the distinctive marks of twiceborn men

225 gamblers dancers and singers cruel men men belonging to an heretical sect those following forbidden occupations and sellers of spirituous liquor let him instantly banish from his town

226 if such persons who are secret thieves dwell in the realm of a king they constantly harass his good subjects by their forbidden practices

227 in a former kalpa this vice of gambling has been seen to cause great enmity a wise man therefore should not practise it even for amusement

228 on every man who addicts himself to that vice either secretly or openly the king may inflict punishment according to his discretion

229 but a kshatriya a vaisya and a sudra who are unable to pay a fine shall discharge the debt by labour a brahmana shall pay it by installments

230 on women infants men of disordered mind the poor and the sick the king shall inflict punishment with a whip a cane or a rope and the like

231 but those appointed to administer public affairs who baked by the fire of wealth mar the business of suitors the king shall deprive of their property

232 forgers of royal edicts those who corrupt his ministers those who slay women infants or brahmanas and those who serve his enemies the king shall put to death

233 whenever any legal transaction has been completed or a punishment been inflicted according to the law he shall sanction it and not annul it

234 whatever matter his ministers or the judge may settle improperly that the king himself shall re settle and fine them one thousand panas

235 the slayer of a brahmana a twiceborn man who drinks the spirituous liquor called sura he who steals the gold of a brahmana and he who violates a gurus bed must each and all be considered as men who committed mortal sins mahapataka

236 on those four even if they do not perform a penance let him inflict corporal punishment and fines in accordance with the law

237 for violating a gurus bed the mark of a female part shall be impressed on the forehead with a hot iron for drinking the spirituous liquor called sura the sign of a tavern for stealing the gold of a brahmana a dogs foot for murdering a brahmana a headless corpse

238 excluded from all fellowship at meals excluded from all sacrifices excluded from instruction and from matrimonial alliances abject and excluded from all religious duties let them wander over this earth

239 such persons who have been branded with indelible marks must be cast off by their paternal and maternal relations and receive neither compassion nor a salutation that is the teaching of manu

240 but men of all castes who perform the prescribed penances must not be branded on the forehead by the king but shall be made to pay the highest amercement

241 for such offences the middlemost amercement shall be inflicted on a brahmana or he may be banished from the realm keeping his money and his chattels

242 but men of other castes who have unintentionally committed such crimes ought to be deprived of their whole property if they committed them intentionally they shall be banished

243 a virtuous king must not take for himself the property of a man guilty of mortal sin but if he takes it out of greed he is tainted by that guilt of the offender

244 having thrown such a fine into the water let him offer it to varuna or let him bestow it on a learned and virtuous brahmana

245 varuna is the lord of punishment for he holds the sceptre even over kings a brahmana who has learnt the whole veda is the lord of the whole world

246 in that country where the king avoids taking the property of mortal sinners men are born in due time and are longlived

247 and the crops of the husbandmen spring up each as it was sown and the children die not and no misshaped offspring is born

248 but the king shall inflict on a baseborn sudra who intentionally gives pain to brahmanas various kinds of corporal punishment which cause terror

249 when a king punishes an innocent man his guilt is considered as great as when he sets free a guilty man but he acquires merit when he punishes justly

250 thus the manner of deciding suits falling under the eighteen titles between two litigant parties has been declared at length

251 a king who thus duly fulfils his duties in accordance with justice may seek to gain countries which he has not yet gained and shall duly protect them when he has gained them

252 having duly settled his country and having built forts in accordance with the institutes he shall use his utmost exertions to remove those men who are nocuous like thorns

253 by protecting those who live as becomes aryans and by removing the thorns kings solely intent on guarding their subjects reach heaven

254 the realm of that king who takes his share in kind though he does not punish thieves will be disturbed and he will lose heaven

255 but if his kingdom be secure protected by the strength of his arm it will constantly flourish like a well watered tree

256 let the king who sees everything through his spies discover the two sorts of thieves who deprive others of their property both those who show themselves openly and those who lie concealed

257 among them the open rogues are those who subsist by cheating in the sale of various marketable commodities but the concealed rogues are burglars robbers in forests and so forth

258 those who take bribes cheats and rogues gamblers those who live by teaching the performance of auspicious ceremonies sanctimonious hypocrites and fortunetellers

259 officials of high rank and physicians who act improperly men living by showing their proficiency in arts and clever harlots

260 these and the like who show themselves openly as well as others who walk in disguise such as nonaryans who wear the marks of aryans he should know to be thorns in the side of his people

261 having detected them by means of trustworthy persons who disguising themselves pretend to follow the same occupations and by means of spies wearing various disguises he must cause them to be instigated to commit offences and bring them into his power

262 then having caused the crimes which they committed by their several actions to be proclaimed in accordance with the facts the king shall duly punish them according to their strength and their crimes

263 for the wickedness of evilminded thieves who secretly prowl over this earth cannot be restrained except by punishment

264 assemblyhouses houses where water is distributed or cakes are sold brothels taverns and victuallers shops crossroads wellknown trees festive assemblies and playhouses and concertrooms

265 old gardens forests the shops of artisans empty dwellings natural and artificial groves

266 these and the like places the king shall cause to be guarded by companies of soldiers both stationary and patrolling and by spies in order to keep away thieves

267 by the means of clever reformed thieves who associate with such rogues follow them and know their various machinations he must detect and destroy them

268 under the pretext of offering them various dainties of introducing them to brahmanas and on the pretence of showing them feats of strength the spies must make them meet the officers of justice

269 those among them who do not come and those who suspect the old thieves employed by the king the king shall attack by force and slay together with their friends blood relations and connexions

270 a just king shall not cause a thief to be put to death unless taken with the stolen goods in his possession him who is taken with the stolen goods and the implements of burglary he may without hesitation cause to be slain

271 all those also who in villages give food to thieves or grant them room for concealing their implements he shall cause to be put to death

272 those who are appointed to guard provinces and his vassals who have been ordered to help he shall speedily punish like thieves if they remain inactive in attacks by robbers

273 moreover if a man who subsists by the fulfilment of the law departs from the established rule of the law the king shall severely punish him by a fine because he violated his duty

274 those who do not give assistance according to their ability when a village is being plundered a dyke is being destroyed or a highway robbery committed shall be banished with their goods and chattels

275 on those who rob the kings treasury and those who persevere in opposing his commands he shall inflict various kinds of capital punishment likewise on those who conspire with his enemies

276 but the king shall cut off the hands of those robbers who breaking into houses commit thefts at night and cause them to be impaled on a pointed stake

277 on the first conviction let him cause two fingers of a cutpurse to be amputated on the second one hand and one foot on the third he shall suffer death

278 those who give to thieves fire food arms or shelter and receivers of stolen goods the ruler shall punish like thieves

279 him who breaks the dam of a tank he shall slay by drowning him in water or by some other mode of capital punishment or the offender may repair the damage but shall be made to pay the highest amercement

280 those who break into a royal storehouse an armoury or a temple and those who steal elephants horses or chariots he shall slay without hesitation

281 but he who shall take away the water of a tank made in ancient times or shall cut off the supply of water must be made to pay the first or lowest amercement

282 but he who except in a case of extreme necessity drops filth on the kings highroad shall pay two karshapanas and immediately remove that filth

283 but a person in urgent necessity an aged man a pregnant woman or a child shall be reprimanded and clean the place that is a settled rule

284 all physicians who treat their patients wrongly shall pay a fine in the case of animals the first or lowest in the case of human beings the middlemost amercement

285 he who destroys a bridge the flag of a temple or royal palace a pole or images shall repair the whole damage and pay five hundred panas

286 for adulterating unadulterated commodities and for breaking gems or for improperly boring them the fine is the first or lowest amercement

287 but that man who behaves dishonestly to honest customers or cheats in his prices shall be fined in the first or in the middlemost amercement

288 let him place all prisons near a highroad where the suffering and disfigured offenders can be seen

289 him who destroys the wall of a town or fills up the ditch round a town or breaks a town gate he shall instantly banish

290 for all incantations intended to destroy life for magic rites with roots practised by persons not related to him against whom they are directed and for various kinds of sorcery a fine of two hundred panas shall be inflicted

291 he who sells for seedcorn that which is not seedcorn he who takes up seed already sown and he who destroys a boundary mark shall be punished by mutilation

292 but the king shall cause a goldsmith who behaves dishonestly the most nocuous of all the thorns to be cut to pieces with razors

293 for the theft of agricultural implements of arms and of medicines let the king award punishment taking into account the time of the offence and the use of the object

294 the king and his minister his capital his realm his treasury his army and his ally are the seven constituent parts of a kingdom hence a kingdom is said to have seven limbs anga

295 but let him know that among these seven constituent parts of a kingdom which have been enumerated in due order each earlier named is more important and its destruction the greater calamity

296 yet in a kingdom containing seven constituent parts which is upheld like the triple staff of an ascetic there is no single part more important than the others by reason of the importance of the qualities of each for the others

297 for each part is particularly qualified for the accomplishment of certain objects and thus each is declared to be the most important for that particular purpose which is effected by its means

298 by spies by a pretended display of energy and by carrying out various undertakings let the king constantly ascertain his own and his enemys strength

299 moreover all calamities and vices afterwards when he has fully considered their relative importance let him begin his operations

300 though he be ever so much tired by repeated failures let him begin his operations again and again for fortune greatly favours the man who strenuously exerts himself in his undertakings

301 the various ways in which a king behaves resemble the krita treta dvapara and kali ages hence the king is identified with the ages of the world

302 sleeping he represents the kali or iron age waking the dvapara or brazen age ready to act the treta or silver age but moving actively the krita or golden age

303 let the king emulate the energetic action of indra of the sun of the wind of yama of varuna of the moon of the fire and of the earth

304 as indra sends copious rain during the four months of the rainy season even so let the king taking upon himself the office of indra shower benefits on his kingdom

305 as the sun during eight months imperceptibly draws up the water with his rays even so let him gradually draw his taxes from his kingdom for that is the office in which he resembles the sun

306 as the wind moves everywhere entering in the shape of the vital air all created beings even so let him penetrate everywhere through his spies that is the office in which he resembles the wind

307 as yama at the appointed time subjects to his rule both friends and foes even so all subjects must be controlled by the king that is the office in which he resembles yama

308 as a sinner is seen bound with ropes by varuna even so let him punish the wicked that is his office in which he resembles varuna

309 he is a king taking upon himself the office of the moon whose appearance his subjects greet with as great joy as men feel on seeing the full moon

310 if he is ardent in wrath against criminals and endowed with brilliant energy and destroys wicked vassals then his character is said to resemble that of fire

311 as the earth supports all created beings equally thus a king who supports all his subjects takes upon himself the office of the earth

312 employing these and other means the king shall ever untired restrain thieves both in his own dominions and in those of others

313 let him not though fallen into the deepest distress provoke brahmanas to anger for they when angered could instantly destroy him together with his army and his vehicles

314 who could escape destruction when he provokes to anger those men by whom the fire was made to consume all things by whom the water of the ocean was made undrinkable and by whom the moon was made to wane and to increase again

315 who could prosper while he injures those men who provoked to anger could create other worlds and other guardians of the world and deprive the gods of their divine station

316 what man desirous of life would injure them to whose support the three worlds and the gods ever owe their existence and whose wealth is the veda

317 a brahmana be he ignorant or learned is a great divinity just as the fire whether carried forth for the performance of a burntoblation or not carried forth is a great divinity

318 the brilliant fire is not contaminated even in burialplaces and when presented with oblations of butter at sacrifices it again increases mightily

319 thus though brahmanas employ themselves in all sorts of mean occupations they must be honoured in every way for each of them is a very great deity

320 when the kshatriyas become in any way overbearing towards the brahmanas the brahmanas themselves shall duly restrain them for the kshatriyas sprang from the brahmanas

321 fire sprang from water kshatriyas from brahmanas iron from stone the allpenetrating force of those three has no effect on that whence they were produced

322 kshatriyas prosper not without brahmanas brahmanas prosper not without kshatriyas brahmanas and kshatriyas being closely united prosper in this world and in the next

323 but a king who feels his end drawing nigh shall bestow all his wealth accumulated from fines on brahmanas make over his kingdom to his son and then seek death in battle

324 thus conducting himself and ever intent on discharging his royal duties a king shall order all his servants to work for the good of his people

325 thus the eternal law concerning the duties of a king has been fully declared know that the following rules apply in due order to the duties of vaisyas and sudras

326 after a vaisya has received the sacraments and has taken a wife he shall be always attentive to the business whereby he may subsist and to that of tending cattle

327 for when the lord of creatures pragapati created cattle he made them over to the vaisya to the brahmana and to the king he entrusted all created beings

328 a vaisya must never conceive this wish i will not keep cattle and if a vaisya is willing to keep them they must never be kept by men of other castes

329 a vaisya must know the respective value of gems of pearls of coral of metals of cloth made of thread of perfumes and of condiments

330 he must be acquainted with the manner of sowing of seeds and of the good and bad qualities of fields and he must perfectly know all measures and weights

331 moreover the excellence and defects of commodities the advantages and disadvantages of different countries the probable profit and loss on merchandise and the means of properly rearing cattle

332 he must be acquainted with the proper wages of servants with the various languages of men with the manner of keeping goods and the rules of purchase and sale

333 let him exert himself to the utmost in order to increase his property in a righteous manner and let him zealously give food to all created beings

334 but to serve brahmanas who are learned in the vedas householders and famous for virtue is the highest duty of a sudra which leads to beatitude

335 a sudra who is pure the servant of his betters gentle in his speech and free from pride and always seeks a refuge with brahmanas attains in his next life a higher caste

336 the excellent law for the conduct of the four castes varna when they are not in distress has been thus promulgated now hear in order their several duties in times of distress



chapter x

1 let the three twiceborn castes varna discharging their prescribed duties study the veda but among them the brahmana alone shall teach it not the other two that is an established rule

2 the brahmana must know the means of subsistence prescribed by law for all instruct the others and himself live according to the law

3 on account of his preeminence on account of the superiority of his origin on account of his observance of particular restrictive rules and on account of his particular sanctification the brahmana is the lord of all castes varna

4 brahmana the kshatriya and the vaisya castes varna are the twiceborn ones but the fourth the sudra has one birth only there is no fifth caste

5 in all castes varna those children only which are begotten in the direct order on wedded wives equal in caste and married as virgins are to be considered as belonging to the same caste as their fathers

6 sons begotten by twiceborn man on wives of the next lower castes they declare to be similar to their fathers but blamed on account of the fault inherent in their mothers

7 such is the eternal law concerning children born of wives one degree lower than their husbands know that the following rule is applicable to those born of women two or three degrees lower

8 from a brahmana a with the daughter of a vaisya is born a son called an ambashtha with the daughter of a sudra a nishada who is also called parasava

9 from a kshatriya and the daughter of a sudra springs a being called ugra resembling both a kshatriya and a sudra ferocious in his manners and delighting in cruelty

10 children of a brahmana by women of the three lower castes of a kshatriya by wives of the two lower castes and of a vaisya by a wife of the one caste below him are all six called baseborn apasada

11 from a kshatriya by the daughter of a brahmana is born a son called according to his caste gati a suta from a vaisya by females of the royal and the brahmana castes spring a magadha and a vaideha

12 from a sudra are born an ayogava a kshattri and a kandala the lowest of men by vaisya kshatriya and brahmana females sons who owe their origin to a confusion of the castes

13 as an ambashtha and an ugra begotten in the direct order on women one degree lower than their husbands are declared to be even so are a kshattri and a vaidehaka though they were born in the inverse order of the castes from mothers one degree higher than the fathers

14 those sons of the twiceborn begotten on wives of the next lower castes who have been enumerated in due order they call by the name anantaras belonging to the next lower caste on account of the blemish inherent in their mothers

15 a brahmana begets on the daughter of an ugra an avrita on the daughter of an ambashtha an abhira but on a female of the ayogava caste a dhigvana

16 from a sudra spring in the inverse order by females of the higher castes three baseborn sons apasada an ayogava a kshattri and a kandala the lowest of men

17 from a vaisya are born in the inverse order of the castes a magadha and a vaideha but from a kshatriya a suta only these are three other baseborn ones apasada

18 the son of a nishada by a sudra female becomes a pukkasa by caste gati but the son of a sudra by a nishada female is declared to be a kukkutaka

19 moreover the son of by kshattri by an ugra female is called a svapaka but one begotten by a vaidehaka on an ambashtha female is named a vena

20 those sons whom the twiceborn beget on wives of equal caste but who not fulfilling their sacred duties are excluded from the savitri one must designate by the appellation vratyas

21 but from a vratya of the brahmana caste spring the wicked bhriggakantaka the avantya the vatadhana the pushpadha and the saikha

22 from a vratya of the kshatriya caste the ghalla the malla the likkhivi the nata the karana the khasa and the dravida

23 from a vratya of the vaisya caste are born a sudhanvan an akarya a karusha a viganman a maitra and a satvata

24 by adultery committed by persons of different castes by marriages with women who ought not to be married and by the neglect of the duties and occupations prescribed to each are produced sons who owe their origin to a confusion the castes

25 i will now fully enumerate those sons of mixed origin who are born of anulomas and of pratilomas and thus are mutually connected

26 the suta the vaidehaka the kandala that lowest of mortals the magadha he of the kshattri caste gati and the ayogava

27 these six pratilomas beget similar races varna on women of their own caste they also produce the like with females of their mothers caste gati and with females of higher ones

28 as a brahmana begets on females of two out of the three twiceborn castes a son similar to himself but inferior on account of the lower degree of the mother and one equal to himself on a female of his own race even so is the order in the case of the excluded races vahya

29 those six mentioned above also beget the one on the females of the other a great many kinds of despicable sons even more sinful than their fathers and excluded from the aryan community vahya

30 just as a sudra begets on a brahmana female a being excluded from the aryan community even so a person himself excluded pro creates with females of the four castes varna sons more worthy of being excluded than he himself

31 but men excluded by the aryans vahya who approach females of higher rank beget races varna still more worthy to be excluded low men hina still lower races even fifteen in number

32 a dasyu begets on an ayogava woman a sairandhra who is skilled in adorning and attending his master who though not a slave lives like a slave or subsists by snaring animals

33 a vaideha produces with the same a sweetvoiced maitreyaka who ringing a bell at the appearance of dawn continually praises great men

34 a nishada begets on the same a margava or dasa who subsists by working as a boatman and whom the inhabitants of aryavarta call a kaivarta

35 those three baseborn ones are severally begot on ayogava women who wear the clothes of the dead are wicked and eat reprehensible food

36 from a nishada springs by a woman of the vaideha caste a karavara who works in leather and from a vaidehaka by women of the karavara and nishada castes an andhra and a meda who dwell outside the village

37 from a kandala by a vaideha woman is born a pandusopaka who deals in cane from a nishada by the same an ahindika

38 but from a kandala by a pukkasa woman is born the sinful sopaka who lives by the occupations of his sire and is ever despised by good men

39 a nishada woman bears to a kandala a son called antyavasayin employed in burialgrounds and despised even by those excluded from the aryan community

40 these races which originate in a confusion of the castes and have been described according to their fathers and mothers may be known by their occupations whether they conceal or openly show themselves

41 six sons begotten by aryans on women of equal and the next lower castes anantara have the duties of twiceborn men but all those born in consequence of a violation of the law are as regards their duties equal to sudras

42 by the power of austerities and of the seed from which they sprang these races obtain here among men more exalted or lower rank in successive births

43 but in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites and of their not consulting brahmanas the following tribes of kshatriyas have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of sudras

44 viz the paundrakas the kodas the dravidas the kambogas the yavanas the sakas the paradas the pahlavas the kinas the kiratas and the daradas

45 all those tribes in this world which are excluded from the community of those born from the mouth the arms the thighs and the feet of brahman are called dasyus whether they speak the language of the mlekkhas barbarians or that of the aryans

46 those who have been mentioned as the baseborn offspring apasada of aryans or as produced in consequence of a violation of the law apadhvamsaga shall subsist by occupations reprehended by the twiceborn

47 to sutas belongs the management of horses and of chariots to ambashthas the art of healing to vaidehakas the service of women to magadhas trade

48 killing fish to nishadas carpenters work to the ayogava to medas andhras kunkus and madgus the slaughter of wild animals

49 to kshattris ugras and pukkasas catching and killing animals living in holes to dhigvanas working in leather to venas playing drums

50 near wellknown trees and burialgrounds on mountains and in groves let these tribes dwell known by certain marks and subsisting by their peculiar occupations

51 but the dwellings of kandalas and svapakas shall be outside the village they must be made apapatras and their wealth shall be dogs and donkeys

52 their dress shall be the garments of the dead they shall eat their food from broken dishes black iron shall be their ornaments and they must always wander from place to place

53 a man who fulfils a religious duty shall not seek intercourse with them their transactions shall be among themselves and their marriages with their equals

54 their food shall be given to them by others than an aryan giver in a broken dish at night they shall not walk about in villages and in towns

55 by day they may go about for the purpose of their work distinguished by marks at the kings command and they shall carry out the corpses of persons who have no relatives that is a settled rule

56 by the kings order they shall always execute the criminals in accordance with the law and they shall take for themselves the clothes the beds and the ornaments of such criminals

57 a man of impure origin who belongs not to any caste varna but whose character is not known who though not an aryan has the appearance of an aryan one may discover by his acts

58 behaviour unworthy of an aryan harshness cruelty and habitual neglect of the prescribed duties betray in this world a man of impure origin

59 a baseborn man either resembles in character his father or his mother or both he can never conceal his real nature

60 even if a man born in a great family sprang from criminal intercourse he will certainly possess the faults of his father be they small or great

61 but that kingdom in which such bastards sullying the purity of the castes are born perishes quickly together with its inhabitants

62 dying without the expectation of a reward for the sake of brahmanas and of cows or in the defence of women and children secures beatitude to those excluded from the aryan community vahya

63 abstention from injuring creatures veracity abstention from unlawfully appropriating the goods of others purity and control of the organs manu has declared to be the summary of the law for the four castes

64 if a female of the caste sprung from a brahmana and a sudra female bear children to one of the highest caste the inferior tribe attains the highest caste within the seventh generation

65 thus a sudra attains the rank of a brahmana and in a similar manner a brahmana sinks to the level of a sudra but know that it is the same with the offspring of a kshatriya or of a vaisya

66 if a doubt should arise with whom the preeminence is whether with him whom an aryan by chance begot on a nonaryan female or with the son of a brahmana woman by a nonaryan

67 the decision is as follows he who was begotten by an aryan on a nonaryan female may become like to an aryan by his virtues he whom an aryan mother bore to a nonaryan father is and remains unlike to an aryan

68 the law prescribes that neither of the two shall receive the sacraments the first being excluded on account of the lowness of his origin the second because the union of his parents was against the order of the castes

69 as good seed springing up in good soil turns out perfectly well even so the son of an aryan by an aryan woman is worthy of all the sacraments

70 some sages declare the seed to be more important and others the field again others assert that the seed and the field are equally important but the legal decision on this point is as follows

71 seed sown on barren ground perishes in it a fertile field also in which no good seed is sown will remain barren

72 as through the power of the seed sons born of animals became sages who are honoured and praised hence the seed is declared to be more important

73 having considered the case of a nonaryan who acts like an aryan and that of an aryan who acts like a nonaryan the creator declared those two are neither equal nor unequal

74 brahmanas who are intent on the means of gaining union with brahman and firm in discharging their duties shall live by duly performing the following six acts which are enumerated in their proper order

75 teaching studying sacrificing for himself sacrificing for others making gifts and receiving them are the six acts prescribed for a brahmana

76 but among the six acts ordained for him three are his means of subsistence viz sacrificing for others teaching and accepting gifts from pure men

77 passing from the brahmana to the kshatriya three acts incumbent on the former are forbidden viz teaching sacrificing for others and thirdly the acceptance of gifts

78 the same are likewise forbidden to a vaisya that is a settled rule for manu the lord of creatures pragapati has not prescribed them for men of those two castes

79 to carry arms for striking and for throwing is prescribed for kshatriyas as a means of subsistence to trade to rear cattle and agriculture for vaisyas but their duties are liberality the study of the veda and the performance of sacrifices

80 among the several occupations the most commendable are teaching the veda for a brahmana protecting the people for a kshatriya and trade for a vaisya

81 but a brahmana unable to subsist by his peculiar occupations just mentioned may live according to the law applicable to kshatriyas for the latter is next to him in rank

82 if it be asked how shall it be if he cannot maintain himself by either of these occupations the answer is he may adopt a vaisyas mode of life employing himself in agriculture and rearing cattle

83 but a brahmana or a kshatriya living by a vaisyas mode of subsistence shall carefully avoid the pursuit of agriculture which causes injury to many beings and depends on others

84 some declare that agriculture is something excellent but that means of subsistence is blamed by the virtuous for the wooden implement with iron point injuries the earth and the beings living in the earth

85 but he who through a want of means of subsistence gives up the strictness with respect to his duties may sell in order to increase his wealth the commodities sold by vaisyas making however the following exceptions

86 he must avoid selling condiments of all sorts cooked food and sesamum stones salt cattle and human beings

87 all dyed cloth as well as cloth made of hemp or flax or wool even though they be not dyed fruit roots and medical herbs

88 water weapons poison meat soma and perfumes of all kinds fresh milk honey sour milk clarified butter oil wax sugar kusagrass

89 all beasts of the forest animals with fangs or tusks birds spirituous liquor indigo lac and all onehoofed beasts

90 but he who subsists by agriculture may at pleasure sell unmixed sesamum grains for sacred purposes provided he himself has grown them and has not kept them long

91 if he applies sesamum to any other purpose but food anointing and charitable gifts he will be born again as a worm and together with his ancestors be plunged into the ordure of dogs

92 by selling flesh salt and lac a brahmana at once becomes an outcast by selling milk he becomes equal to a sudra in three days

93 but by willingly selling in this world other forbidden commodities a brahmana assumes after seven nights the character of a vaisya

94 condiments may be bartered for condiments but by no means salt for other condiments cooked food may be exchanged for other kinds of cooked food and sesamum seeds for grain in equal quantities

95 a kshatriya who has fallen into distress may subsist by all these means but he must never arrogantly adopt the mode of life prescribed for his betters

96 a man of low caste who through covetousness lives by the occupations of a higher one the king shall deprive of his property and banish

97 it is better to discharge ones own appointed duty incompletely than to perform completely that of another for he who lives according to the law of another caste is instantly excluded from his own

98 a vaisya who is unable to subsist by his own duties may even maintain himself by a sudras mode of life avoiding however acts forbidden to him and he should give it up when he is able to do so

99 but a sudra being unable to find service with the twiceborn and threatened with the loss of his sons and wife through hunger may maintain himself by handicrafts

100 let him follow those mechanical occupations and those various practical arts by following which the twiceborn are best served

101 a brahmana who is distressed through a want of means of subsistence and pines with hunger but unwilling to adopt a vaisyas mode of life and resolved to follow his own prescribed path may act in the following manner

102 a brahmana who has fallen into distress may accept gifts from anybody for according to the law it is not possible to assert that anything pure can be sullied

103 by teaching by sacrificing for and by accepting gifts from despicable men brahmanas in distress commit not sin for they are as pure as fire and water

104 he who when in danger of losing his life accepts food from any person whatsoever is no more tainted by sin than the sky by mud

105 agigarta who suffered hunger approached in order to slay his own son and was not tainted by sin since he only sought a remedy against famishing

106 vamadeva who well knew right and wrong did not sully himself when tormented by hunger he desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life

107 bharadvaga a performer of great austerities accepted many cows from the carpenter bribu when he was starving together with his sons in a lonely forest

108 visvamitra who well knew what is right or wrong approached when he was tormented by hunger to eat the haunch of a dog receiving it the hands of a kandala

109 on comparing the acceptance of gifts from low men sacrificing for them and teaching them the acceptance of gifts is the meanest of those acts and most reprehensible for a brahmana on account of its results in the next life

110 for assisting in sacrifices and teaching are two acts always performed for men who have received the sacraments but the acceptance of gifts takes place even in case the giver is a sudra of the lowest class

111 the guilt incurred by offering sacrifices for teaching unworthy men is removed by muttering sacred texts and by burnt offerings but that incurred by accepting gifts from them by throwing the gifts away and by austerities

112 a brahmana who is unable to maintain himself should rather glean ears or grains from the field of any man gleaning ears is better than accepting gifts picking up single grains is declared to be still more laudable

113 if brahmanas who are snatakas are pining with hunger or in want of utensils made of common metals or of other property they may ask the king for them if he is not disposed to be liberal he must be left

114 the acceptance on an untilled field is less blamable than that of a tilled one with respect to cows goats sheep gold grain and cooked food the acceptance of each earliernamed article is less blamable than of the following ones

115 there are seven lawful modes of acquiring property viz inheritance finding or friendly donation purchase conquest lending at interest the performance of work and the acceptance of gifts from virtuous men

116 learning mechanical arts work for wages service rearing cattle traffic agriculture contentment with little alms and receiving interest on money are the ten modes of subsistence permitted to all men in times of distress

117 neither a brahmana nor a kshatriya must lend money at interest but at his pleasure either of them may in times of distress when he requires money for sacred purposes lend to a very sinful man at a small interest

118 a kshatriya king who in times of distress takes even the fourth part of the crops is free from guilt if he protects his subjects to the best of his ability

119 his peculiar duty is conquest and he must not turn back in danger having protected the vaisyas by his weapons he may cause the legal tax to be collected

120 viz from vaisyas oneeighth as the tax on grain onetwentieth on the profits on gold and cattle which amount at least to one karshapana sudras artisans and mechanics shall benefit the king by doing work for him

121 if a sudra unable to subsist by serving brahmanas seeks a livelihood he may serve kshatriyas or he may also seek to maintain himself by attending on a wealthy vaisya

122 but let a sudra serve brahmanas either for the sake of heaven or with a view to both this life and the next for he who is called the servant of a brahmana thereby gains all his ends

123 the service of brahmanas alone is declared to be an excellent occupation for a sudra for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear him no fruit

124 they must allot to him out of their own family property a suitable maintenance after considering his ability his industry and the number of those whom he is bound to support

125 the remnants of their food must be given to him as well as their old clothes the refuse of their grain and their old household furniture

126 a sudra cannot commit an offence causing loss of caste pataka and he is not worthy to receive the sacraments he has no right to fulfil the sacred law of the aryans yet there is no prohibition against his fulfilling certain portions of the law

127 sudras who are desirous to gain merit and know their duty commit no sin but gain praise if they imitate the practice of virtuous men without reciting sacred texts

128 the more a sudra keeping himself free from envy imitates the behaviour of the virtuous the more he gains without being censured exaltation in this world and the next

129 no collection of wealth must be made by a sudra even though he be able to do it for a sudra who has acquired wealth gives pain to brahmanas

130 the duties of the four castes varna in times of distress have thus been declared and if they perform them well they will reach the most blessed state

131 thus all the legal rules for the four castes have been proclaimed i next will promulgate the auspicious rules for penances



chapter xi

1 him who wishes to marry for the sake of having offspring him who wishes to perform a sacrifice a traveller him who has given away all his property him who begs for the sake of his teacher his father or his mother a student of the veda and a sick man

2 these nine brahmanas one should consider as snatakas begging in order to fulfil the sacred law to such poor men gifts must be given in proportion to their learning

3 to these most excellent among the twiceborn food and presents of money must be given it is declared that food must be given to others outside the sacrificial enclosure

4 but a king shall bestow as is proper jewels of all sorts and presents for the sake of sacrifices on brahmanas learned in the vedas

5 if a man who has a wife weds a second wife having begged money to defray the marriage expenses he obtains no advantage but sensual enjoyment but the issue of his second marriage belongs to the giver of the money

6 one should give according to ones ability wealth to brahmanas learned in the veda and living alone thus one obtains after death heavenly bliss

7 he who may possess a supply of food sufficient to maintain those dependant on him during three years or more than that is worthy to drink the somajuice

8 but a twiceborn man who though possessing less than that amount of property nevertheless drinks the somajuice does not derive any benefit from that act though he may have formerly drunk the somajuice

9 if an opulent man is liberal towards strangers while his family lives in distress that counterfeit virtue will first make him taste the sweets of fame but afterwards make him swallow the poison of punishment in hell

10 if a man does anything for the sake of his happiness in another world to the detriment of those whom he is bound to maintain that produces evil results for him both while he lives and when he is dead

11 if a sacrifice offered by any twiceborn sacrificer and especially by a brahmana must remain incomplete through the want of one requisite while a righteous king rules

12 that article required for the completion of the sacrifice may be taken forcibly from the house of any vaisya who possesses a large number of cattle but neither performs the minor sacrifices nor drinks the somajuice

13 or the sacrificer may take at his pleasure two or three articles required for a sacrifice from the house of a sudra for a sudra has no business with sacrifices

14 if a man possessing one hundred cows kindles not the sacred fire or one possessing a thousand cows drinks not the somajuice a sacrificer may unhesitatingly take what he requires from the houses of those two even though they be brahmanas or kshatriyas

15 or he may take it by force or fraud from one who always takes and never gives and who refuses to give it thus the fame of the taker will spread and his merit increase

16 likewise he who has not eaten at the time of six meals may take at the time of the seventh meal food from a man who neglects his sacred duties without however making a provision for the morrow

17 either from the threshingfloor or from a field or out of the house or wherever he finds it but if the owner asks him he must confess to him that deed and its cause

18 on such occasions a kshatriya must never take the property of a virtuous brahmana but he who is starving may appropriate the possessions of a dasyu or of one who neglects his sacred duties

19 he who takes property from the wicked and bestows it on the virtuous transforms himself into a boat and carries both over the sea of misfortune

20 the property of those who zealously offer sacrifices the wise call the property of the gods but the wealth of those who perform no sacrifices is called the property of the asuras

21 on him who for the reasons stated appropriates anothers possessions a righteous king shall not inflict punishment for in that case a brahmana pines with hunger through the kshatriyas want of care

22 having ascertained the number of those dependent on such a man and having fully considered his learning and his conduct the king shall allow him out of his own property a maintenance whereon he may live according to the law

23 and after allotting to him a maintenance the king must protect him in every way for he obtains from such a man whom he protects the part of his spiritual merit

24 a brahmana shall never beg from a sudra property for a sacrifice for a sacrificer having begged it from such a man after death is born again as a kandala

25 a brahmana who having begged any property for a sacrifice does not use the whole for that purpose becomes for a hundred years a vulture of the kind called bhasa or a crow

26 that sinful man who through covetousness seizes the property of the gods or the property of brahmanas feeds in another world on the leavings of vultures

27 in case the prescribed animal and somasacrifices cannot be performed let him always offer at the change of the year a vaisvanari ishti as a penance for the omission

28 but a twiceborn who without being in distress performs his duties according to the law for times of distress obtains no reward for them in the next world that is the opinion of the sages

29 by the visvedevas by the sadhyas and by the great sages of the brahmana caste who were afraid of perishing in times of distress a substitute was made for the principal rule

30 that evilminded man who being able to fulfil the original law lives according to the secondary rule reaps no reward for that after death

31 a brahmana who knows the law need not bring any offence to the notice of the king by his own power alone be can punish those men who injure him

32 his own power is greater than the power of the king the brahmana therefore may punish his foes by his own power alone

33 let him use without hesitation the sacred texts revealed by atharvan and by angiras speech indeed is the weapon of the brahmana with that he may slay his enemies

34 a kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him by the strength of his arms a vaisya and a sudra by their wealth the chief of the twiceborn by muttered prayers and burntoblations

35 the brahmana is declared to be the creator of the world the punisher the teacher and hence a benefactor of all created beings to him let no man say anything unpropitious nor use any harsh words

36 neither a girl nor a married young woman nor a man of little learning nor a fool nor a man in great suffering nor one uninitiated shall offer an agnihotra

37 for such persons offering a burntoblation sink into hell as well as he to whom that agnihotra belongs hence the person who sacrifices for another must be skilled in the performance of vaitana rites and know the whole veda

38 a brahmana who though wealthy does not give as fee for the performance of an agnyadheya a horse sacred to pragapati becomes equal to one who has not kindled the sacred fires

39 let him who has faith and controls his senses perform other meritorious acts but let him on no account offer sacrifices at which he gives smaller fees than those prescribed

40 the organs of sense and action honour bliss in heaven longevity fame offspring and cattle are destroyed by a sacrifice at which too small sacrificial fees are given hence a man of small means should not offer a srauta sacrifice

41 a brahmana who being an agnihotrin voluntarily neglects the sacred fires shall perform a lunar penance during one month for that offence is equal to the slaughter of a son

42 those who obtaining wealth from sudras and using that offer an agnihotra are priests officiating for sudras and hence censured among those who recite the veda

43 treading with his foot on the heads of those fools who worship a fire kindled at the expense of a sudra the giver of the wealth shall always pass over his miseries in the next world

44 a man who omits a prescribed act or performs a blamable act or cleaves to sensual enjoyments must perform a penance

45 all sages prescribe a penance for a sin unintentionally committed some declare on the evidence of the revealed texts that it may be performed even for an intentional offence

46 a sin unintentionally committed is expiated by the recitation of vedic texts but that which men in their folly commit intentionally by various special penances

47 a twiceborn man having become liable to perform a penance be it by the decree of fate or by an act committed in a former life must not before the penance has been performed have intercourse with virtuous men

48 some wicked men suffer a change of their natural appearance in consequence of crimes committed in this life and some in consequence of those committed in a former existence

49 he who steals the gold of a brahmana has diseased nails a drinker of the spirituous liquor called sura black teeth the slayer of a brahmana consumption the violator of a gurus bed a diseased skin

50 an informer a foulsmelling nose a calumniator a stinking breath a stealer of grain deficiency in limbs he who adulterates grain redundant limbs

51 a stealer of cooked food dyspepsia a stealer of the words of the veda dumbness a stealer of clothes white leprosy a horsestealer lameness

52 the stealer of a lamp will become blind he who extinguishes it will become oneeyed injury to sentient beings is punished by general sickliness an adulterer will have swellings in his limbs

53 thus in consequence of a remnant of the guilt of former crimes are born idiots dumb blind deaf and deformed men who are all despised by the virtuous

54 penances therefore must always be performed for the sake of purification because those whose sins have not been expiated are born again with disgraceful marks

55 killing a brahmana drinking the spirituous liquor called sura stealing the gold of a brahmana adultery with a gurus wife and associating with such offenders they declare to be mortal sins mahapataka

56 falsely attributing to oneself high birth giving information to the king regarding a crime and falsely accusing ones teacher are offences equal to slaying a brahmana

57 forgetting the veda reviling the vedas giving false evidence slaying a friend eating forbidden food or swallowing substances unfit for food are six offences equal to drinking sura

58 stealing a deposit or men a horse and silver land diamonds and other gems is declared to be equal to stealing the gold of a brahmana

59 carnal intercourse with sisters by the same mother with unmarried maidens with females of the lowest castes with the wives of a friend or of a son they declare to be equal to the violation of a gurus bed

60 slaying kine sacrificing for those who are unworthy to sacrifice adultery selling oneself casting off ones teacher mother father or son giving up the daily study of the veda and neglecting the sacred domestic fire

61 allowing ones younger brother to marry first marrying before ones elder brother giving a daughter to or sacrificing for either brother

62 defiling a damsel usury breaking a vow selling a tank a garden ones wife or child

63 living as a vratya casting off a relative teaching the veda for wages learning the veda from a paid teacher and selling goods which one ought not to sell

64 superintending mines or factories of any sort executing great mechanical works injuring living plants subsisting on the earnings of ones wife sorcery by means of sacrifices and working magic by means of roots and so forth

65 cutting down green trees for firewood doing acts for ones own advantage only eating prohibited food

66 neglecting to kindle the sacred fires theft nonpayment of the three debts studying bad books and practising the arts of dancing and singing

67 stealing grain base metals or cattle intercourse with women who drink spirituous liquor slaying women sudras vaisyas or kshatriyas and atheism are all minor offences causing loss of caste upapataka

68 giving pain to a brahmana by a blow smelling at things which ought not to be smelt at or at spirituous liquor cheating and an unnatural offence with a man are declared to cause the loss of caste gatibhramsa

69 killing a donkey a horse a camel a deer an elephant a goat a sheep a fish a snake or a buffalo must be known to degrade the offender to a mixed caste samkarikarana

70 accepting presents from blamed men trading serving sudras and speaking a falsehood make the offender unworthy to receive gifts apatra

71 killing insects small or large or birds eating anything kept close to spirituous liquors stealing fruit firewood or flowers are offences which make impure malavaha

72 learn now completely those penances by means of which all the several offences mentioned can be expiated

73 for his purification the slayer of a brahmana shall make a hut in the forest and dwell in it during twelve years subsisting on alms and making the skull of a dead man his flag

74 or let him of his own free will become in a battle the target of archers who know his purpose or he may thrice throw himself headlong into a blazing fire

75 or he may offer a horsesacrifice a svargit a gosava an abhigit a visvagit a trivrit or an agnishtut

76 or in order to remove the guilt of slaying a brahmana he may walk one hundred yoganas reciting one of the vedas eating little and controlling his organs

77 or he may present to a brahmana learned in the vedas whole property as much wealth as suffices for the maintenance of the recipient or a house together with the furniture

78 or subsisting on sacrificial food he may walk against the stream along the whole course of the river sarasvati or restricting his food very much he may mutter thrice the samhita of a veda

79 having shaved off all his hair he may dwell at the extremity of the village or in a cowpen or in a hermitage or at the root of a tree taking pleasure in doing good to cows and brahmanas

80 he who unhesitatingly abandons life for the sake of brahmanas or of cows is freed from the guilt of the murder of a brahmana and so is he who saves the life of a cow or of a brahmana

81 if either he fights at least three times against robbers in defence of a brahmanas property or reconquers the whole property of a brahmana or if he loses his life for such a cause he is freed from his guilt

82 he who thus remains always firm in his vow chaste and of concentrated mind removes after the lapse of twelve years the guilt of slaying a brahmana

83 or he who after confessing his crime in an assembly of the gods of the earth brahnanas and the gods of men kshatriyas bathes with the priests at the close of a horsesacrifice is also freed from guilt

84 the brahmana is declared to be the root of the sacred law and the kshatriya its top hence he who has confessed his sin before an assembly of such men becomes pure

85 by his origin alone a brahmana is a deity even for the gods and his teaching is authoritative for men because the veda is the foundation for that

86 if only three of them who are learned in the veda proclaim the expiation for offences that shall purify the sinners for the words of learned men are a means of purification

87 a brahmana who with a concentrated mind follows any of the abovementioned rules removes the sin committed by slaying a brahmana through his selfcontrol

88 for destroying the embryo of a brahmana the sex of which was unknown for slaying a kshatriya or a vaisya who are engaged in or have offered a vedic sacrifice or a brahmana woman who has bathed after temporary uncleanness atreyi he must perform the same penance

89 likewise for giving false evidence in an important cause for passionately abusing the teacher for stealing a deposit and for killing his wife or his friend

90 this expiation has been prescribed for unintentionally killing a brahmana but for intentionally slaying a brahmana no atonement is ordained

91 a twiceborn man who has intentionally drunk through delusion of mind the spirituous liquor called sura shall drink that liquor boilinghot when his body has been completely scalded by that he is freed from his guilt

92 or he may drink cows urine water milk clarified butter or liquid cowdung boilinghot until he dies

93 or in order to remove the guilt of drinking sura he may eat during a year once a day at night grains of rice or oilcake wearing clothes made of cowhair and his own hair in braids and carrying a wine cup as a flag

94 sura indeed is the dirty refuse mala of grain sin also is called dirt mala hence a brahmana a kshatriya and a vaisya shall not drink sura

95 sura one must know to be of three kinds that distilled from molasses gaudi that distilled from ground rice and that distilled from madhukaflowers madhvi as the one named above even so are all three sorts forbidden to the chief of the twiceborn

96 sura all other intoxicating drinks and decoctions and flesh are the food of the yakshas rakshasas and pisakas a brahmana who eats the remnants of the offerings consecrated to the gods must not partake of such substances

97 a brahmana stupefied by drunkenness might fall on something impure or improperly pronounce vedic texts or commit some other act which ought not to be committed

98 when the brahman the veda which dwells in his body is even once only deluged with spirituous liquor his brahmanhood forsakes him and he becomes a sudra

99 the various expiations for drinking the spirituous liquors called sura have thus been explained i will next proclaim the atonement for stealing the gold of a brahmana

100 a brahmana who has stolen the gold of a brahmana shall go to the king and confessing his deed say lord punish me

223 burnt oblations accompanied by the recitation of the mahavyahritis must daily be made by the penitent himself and he must abstain from injuring sentient creatures speak the truth and keep himself free from anger and from dishonesty

224 let him bathe three times each day and thrice each night dressed in his clothes let him on no account talk to women sudras and outcasts

225 let him pass the time standing during the day and sitting during the night or if he is unable to do that let him lie on the bare ground let him be chaste and observe the vows of a student and worship his gurus the gods and brahmanas

226 let him constantly mutter the savitri and other purificatory texts according to his ability let him carefully act thus on the occasion of all other vows performed by way of penance

227 by these expiations twiceborn men must be purified whose sins are known but let him purify those whose sins are not known by the recitation of sacred texts and by the performance of burnt oblations

228 by confession by repentance by austerity and by reciting the veda a sinner is freed from guilt and in case no other course is possible by liberality

229 in proportion as a man who has done wrong himself confesses it even so far he is freed from guilt as a snake from its slough

230 in proportion as his heart loathes his evil deed even so far is his body freed from that guilt

231 he who has committed a sin and has repented is freed from that sin but he is purified only by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking i will do so no more

232 having thus considered in his mind what results will arise from his deeds after death let him always be good in thoughts speech and actions

233 he who having either unintentionally or intentionally committed a reprehensible deed desires to be freed from the guilt on it must not commit it a second time

234 if his mind be uneasy with respect to any act let him repeat the austerities prescribed as a penance for it until they fully satisfy his conscience

235 all the bliss of gods and men is declared by the sages to whom the veda was revealed to have austerity for its root austerity for its middle and austerity for its end

236 the pursuit of sacred knowledge is the austerity of a brahmana protecting the people is the austerity of a kshatriya the pursuit of his daily business is the austerity of a vaisya and service the austerity of a sudra

237 the sages who control themselves and subsist on fruit roots and air survey the three worlds together with their moving and immovable creatures through their austerities alone

238 medicines good health learning and the various divine stations are attained by austerities alone for austerity is the means of gaining them

239 whatever is hard to be traversed whatever is hard to be attained whatever is hard to be reached whatever is hard to be performed all this may be accomplished by austerities for austerity possesses a power which it is difficult to surpass

240 both those who have committed mortal sin mahapataka and all other offenders are severally freed from their guilt by means of wellperformed austerities

241 insects snakes moths bees birds and beings bereft of motion reach heaven by the power of austerities

242 whatever sin men commit by thoughts words or deeds that they speedily burn away by penance if they keep penance as their only riches

243 the gods accept the offerings of that brahmana alone who has purified himself by austerities and grant to him all he desires

244 the lord pragapati created these institutes of the sacred law by his austerities alone the sages likewise obtained the revelation of the vedas through their austerities

245 the gods discerning that the holy origin of this whole world is from austerity have thus proclaimed the incomparable power of austerity

246 the daily study of the veda the performance of the great sacrifices according to ones ability and patience in suffering quickly destroy all guilt even that caused by mortal sins

247 as a fire in one moment consumes with its bright flame the fuel that has been placed on it even so he who knows the veda destroys all guilt by the fire of knowledge

248 the penances for sins made public have been thus declared according to the law learn next the penances for secret sins

249 sixteen suppressions of the breath pranayama accompanied by the recitation of the vyahritis and of the syllable om purify if they are repeated daily after a month even the murderer of a learned brahmana

250 even a drinker of the spirituous liquor called sura becomes pure if he mutters the hymn seen by kutsa removing by thy splendour our guilt o agni c that seen by vasishtha with their hymns the vasishthas woke the dawn c the mahitra hymn and the verses called suddhavatis

251 even he who has stolen gold instantly becomes free from guilt if he once mutters the hymn beginning with the words the middlemost brother of this beautiful ancient hotripriest and the sivasamkalpa

252 the violator of a gurus bed is freed from sin if he repeatedly recites the havishpantiya hymn that beginning neither anxiety nor misfortune and that beginning thus verily thus and mutters the hymn addressed to purusha

253 he who desires to expiate sins great or small must mutter during a year the ritverse may we remove thy anger o varuna c or whatever offence here o varuna c

254 that man who having accepted presents which ought not to be accepted or having eaten forbidden food mutters the taratsamandiya rikas becomes pure after three days

255 but he who has committed many sins becomes pure if he recites during a month the four verses addressed to soma and rudra and the three verses beginning aryaman varuna and mitra while he bathes in a river

256 a grievous offender shall mutter the seven verses beginning with indra for half a year but he who has committed any blamable act in water shall subsist during a month on food obtained by begging

257 a twiceborn man removes even very great guilt by offering clarified butter with the sacred texts belonging to the sakalahomas or by muttering the rik beginning adoration

258 he who is stained by mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends cows for a year reciting the pavamani hymns and subsisting on alms

259 or if pure in mind and in body he thrice repeats the samhita of the veda in a forest sanctified by three paraka penances he is freed from all crimes causing loss of caste pataka

260 but if a man fasts during three days bathing thrice a day and muttering in the water the hymn seen by aghamarshana he is likewise freed from all sins causing loss of caste

261 as the horsesacrifice the king of sacrifices removes all sin even so the aghamarshana hymn effaces all guilt

262 a brahmana who retains in his memory the rigveda is not stained by guilt though he may have destroyed these three worlds though he may eat the food of anybody

263 he who with a concentrated mind thrice recites the riksamhita or that of the yagurveda or that of the samaveda together with the secret texts the upanishads is completely freed from all sins

264 as a clod of earth falling into a great lake is quickly dissolved even so every sinful act is engulfed in the threefold veda

265 the rikas the yagus formulas which differ from the former the manifold saman songs must be known to form the triple veda he who knows them is called learned in the veda

266 the initial triliteral brahman on which the threefold sacred science is based is another triple veda which must be kept secret he who knows that is called learned in the veda



chapter xii

1 o sinless one the whole sacred law applicable to the four castes has been declared by thee communicate to us now according to the truth the ultimate retribution for their deeds

2 to the great sages who addressed him thus righteous bhrigu sprung from manu answered hear the decision concerning this whole connexion with actions

3 action which springs from the mind from speech and from the body produces either good or evil results by action are caused the various conditions of men the highest the middling and the lowest

4 know that the mind is the instigator here below even to that action which is connected with the body and which is of three kinds has three locations and falls under ten heads

5 coveting the property of others thinking in ones heart of what is undesirable and adherence to false doctrines are the three kinds of sinful mental action

6 abusing others speaking untruth detracting from the merits of all men and talking idly shall be the four kinds of evil verbal action

7 taking what has not been given injuring creatures without the sanction of the law and holding criminal intercourse with another mans wife are declared to be the three kinds of wicked bodily action

8 a man obtains the result of a good or evil mental act in his mind that of a verbal act in his speech that of a bodily act in his body

9 in consequence of many sinful acts committed with his body a man becomes in the next birth something inanimate in consequence of sins committed by speech a bird or a beast and in consequence of mental sins he is reborn in a low caste

10 that man is called a true tridandin in whose mind these three the control over his speech vagdanda the control over his thoughts manodanda and the control over his body kayadanda are firmly fixed

11 that man who keeps this threefold control over himself with respect to all created beings and wholly subdues desire and wrath thereby assuredly gains complete success

12 him who impels this corporeal self to action they call the kshetragna the knower of the field but him who does the acts the wise name the bhutatman the self consisting of the elements

13 another internal self that is generated with all embodied kshetragnas is called giva through which the kshetragna becomes sensible of all pleasure and pain in successive births

14 these two the great one and the kshetragna who are closely united with the elements pervade him who resides in the multiform created beings

15 from his body innumerable forms go forth which constantly impel the multiform creatures to action

16 another strong body formed of particles of the five elements and destined to suffer the torments in hell is produced after death in the case of wicked men

17 when the evildoers by means of that body have suffered there the torments imposed by yama its constituent parts are united each according to its class with those very elements from which they were taken

18 he having suffered for his faults which are produced by attachment to sensual objects and which result in misery approaches free from stains those two mighty ones

19 those two together examine without tiring the merit and the guilt of that individual soul united with which it obtains bliss or misery both in this world and the next

20 if the soul chiefly practises virtue and vice to a small degree it obtains bliss in heaven clothed with those very elements

21 but if it chiefly cleaves to vice and to virtue in a small degree it suffers deserted by the elements the torments inflicted by yama

22 the individual soul having endured those torments of yama again enters free from taint those very five elements each in due proportion

23 let man having recognised even by means of his intellect these transitions of the individual soul which depend on merit and demerit always fix his heart on the acquisition of merit

24 know goodness sattva activity ragas and darkness tamas to be the three qualities of the self with which the great one always completely pervades all existences

25 when one of these qualities wholly predominates in a body then it makes the embodied soul eminently distinguished for that quality

26 goodness is declared to have the form of knowledge darkness of ignorance activity of love and hatred such is the nature of these three which is all pervading and clings to everything created

27 when man experiences in his soul a feeling full of bliss a deep calm as it were and a pure light then let him know that it is among those three the quality called goodness

28 what is mixed with pain and does not give satisfaction to the soul one may know to be the quality of activity which is difficult to conquer and which ever draws embodied souls towards sensual objects

29 what is coupled with delusion what has the character of an undiscernible mass what cannot be fathomed by reasoning what cannot be fully known one must consider as the quality of darkness

30 i will moreover fully describe the results which arise from these three qualities the excellent ones the middling ones and the lowest

31 the study of the vedas austerity the pursuit of knowledge purity control over the organs the performance of meritorious acts and meditation on the soul are the marks of the quality of goodness

32 delighting in undertakings want of firmness commission of sinful acts and continual indulgence in sensual pleasures are the marks of the quality of activity

33 covetousness sleepiness pusillanimity cruelty atheism leading an evil life a habit of soliciting favours and inattentiveness are the marks of the quality of darkness

34 know moreover the following to be a brief description of the three qualities each in its order as they appear in the three times the present past and future

35 when a man having done doing or being about to do any act feels ashamed the learned may know that all such acts bear the mark of the quality of darkness

36 but when a man desires to gain by an act much fame in this world and feels no sorrow on failing know that it bears the mark of the quality of activity

37 but that bears the mark of the quality of goodness which with his whole heart he desires to know which he is not ashamed to perform and at which his soul rejoices

38 the craving after sensual pleasures is declared to be the mark of darkness the pursuit of wealth the mark of activity the desire to gain spiritual merit the mark of goodness each later named quality is better than the preceding one

39 i will briefly declare in due order what transmigrations in this whole world a man obtains through each of these qualities

40 those endowed with goodness reach the state of gods those endowed with activity the state of men and those endowed with darkness ever sink to the condition of beasts that is the threefold course of transmigrations

41 but know this threefold course of transmigrations that depends on the three qualities to be again threefold low middling and high according to the particular nature of the acts and of the knowledge of each man

42 immovable beings insects both small and great fishes snakes and tortoises cattle and wild animals are the lowest conditions to which the quality of darkness leads

43 elephants horses sudras and despicable barbarians lions tigers and boars are the middling states caused by the quality of darkness

44 karanas suparnas and hypocrites rakshasas and pisakas belong to the highest rank of conditions among those produced by darkness

45 ghallas mallas natas men who subsist by despicable occupations and those addicted to gambling and drinking form the lowest order of conditions caused by activity

46 kings and kshatriyas the domestic priests of kings and those who delight in the warfare of disputations constitute the middling rank of the states caused by activity

47 the gandharvas the guhyakas and the servants of the gods likewise the apsarases belong all to the highest rank of conditions produced by activity

48 hermits ascetics brahmanas the crowds of the vaimanika deities the lunar mansions and the daityas form the first and lowest rank of the existences caused by goodness

49 sacrificers the sages the gods the vedas the heavenly lights the years the manes and the sadhyas constitute the second order of existences caused by goodness

50 the sages declare brahma the creators of the universe the law the great one and the undiscernible one to constitute the highest order of beings produced by goodness

51 thus the result of the threefold action the whole system of transmigrations which consists of three classes each with three subdivisions and which includes all created beings has been fully pointed out

52 in consequence of attachment to the objects of the senses and in consequence of the nonperformance of their duties fools the lowest of men reach the vilest births

53 what wombs this individual soul enters in this world and in consequence of what actions learn the particulars of that at large and in due order

54 those who committed mortal sins mahapataka having passed during large numbers of years through dreadful hells obtain after the expiration of that term of punishment the following births

55 the slayer of a brahmana enters the womb of a dog a pig an ass a camel a cow a goat a sheep a deer a bird a kandala and a pukkasa

56 a brahmana who drinks the spirituous liquor called sura shall enter the bodies of small and large insects of moths of birds feeding on ordure and of destructive beasts

57 a brahmana who steals the gold of a brahmana shall pass a thousand times through the bodies of spiders snakes and lizards of aquatic animals and of destructive pisakas

58 the violator of a gurus bed enters a hundred times the forms of grasses shrubs and creepers likewise of carnivorous animals and of beasts with fangs and of those doing cruel deeds

59 men who delight in doing hurt become carnivorous animals those who eat forbidden food worms thieves creatures consuming their own kind those who have intercourse with women of the lowest castes pretas

60 he who has associated with outcasts he who has approached the wives of other men and he who has stolen the property of a brahmana become brahmarakshasas

61 a man who out of greed has stolen gems pearls or coral or any of the many other kinds of precious things is born among the goldsmiths

62 for stealing grain a man becomes a rat for stealing yellow metal a hamsa for stealing water a plava for stealing honey a stinging insect for stealing milk a crow for stealing condiments a dog for stealing clarified butter an ichneumon

63 for stealing meat a vulture for stealing fat a cormorant for stealing oil a winged animal of the kind called tailapaka for stealing salt a cricket for stealing sour milk a bird of the kind called balaka

64 for stealing silk a partridge for stealing linen a frog for stealing cottoncloth a crane for stealing a cow an iguana for stealing molasses a flyingfox

65 for stealing fine perfumes a muskrat for stealing vegetables consisting of leaves a peacock for stealing cooked food of various kinds a porcupine for stealing uncooked food a hedgehog

66 for stealing fire he becomes a heron for stealing householdutensils a masonwasp for stealing dyed clothes a francolinpartridge

67 for stealing a deer or an elephant a wolf for stealing a horse a tiger for stealing fruit and roots a monkey for stealing a woman a bear for stealing water a blackwhite cuckoo for stealing vehicles a camel for stealing cattle a hegoat

68 that man who has forcibly taken away any kind of property belonging to another or who has eaten sacrificial food of which no portion had been offered inevitably becomes an animal

69 women also who in like manner have committed a theft shall incur guilt they will become the females of those same creatures which have been enumerated above

70 but men of the four castes who have relinquished without the pressure of necessity their proper occupations will become the servants of dasyus after migrating into despicable bodies

71 a brahmana who has fallen off from his duty becomes an ulkamukha preta who feeds on what has been vomited and a kshatriya a kataputana preta who eats impure substances and corpses

72 a vaisya who has fallen off from his duty becomes a maitrakshagyotika preta who feeds on pus and a sudra a kailasaka preta who feeds on moths

73 in proportion as sensual men indulge in sensual pleasures in that same proportion their taste for them grows

74 by repeating their sinful acts those men of small understanding suffer pain here below in various births

75 the torture of being tossed about in dreadful hells tamisra and the rest that of the forest with swordleaved trees and the like and that of being bound and mangled

76 and various torments the pain of being devoured by ravens and owls the heat of scorching sand and the torture of being boiled in jars which is hard to bear

77 and births in the wombs of despicable beings which cause constant misery and afflictions from cold and heat and terrors of various kinds

78 the pain of repeatedly lying in various wombs and agonizing births imprisonment in fetters hard to bear and the misery of being enslaved by others

79 and separations from their relatives and dear ones and the pain of dwelling together with the wicked labour in gaining wealth and its loss trouble in making friends and the appearance of enemies

80 old age against which there is no remedy the pangs of diseases afflictions of many various kinds and finally unconquerable death

81 but with whatever disposition of mind a man forms any act he reaps its result in a future body endowed with the same quality

82 all the results proceeding from actions have been thus pointed out learn next those acts which secure supreme bliss to a brahmana

83 studying the veda practising austerities the acquisition of true knowledge the subjugation of the organs abstention from doing injury and serving the guru are the best means for attaining supreme bliss

84 if you ask whether among all these virtuous actions performed here below there be one which has been declared more efficacious than the rest for securing supreme happiness to man

85 the answer is that the knowledge of the soul is stated to be the most excellent among all of them for that is the first of all sciences because immortality is gained through that

86 among those six kinds of actions enumerated above the performance of the acts taught in the veda must ever be held to be most efficacious for ensuring happiness in this world and the next

87 for in the performance of the acts prescribed by the veda all those others are fully comprised each in its turn in the several rules for the rites

88 the acts prescribed by the veda are of two kinds such as procure an increase of happiness and cause a continuation of mundane existence pravritta and such as ensure supreme bliss and cause a cessation of mundane existence nivritta

89 acts which secure the fulfilment of wishes in this world or in the next are called pravritta such as cause a continuation of mundane existence but acts performed without any desire for a reward preceded by the acquisition of true knowledge are declared to be nivritta such as cause the cessation of mundane existence

90 he who sedulously performs acts leading to future births pravritta becomes equal to the gods but he who is intent on the performance of those causing the cessation of existence nivritta indeed passes beyond the reach of the five elements

91 he who sacrifices to the self alone equally recognising the self in all created beings and all created beings in the self becomes independent like an autocrat and selfluminous

92 after giving up even the abovementioned sacrificial rites a brahmana should exert himself in acquiring the knowledge of the soul in extinguishing his passions and in studying the veda

93 for that secures the attainment of the object of existence especially in the case of a brahmana because by attaining that not otherwise a twiceborn man has gained all his ends

94 the veda is the eternal eye of the manes gods and men the vedaordinance is both beyond the sphere of human power and beyond the sphere of human comprehension that is a certain fact

95 all those traditions smriti and those despicable systems of philosophy which are not based on the veda produce no reward after death for they are declared to be founded on darkness

96 all those doctrines differing from the veda which spring up and soon perish are worthless and false because they are of modern date

97 the four castes the three worlds the four orders the past the present and the future are all severally known by means of the veda

98 sound touch colour taste and fifthly smell are known through the veda alone their production is through the vedic rites which in this respect are secondary acts

99 the eternal lore of the veda upholds all created beings hence i hold that to be supreme which is the means of securing happiness to these creatures

100 command of armies royal authority the office of a judge and sovereignty over the whole world he only deserves who knows the vedascience

101 as a fire that has gained strength consumes even trees full of sap even so he who knows the veda burns out the taint of his soul which arises from evil acts

102 in whatever order a man who knows the true meaning of the vedascience may dwell he becomes even while abiding in this world fit for the union with brahman

103 even forgetful students of the sacred books are more distinguished than the ignorant those who remember them surpass the forgetful students those who possess a knowledge of the meaning are more distinguished than those who only remember the words men who follow the teaching of the texts surpass those who merely know their meaning

104 austerity and sacred learning are the best means by which a brahmana secures supreme bliss by austerities he destroys guilt by sacred learning he obtains the cessation of births and deaths

105 the three kinds of evidence perception inference and the sacred institutes which comprise the tradition of many schools must be fully understood by him who desires perfect correctness with respect to the sacred law

106 he alone and no other man knows the sacred law who explores the utterances of the sages and the body of the laws by modes of reasoning not repugnant to the vedalore

107 thus the acts which secure supreme bliss have been exactly and fully described now the secret portion of these institutes proclaimed by manu will be taught

108 if it be asked how it should be with respect to points of the law which have not been specially mentioned the answer is that which brahmanas who are sishtas propound shall doubtlessly have legal force

109 those brahmanas must be considered as sishtas who in accordance with the sacred law have studied the veda together with its appendages and are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts

110 whatever an assembly consisting either of at least ten or of at least three persons who follow their prescribed occupations declares to be law the legal force of that one must not dispute

111 three persons who each know one of the three principal vedas a logician a mimamsaka one who knows the nirukta one who recites the institutes of the sacred law and three men belonging to the first three orders shall constitute a legal assembly consisting of at least ten members

112 one who knows the rigveda one who knows the yagurveda and one who knows the samaveda shall be known to form an assembly consisting of at least three members and competent to decide doubtful points of law

113 even that which one brahmana versed in the veda declares to be law must be considered to have supreme legal force but not that which is proclaimed by myriads of ignorant men

114 even if thousands of brahmanas who have not fulfilled their sacred duties are unacquainted with the veda and subsist only by the name of their caste meet they cannot form an assembly for settling the sacred law

115 the sin of him whom dunces incarnations of darkness and unacquainted with the law instruct in his duty falls increased a hundredfold on those who propound it

116 all that which is most efficacious for securing supreme bliss has been thus declared to you a brahmana who does not fall off from that obtains the most excellent state

117 thus did that worshipful deity disclose to me through a desire of benefiting mankind this whole most excellent secret of the sacred law

118 let every brahmana concentrating his mind fully recognise in the self all things both the real and the unreal for he who recognises the universe in the self does not give his heart to unrighteousness

119 the self alone is the multitude of the gods the universe rests on the self for the self produces the connexion of these embodied spirits with actions

120 let him meditate on the ether as identical with the cavities of the body on the wind as identical with the organs of motions and of touch on the most excellent light as the same with his digestive organs and his sight on water as the same with the corporeal fluids on the earth as the same with the solid parts of his body

121 on the moon as one with the internal organ on the quarters of the horizon as one with his sense of hearing on vishnu as one with his power of motion on hara as the same with his strength on agni fire as identical with his speech on mitra as identical with his excretions and on pragapati as one with his organ of generation

122 let him know the supreme male purusha to be the sovereign ruler of them all smaller even than small bright like gold and perceptible by the intellect only when in a state of sleep like abstraction

123 some call him agni fire others manu the lord of creatures others indra others the vital air and again others eternal brahman

124 he pervades all created beings in the five forms and constantly makes them by means of birth growth and decay revolve like the wheels of a chariot

125 he who thus recognises the self through the self in all created beings becomes equal minded towards all and enters the highest state brahman

126 a twiceborn man who recites these institutes revealed by manu will be always virtuous in conduct and will reach whatever condition he desires

the end of the laws of manuembed"
