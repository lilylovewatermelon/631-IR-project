he left no time to regret
kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
me and my head high
and my tears dry get on without my guy
you went back to what you knew
so far removed from all that we went through
and i tread a troubled track
my odds are stacked ill go back to black

chorus
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
i go back to us

verse 2
i love you much its not enough
you love blow and i love puff
and life is like a pipe
and im a tiny penny rollin up the walls inside

chorus
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
you might also likebridge
black black black black
black black black
i go back to
i go back to

chorus
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to
we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her and i go back to black107embed"
