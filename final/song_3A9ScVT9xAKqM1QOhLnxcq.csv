pretend i never happened
erase me from your mind
you will not want to remember
any love as cold as mine

verse 1
ill be leavin in the mornin
for a place i hope i find
all the place must be better
than the ones i leave behind

chorus 2
i dont suppose youll be unhappy
youll find ways to spend your time
but if you ever think about me
if i ever cross your mind

chorus 1
just pretend i never happened
erase me from your mind girl
you will not want to remember
any love as cold as mine
