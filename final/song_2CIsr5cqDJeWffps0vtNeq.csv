can you help me out can you lend me a hand
its safe to say that im stuck again
trapped between this life and the light
i just cant figure out how to make it right

prechorus
a thousand times before
ive wondered if theres something more something more

chorus
i feel its going to rain like this for days
so let it rain down and wash everything away
i hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
with every tomorrow comes another life
i feel its going to rain for days and days
i feel its going to rain

verse 2
i tried to figure out i cant understand
what it means to be whole again
trapped between the truth and the consequence
nothings real nothings making sense

prechorus
a thousand times before
ive wondered if theres something more something more
