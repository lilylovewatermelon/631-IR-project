in the final curtain call
you left me here with
the coldest of feelings weight kind depression
blessing the floor with the places youve stepped in
will they ever measure up
to the way you left me
here by the roadside the bloodiest cadaver
marked in your words im the joke im the bastard
here wait so i guess that you knew
that youre
a selfish little whore im the selfish little whore
if i had my way id crush your face in the door

chorus
this is no beginning yeah yeah
this is the final cut open up
this is no beginning yeah yeah
this is the final cut oh im in love
