you make me feel like im a whore
like im the one whos there to bore you now
its always gonna be this way

cause i cant seem to show you what you wanna see
i can never give you anything you need
im sick of wasting time on what can never be
i cannot control you into wanting me

you always wanna steal the light
by stepping on the ones who fight for you
its always gonna be the same
get the fuck away

chorus
cause i cant seem to show you what you wanna see
i can never give you anything you need
im sick of wasting time on what can never be
i cannot control you into wanting me
