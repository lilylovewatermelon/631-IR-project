you know my old car needs washing
and the front yard needs a trim
and the telephone keeps ringing
and the bossman knows i know its him
and the bills aint going to pay themselves
dont matter anyway
cause i aint in no hurry today
theres nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
and the smell of early spring
sit down in a foldup easy chair
on a quiet shady river bank
let the world go on without me
wouldnt have it any other way
cause i aint in no hurry today

chorus
aint in no hurry
id be a fool now to worry
about all those things i cant change
and the time that i borrow
can wait til tomorrow
cause i aint in no hurry today

bridge
when i must return
to the cold cold ground
have them take their time
when they lay this sinner down
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 2
heaven knows that i aint perfect
ive raised a little cain
and i plan to raise a whole lot more
before i hear those angels sing
going to get right with the lord
but therell be hell to pay
but i aint in no hurry

chorus
aint in no hurry
id be a fool now to worry
about all those things i cant change
and the time that i borrow
can wait til tomorrow
cause i aint in no hurry today
aint in no hurry
aint in no hurry today2embed"
