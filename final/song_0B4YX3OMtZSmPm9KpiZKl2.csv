every once in a while something changes
and shes changing me
its too late for me now i am altered
there is something beneath

chorus
shes not acid nor alkaline
caught between black and white
not quite either day or night
shes perfectly misaligned
im caught up in her design
and how it connects to mine
i see in a different light
the objects of my desire

verse 2
ooh lets talk about chemistry
cause im dying to melt through
to the hеart of her molecules
till thе particles part like holy water
if anything shes an undiscovered element
either born in hell or heavensent
either way im into it

chorus
shes not acid nor alkaline
caught between black and white
not quite either day or night
shes perfectly misaligned
im caught up in her design
and how it connects to mine
i see in a different light
the objects of my desire
not acid nor alkaline
caught between black and white
not quite either day or night
shes perfectly misaligned
im caught up in her design
and how it connects to mine
i see in a different light
the objects of my desiresee sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also like9embed"
