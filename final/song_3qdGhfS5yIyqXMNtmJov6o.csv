satan being thus confined to a vagabond wandering unsettled condition is without any certain abode for though he has in consequence of his angelic nature a kind of empire in the liquid waste or air yet this is certainly part of his punishment that he is    without any fixed place or space allowed him to rest the sole of his foot upon

to be born again sang gibreel farishta tumbling from the heavens first you have to die ho ji ho ji to land upon the bosomy earth first one needs to fly tattaa takathun how to ever smile again if first you wont cry how to win the darlings love mister without a sigh baba if you want to get born again    just before dawn one winters morning new years day or thereabouts two real fullgrown living men fell from a great height twentynine thousand and two feet towards the english channel without benefit of parachutes or wings out of a clear sky

i tell you you must die i tell you i tell you and thusly and so beneath a moon of alabaster until a loud cry crossed the night to the devil with your tunes the words hanging crystalline in the iced white night in the movies you only mimed to playback singers so spare me these infernal noises now

gibreel the tuneless soloist had been cavorting in moonlight as he sang his impromptu gazal swimming in air butterflystroke breaststroke bunching himself into a ball spreadeagling himself against the almostinfinity of the almostdawn adopting heraldic postures rampant couchant pitting levity against gravity now he rolled happily towards the sardonic voice oh√© salad baba its you too good whatho old chumch at which the other a fastidious shadow falling headfirst in a grey suit with all the jacket buttons done up arms by his sides taking for granted the improbability of the bowler hat on his head pulled a nicknamehaters face hey spoono gibreel yelled eliciting a second inverted wince proper london bhai here we come those bastards down there wont know what hit them meteor or lightning or vengeance of god out of thin air baby dharrraaammm wham na what an entrance yaar i swear splat

out of thin air a big bang followed by falling stars a universal beginning a miniature echo of the birth of time    the jumbo jet bostan flight ai420 blew apart without any warning high above the great rotting beautiful snowwhite illuminated city mahagonny babylon alphaville but gibreel has already named it i mustnt intefere proper london capital of vilayet winked blinked nodded in the night while at himalayan height a brief and premature sun burst into the powdery january air a blip vanished from radar screens and the thin air was full of bodies descending from the everest of the catastrophe to the miky paleness of the sea

who am i

who else is there

the aircraft cracked in half a seedpod giving up its spores an egg yielding its mystery two actors prancing gibreel and buttony pursed mr saladin chamcha fell like titbits of tobacco from a broken old cigar above behind below them in the void there hung reclining seats stereophonic headsets drinks trolleys motion discomfort receptacles disembarkation cards dutyfree video games braided caps paper cups blankets oxygen masks also  for there had been more than a few migrants aboard yes quite a quantity of wives who had been grilled by reasonable doingtheirjob officials about the length of and distinguishing moles upon their husbands genitalia a sufficiency of children upon whose legitimacy the british government had cast its everreasonable doubts  mingling with the remnants on the plane equally fragmented equally absurd there floated the debris of the soul broken memories sloughedoff selves severed mothertongues violated privacies untranslatable jokes extinguished futures lost loves the forgotten meaning of hollow booming words land belonging home knocked a little silly by the blast gibreel and saladin plummeted like bundles dropped by some carelessly openbeaked stork and because chamcha was going down head first in the recommended position for babies entering the birth canal he commenced to feel a low irritation at the others refusal to fall in plain fashion saladin nosedived while farishta embraced air hugging it with his arms and legs a flailing overwrought actor without techniques of restraint below cloudcovered awaiting their entrance the slow congealed currents of the english sleeve the appointed zone of their watery recincarnation

o my shoes are japanese gibreel sang translating the old song into english in semiconscious deference to the uprushing hostnation these trousers english if you please on my head red russian hat my hearts indian for all that the clouds were bubbling up towards them and perhaps it was on account of that great mystification of cumulus and cumulonimbus the mighty rolling thunderheads standing like hammers in the dawn or perhaps it was the singing the one busy performing the other booing the performance or their blastdelirium that spared them full foreknowledge of the imminent    but for whatever reason the two men gibreelsaladin farishtachamcha condemned to this endless but also ending angelicdevilish fall did not become aware of the moment at which the process of their transmutation began
mutation

yessir but not random up there in airspace in that soft imperceptible field which had been made possible by the century and which thereafter made the century possible becoming one of its defining locations the place of movement and of war the planetshrinker and powervacuum most insecure and transitory of zones illusory discontinuous metamorphic  because when you throw everything up in the air anything becomes possible  wayupthere at any rate changes took place in delirious actors that would have gladdened the heart of old mr lamarck under extreme environmental pressure characteristics were acquired

what characteristics which slow down you think creation happens in a rush so then neither does revelation    take a look at the pair of them notice anything unusual just two brown men falling hard nothing so new about that you may think climbed too high got above themselves flew too close to the sun is that it

thats not it listen

mr saladin chamcha appalled by the noises emanating from gibreel farishtas mouth fought back with verses of his own what farishta heard wafting across the improbable night sky was an old song too lyrics by mr james thomson seventeenhundred to seventeenfortyeight    at heavens command chamcha carolled through lips turned jingoistically redwhiteblue by the cold arooooose from out the aaaazure rain farishta horrified sang louder and louder of japanese shoes russian hats inviolately subcontinental hearts but could not still saladins wild recital and guardian aaaaangels sung the strain

lets face it it was impossible for them to have heard one another much less conversed and also competed thus in song accelerating towards the planet atmosphere raring around them how could they but lets face this too they did

downdown they hurtled and the winter cold frosting their eyelashes and threatening to freeze their hearts was on the point of waking them from their delirious daydream they were about to become aware of the miracle of the singing the rain of limbs and babies of which they were a part and the terror of the destiny rushing at them from below when they hit were drenched and instantly iced by the degreezero boiling of the clouds

they were in what appeared to be a long vertical tunnel chamcha prim rigid and still upsidedown saw gibreel farishta in his purple bushshirt come swimming towards him across that cloudwalled funnel and would have shouted keep away get away from me except that something prevented him the beginning of a little fluttery screamy thing in his intestines so instead of uttering words of rejection he opened his arms and farishta swam into them until they were embracing headtotail and the force of their collision sent them tumbling end over end performing their geminate cartwheels all the way down and along the hole that went to wonderland while pushing their way out of the white came a succession of coudforms ceaselessly metamorphosing gods into bulls women into spiders men into wolves hybrid cloudcreatures pressed in upon them gigantic flowers with human breasts dangling from fleshy stalks winged cats centaurs and chamcha in his semiconsciousness was seized by the notion that he too had acquired the quality of cloudiness becoming metamorphic hybrid as if he were growing into the person whose head nestled now between his legs and whose legs were wrapped around his long patrician neck

this person had however no time for such high falutions was indeed incapable of faluting at all having just seen emerging from the swirl of cloud the figure of a glamorous woman of a certain age wearing a brocade sari in green and gold with a diamond in her nose and lacquer defending her highcoiled hair against the pressure of the wind at these altitudes as she sat equably upon a flying carpet rekha merchant gibreel greeted her you couldnt find your way to heaven or what insensitive words to speak to a dead woman but his concussed plummeting condition may be offered in mitigation    chamcha clutching his legs made an uncomprehending query what the hell

you dont see her gibreel shouted you dont see her goddamn bokhara rug

no no gibbo her voice whispered in his ears dont expect him to confirm i am strictly for your eyes only maybe you are going crazy what do you think you namaqool you piece of pig excrement my love with death comes honesty my beloved so i can call you by your true names

cloudy rekha murmured sour nothings but gibreel cried again to chamcha spoono you see her or you dont

saladin chamcha saw nothing heard nothing said nothing gibreel faced her alone you shouldnt have done it he admonished her no sir a sin a suchmuch thing
o you can lecture me now she laughed you are the one with the high moral tone thats a good one it was you who left me her voice reminded his ear seeming to nibble at the lobe it was you o moon of my delight who hid behind a cloud and i in darkness blinded lost for love

he became afraid what do you want no dont tell just go

when you were sick i could not see you in case of scandal you knew i could not that i stayed away for your sake but afterwards you punished you used it as your excuse to leave your cloud to hide behind that and also her the icewoman bastard now that i am dead i have forgotten to forgive i curse you my gibreel may your life be hell hell because thats where you sent me damn you where you came from devil where youre going sucker enjoy the bloody dip rekhas curse and after that verses in a language he did not understand all harshnesses and sibilance in which he thought he made out but maybe not the repeated name allat

he clutched at chamcha they burst through the bottom of the clouds

speed the sensation of speed returned whistling its fearful note the roof of cloud fled upwards the waterfloor zoomed closer their eyes opened a scream that same scream that had fluttered in his guts when gibreel swam across the sky burst from chamchas lips a shaft of sunlight pierced his open mouth and set it free but they had fallen through the transformations of the clouds chamcha and farishta and there was a fluidity an indistinctness at the edges of them and as the sunlight hit chamcha it released more than noise

fly chamcha shriekd at gibreel start flying now and added without knowing its source the second command and sing

how does newness come into the world how is it born

of what fusions translations conjoinings is it made

how does it survive extreme and dangerous as it is what compromises what deals what betrayals of its secret nature must it make to stave off the wrecking crew the exterminating angel the guillotine

is birth always a fall

do angels have wings can men fly



when mr saladin chamcha fell out of the clouds over the english channel he felt his heart being gripped by a force so implacable that he understood it was impossible for him to die afterwards when his feet were once more firmly planted on the ground he would begin to doubt this to ascribe the implausibilities of his transit to the scrambling of his perceptions by the blast and to attribute his survival his and gibreel‚Äôs to blind dumb luck but at the time he had no doubt what had taken him over was the will to live unadulterated irresistible pure and the first thing it did was to inform him that it wanted nothing to do with his pathetic personality that halfreconstructed affair of mimicry and voices it intended to bypass all that and he found himself surrendering to it yes go on as if he were a bystander in his own mind in his own body because it began in the very centre of his body and spread outwards turning his blood to iron changing his flesh to steel except that it also felt like a fist that enveloped him from outside holding him in a way that was both unbearably tight and intolerably gentle until finally it had conquered him totally and could work his mouth his fingers whatever it chose and once it was sure of its dominion it spread outward from his body and grabbed gibreel farishta by the balls
‚Äòfly‚Äô it commanded gibreel ‚Äòsing‚Äô

chamcha held on to gibreel while the other began slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity and force to flap his arms harder and harder he flapped and as he flapped a song burst out of him and like the song of the spectre of rekha merchant it was sung in a language he did not know to a tune he had never heard gibreel never repudiated the miracle unlike chamcha who tried to reason it out of existence he never stopped saying that the gazal had been celestial that without the song the flapping would have been for nothing and without the flapping it was a sure thing that they would hit the waves like rocks or what and simply burst into pieces on making contact with the taut drum of the sea whereas instead they began to slow down the more emphatically gibreel flapped and sang sang and flapped the more pronounced the deceleration until finally the two of them were floating down to the channel like scraps of paper in a breeze

they were the only survivors of the wreck the only ones who fell from bostan and lived they were found washed up on a beach the more voluble of the two the one in the purple shirt swore in his wild ramblings that they had walked upon the water that the waves had borne them gently in to shore but the other to whose head a soggy bowler hat clung as if by magic denied this ‚Äògod we were lucky‚Äô he said ‚Äòhow lucky can you get‚Äô

i know the truth obviously i watched the whole thing as to omnipresence and potence im making no claims at present but i can manage this much i hope chamcha willed it and farishta did what was willed

which was the miracle worker

of what type  angelic satanic  was farishta‚Äôs song

who am i

let‚Äôs put it this way who has the best tunes



these were the first words gibreel farishta said when he awoke on the snowbound english beach with the improbability of a starfish by his ear ‚Äòborn again spoono you and me happy birthday mister happy birthday to you‚Äô

whereupon saladin chamcha coughed spluttered opened his eyes as befitted a newborn babe burst into foolish tearsembed"
