well it was just a dream just a moment ago
i was up so high lookin down at the sky dont let me fall
i was shootin for stars on a saturday night
they say what goes up must come down but dont let me fall
dont let me fall dont let me fall
they say what goes up must come down but dont let me fall
dont let me fall

verse 1
cause im glidin up there oh so very high that if the
clouds were to drop me then id fall out the sky i dont really
know why im here i guess im just here for the ride i swear it
feels like im dreamin its vividly defined yeah

but lets get one thing straight you know my name
so i run this town when im on this mic yeah
so here i go bob bobby ray i dont know need i know
but i know that i flow rack em up knock em down dominoes
then i go as my story goes

verse 2
yeah well im from much lower than where that pavement is
cause there aint no parachute that they can make for this
cause i put my pain my heart my soul my faith in this
does anyone feel like how i feel then you can relate to this
or just blaze to this maybe roll one up then take a hit
toast to the good life then take a sip
vacay everyday yeah take a trip
its easy to see i was made for this
from the womb all the way to the grave i spit
just to show yall niggas what greatness is yeah
im talkin very lucid like makin movies
to picture my life boy you need a higher resolution
i used to cut class in the day then run away at night
but now im ruler of the upper class and i dont even write
