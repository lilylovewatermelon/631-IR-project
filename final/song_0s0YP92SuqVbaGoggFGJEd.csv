brother theres so much that i could never say to your face
but by now you should know the world and all its ways
so find your place
how do i find words that do not condescend
when she bore you before me
cause she doesnt need a child she needs a friend
a son not a sob story ooh

chorus
now you must look out for her the way she did for you
and your priority it must be her
now you must look out for her the way she did for you
cause well never be the way we were ooh

verse 2
she cant always be there just to hold you down
our mother
when you are at a age now where life turns around
my brother
realise that you dont have to answer to no man
responsibility comes down to you
but how can i expect you to understand
when you live life like its a runthrough
ooh oohoohooh

now you must look out for her the way she did for you
ooh your priority it must be her
now you must look out for her the way she did for you
now you must look out
cause well never be the way we were
now you must look out for her the way she did for you
now you must
and your priority it must be her
now you must look after her the way she did for you
