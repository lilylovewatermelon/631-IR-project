grace what have you done
murdered for me on that cross
accused in absence of wrong
my sin washed away in your blood

too much to make sense of it all
i know that your love breaks my fall
the scandal of grace you died in my place
so my soul will live

oh to be like you
give all i have just to know you
jesus theres no one besides you
forever the hope in my heart

verse 2
death where is your sting
your power is as dead as my sin
the cross has taught me to live
and mercy my heart now to sing

the day and its trouble shall come
i know that your strength is enough
the scandal of grace you died in my place
so my soul will live
