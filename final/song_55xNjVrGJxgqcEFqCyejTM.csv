october 92 when you pushed me out straight up
it was only right that i made a song about you straight up
ain’t no tellin where id be if i went without you on god
wish i woulda stayed in school but i dropped out on god
you taught me how to be strong gotta give praise 21
when the times got hard you always made ways on god
even though i barely got the new js on god
you made sure the kid kept a temp fade straight up
and you kept my playstation with some new games straight up
and you buy me freezy cups with your loose change facts
my daddy never was around that nigga too lame fuck ’em
i think thats why i quit school and started to shoot thangs 21
my mama taught me how to tie my shoes on god
my mama taught me how to cook my noodles straight up
mama told me dont spend all my money with a jeweler
i bought some real estate plus im investin in my shooters 21 21

chorus
had to write a letter to my ma dukes ma dukes
i know you proud of me but im proud too im proud too
you the only woman id give some vows to on god
i’m still your baby even though i got a child too straight up
i paid it off ain’t no mortgage or no rent due facts
yes she got a range rover and a benz too on god
its a hard job but women raise men too 21
ma you never left my side and i thank you 21
see 21 savage liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likeverse 2
i seen you strugglin’ i think it left a scar left a scar
i did some things when i was young that broke your heart broke your heart
im the one that stole the cookies out the jar out the jar
im the one that went and stole the neighbors car neighbor’s car
times got hard started sellin hard sellin hard
before i see you stressin im gonna break the law break the law
i was sellin weed i never mowed the lawn mowed the lawn
commit a burglary and take it to the pawn straight to the pawn
when i went to ydc you was there on god
if i had a school hearing you was there thats a fact
back when you had the ford minivan let me drive to citi trends
baggyass girbauds and some timberlands straight up straight up
me and my baby mama was beefin you didnt give a damn straight up
you didnt never pick a side told me be a man straight up
ima raise my kids nothin like my dad im a better dad
youre the best mama i could ever have on god

chorus
had to write a letter to my ma dukes ma dukes
i know you proud of me but im proud too im proud too
you the only woman id give some vows to on god
im still your baby even though i got a child too straight up
i paid it off aint no mortgage or no rent due facts
yes she got a range rover and a benz too on god
its a hard job but women raise men too 21
ma you never left my side and i thank you 2129embed"
