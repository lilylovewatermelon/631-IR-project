while hes still around
im gonna take him out to fish
so we can catch up on those stories
that we aint got to yet
and while hes still around
im gonna make a couple of notes
about how hes loved my mama
since all those years ago

chorus
cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
sayin heaven handed out some angel wings
and all those things that you were gonna do
are just tear drops rainin on a church pew
so im gonna try to say before i gotta pray it
hopin that hes lookin down
and tell him that i love him
while hes still around

verse 2
while hes still around
were gonna fix up that old car
so one day when its all mine
hell be there every time it starts
and while hes still around
yeah i want to meet the one
watch him try and hold them tears back
when i see him holdin my son
