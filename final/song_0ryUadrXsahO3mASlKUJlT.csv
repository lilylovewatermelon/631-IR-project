heeheeheehee

verse 1 michael jackson
my babys always dancin and it wouldnt be a bad thing
but i dont get no lovin and thats no lie
we spent the night in frisco at every kinda disco
from that night i kissed our love goodbye

hook the jacksons
dont blame it on the sunshine
dont blame it on the moonlight
dont blame it on the good times
blame it on the boogie
dont blame it on the sunshine
dont blame it on the moonlight
dont blame it on the good times
blame it on the boogie

verse 2 michael jackson
that nasty boogie bugs me but somehow it has drugged me
spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
ive changed my life completely ive seen the lightning leave me
and my baby just cant take her eyes off me

hook the jacksons
dont blame it on the sunshine
dont blame it on the moonlight
dont blame it on the good times
blame it on the boogie woo
dont you blame it on the sunshine
dont blame it on the moonlight
dont blame it on the good times
blame it on the boogie
