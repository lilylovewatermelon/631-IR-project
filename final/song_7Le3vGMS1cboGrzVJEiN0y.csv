bout a football jacket and a high school ring
and it sure looked nice
when you wore mine

that late october at the homecoming dance
we slipped outside
and we took a chance
in the middle of the night
it sure felt right

we let go right then and there
we were loved and we were scared
for the first time
loving blind we dove right in
for the first time
we gave everything and then
graduation came
and our dreams called our names
with broken hearts we moved on with our lives
for the first time

well i heard the other day
youre a sunday school teacher got the pta
got a real good life
youre a real good wife
im livin in this circus world
no i aint married but i got a girl
and im her man
and were makin plans
but i still smile when i think of us
together we learned how to love

loving blind we dove right in
for the first time
we gave everything and then
graduation came
and our dreams called our names
with broken hearts we moved on with our lives
for the first time

oh graduation came
and our dreams called our names
with broken hearts we moved on with our lives
for the first time

for the first time
loving blind we dove right in
for the first time
we gave everything and then
for the first time
qe moved on with our lives
