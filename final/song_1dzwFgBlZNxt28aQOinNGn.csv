love comes with a price tag and a barcode
still love you when we part though
blame me like its my fault

walk around like your heart cold
hop around like your parkour
still o still okay

still o still okay
still o still okay changes

my biggest distraction is that i get distracted
people suing me for shit that didnt happen
i wonder how the world would be if they didnt have me

or had a baby with some nigga
or either three months postnatal postin up that little nigga papi
i wonder if they really happy or just gettin at me

change she could feel a change in me
so long since i’ve seen her she can feel a change in me
