on the starboard side but close to the middle is a plain oak drawingtable with drawingboard tsquare straightedges set squares mathematical instruments saucers of water color a tumbler of discolored water indian ink pencils and brushes on it the drawingboard is set so that the draughtsmans chair has the window on its left hand on the floor at the end of the table on its right is a ships fire bucket on the port side of the room near the bookshelves is a sofa with its back to the windows it is a sturdy mahogany article oddly upholstered in sailcloth including the bolster with a couple of blankets hanging over the back between the sofa and the drawingtable is a big wicker chair with broad arms and a low sloping back with its back to the light a small but stout table of teak with a round top and gate legs stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase it is the only article in the room that suggests not at all convincingly a womans hand in the furnishing the uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck

the garden to which the glass doors lead dips to the south before the landscape rises again to the hills emerging from the hollow is the cupola of an observatory between the observatory and the house is a flagstaff on a little esplanade with a hammock on the east side and a long garden seat on the west

a young lady gloved and hatted with a dust coat on is sitting in the windowseat with her body twisted to enable her to look out at the view one hand props her chin the other hangs down with a volume of the temple shakespeare in it and her finger stuck in the page she has been reading

a clock strikes six

the young lady turns and looks at her watch she rises with an air of one who waits and is almost at the end of her patience she is a pretty girl slender fair and intelligent looking nicely but not expensively dressed evidently not a smart idler

with a sigh of weary resignation she comes to the draughtsmans chair sits down and begins to read shakespeare presently the book sinks to her lap her eyes close and she dozes into a slumber

an elderly womanservant comes in from the hall with three unopened bottles of rum on a tray she passes through and disappears in the pantry without noticing the young lady she places the bottles on the shelf and fills her tray with empty bottles as she returns with these the young lady lets her book drop awakening herself and startling the womanservant so that she all but lets the tray fall

the womanservant
god bless us the young lady picks up the book and places it on the table sorry to wake you miss im sure but you are a stranger to me what might you be waiting here for now

the young lady
waiting for somebody to show some signs of knowing that i have been invited here

the womanservant
oh youre invited are you and has nobody come dear dear

the young lady
a wildlooking old gentleman came and looked in at the window and i heard him calling out nurse there is a young and attractive female waiting in the poop go and see what she wants are you the nurse
the womanservant
yes miss im nurse guinness that was old captain shotover mrs hushabyes father i heard him roaring but i thought it was for something else i suppose it was mrs hushabye that invited you ducky

the young lady
i understood her to do so but really i think id better go

nurse guinness
oh dont think of such a thing miss if mrs hushabye has forgotten all about it it will be a pleasant surprise for her to see you wont it

the young lady
it has been a very unpleasant surprise to me to find that nobody expects me

nurse guinness
youll get used to it miss this house is full of surprises for them that dont know our ways

captain shotover
looking in from the hall suddenly an ancient but still hardy man with an immense white beard in a reefer jacket with a whistle hanging from his neck nurse there is a holdall and a handbag on the front steps for everybody to fall over also a tennis racquet who the devil left them there

the young lady
they are mine im afraid

the captain
advancing to the drawingtable nurse who is this misguided and unfortunate young lady

nurse guinness
she says miss hessy invited her sir
the captain
and had she no friend no parents to warn her against my daughters invitations this is a pretty sort of house by heavens a young and attractive lady is invited here her luggage is left on the steps for hours and she herself is deposited in the poop and abandoned tired and starving this is our hospitality these are our manners no room ready no hot water no welcoming hostess our visitor is to sleep in the toolshed and to wash in the duckpond

nurse guinness
now its all right captain ill get the lady some tea and her room shall be ready before she has finished it to the young lady take off your hat ducky and make yourself at home she goes to the door leading to the hall

the captain
as she passes him ducky do you suppose woman that because this young lady has been insulted and neglected you have the right to address her as you address my wretched children whom you have brought up in ignorance of the commonest decencies of social intercourse

nurse guinness
never mind him doty quite unconcerned she goes out into the hall on her way to the kitchen

the captain
madam will you favor me with your name he sits down in the big wicker chair

the young lady
my name is ellie dunn

the captain
dunn i had a boatswain whose name was dunn he was originally a pirate in china he set up as a ships chandler with stores which i have every reason to believe he stole from me no doubt he became rich are you his daughter

ellie
indignant no certainly not i am proud to be able to say that though my father has not been a successful man nobody has ever had one word to say against him i think my father is the best man i have ever known

the captain
he must be greatly changed has he attained the seventh degree of concentration
ellie
i dont understand

the captain

nurse guinness
carrying the table with the teathings on it to ellies side indeed you never were more mistaken she is in england this very moment you have been told three times this week that she is coming home for a year for her health and very glad you should be to see your own daughter again after all these years

the captain
i am not glad the natural term of the affection of the human animal for its offspring is six years my daughter ariadne was born when i was fortysix i am now eightyeight if she comes i am not at home if she wants anything let her take it if she asks for me let her be informed that i am extremely old and have totally forgotten her

nurse guinness
thats no talk to offer to a young lady here ducky have some tea and dont listen to him she pours out a cup of tea

the captain
rising wrathfully now before high heaven they have given this innocent child indian tea the stuff they tan their own leather insides with he seizes the cup and the teapot and empties both into the leathern bucket

ellie
almost in tears oh please i am so tired i should have been glad of anything

nurse guinness
oh what a thing to do the poor lamb is ready to drop

the captain
you shall have some of my tea do not touch that flyblown cake nobody eats it here except the dogs he disappears into the pantry

nurse guinness
theres a man for you they say he sold himself to the devil in zanzibar before he was a captain and the older he grows the more i believe them

a womans voice
in the hall is anyone at home hesione nurse papa do come somebody and take in my luggage
thumping heard as of an umbrella on the wainscot

nurse guinness
my gracious its miss addy lady utterword mrs hushabyes sister the one i told the captain about calling coming miss coming
she carries the table back to its place by the door and is harrying out when she is intercepted by lady utterword who bursts in much flustered lady utterword a blonde is very handsome very well dressed and so precipitate in speech and action that the first impression erroneous is one of comic silliness

lady utterword
oh is that you nurse how are you you dont look a day older is nobody at home where is hesione doesnt she expect me where are the servants whose luggage is that on the steps wheres papa is everybody asleep seeing ellie oh i beg your pardon i suppose you are one of my nieces approaching her with outstretched arms come and kiss your aunt darling

ellie

nurse guinness

ellie
but the old gentleman said he would make some himself

nurse guinness

lady utterword
papa i suppose

nurse guinness
yes miss

lady utterword
vehemently dont be silly nurse dont call me miss

nurse guinness
placidly no lovey she goes out with the teatray

lady utterword
sitting down with a flounce on the sofa i know what you must feel oh this house this house i come back to it after twentythree years and it is just the same the luggage lying on the steps the servants spoilt and impossible nobody at home to receive anybody no regular meals nobody ever hungry because they are always gnawing bread and butter or munching apples and what is worse the same disorder in ideas in talk in feeling when i was a child i was used to it i had never known anything better though i was unhappy and longed all the time—oh how i longed—to be respectable to be a lady to live as others did not to have to think of everything for myself i married at nineteen to escape from it my husband is sir hastings utterword who has been governor of all the crown colonies in succession i have always been the mistress of government house i have been so happy i had forgotten that people could live like this i wanted to see my father my sister my nephews and nieces one ought to you know and i was looking forward to it and now the state of the house the way im received the casual impudence of that woman guinness our old nurse really hesione might at least have been here some preparation might have been made for me you must excuse my going on in this way but i am really very much hurt and annoyed and disillusioned and if i had realized it was to be like this i wouldnt have come i have a great mind to go away without another word she is on the point of weeping

ellie
also very miserable nobody has been here to receive me either i thought i ought to go away too but how can i lady utterword my luggage is on the steps and the station fly has gone
the captain emerges from the pantry with a tray of chinese lacquer and a very fine teaset on it he rests it provisionally on the end of the table snatches away the drawingboard which he stands on the floor against table legs and puts the tray in the space thus cleared ellie pours out a cup greedily

the captain
your tea young lady what another lady i must fetch another cup he makes for the pantry

lady utterword
rising from the sofa suffused with emotion papa dont you know me im your daughter

the captain
nonsense my daughters upstairs asleep he vanishes through the half door
lady utterword retires to the window to conceal her tears

ellie
going to her with the cup dont be so distressed have this cup of tea he is very old and very strange he has been just like that to me i know how dreadful it must be my own father is all the world to me oh im sure he didnt mean it
the captain returns with another cup

the captain
now we are complete he places it on the tray

lady utterword
hysterically papa you cant have forgotten me i am ariadne im little paddy patkins wont you kiss me she goes to him and throws her arms round his neck

the captain
woodenly enduring her embrace how can you be ariadne you are a middleaged woman well preserved madam but no longer young

lady utterword
but think of all the years and years i have been away papa i have had to grow old like other people

the captain
disengaging himself you should grow out of kissing strange men they may be striving to attain the seventh degree of concentration

lady utterword
but im your daughter you havent seen me for years

the captain
so much the worse when our relatives are at home we have to think of all their good points or it would be impossible to endure them but when they are away we console ourselves for their absence by dwelling on their vices that is how i have come to think my absent daughter ariadne a perfect fiend so do not try to ingratiate yourself here by impersonating her he walks firmly away to the other side of the room

lady utterword
ingratiating myself indeed with dignity very well papa she sits down at the drawingtable and pours out tea for herself

the captain
i am neglecting my social duties you remember dunn billy dunn

lady utterword
do you mean that villainous sailor who robbed you

the captain
introducing ellie his daughter he sits down on the sofa

ellie
protesting no—
nurse guinness returns with fresh tea

the captain
take that hogwash away do you hear

nurse
youve actually remembered about the tea to ellie oh miss he didnt forget you after all you have made an impression

the captain
gloomily youth beauty novelty they are badly wanted in this house i am excessively old hesione is only moderately young her children are not youthful

lady utterword
how can children be expected to be youthful in this house almost before we could speak we were filled with notions that might have been all very well for pagan philosophers of fifty but were certainly quite unfit for respectable people of any age

nurse
you were always for respectability miss addy

lady utterword
nurse will you please remember that i am lady utterword and not miss addy nor lovey nor darling nor doty do you hear

nurse
yes ducky all right ill tell them all they must call you my lady she takes her tray out with undisturbed placidity

lady utterword
what comfort what sense is there in having servants with no manners

ellie
rising and coming to the table to put down her empty cup lady utterword do you think mrs hushabye really expects me

lady utterword
oh dont ask me you can see for yourself that ive just arrived her only sister after twentythree years absence and it seems that i am not expected

the captain
what does it matter whether the young lady is expected or not she is welcome there are beds there is food ill find a room for her myself he makes for the door

ellie
following him to stop him oh please—he goes out lady utterword i dont know what to do your father persists in believing that my father is some sailor who robbed him

lady utterword
you had better pretend not to notice it my father is a very clever man but he always forgot things and now that he is old of course he is worse and i must warn you that it is sometimes very hard to feel quite sure that he really forgets
mrs hushabye bursts into the room tempestuously and embraces ellie she is a couple of years older than lady utterword and even better looking she has magnificent black hair eyes like the fishpools of heshbon and a nobly modelled neck short at the back and low between her shoulders in front unlike her sister she is uncorseted and dressed anyhow in a rich robe of black pile that shows off her white skin and statuesque contour

mrs hushabye
ellie my darling my pettikins kissing her how long have you been here ive been at home all the time i was putting flowers and things in your room and when i just sat down for a moment to try how comfortable the armchair was i went off to sleep papa woke me and told me you were here fancy your finding no one and being neglected and abandoned kissing her again my poor love she deposits ellie on the sofa meanwhile ariadne has left the table and come over to claim her share of attention oh youve brought someone with you introduce me

lady utterword
hesione is it possible that you dont know me

mrs hushabye
conventionally of course i remember your face quite well where have we met

lady utterword
didnt papa tell you i was here oh this is really too much she throws herself sulkily into the big chair

mrs hushabye
papa

lady utterword
yes papa our papa you unfeeling wretch rising angrily ill go straight to a hotel

mrs hushabye
seizing her by the shoulders my goodness gracious goodness you dont mean to say that youre addy

lady utterword
i certainly am addy and i dont think i can be so changed that you would not have recognized me if you had any real affection for me and papa didnt think me even worth mentioning

mrs hushabye
what a lark sit down she pushes her back into the chair instead of kissing her and posts herself behind it you do look a swell youre much handsomer than you used to be youve made the acquaintance of ellie of course she is going to marry a perfect hog of a millionaire for the sake of her father who is as poor as a church mouse and you must help me to stop her

ellie
oh please hesione

mrs hushabye
my pettikins the mans coming here today with your father to begin persecuting you and everybody will see the state of the case in ten minutes so whats the use of making a secret of it

ellie
he is not a hog hesione you dont know how wonderfully good he was to my father and how deeply grateful i am to him

mrs hushabye to lady utterword her father is a very remarkable man addy his name is mazzini dunn mazzini was a celebrity of some kind who knew ellies grandparents they were both poets like the brownings and when her father came into the world mazzini said another soldier born for freedom so they christened him mazzini and he has been fighting for freedom in his quiet way ever since thats why he is so poor

ellie
i am proud of his poverty

mrs hushabye
of course you are pettikins why not leave him in it and marry someone you love

lady utterword
rising suddenly and explosively hesione are you going to kiss me or are you not

mrs hushabye
what do you want to be kissed for

lady utterword
i dont want to be kissed but i do want you to behave properly and decently we are sisters we have been separated for twentythree years you ought to kiss me

mrs hushabye
tomorrow morning dear before you make up i hate the smell of powder

lady utterword
oh you unfeeling—she is interrupted by the return of the captain

the captain
to ellie your room is ready ellie rises the sheets were damp but i have changed them he makes for the garden door on the port side

lady utterword
oh what about my sheets

the captain
halting at the door take my advice air them or take them off and sleep in blankets you shall sleep in ariadnes old room

lady utterword
indeed i shall do nothing of the sort that little hole i am entitled to the best spare room

the captain
continuing unmoved she married a numskull she told me she would marry anyone to get away from home

ladt utterword
you are pretending not to know me on purpose i will leave the house
mazzini dunn enters from the hall he is a little elderly man with bulging credulous eyes and earnest manners he is dressed in a blue serge jacket suit with an unbuttoned mackintosh over it and carries a soft black hat of clerical cut

ellie
at last captain shotover here is my father

the captain
this nonsense not a bit like him he goes away through the garden shutting the door sharply behind him

lady utterword
i will not be ignored and pretended to be somebody else i will have it out with papa now this instant to mazzini excuse me she follows the captain out making a hasty bow to mazzini who returns it

mrs hushabye
hospitably shaking hands how good of you to come mr dunn you dont mind papa do you he is as mad as a hatter you know but quite harmless and extremely clever you will have some delightful talks with him

mazzini
i hope so to ellie so here you are ellie dear he draws her arm affectionately through his i must thank you mrs hushabye for your kindness to my daughter im afraid she would have had no holiday if you had not invited her

mrs hushabye
not at all very nice of her to come and attract young people to the house for us

mazzini
smiling im afraid ellie is not interested in young men mrs hushabye her taste is on the graver solider side

mrs hushabye
with a sudden rather hard brightness in her manner wont you take off your overcoat mr dunn you will find a cupboard for coats and hats and things in the corner of the hall

mazzini
hastily releasing ellie yes—thank you—i had better— he goes out

mrs hushabye
emphatically the old brute

ellie
who

mrs hushabye
who him he it pointing after mazzini graver solider tastes indeed

ellie
aghast you dont mean that you were speaking like that of my father

mrs hushabye
i was you know i was

ellie
with dignity i will leave your house at once she turns to the door

mrs hushabye
if you attempt it ill tell your father why

ellie
turning again oh how can you treat a visitor like this mrs hushabye

mrs hushabye
i thought you were going to call me hesione

ellie
certainly not now

mrs hushabye
very well ill tell your father

ellie
distressed oh

mrs hushabye
if you turn a hair—if you take his part against me and against your own heart for a moment ill give that born soldier of freedom a piece of my mind that will stand him on his selfish old head for a week

ellie hesione
my father selfish how little you know—
she is interrupted by mazzini who returns excited and perspiring

mazzini
ellie mangan has come i thought youd like to know excuse me mrs hushabye the strange old gentleman—

mrs hushabye
papa quite so

mazzini
oh i beg your pardon of course i was a little confused by his manner he is making mangan help him with something in the garden and he wants me too—
a powerful whistle is heard

the captains voice
bosun ahoy the whistle is repeated

mazzini
flustered oh dear i believe he is whistling for me he hurries out

mrs hushabye
now my father is a wonderful man if you like

ellie
hesione listen to me you dont understand my father and mr mangan were boys together mr ma—

mrs hushabye
i dont care what they were we must sit down if you are going to begin as far back as that she snatches at ellies waist and makes her sit down on the sofa beside her now pettikins tell me all about mr mangan they call him boss mangan dont they he is a napoleon of industry and disgustingly rich isnt he why isnt your father rich

ellie
my poor father should never have been in business his parents were poets and they gave him the noblest ideas but they could not afford to give him a profession

mrs hushabye
fancy your grandparents with their eyes in fine frenzy rolling and so your poor father had to go into business hasnt he succeeded in it

ellie
he always used to say he could succeed if he only had some capital he fought his way along to keep a roof over our heads and bring us up well but it was always a struggle always the same difficulty of not having capital enough i dont know how to describe it to you

mrs hushabye
poor ellie i know pulling the devil by the tail

ellie
hurt oh no not like that it was at least dignified

mrs hushabye
that made it all the harder didnt it i shouldnt have pulled the devil by the tail with dignity i should have pulled hard—between her teeth hard well go on

ellie
at last it seemed that all our troubles were at an end mr mangan did an extraordinarily noble thing out of pure friendship for my father and respect for his character he asked him how much capital he wanted and gave it to him i dont mean that he lent it to him or that he invested it in his business he just simply made him a present of it wasnt that splendid of him

mrs hushabye
on condition that you married him

ellie
oh no no no this was when i was a child he had never even seen me he never came to our house it was absolutely disinterested pure generosity

mrs hushabye
oh i beg the gentlemans pardon well what became of the money

ellie
we all got new clothes and moved into another house and i went to another school for two years

mrs hushabye
only two years

ellie
that was all for at the end of two years my father was utterly ruined

mrs hushabye
how

ellie
i dont know i never could understand but it was dreadful when we were poor my father had never been in debt but when he launched out into business on a large scale he had to incur liabilities when the business went into liquidation he owed more money than mr mangan had given him

mrs hushabye
bit off more than he could chew i suppose

ellie
i think you are a little unfeeling about it

mrs hushabye
my pettikins you mustnt mind my way of talking i was quite as sensitive and particular as you once but i have picked up so much slang from the children that i am really hardly presentable i suppose your father had no head for business and made a mess of it

ellie
oh that just shows how entirely you are mistaken about him the business turned out a great success it now pays fortyfour per cent after deducting the excess profits tax

mrs hushabye
then why arent you rolling in money

ellie
i dont know it seems very unfair to me you see my father was made bankrupt it nearly broke his heart because he had persuaded several of his friends to put money into the business he was sure it would succeed and events proved that he was quite right but they all lost their money it was dreadful i dont know what we should have done but for mr mangan

mrs hushabye
what did the boss come to the rescue again after all his money being thrown away

ellie
he did indeed and never uttered a reproach to my father he bought what was left of the business—the buildings and the machinery and things—from the official trustee for enough money to enable my father to pay sixandeightpence in the pound and get his discharge everyone pitied papa so much and saw so plainly that he was an honorable man that they let him off at sixandeightpence instead of ten shillings then mr mangan started a company to take up the business and made my father a manager in it to save us from starvation for i wasnt earning anything then

mrs hushabye
quite a romance and when did the boss develop the tender passion

ellie
oh that was years after quite lately he took the chair one night at a sort of peoples concert i was singing there as an amateur you know half a guinea for expenses and three songs with three encores he was so pleased with my singing that he asked might he walk home with me i never saw anyone so taken aback as he was when i took him home and introduced him to my father his own manager it was then that my father told me how nobly he had behaved of course it was considered a great chance for me as he is so rich and—and—we drifted into a sort of understanding—i suppose i should call it an engagement—she is distressed and cannot go on

mrs hushabye
rising and marching about you may have drifted into it but you will bounce out of it my pettikins if i am to have anything to do with it

ellie
hopelessly no its no use i am bound in honor and gratitude i will go through with it

mrs hushabye
behind the sofa scolding down at her you know of course that its not honorable or grateful to marry a man you dont love do you love this mangan man

ellie
yes at least—

mrs hushabye
i dont want to know about at least i want to know the worst girls of your age fall in love with all sorts of impossible people especially old people

ellie
i like mr mangan very much and i shall always be—

mrs hushabye
impatiently completing the sentence and prancing away intolerantly to starboard —grateful to him for his kindness to dear father i know anybody else

ellie
what do you mean

mrs hushabye
anybody else are you in love with anybody else

ellie
of course not

mrs hushabye
humph the book on the drawingtable catches her eye she picks it up and evidently finds the title very unexpected she looks at ellie and asks quaintly quite sure youre not in love with an actor

ellie
no no why what put such a thing into your head

mrs hushabye
this is yours isnt it why else should you be reading othello

ellie
my father taught me to love shakespeare

mrs hushaye
flinging the book down on the table really your father does seem to be about the limit

ellie
naively do you never read shakespeare hesione that seems to me so extraordinary i like othello

mrs hushabye
do you indeed he was jealous wasnt he

ellie
oh not that i think all the part about jealousy is horrible but dont you think it must have been a wonderful experience for desdemona brought up so quietly at home to meet a man who had been out in the world doing all sorts of brave things and having terrible adventures and yet finding something in her that made him love to sit and talk with her and tell her about them

mrs hushabye
thats your idea of romance is it

ellie
not romance exactly it might really happen
ellies eyes show that she is not arguing but in a daydream mrs hushabye watching her inquisitively goes deliberately back to the sofa and resumes her seat beside her

mrs hushabye
ellie darling have you noticed that some of those stories that othello told desdemona couldnt have happened—

ellie
oh no shakespeare thought they could have happened

mrs hushabye
hm desdemona thought they could have happened but they didnt

ellie
why do you look so enigmatic about it you are such a sphinx i never know what you mean

mrs hushabye
desdemona would have found him out if she had lived you know i wonder was that why he strangled her

ellie
othello was not telling lies

mrs hushabye
how do you know

ellie
shakespeare would have said if he was hesione there are men who have done wonderful things men like othello only of course white and very handsome and—

mrs hushabye
ah now were coming to it tell me all about him i knew there must be somebody or youd never have been so miserable about mangan youd have thought it quite a lark to marry him

ellie
blushing vividly hesione you are dreadful but i dont want to make a secret of it though of course i dont tell everybody besides i dont know him

mrs hushabye
dont know him what does that mean

ellie
well of course i know him to speak to

mrs hushabye
but you want to know him ever so much more intimately eh

ellie
no no i know him quite—almost intimately

mrs hushabye
you dont know him and you know him almost intimately how lucid

ellie
i mean that he does not call on us i—i got into conversation with him by chance at a concert

mrs hushabye
you seem to have rather a gay time at your concerts ellie

ellie
not at all we talk to everyone in the greenroom waiting for our turns i thought he was one of the artists he looked so splendid but he was only one of the committee i happened to tell him that i was copying a picture at the national gallery i make a little money that way i cant paint much but as its always the same picture i can do it pretty quickly and get two or three pounds for it it happened that he came to the national gallery one day

mrs hushabye
one students day paid sixpence to stumble about through a crowd of easels when he might have come in next day for nothing and found the floor clear quite by accident

ellie
triumphantly no on purpose he liked talking to me he knows lots of the most splendid people fashionable women who are all in love with him but he ran away from them to see me at the national gallery and persuade me to come with him for a drive round richmond park in a taxi

mrs hushabye
my pettikins you have been going it its wonderful what you good girls can do without anyone saying a word

ellie
i am not in society hesione if i didnt make acquaintances in that way i shouldnt have any at all

mrs hushabye
well no harm if you know how to take care of yourself may i ask his name

ellie
slowly and musically marcus darnley

mrs hushabye
echoing the music marcus darnley what a splendid name

ellie oh im so glad you think so i think so too but i was afraid it was only a silly fancy of my own

mrs hushabye
hm is he one of the aberdeen darnleys

ellie
nobody knows just fancy he was found in an antique chest—

mrs hushabye
a what

ellie
an antique chest one summer morning in a rose garden after a night of the most terrible thunderstorm

mrs hushabye
what on earth was he doing in the chest did he get into it because he was afraid of the lightning

ellie
oh no no he was a baby the name marcus darnley was embroidered on his baby clothes and five hundred pounds in gold

mrs hushabye
looking hard at her ellie

ellie
the garden of the viscount—

mrs hushabye
—de rougemont

ellie
innocently no de larochejaquelin a french family a vicomte his life has been one long romance a tiger—

mrs hushabye
slain by his own hand

ellie
oh no nothing vulgar like that he saved the life of the tiger from a hunting party one of king edwards hunting parties in india the king was furious that was why he never had his military services properly recognized but he doesnt care he is a socialist and despises rank and has been in three revolutions fighting on the barricades

mrs hushabye
how can you sit there telling me such lies you ellie of all people and i thought you were a perfectly simple straightforward good girl

ellie
rising dignified but very angry do you mean you dont believe me

mrs hushabye
of course i dont believe you youre inventing every word of it do you take me for a fool
ellie stares at her her candor is so obvious that mrs hushabye is puzzled

ellie
goodbye hesione im very sorry i see now that it sounds very improbable as i tell it but i cant stay if you think that way about me
mrs hushabye catching her dress you shant go i couldnt be so mistaken i know too well what liars are like somebody has really told you all this

ellie
flushing hesione dont say that you dont believe him i couldnt bear that

mrs hushabye
soothing her of course i believe him dearest but you should have broken it to me by degrees drawing her back to her seat now tell me all about him are you in love with him

ellie
oh no im not so foolish i dont fall in love with people im not so silly as you think

mrs hushabye
i see only something to think about—to give some interest and pleasure to life

ellie
just so thats all really

mrs hushabye
it makes the hours go fast doesnt it no tedious waiting to go to sleep at nights and wondering whether you will have a bad night how delightful it makes waking up in the morning how much better than the happiest dream all life transfigured no more wishing one had an interesting book to read because life is so much happier than any book no desire but to be alone and not to have to talk to anyone to be alone and just think about it

ellie
embracing her hesione you are a witch how do you know oh you are the most sympathetic woman in the world

mrs hushabye
caressing her pettikins my pettikins how i envy you and how i pity you

ellie
pity me oh why
a very handsome man of fifty with mousquetaire moustaches wearing a rather dandified curly brimmed hat and carrying an elaborate walkingstick comes into the room from the hall and stops short at sight of the women on the sofa

ellie
seeing him and rising in glad surprise oh hesione this is mr marcus darnley

mrs hushabye
rising what a lark he is my husband

ellie
but now—she stops suddenly then turns pale and sways

mrs hushabye
catching her and sitting down with her on the sofa steady my pettikins

the man
with a mixture of confusion and effrontery depositing his hat and stick on the teak table my real name miss dunn is hector hushabye i leave you to judge whether that is a name any sensitive man would care to confess to i never use it when i can possibly help it i have been away for nearly a month and i had no idea you knew my wife or that you were coming here i am none the less delighted to find you in our little house

ellie
in great distress i dont know what to do please may i speak to papa do leave me i cant bear it

mrs hushabye
be off hector

hector
i—

mrs hushabye
quick quick get out

hector
if you think it better—he goes out taking his hat with him but leaving the stick on the table

mrs hushabye
laying ellie down at the end of the sofa now pettikins he is gone theres nobody but me you can let yourself go dont try to control yourself have a good cry

ellie
raising her head damn

mrs hushabye
splendid oh what a relief i thought you were going to be brokenhearted never mind me damn him again

ellie
i am not damning him i am damning myself for being such a fool rising how could i let myself be taken in so she begins prowling to and fro her bloom gone looking curiously older and harder

mrs hushabye
cheerfully why not pettikins very few young women can resist hector i couldnt when i was your age he is really rather splendid you know

ellie
turning on her splendid yes splendid looking of course but how can you love a liar

mrs hushabye
i dont know but you can fortunately otherwise there wouldnt be much love in the world

ellie
but to lie like that to be a boaster a coward

mrs hushabye
rising in alarm pettikins none of that if you please if you hint the slightest doubt of hectors courage he will go straight off and do the most horribly dangerous things to convince himself that he isnt a coward he has a dreadful trick of getting out of one thirdfloor window and coming in at another just to test his nerve he has a whole drawerful of albert medals for saving peoples lives

ellie
he never told me that

mrs hushabye
he never boasts of anything he really did he cant bear it and it makes him shy if anyone else does all his stories are madeup stories

ellie
coming to her do you mean that he is really brave and really has adventures and yet tells lies about things that he never did and that never happened

mrs hushabye
yes pettikins i do people dont have their virtues and vices in sets they have them anyhow all mixed

ellie
staring at her thoughtfully theres something odd about this house hesione and even about you i dont know why im talking to you so calmly i have a horrible fear that my heart is broken but that heartbreak is not like what i thought it must be

mrs hushabye
fondling her its only life educating you pettikins how do you feel about boss mangan now

ellie
disengaging herself with an expression of distaste oh how can you remind me of him hesione

mrs hushabye
sorry dear i think i hear hector coming back you dont mind now do you dear

ellie
not in the least i am quite cured
mazzini dunn and hector come in from the hall

hector
as he opens the door and allows mazzini to pass in one second more and she would have been a dead woman

mazzini
dear dear what an escape ellie my love mr hushabye has just been telling me the most extraordinary—

ellie
yes ive heard it she crosses to the other side of the room

hector
following her not this one ill tell it to you after dinner i think youll like it the truth is i made it up for you and was looking forward to the pleasure of telling it to you but in a moment of impatience at being turned out of the room i threw it away on your father

ellie
turning at bay with her back to the carpenters bench scornfully selfpossessed it was not thrown away he believes it i should not have believed it

mazzini
benevolently ellie is very naughty mr hushabye of course she does not really think that he goes to the bookshelves and inspects the titles of the volumes
boss mangan comes in from the hall followed by the captain mangan carefully frockcoated as for church or for a dihectors meeting is about fiftyfive with a careworn mistrustful expression standing a little on an entirely imaginary dignity with a dull complexion straight lustreless hair and features so entirely commonplace that it is impossible to describe them

captain shotover
to mrs hushabye introducing the newcomer says his name is mangan not ablebodied

mrs hushabye
graciously how do you do mr mangan

mangan
shaking hands very pleased

captain shotover
dunns lost his muscle but recovered his nerve men seldom do after three attacks of delirium tremens he goes into the pantry

mrs hushabye
i congratulate you mr dunn

mazzini
dazed i am a lifelong teetotaler

mrs hushabye
you will find it far less trouble to let papa have his own way than try to explain

mazzini
but three attacks of delirium tremens really

mrs hushabye
to mangan do you know my husband mr mangan she indicates hector

mangan
going to hector who meets him with outstretched hand very pleased turning to ellie i hope miss ellie you have not found the journey down too fatiguing they shake hands

captain shotover

mangan
she doesnt think so

captain
shotover she does

mangan
older men than i have—

captain shotover
finishing the sentence for him—made fools of themselves that also is true

mangan
asserting himself i dont see that this is any business of yours

captain shotover
it is everybodys business the stars in their courses are shaken when such things happen

mangan
im going to marry her all the same

captain shotover
how do you know

mangan
playing the strong man i intend to i mean to see i never made up my mind to do a thing yet that i didnt bring it off thats the sort of man i am and there will be a better understanding between us when you make up your mind to that captain

captain shotover
you frequent picture palaces

mangan
perhaps i do who told you

captain shotover
talk like a man not like a movie you mean that you make a hundred thousand a year

mangan
i dont boast but when i meet a man that makes a hundred thousand a year i take off my hat to that man and stretch out my hand to him and call him brother

captain shotover
then you also make a hundred thousand a year hey

mangan no
i cant say that fifty thousand perhaps

captain shotover
his half brother only he turns away from mangan with his usual abruptness and collects the empty teacups on the chinese tray

mangan
irritated see here captain shotover i dont quite understand my position here i came here on your daughters invitation am i in her house or in yours

captain shotover
you are beneath the dome of heaven in the house of god what is true within these walls is true outside them go out on the seas climb the mountains wander through the valleys she is still too young

mangan

mangan
following him to the half door what pirates child what are you talking about

captain shotover

mangan

captain shotover
emerging my daughter he makes for the door leading to the hall

mangan
well i am damned

captain shotover
i thought so i was too for many years the negress redeemed me

mangan
feebly this is queer i ought to walk out of this house

captain shotover
why

mangan
well many men would be offended by your style of talking

captain shotover
nonsense its the other sort of talking that makes quarrels nobody ever quarrels with me
a gentleman whose firstrate tailoring and frictionless manners proclaim the wellbred west ender comes in from the hall he has an engaging air of being young and unmarried but on close inspection is found to be at least over forty

the gentleman
excuse my intruding in this fashion but there is no knocker on the door and the bell does not seem to ring

captain shotover
why should there be a knocker why should the bell ring the door is open

the gentleman
precisely so i ventured to come in

captain shotover
quite right i will see about a room for you he makes for the door

the gentleman
stopping him but im afraid you dont know who i am

captain shotover
do you suppose that at my age i make distinctions between one fellow creature and another he goes out mangan and the newcomer stare at one another

mangan

captain shotover
shouting outside hesione another person has arrived and wants a room man about town well dressed fifty

captain shotover

the gentleman

captain shotover
yes she said shed marry anybody to get away from this house i should not have recognized you your head is no longer like a walnut your aspect is softened you have been boiled in bread and milk for years and years like other married men poor devil he disappears into the pantry

mrs hushabye

the gentleman

lady utterword

randall

randall

mrs hushabye
what is wrong with mr randall addy

lady utterword
recollecting herself oh nothing but he has no right to come bothering you and papa without being invited she goes to the windowseat and sits down turning away from them illhumoredly and looking into the garden where hector and ellie are now seen strolling together

mrs hushabye

lady utterword

lady utterword
with marked interest who is that gentleman walking in the garden with miss dunn

mrs hushabye

mrs hushabye

mrs hushabye

gratefully thank you hector they shake hands cordially
mazzini dunn is seen crossing the garden from starboard to port

captain shotover
coming from the pantry and addressing ellie your father has washed himself

ellie
quite selfpossessed he often does captain shotover

captain shotover
a strange conversion i saw him through the pantry window
mazzini dunn enters through the port window door newly washed and brushed and stops smiling benevolently between mangan and mrs hushabye

mrs hushabye
introducing mr mazzini dunn lady ut—oh i forgot youve met indicating ellie miss dunn

mazzini
walking across the room to take ellies hand and beaming at his own naughty irony i have met miss dunn also she is my daughter he draws her arm through his caressingly

mrs hushabye of course how stupid mr utterword my sisters—er—

randall
shaking hands agreeably her brotherinlaw mr dunn how do you do

mrs hushabye

hector
we have met dear dont introduce us any more he moves away to the big chair and adds wont you sit down lady utterword she does so very graciously

mrs hushabye
sorry i hate it its like making people show their tickets

mazzini
sententiously how little it tells us after all the great question is not who we are but what we are

captain shotover
ha what are you

mazzini
taken aback what am i

captain shotover
a thief a pirate and a murderer

mazzini
i assure you you are mistaken

captain shotover
an adventurous life but what does it end in respectability a ladylike daughter the language and appearance of a city missionary let it be a warning to all of you he goes out through the garden

dunn
i hope nobody here believes that i am a thief a pirate or a murderer mrs hushabye will you excuse me a moment i must really go and explain he follows the captain

mrs hushabye
as he goes its no use youd really better— but dunn has vanished we had better all go out and look for some tea we never have regular tea but you can always get some when you want the servants keep it stewing all day the kitchen veranda is the best place to ask may i show you she goes to the starboard door

randall
going with her thank you i dont think ill take any tea this afternoon but if you will show me the garden—

mrs hushabye
theres nothing to see in the garden except papas observatory and a gravel pit with a cave where he keeps dynamite and things of that sort however its pleasanter out of doors so come along

randall
dynamite isnt that rather risky

mrs hushabye
well we dont sit in the gravel pit when theres a thunderstorm

lady utterorrd
thats something new what is the dynamite for

hector
to blow up the human race if it goes too far he is trying to discover a psychic ray that will explode all the explosive at the well of a mahatma

ellie
the captains tea is delicious mr utterword

mrs hushabye
stopping in the doorway do you mean to say that youve had some of my fathers tea that you got round him before you were ten minutes in the house

ellie
i did

mrs hushabye
you little devil she goes out with randall

mangan
wont you come miss ellie

ellie
im too tired ill take a book up to my room and rest a little she goes to the bookshelf

mangan
right you cant do better but im disappointed he follows randall and mrs hushabye
ellie hector and lady utterword are left hector is close to lady utterword they look at ellie waiting for her to go

ellie
looking at the title of a book do you like stories of adventure lady utterword

lady utterword
patronizingly of course dear

ellie
then ill leave you to mr hushabye she goes out through the hall

hector
that girl is mad about tales of adventure the lies i have to tell her

lady utterword
not interested in ellie when you saw me what did you mean by saying that you thought and then stopping short what did you think

hector
folding his arms and looking down at her magnetically may i tell you

lady utterword
of course

hector
it will not sound very civil i was on the point of saying i thought you were a plain woman

lady utterword
oh for shame hector what right had you to notice whether i am plain or not

hector
listen to me ariadne until today i have seen only photographs of you and no photograph can give the strange fascination of the daughters of that supernatural old man there is some damnable quality in them that destroys mens moral sense and carries them beyond honor and dishonor you know that dont you

lady utterword
perhaps i do hector but let me warn you once for all that i am a rigidly conventional woman you may think because im a shotover that im a bohemian because we are all so horribly bohemian but im not i hate and loathe bohemianism no child brought up in a strict puritan household ever suffered from puritanism as i suffered from our bohemianism

hector
our children are like that they spend their holidays in the houses of their respectable schoolfellows

lady utterword
i shall invite them for christmas

hector
their absence leaves us both without our natural chaperones

lady utterword
children are certainly very inconvenient sometimes but intelligent people can always manage unless they are bohemians

hector
you are no bohemian but you are no puritan either your attraction is alive and powerful what sort of woman do you count yourself

lady utterword
i am a woman of the world hector and i can assure you that if you will only take the trouble always to do the perfectly correct thing and to say the perfectly correct thing you can do just what you like an illconducted careless woman gets simply no chance an illconducted careless man is never allowed within arms length of any woman worth knowing

hector
i see you are neither a bohemian woman nor a puritan woman you are a dangerous woman

lady utterword
on the contrary i am a safe woman

hector
you are a most accursedly attractive woman mind i am not making love to you i do not like being attracted but you had better know how i feel if you are going to stay here

lady utterword
you are an exceedingly clever ladykiller hector and terribly handsome i am quite a good player myself at that game is it quite understood that we are only playing

hector
quite i am deliberately playing the fool out of sheer worthlessness

lady utterword
rising brightly well you are my brotherinlaw hesione asked you to kiss me he seizes her in his arms and kisses her strenuously oh that was a little more than play brotherinlaw she pushes him suddenly away you shall not do that again

hector
in effect you got your claws deeper into me than i intended

mrs hubhabye
coming in from the garden dont let me disturb you i only want a cap to put on daddiest the sun is setting and hell catch cold she makes for the door leading to the hall

lady utterword
your husband is quite charming darling he has actually condescended to kiss me at last i shall go into the garden its cooler now she goes out by the port door

mrs hushabye
take care dear child i dont believe any man can kiss addy without falling in love with her she goes into the hall

hector
striking himself on the chest fool goat
mrs hushabye comes back with the captains cap

hector
your sister is an extremely enterprising old girl wheres miss dunn

mrs hushabye
mangan says she has gone up to her room for a nap addy wont let you talk to ellie she has marked you for her own

hector
she has the diabolical family fascination i began making love to her automatically what am i to do i cant fall in love and i cant hurt a womans feelings by telling her so when she falls in love with me and as women are always falling in love with my moustache i get landed in all sorts of tedious and terrifying flirtations in which im not a bit in earnest

mrs hushabye
oh neither is addy she has never been in love in her life though she has always been trying to fall in head over ears she is worse than you because you had one real go at least with me

hector
that was a confounded madness i cant believe that such an amazing experience is common it has left its mark on me i believe that is why i have never been able to repeat it

mrs hushabye
laughing and caressing his arm we were frightfully in love with one another hector it was such an enchanting dream that i have never been able to grudge it to you or anyone else since i have invited all sorts of pretty women to the house on the chance of giving you another turn but it has never come off

hector
i dont know that i want it to come off it was damned dangerous you fascinated me but i loved you so it was heaven this sister of yours fascinates me but i hate her so it is hell i shall kill her if she persists

mrs hushabye
nothing will kill addy she is as strong as a horse releasing him now i am going off to fascinate somebody

hector
the foreign office toff randall

mrs hushabye
goodness gracious no why should i fascinate him

hector
i presume you dont mean the bloated capitalist mangan

mrs hushabye
hm i think he had better be fascinated by me than by ellie she is going into the garden when the captain comes in from it with some sticks in his hand what have you got there daddiest

captain shotover
dynamite

mrs hushabye
youve been to the gravel pit dont drop it about the house theres a dear she goes into the garden where the evening light is now very red

hector
listen o sage how long dare you concentrate on a feeling without risking having it fixed in your consciousness all the rest of your life

captain shotover
ninety minutes an hour and a half he goes into the pantry
hector left alone contracts his brows and falls into a daydream he does not move for some time then he folds his arms then throwing his hands behind him and gripping one with the other he strides tragically once to and fro suddenly he snatches his walking stick from the teak table and draws it for it is a swordstick he fights a desperate duel with an imaginary antagonist and after many vicissitudes runs him through the body up to the hilt he sheathes his sword and throws it on the sofa falling into another reverie as he does so he looks straight into the eyes of an imaginary woman seizes her by the arms and says in a deep and thrilling tone do you love me the captain comes out of the pantry at this moment and hector caught with his arms stretched out and his fists clenched has to account for his attitude by going through a series of gymnastic exercises

captain shotover
that sort of strength is no good you will never be as strong as a gorilla

hector
what is the dynamite for

captain shotover
to kill fellows like mangan

hector
no use they will always be able to buy more dynamite than you

captain shotover
i will make a dynamite that he cannot explode

hector
and that you can eh

captain shotover
yes when i have attained the seventh degree of concentration

hector
whats the use of that you never do attain it

captain shotover
what then is to be done are we to be kept forever in the mud by these hogs to whom the universe is nothing but a machine for greasing their bristles and filling their snouts

hector
are mangans bristles worse than randalls lovelocks

captain shotover
we must win powers of life and death over them both i refuse to die until i have invented the means

hector
who are we that we should judge them

captain shotover
what are they that they should judge us yet they do unhesitatingly there is enmity between our seed and their seed they know it and act on it strangling our souls they believe in themselves when we believe in ourselves we shall kill them

hector
it is the same seed you forget that your pirate has a very nice daughter mangans son may be a plato randalls a shelley what was my father

captain shotover
the damnedst scoundrel i ever met he replaces the drawingboard sits down at the table and begins to mix a wash of color

hector
precisely well dare you kill his innocent grandchildren

captain shotover
they are mine also

hector
just so—we are members one of another he throws himself carelessly on the sofa i tell you i have often thought of this killing of human vermin many men have thought of it decent men are like daniel in the lions den their survival is a miracle and they do not always survive we live among the mangans and randalls and billie dunns as they poor devils live among the disease germs and the doctors and the lawyers and the parsons and the restaurant chefs and the tradesmen and the servants and all the rest of the parasites and blackmailers what are our terrors to theirs give me the power to kill them and ill spare them in sheer—

captain shotover
cutting in sharply fellow feeling

hector no
i should kill myself if i believed that i must believe that my spark small as it is is divine and that the red light over their door is hell fire i should spare them in simple magnanimous pity

captain shotover
you cant spare them until you have the power to kill them at present they have the power to kill you there are millions of blacks over the water for them to train and let loose on us theyre going to do it theyre doing it already

hector
they are too stupid to use their power

captain shotover
throwing down his brush and coming to the end of the sofa do not deceive yourself they do use it we kill the better half of ourselves every day to propitiate them the knowledge that these people are there to render all our aspirations barren prevents us having the aspirations and when we are tempted to seek their destruction they bring forth demons to delude us disguised as pretty daughters and singers and poets and the like for whose sake we spare them

hector
sitting up and leaning towards him may not hesione be such a demon brought forth by you lest i should slay you

captain shotover
that is possible she has used you up and left you nothing but dreams as some women do

hector
vampire women demon women

captain shotover
men think the world well lost for them and lose it accordingly who are the men that do things the husbands of the shrew and of the drunkard the men with the thorn in the flesh walking distractedly away towards the pantry i must think these things out turning suddenly but i go on with the dynamite none the less i will discover a ray mightier than any xray a mind ray that will explode the ammunition in the belt of my adversary before he can point his gun at me and i must hurry i am old i have no time to waste in talk he is about to go into the pantry and hector is making for the hall when hesione comes back

mrs hushabye
daddiest you and hector must come and help me to entertain all these people what on earth were you shouting about

hector
stopping in the act of turning the door handle he is madder than usual

mrs hushabye
we all are

hector
i must change he resumes his door opening

mrs hushabye
stop stop come back both of you come back they return reluctantly money is running short

hector
money where are my april dividends

mrs hushabye
where is the snow that fell last year

captain shotover
where is all the money you had for that patent lifeboat i invented

mrs hushabye
five hundred pounds and i have made it last since easter

captain shotover
since easter barely four months monstrous extravagance i could live for seven years on 500 pounds

mrs hushabye
not keeping open house as we do here daddiest

captain shotover
only 500 pounds for that lifeboat i got twelve thousand for the invention before that

mrs hushabye
yes dear but that was for the ship with the magnetic keel that sucked up submarines living at the rate we do you cannot afford lifesaving inventions cant you think of something that will murder half europe at one bang

captain shotover
no i am ageing fast my mind does not dwell on slaughter as it did when i was a boy why doesnt your husband invent something he does nothing but tell lies to women

hector
well that is a form of invention is it not however you are right i ought to support my wife

mrs hushabye
indeed you shall do nothing of the sort i should never see you from breakfast to dinner i want my husband

hector
bitterly i might as well be your lapdog

mrs hushabye
do you want to be my breadwinner like the other poor husbands

hector
no by thunder what a damned creature a husband is anyhow

mrs hushabye
to the captain what about that harpoon cannon

captain shotover
no use it kills whales not men

mrs hushabye
why not you fire the harpoon out of a cannon it sticks in the enemys general you wind him in and there you are

hector
you are your fathers daughter hesione

captain shotover
there is something in it not to wind in generals they are not dangerous but one could fire a grapnel and wind in a machine gun or even a tank i will think it out

mrs hushabye
squeezing the captains arm affectionately saved you are a darling daddiest now we must go back to these dreadful people and entertain them

captain shotover
they have had no dinner dont forget that

hector
neither have i and it is dark it must be all hours

mrs hushabye
oh guinness will produce some sort of dinner for them the servants always take jolly good care that there is food in the house

captain shotover
raising a strange wail in the darkness what a house what a daughter

mrs hushabye
raving what a father

hector
following suit what a husband

captain shotover
is there no thunder in heaven

hector
is there no beauty no bravery on earth

mrs hushabye
what do men want they have their food their firesides their clothes mended and our love at the end of the day why are they not satisfied why do they envy us the pain with which we bring them into the world and make strange dangers and torments for themselves to be even with us

captain shotover
weirdly chanting

                i builded a house for my daughters and opened the doors
                thereof
                that men might come for their choosing and their betters
                spring from their love
                but one of them married a numskull

hector
taking up the rhythm

                the other a liar wed

mrs hushabye
completing the stanza

                and now must she lie beside him even as she made her bed

lady utterword
calling from the garden hesione hesione where are you

hector
the cat is on the tiles

mrs hushabye
coming darling coming she goes quickly into the garden
the captain goes back to his place at the table

hector
going out into the hall shall i turn up the lights for you

captain shotover
no give me deeper darkness money is not made in the lightembed"
