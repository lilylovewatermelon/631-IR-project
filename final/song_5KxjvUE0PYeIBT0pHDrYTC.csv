a bad girl dont just mean good sex get weed vip
i need a bad girl who done caught the good way going for her phd

verse 1
you gon try to end up with that one rapper
club time hit up a nigga tell they after
you know the promoter you dont stand in line
parachute pants make a nigga want that hammer time
its easy yeah you see its easy
hit up the list in the party where the rest of the freaks be
dressed to the nine catch a nigga with greeen
want niggas to drop money up on three ts
i know what type of girl you are
got famous cause you pregnant you a new star
child support got you a car but your baby still hungry like oohaah

see me in that new whip going crazy
top write of the papers she gon wanna date me
im from where they made that shit up
trying to gang me we gon break that shit up
and if you fell we gone hang that shit up
before i fuck and make you leave rake that shit up
explosive young nigga with a lot of dollars
if we was back in high school would you wanna holler
gucci louis shirts everything collared
and you look beauty til you hit the parlor
you like yall niggas getting fade but you are not the barber
most of these ballers you be picking dont even be starters

hook
a bad girl dont just mean good sex get weed vip
i need a bad girl who done caught the good way going for her phd
i want a bad girl

i want a bad girl

i want a bad girl
i want a bad girl
