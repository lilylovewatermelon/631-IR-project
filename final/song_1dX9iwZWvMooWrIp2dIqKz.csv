youre a tough tailgunner in a pitch black chevy
cruising in the moonlight
ooh your aim is steady
your eyes are hungry and your hands are ready
you shot me where you wanted
you put me in a daze
no matter where you go youll always be a stranger
getting into trouble getting off on danger
riding out of town like a cool lone ranger
when theres nothing to lose you gotta call your own plays

refrain
did anybody say something incredibly stupid
like there isnt any paradise
but i remember the songs and i remember the story
i remember the thrills and i remember the glory

prechorus
so hold me  hold me in your arms
deliver me from growing old
hold me  hold me in your arms
shelter me from going cold
im a shot in the dark without you
a rebel without a clue

rebel without a clue
i dont know what to say and i dont know what to do
standing on the corner in my boots and my leather
a little over the edge a little under the weather
just a rebel without a clue
im tired an lonely and crying for you
i know just when to sulk and i know just how to pose
dirty harry to madonna
ive been learning all the roles

chorus 2
so hold me baby hold me a little longer
need me baby just a little stronger tonight
move it darling move a little quicker
prove it darling blood is really thicker tonight
drive on darling drive a little farther
dream on darling dream a little harder tonight
teach me baby teach me how to love you
without me youre just another rebel without a clue

postchorus
rebel without a clue oooh
rebel without a clue oooh

verse 2
its been a long hot summer an its just the beginning
so keep our motor running and your tires spinning
so many places that ive wanted to be in
take me where youre going  away beyond above 
well see a little action relieve a little tension
stuff id like to try that i shouldnt even mention
ive gone so far already c im way beyond redemption
theres nothing to it really  i think they call it love
refrain
did anybody say something incredibly stupid
like there isnt any paradise
but i remember the songs and i remember the story
i remember the thrills and i remember the glory

prechorus
so hold me  hold me in your arms
deliver me from growing old
hold me  hold me in your arms
shelter me from going cold
im a shot in the dark without you
a rebel without a clue
