listen do you hear my heartbeat thump over the monitors
you pretend to close your eyes dont breathe in
pieces of candy and leaks of light leaks of light light
paint the floor round me then without hesitating hesitating

chorus
you took my hand and then we both started running
both started running theres no place to go
another bullet and we both started running
both started running too whoaohoohwhoaoh
save yourself dont ever look back whoaoh
nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles circles
whoaohohoohwhoaoh

verse 2
creeping through these labyrinths
i find another dead end to the weekend but is this real life
paper hearts turned ash begin to fly over our heads i begin
screaming while the exit signs read heavens waiting

chorus
you took my hand and then we both started running
both started running theres no place to go
another bullet and we both started running
both started running too whoaohoohwhoaoh
save yourself dont ever look back whoaoh
nowhere to go and so and we both spin around in circles circles
whoaohohoohwhoaoh

and i said hey hey whats on your mind
i think about my life without you and i start to cry
and i said hey hey its alright
well make it i love you and ill never leave your side
whoaohohoh

chorus
you took my hand and then we both started running
both started running theres no place to go
another bullet and we both started running
both started running too whoaohoohwhoaoh
save yourself dont ever look back whoaoh
nowhere to go and so and we both spin around in circles circles
oh lets go
