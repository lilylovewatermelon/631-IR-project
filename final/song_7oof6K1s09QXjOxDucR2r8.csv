pressure

verse 1 bert mccracken
pushing down on me
pressing down on you no man ask for
under pressure

gerard way
that burns a building down
splits a family in two
puts people on streets

bridge bert mccracken and gerard way
bah bah dah bah bah dah
yeah yeah

chorus bert mccracken
thats okay
its the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends scream
let me out
pray tomorrow takes me higher
pressure on people
people on the streets
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likebridge bert mccracken and gerard way
bah bah dah bah bah dah
okay

verse 2 gerard way
chipping around
kick my brains round the floor
these are the days
it never rains but it pours
bah bah dah bah bah dah

bridge bert mccracken and gerard way
people on streets
bah dah dee da day
people on streets
bah dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah

chorus bert mccracken
its the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends scream
let me out

gerard way
pray tomorrow takes me higher higher
verse 3 bert mccracken and gerard way
turned away from it all
like a blind man
sat on a fence but it dont work
keep coming up with love
but its so slashed and torn

bridge bert mccracken and gerard way
why why why
love love
love love
love love

verse 4 bert mccracken
insanity laughs under pressure
were cracking
cant we give ourselves
one more chance
why cant we give love that one more chance

bert mccracken and gerard way
why cant we give love give love give love
give love give love give love give love give love
because loves such an oldfashioned word
and love dares you to care
for the people on
the edge of the night
and love dares you to change our ways
of caring about ourselves
outro bert mccracken and gerard way
this is our last dance
this is our last dance
this is ourselves

bert mccracken
under pressure
under pressure
