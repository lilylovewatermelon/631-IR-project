so we rollin just left billings montana did a dope ass show
we in a 15 passenger van headed to spokane washington
we drivin along the interstate we go over this bridge hit a patch of ice all of a sudden the van starts fishtailing
were going back and forth im like woah krizz says you got it
krizz kaliko
sean you got it i think you got it man
but we went sliding further and further towards the embankment
boom we hit
we flipped like 5 times all the windows start breaking out in the van
and im like oh god oh god while we flipping and finally we stop
im lookin around the van to see if everybodys aight
first person i looked at was big nick cause i see him jumpin out first
he runs to the doors cause they crushed in and he starts grabbin em tryin to rip em open like mm mmm

big nick

i yank the doors open and im yellin out tech tech are you alright man kutt kutt are you alright
kutt raises up and i see hes drenched from all the bottles of alcohol that we had in the van from last night
and i say kutt man are you cool
