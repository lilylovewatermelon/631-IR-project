verse 1 mike shinoda
yo peep the style and the kids checkin for it
the number one question is how could you ignore it
we drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
with raps that got you backin this up like rewind that
were just rollin with the rhythm
rise from the ashes of stylistic division
with these nonstop lyrics of life livin
not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
but in the meantime there are those
who wanna talk this and that so i suppose
that it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
and get dirty with the people spreadin the dirt it ​goes

chorus chester bennington mike shinoda
try to give you warning
but everyone ignores me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening
call to you so clearly
but you dont want to hear me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening

i got a heart full of pain head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
and everything lefts a waste of time
i hate my rhymes but hate everyone elses more
im ridin on the back of this pressure
guessin that its better i cant keep myself together
because all of this stress gave me somethin to write on
the pain gave me somethin i could set my sights on
you never forget the blood sweat and tears
the uphill struggle over years the fear
and trashtalkin and the people it was to
and the people that started it just like you

chorus chester bennington mike shinoda
try to give you warning
but everyone ignores me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening
call to you so clearly
but you dont want to hear me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening

bridge mike shinoda
i got a heart full of pain head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle blood sweat and tears
nothin to gain everything to fear
heart full of pain head full of stress
handful of anger held in my chest
uphill struggle blood sweat and tears
nothin to gain everything to fear
heart full of pain
chorus chester bennington mike shinoda
try to give you warning
but everyone ignores me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening
call to you so clearly
but you dont want to hear me
told you everything loud and clear
but nobodys listening

breakdown mike shinoda chester bennington
i got a heart full of pain head full of stress
nobodys listening
handful of anger held in my chest
nobodys listening
uphill struggle blood sweat and tears
nobodys listening
nothin to gain everything to fear
nobodys listening
