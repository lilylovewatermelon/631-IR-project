i took my love and i took it down
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snowcovered hills
well the landslide brought me down

verse 2
oh mirror in the sky what is love
can the child within my heart rise above
can i sail through the changing ocean tides
can i handle the seasons of my life
ohoh ohoh ohoh

chorus
well ive been afraid of changing
cause i built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
children get older
im getting older too
well

and if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills

and if you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills

well maybe
the landslide will bring you down5embed"
