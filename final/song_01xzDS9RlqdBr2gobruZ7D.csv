24 to nothing and im at the intersection
waiting for the light thats green
waiting for a reason
take them all and stack them up
not in my collection
hit them all and watch them fly
fuck them all and watch them drown

verse 2
what is with these bands that keep coming with their politics
they never went to school to find out that they were full of shit
didnt really either
but fuck i guess it really doesnt matter
you took this time to listen to me
so ill say hey i fucked your brother

chorus
theres one problem
i got brownies
from your mother
it gave me syphilis
i got no dick
