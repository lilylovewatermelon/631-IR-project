you picked me up you shot me down
steppin out all over town
drove me back to drinkin in this bar
i found myself a brand new friend
im headed down that road again
im workin on my next broken heart

verse2
happy or sad its hard to tell
you taught me how to hurt so well
when it comes to love i know my part
well ill play this game that i cant win
ill be somebodys fool again
workin on my next broken heart

chorus
well i thought all along youd be the death of me
but i met one tonight who wants whats left of me
ive seen that look before shell tear my world apart
im workin on my next broken heart
