him haile selassie i speaking in amharic
english translation
the security of the world
those who disturb terrorise the peace at this time
we are going to describe them now
bunny wailer dialogue
since the beginning of modern civilization
generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
but behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
then shall the earths children know the true expression of one love
then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace
forever eliminating the aspirations lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars
selah

chorus
see it deh know the innocent going up in vapors
and propaganda spreading inna the sunday papers

verse 1 damian marley
boom

only few men survive crawling out

medic haffi haul him out
and gi him two tranquilizer fi stall him out

cant get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
him mistress find a new shoes
wife cant get no news and lately she starting to doubt
she still searching
and the youth dem bawling out
working hard not to let it all come out
well its not safe to go walk about
a slaughterhouse from baghdad to waterhouse
she start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
she start go out start beat a darker stout
guns come out
working people funds run out
keep a show last week and no one come out
bombs come out
mi gas tank just run out
bomboclaat
the scotch tape just run out
weed run out
yuh senses must dumb out mi have a pound round a back deh a gwan sun out
nah come out
till the chalice bun out
nah come out
till the malice bun out a war
zimbabwe to berlin wall
blazin like a burnin ball loose balldat no work in war
sleepin dat no work in war
cant wear jheri curl in war
no diamond and pearl in war
cant drink weh a serve in bar cah
gas wi fuck up yuh nerves in war
shot wi blood up yuh shirt in war
cant go lift up no skirt in war
now disease and germs in war
cant go release your sperms in war
stamina must preserve in war
fire constantly burn in war

marcus garvey dialogue 2
if you cannot do it if you are not prepared to do itthen you will die
you race of cowards you race of imbeciles you race of good for nothings
if you cannot do what other men have done
what other nations have done what other races have done
then you yourself shall die

chorus

verse 2 damian marley
see it deh nowhey
now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
any day a revolution might erupt and the skies over kingston lighting up
for the new generation rising up of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
and through reasoning dem biding up
searching for the sign and the sign is us
searching for the truth all you find is us
searching for the troops still behind is us
the almighty we recruit and we come from the root
we build like roach killing boot
weh just cant done rastafari design me tuff
if a the fight for freedom sign me up
cause you telllievision cant blind me up
soldiers and police dem wising up realizing theyre no more right than us
realizing theres no use fighting us
realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
so we nah tek talk nor smiling up
cause the word temper tantrum boiling up
and who calling the shots and nah bust none
controlling the mind of the young bring down

bear famine no rain nah fall from london to dadeland mall
all the son of the virgin bawl
institute of the church in war
preaching and researching war
practice and rehearsing war
teaching and dem learning war
instigating and urging war
always keep alert in war
cause man will jump out a swerving car
now bees and birds in war
and the freaks and nerds in war
and the straight and curves in war
forward and reverse in war
redit redit redit redit red
