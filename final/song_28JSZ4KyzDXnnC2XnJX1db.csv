dark years brought endless rain
out in the cold i lost my way
but storms wont last to clear the air
for something new the sun came out and brought you through

chorus
a lifetime full of words to say
a hope that time will slow the passing day
ive been wrong times over
and ive been shamed with no words to find
but if the sun will rise bring us tomorrow
walk with me crimson day

verse 2
dont speak no use for words
lie in my arms sleep secure
i wonder what youre dreaming of lands rare and far
a timeless flight to reach the stars

chorus
a lifetime full of words to say
a hope that time will slow the passing day
ive been wrong times over
and ive been shamed with no words to find
but if the sun will rise bring us tomorrow
walk with me crimson day

verse 3
ive come so far to meet you here
to share this life with one i hold so dear
and i wont speak but what is true
the world outside created just for you its for you for you

chorus
ive been wrong times over
and ive been shamed with no words to find
but if the sun will rise bring us tomorrow
walk with me crimson day4embed"
