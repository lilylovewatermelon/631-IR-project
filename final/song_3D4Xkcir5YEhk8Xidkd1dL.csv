verse 1
i think i fell in love again
maybe i just took too much cough medicine
im the best worst thing that hasnt happened to you yet
the best worst thing
you take the full full truth then you pour some out
you take the full full truth then you pour some out
and you can kill me kill me or let god sort ‘em out
and you can kill me kill me orwhoa

you take the full full truth then you pour some out

and as were drifting off to sleep
