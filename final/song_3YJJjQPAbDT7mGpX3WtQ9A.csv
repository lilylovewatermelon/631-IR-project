good day in my mind safe to take a step out

i need rest now got me bummed out
you so you so you

ive been on my empty mind shit

prechorus sza
i try to keep from losin the rest of me
i worry that i wasted the best of me on you babe
you dont care
said not tryna be a nuisance this is urgent
tryna make sense of loose change
got me a war in my mind
gotta let go of weight cant keep whats holdin me
choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

verse 3 sza
gotta get right
tryna free my mind before the end of the world
i dont miss no ex i dont miss no text
i choose not to respond
i dont regret just pretend shit never happened
half of us layin waste to our youth its in the present
nana nana nana na
half of us chasin fountains of youth and its in the present now

outro jacob collier
always in my mind always in my mind mind
youve been making me feel like im
always in my mind always in my mind mind185embed"
