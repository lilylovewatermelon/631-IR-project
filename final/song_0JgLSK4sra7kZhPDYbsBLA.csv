rise
throw away
the charade of your life
let the flame of my heart
burn away
your complacence tonight
i command you to

verse 2
rise
wash away
the decay of your life
feel the light of your eyes
find the way
through the darkness tonight
fearing no one

prechorus
do you really think i covet like you do

chorus
come take me away
remove the fear from my eyes
feel the flame of my heart
burning away
all conversation tonight
hearing no one

now rise
turn away
from the shame of your life
feel the light from my eyes

fearing no one

saviors of my soul

i cannot stop this
pure emotion
falling from my eyes
you are vindicating
liberating
saviors of my soul

now rise
throw away
the charade of your life
let the flame of my heart
burn away
your complacence tonight
fearing no one1embed"
