when i was a boy i lived on poplar street
just a little child with plasters on my knees
watching all the world from high up in the trees
i saw mrs moore sleep round with mr keats

chorus
i feel like a new man
red flowers in my bed
breathe straight through the crisp air
dead flowers in the sand
i am a true romantic
free falling love addict and
i am a true romantic
free falling love addict yeah

verse 2
mama always called that woman prostitits
wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
one night mrs moore she made her eyes at me
pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep

chorus
i feel like a new man
red flowers in my bed
breathe straight through the crisp air
dead flowers in the sand
i am a true romantic
free falling love addict and
i am a true romantic
free falling love addict yeah
