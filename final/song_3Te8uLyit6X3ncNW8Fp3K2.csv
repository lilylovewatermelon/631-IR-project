they say we are what we are
but we don’t have to be
i’m bad behavior but i do it in the best way
i’ll be the watcher watcher
of the eternal flame
i’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

prechorus
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
i am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass glass
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
oh i try to picture me without you but i can’t

chorus
cause we could be immortals
immortals
just not for long for long
and live with me forever now
mmm pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long for long

postchorus
we could be immor—immortals
immor—immortals
immor—immortals
immor—immortals

verse 2
sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
is when it’s tested again and again every day
i’m still comparing your past to my future
it might be your wound but they’re my sutures

i am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass glass
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
i try to picture me without you but i can’t

cause we could be immortals
immortals
just not for long for long
and live with me forever now
mmm pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long for long
