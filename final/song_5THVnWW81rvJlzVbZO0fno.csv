i can hear the wind blowing in my mind
just the way it used to sound through the georgia pines
you were there to answer when i called
you and me lord knows we had it all

verse 2
remember how i used to touch your hair
while reaching for a feeling that was always there
you were the best thing in my life that i recall
you and me we had it all

bridge
i know that we can never live those times again
so i let my dreams take me back to where weve been
and ill stay with you girl as long as i can
oh it was so good oh so good
mm when i was your man

verse 3
ill never stop believing in your smile
even though you didnt stay it was all worthwhile
you were the best thing in my life that i recall
you and me we had it allyou might also like1embed"
