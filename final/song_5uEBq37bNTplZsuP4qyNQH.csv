big pile up when the coop come through with those tecs that be silent when you shoot like a rim with no net
sometimes you got to quote a rapper just to speak right we run streets like drunks run street lights i held that heat tight just so i could sleep nice so they wont put me in that box and tell me sleep tight big llama out show you what the drama about
im trying to eat like sunday at big momma house

verse 3 green double
im the hardest prick got the shinobi on the hip
at any second im liable to go spartacus
vision a war dome well its a battle to the death and half of these niggas die because of an open wound
blood in the air killers everywhere ambition is killing my niggas chopping off every head 2015 thats a mclaren its cherry red
dope spots milk in your heart its like a dairy there
snapback red wings rose gold red bling gucci boots with the green straps and the red strings 2 door murcielago put that on everything
fuck with giovannis but i like how the berellis green
put it in a pot after i stir it i let it steam strap it to a bumper yeah i got that off a belly scene what if sin was cere
what if tommy was buns what if ox had a chopper hed probably run  in the mazzy magnum with a shotty im from where niggas do homicides and brag about their bodies
armani pull over 5 racks call that a quick stunt all red with the yellow a like alvin the chipmunk 3 meals out the day you think im willing to skip lunch i was only home for 7 but i ate em for 6 months fast forward i aint trying to summon my old days
on a run like simpson in a pair of ojs catch me flaring both ways picking and hitting them running the strip the  getting sent to the pen touching down going on top just going in fuck it you know giving you this shit without a pen nigga its trust gang

verse 4 gee money
i said style on niggas while yall niggas step on the scene in something mean arouse yall bitches
this aint nothing new man i been like this for a minute think my pops was a pilot moms was a flight attendant
loud on my lungs yac in my liver and my uniform separates me from these wack niggas about to  do for upstate with big dig for fat niggas outfitter nike and might kicker
style is free with every verse that i deliver has a token of appreciation to my listeners my ceelos out of this world im just a visitor my stay on earths a business trip im here to get my chicken up trust niggas only one way to think when they mention us
know how we give it up live it up until they send for us not to be religious but being broke is a sin to us

yo tear drops with no bodies well i oughta get one cos every verse is a homi no features cos its hard for niggas to rap behind me

itll be asking all to say that boy name but that boy malcolm ate niggas fuck up that boy frame yeah that boy playing comparing life to a ball game pop his boy top and cover his face with his boy frame see the boy like attention but can the boy endure pain

verse 5 ty villian
yo i swear to tell the truth and nothing but the whole truth
for all inquiring minds who want to see me show proof
i expose flukes catch you on a jack blam you in the back leave you slumped in the phone booth the jokers will tell throw you in jail
when these bitch niggas around do you know what i smell pussy
that shit is unacceptable and unprofessional to lock real niggas up in correctional facilities i only fuck with a selected few animals that will peel your wig back when the lemon squeeze
you hustled for years but still didnt make it yet spitting all them corny ass lyrics need to save your breath thinking that the teflon on you gonna save your flesh pop the fifth let a hollow tip penetrate your vest get your clean cut steamed up ima make a mess
never prejudge a street thug i dont break a sweat
think your gd out weak fuck better save your breath or get a clean tux  and a place to rest false claiming you can lay in a hole
im a gangster of real life you just playing the role
after the first time i beasted on a bitch i have her stalking the kid
all day feening for the dick getting brain with the nina on the hip
and after i buss ima leave a lot of semen on the lips
keep a g pack eating on the strip or the ski mask way plotting and scheming on the vic i stick up  in the piff to empty the snub nose
after that im reaching for the fifth fuck a grave ima leave him in a ditch my guns so big its like im loading heat seekers in the clip nigga ima keep squeezing til it click then bounce from the cops cos im a fucking speed demon in the whip drama with them like beefing with a bitch give them a buck 50 and have blood leaking on his kicks my eyes red and cheeky from the spliff spend a dub on my neck and 10 stacks on my pinky and the wrist
if a nigga owe me cheese ima flip it through his ass like suge when he had vanilla ice swinging from a cliff at the base heads twinking for a fix and when i bang that thing i turn your wife beater into swiss trust
verse 6 38 spesh
lying on track ain gonna help you get respect
they put that shit in my deck i pressed eject
talking about the broads and all the connects he make
fronting like he hard but soft as a wet cleenex
we next you know they want to catch me next when you a boss it ain hard to accept regrets we next im comfortable in the pjects low top giuseppes louis sweats and a vneck
these niggas wanna see me shot my nigga easy got the top but the gt chop plans to grab the benz when the cd drop
think its bullshit niggas dont believe me watch
everytime the plug see me they feed me blocks im greasy im the reason that that kid re rock smoke so much green leaf think i need detox howthe fuck you think you shining with a 3g watch
first man to hand me a kilo nickname tito resemble danny devito
making money legal is what expanded my ego
still got 100 things about to land in toledo watch 40 chain 40
my right hand man got the same story shout out them bitches that aint call me the hungry and pain quickly but came glory
attitude greedy reinup i had to do weekly every day my avenue need me niggas started ratting so i had to move easy niggas started ratting so i had to move easy  in my house last night
went broke bounced back twice you niggas not about that life
they think im nice becauseim smiling im nice because of talent
then walk around looking like an ice bucket challenge
this is for my niggas sending kites to the islands or up north eating rice with the salmon you niggas is beginners to me
ive been locked in that box eating dinner at three
you niggas is beginners to me ive been locked in that box eating dinner at three make a nigga think about killing the e so when my niggas get free i send them a key you ever seen a 13 year old shooter nigga might do a driveby on a scooter
everything is real never lie to the consumer back home miss a lot of
homicide rumors i got him smoked got him knocked off
heard a bullet hit him then a limb popped off
why you rapping about them cars nigga them not yours
i had a maserati and a benz in my garage
lets go glock rounds disperse niggas get hurt
shot down the mercs you not found ain no cops round to search i got enough work to lock down the turf in 05 i used to cop pounds of purp my trap house make a lot round a verse 38s hurt but 4 pounds is worse i like hoes because they more down to earth
i give them what i need give them a little weed only thing they want is money for their weed drop the hoe off she forgot about her seed picked the bitch up i told her its time to leave
real niggas dont talk real niggas just squeeze shoot everything from the hat to the knees and im doneembed"
