walking with my head down
counting every step
hoping that the next one
brings me closer to the man i was
cause i was way better
maybe its because
we were together

escaping on the tightrope
trying not to fall

i know i will lose it all
i should have known better
and its all my fault
that were not together

bridge usher
i was on a journey
trying to figure out who i really was
then i realized that
when youre not here
half of me is gone
so in order for me to find me
i had to find you
you know you
and i got a funny feeling that you
you wont know who you are
and unless you find me you
its like
you look in the mirror you
and you see the person that you truly love

chorus usher
