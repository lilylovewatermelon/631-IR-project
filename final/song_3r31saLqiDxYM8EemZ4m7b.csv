ill bet two years ill bet one year
ill bet those years
you wont be here
i guess ill keep i guess youll keep every memory
sadly we may never be
ill bet my tears ill bet your tears
ill bet those tears over time could disappear

prechorus
wait a minute i have more to say
and i care if youre listening to me

chorus
i need you more than youll ever know
still do willing to let it show
i need a minute just to get you
i feel like i might be getting through
come over and say nothing
silence is everything

bridge
i know i know i know i know
feelings can show oh
if you let go
it must told must be told
that ive got a hold oh
on what we used to have
you might also likeverse 2
i will forgive if you forget all the things we said
lets accept it

chorus
i need you more than youll ever know
still do willing to let it show
i need a minute just to get you
i feel like i might be getting through
come over and say nothing
silence is everythingembed"
