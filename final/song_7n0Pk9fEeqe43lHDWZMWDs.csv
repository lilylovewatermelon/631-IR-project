hey say pimp this to everybody stretched out behind the wall

hey man i dont give a damn bout how other folks treat you man

chorus
i know the times seem long
just try and keep strong
put on your headphones and rewind this song
remember you aint missin nothin homes
i promise you aint missin nothin homes

hey just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
you get home its gonna be waitin on yall
so dog just know for real

i promise you aint missin nothin homes
on everything

verse 1
my uncle did a decade
came home hit the ground runnin gettin paid
like he never did a day
hit the streets nigga still in the same place they were
fore we went in the chain gang
and doin the same thing
cause the game go on you only did two days in the joint
the day you get locked up and the day you go home
i know it feels like the world passin you by
like shit happenin every day out there that you dont know bout
everytime you call home your baby momma show out
and your partners dont even send you flicks from when they go out
but dont worry bout it or stress it cause shawty know what
the timell do itself all you gotta do is show up
keep layin down wakin up
and thankin the lord
and fore you know it they gonna open the doors
true story just prepare yourself for it
if you aint got a plan what you need was a second chance
shit you gonna blow it
learn and visualize what you try to do
and do the time homeboy dont let the time do you
they say the time just flew on the street
hard to believe from me never but youll see soon as you on the street
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likechorus
i know the times seem long
just try and keep strong
put on your headphones and rewind this song
remember you aint missin nothin homes
i promise you aint missin nothin homes

hey just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
you get home its gonna be waitin on yall
so dog just know for real

i promise you aint missin nothin homes

verse 2
probably thinkin its easy for me to say from here in the booth
but they showed ya theyd put me in there with you
right now locked down in the state of the fed lay in the bed
prayin its over and over as you say in your head
yeah next time im a be straight
just count down to my release date peace of cake
my nigga kap right now servin a life sentence for a murder he committed
in self defense
and in such good spirits shawty aint even trippin
and i could be right in there with him no bull shittin
he on his ninth year now just waitin to get out
got me thinkin my shit aint even worth complainin about
cause it could still be worse for sho
so you waitin on me to lose ho you got to kill me first
i talked to my nigga big meedge had to tell him the
streets miss him just as much as he miss the streets
had to let him know whenever he released
we hittin the club like 03 this time its on me
yeah we laugh reminisce for a minute and then i tell him
just nobody ever did it as big
itll never be the same in this city again closest
youll get is me and jeezy and them
so dog if it seems like you left behind ten steps
behind just know it only gets better with time
chorus
i know the times seem long
just try and keep strong
put on your headphones and rewind this song
remember you aint missin nothin homes
i promise you aint missin nothin homes

hey just now the club on hold and the broads on pause
you get home its gonna be waitin on yall
so dog just know for real
you aint missin nothin homes
i promise you aint missin nothin homes
