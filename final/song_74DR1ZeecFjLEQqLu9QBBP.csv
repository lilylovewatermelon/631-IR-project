i guess you have to have a problem if you want to invent a contraption
first you cause a train wreck then they put me in traction mmm
well first came an action and then a reaction
but you cant switch em round for your own satisfaction
well you burnt my house down then got mad at my reaction
well in every complicated situation of a human relation
makin sense of it all takes a whole lotta concentration mmm
well you cant blame a baby for her pregnant ma
and if theres one of these unavoidable laws
its that you just cant take the effect and make it the cause no

chorus
well you cant take the effect and make it the cause
i didnt rob a bank because you made up the law
blame me for robbin peter but dont you blame paul
cant take the effect and make it the cause

verse 2
i aint the reason that you gave me no reason to return your call
you built a house of cards and got shocked when you saw them fall yeah
well i aint saying im innocent in fact the reverse
but if youre headed to the grave you dont blame the hearse
youre like a little girl yellin at her brother cause you lost his ball yes
well you keep blaming me for what you did but that aint all
the way you clean up a wreck is enough to give one pause yes
well you seem to forget just how this all started
im reactin to you because you left me brokenhearted
see you just cant just take the effect and make it the cause
you might also likechorus
well you cant take the effect and make it the cause
i didnt rob a bank because you made up the law
blame me for robbin peter but dont you blame paul
cant take the effect and make it the cause5embed"
