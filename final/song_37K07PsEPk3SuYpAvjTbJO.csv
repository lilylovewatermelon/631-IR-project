i guess i just got lost
being someone else
i tried to kill the pain
nothin ever helped
i left myself behind
somewhere along the way
hoping to come back around
to find myself someday

prechorus
lately im so tired of waiting for you
to say that its ok but tell me

chorus
please would you one time
just let me be myself
so i can shine with my own light
let me be myself

postchorus
would you let me be myself

verse 2
ill never find my heart
behind someone else
ill never see the light of day
living in this cell
its time to make my way
into the world i knew
take back all of these times
that i gave in to you
