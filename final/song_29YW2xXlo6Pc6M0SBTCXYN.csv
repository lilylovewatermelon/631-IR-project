metro in this bitch goin brazy

chorus 21 savage
strike like a match knock him out his hat
knife to a gun fight this aint none of that
had to cut her off she got too attached
i aint wastin time that im never gettin back
takin less ls makin more ms
put her skims on now she actin like she kim
take it to the paint take it to the rim
you look good on camera baby lets go make a film

verse 1 21 savage
big diamonds big puns vs1s
long guns home runs im the don
i can hang in the trenches with no one
plenty switches with extensions its no fun
givin out spankings
ridin with lil— cause he shoot without thinkin
baptize a nigga send him home in a blanket
upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet
better not get no throw up on my seat i know you drinkin
you aint fuck no rapper you a dinosaur you ancient
i like fried rice you better cook like you an asian
wrote a lot of verses but i never wrote no statement
i been in them rooms i never did no contemplatin
this bitch wanna argue i aint doin no debatin
seen her with her nigga waved my hand im like hey friend
lookin at the shade room that shit be entertainin
tryna turn an opp into a motherfuckin painting
wells fargo where im banking nigga
heard your album sales tankin nigga
my bros down the road shank you nigga

verse 2 drake
6 god lurkin
come up off that bag for the boy that keep working
dissin on his album and it flopped he deserved it
come up out that booth and bring that energy in person
got so many hits it wouldnt be fair to do no verses
i could really go five hours in the stadium
what happened to that nigga claiming ovo we traded him
thought i was a popstar im slaughter gang i baited em
walk around like prince cause i got a lot of lady friends
used to be in sauga out at sega city playdium
skatin through this album like a montreal canadien
way that i ran shit youd think i was iranian
niggas see my deal look at they deal and now they hate the kid
fuck let me kick it basic
niggas aint got love for the boy so they fake it
crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit
but if i send a verse to they ass then theyll take it
shoot a video arm around me like we aces
or pop out at my shows jump around with me on stages
probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises
mightve fucked a rapper girl but you aint fucked drake yet
yeah
