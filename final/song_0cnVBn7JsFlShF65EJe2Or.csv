there comes a time in a young mans life
he should settle down and find himself a wife
but im just fine cause i know that you are mine

verse 1
i fight crime online sometimes
then write rhymes i hide behind
and my switch her wine both crying
im fine if you are fine

verse 2
looking back on 2009
when people said that it was raining all the time
i see sunshine cause i know that you are mine

verse 3
when you say that im wasting your time
then i smile and tell you things will be fine
for some reason i just cant say i do
