i hear the lord passing by
this could be my day of visitation
have mercy on me lord
hear my cry of desperation
i hear the lord passing by
bridge
my heart my flesh
yearn to be with you
open my eyes to see your glory
all the days of my life
bridge 2
this is my one chance
this is my moment
lord i throw everything aside
just to run blindly after you
this is my one chance
this is my moment
i wanna see you
i wanna touch you
i wanna hold you
i wanna know you
i wanna follow you
i wanna follow you
all my hope is in you
all i need is in you
my miracle is you
chorus 2
i hear the lord passing by
this could be my day of visitation
have mercy on me lord
hear my cry of desperation
have mercy on me lord
from the depth of my affliction
i hear the lord
i hear the lord
i hear the lord passing bysee yiruma liveget tickets as low as 133you might also likeembed"
