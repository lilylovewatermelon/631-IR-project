my hand to god i didnt mean to
after all look what weve been through
men come in different shades
thats how were made
the little house on ellis drive
is where i felt most alive
the oak tree covered that old ford
i miss it lord i miss it lord

chorus
these blood red eyes dont see so good
but whats worse is if they could
would i change my ways
wasted times and broken dreams
violent colors so obscene
its all i see these days these days

verse 2
watch what you say the devil is listenin
hes got ears that you wouldnt believe
and brother once you go to him
its your soul you can never never never retrieve

chorus
these blood red eyes dont see so good
but whats worse is if they could
would i change my ways
wasted times and broken dreams
and violent colors so obscene
its all i see these days these days

these days all i see these days
see these days all i see6embed"
