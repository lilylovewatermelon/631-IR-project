they brothers wanna fight me they sisters wanna date me
i tell her bust it baby you could be my bust it baby
but stay in your place i need my space dont suffocate me please
back black approach us clack clack take gats out the holsters
cops in black the patrol us treat us like rats and roaches
but the blue benz got the blue lamps
and your wifey well we use her for her food stamps
aint no big deal but she keep the fridge filled
eggs scrambled cheese grilled cold juice the grits kill
dont forget veal italiano gallardo

well rush in ya spot knock knock snub of the glock
