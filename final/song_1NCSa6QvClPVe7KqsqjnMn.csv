all my niggas take a walk with me
you aint gotta holla you can talk with me
just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how i stack figures
learn why im real still that nigga
i get money i aint gotta do a crime
shit i hit dimes what i need with a nine
before yall judge me be clear
we got nothing but heat here beware we here
whats my name got chicks twisted like whats my game
pimp things still the same
i smash it i dont harass it
ma im a baller i score and pass it
feel me still be filthy
if making hits is a crime i plead guilty
and this is what we came do
