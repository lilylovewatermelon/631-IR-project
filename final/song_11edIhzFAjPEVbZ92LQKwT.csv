ive been waiting for a good day
ive been holding back long enough
ive been hurting to tell you some things
its not the falling of the temperature
thats making all our bones run cold
its the breeze you make
the presence felt when youre around me

chorus
and it feels like im at an alltime low
slightly bruised and broken
from our head on collision
ive never seen this side of you
another tragic case of feeling
bruised and broken
from our head on collision
ive never seen this side of you
another tragic case

verse 2
and im still waiting for a good day
i think ive held this long enough
i think its safe to tell you some things
its not just what you say to people
and its not the way you look at me
its the way you present yourself
for all your worst critics to see

bridge
then you were gone
all this time you just didnt know it yet x2

chorus

outro
another tragic case of feeling
bruised and broken
another tragic case and ive been
still waiting for a good dayembed"
