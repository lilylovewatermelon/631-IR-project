stay away from the fakes stay away
my nigga stay away from the jakes

i just hope you niggas wear a hoodie when the rain come
i just hope you niggas dont think you really stainless
i just hope my niggas dont ever ever change on me
oh you really think youre so official im the same one
they been telling me i fell off since i came up
baby girl listen youre way better than a bartender
told my niggas just ten toes stand tall yeah

i tried not to fall in love but we all fell in
we tried to find ninetofives but we was all felons
