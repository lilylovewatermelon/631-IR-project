it was a cold and cruel evening
sneaking up on speedy creek
found myself asleep and in the snow
one or two odd reasons
i aint too proud to repeat
for now well say i had no place to go
there was a rustle and a humming
just hauling down the street
i drew myself up from my icy bed
painted on that shiny car the letters rcm and p
i can feel a little aching in my head

verse 2
and then out jumps this old boy
about twice the size of me
he asked me for my name and where i dwell
i just looked him in the eye
and sang blue yodel number 9
he didnt catch the reference i could tell

then the old familiar click
in the handcuffs bind and grip
should have left me in the snow where i laid
he just laughed and touched his gun
and turned to me and he said
son i bet you dont own a damn thing to your name
see colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
well i got my health
my john b stetson
got a bottle full of babys bluebird wine
and i left my stash
somewhere down in preston
along with thirteen silver dollars and my mind

well i got my health

got me a bottle full of babys bluebird wine
