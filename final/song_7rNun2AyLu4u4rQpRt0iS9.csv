i used to live out west in a collective
i used to yeah

verse 1
we used to live out west in a collective
everybody got arrested cause nobody wanted sleep
i used to dish out verses on purpose
and if you wanted to purchase one you werent as good as me
i dont know if that time is comin to an end
i hope the band gets back together when its over

chorus
dont you go runnin for the hills
you cant outrun it by yourself
by yourself

verse 2
and when i call you up you barely answer
you think you got it all figured out
you act like you dont even remember
oh youre all by yourself

chorus
dont you go runnin for the hills
you cant outrun it by yourself
by yourselfsee dominic fike liveget tickets as low as 186you might also like3embed"
