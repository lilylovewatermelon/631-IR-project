well the night is my companion
and the highway is my home
got me seekin for one last beacon
every single place i roam

verse 2
they say jesus was a poor man
i guess i wish i had a little more of him in me
make it easier goin on livin
heartache misery

chorus
sweet sweet heart of mine
im gonna break again a million times
or is this too far gone
or have you turned to stone

verse 3
well i guess i got my bottle
i still hold it all the time
but it keeps me smilin and singin
helps me fall asleep a little bit better at night

verse 4
they say life is like a dagger
backstage is full of parasites
they love you and drain you of everything you own
just to feel better about their life

sweet sweet heart of mine
im gonna break again a million times
or is this too far gone
or have you turned to stone

chorus
sweet sweet heart of mine
im gonna break again a million times
or is this too far gone
sweet sweet love of mine
im gonna break again a million times
or is this too far gone
or have you turned to stone
