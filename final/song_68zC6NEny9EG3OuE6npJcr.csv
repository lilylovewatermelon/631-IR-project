i aint looking at you for no particular reason
its just a tough spot for me to be in
i gotta open that door
i gotta get it open hey
ima push my way through just like a robber
and smile for the camera
damn that felt awesome
push it open little more
gotta get it open

prechorus
you would never listen when i need someone to talk to
so you switch the subject cause cause its beyond you
and when you talk about your dreams im never included
i need to stop sleeping on myself
wake up and do it on my own

chorus
hey ill find a way yeah
and ill do it on my own
hey i can do anything yeah
and ill do it on my own

postchorus
i will get it done with the help from no one
came into this world by myself
so i dont need nobody else
we have just begun
so much to do so young
dont be afraid of alone
youll get it done on your own

im so confused with all the traffic
ima skip the line

i gotta stay on that course
i gotta get it open
