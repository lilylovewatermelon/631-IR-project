i have been trying
to write a haiku for you
some things i just cant do
maybe youre beyond
ancient asian poetry
or maybe its just me

refrain

to get this haiku just right
all night for you alright

was lost in the sauce we spilled
that never got refilled
ive never thought much
of formulaic verse anyway
and rhymes are not my fortâ€“

i have been trying
to get this haiku just right
all night for you alright
im through
