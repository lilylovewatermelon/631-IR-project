means your true lovin daddy aint comin back
im movin on ill soon be gone
you were flyin too high for my little old sky
and im movin on

that big loud whistle as it blew and blew
said hello to the southland were comin to you
im movin on oh hear my song
you had the laugh on me now im settin you free
so keep movin on

mister fireman wont you please listen to me
cause i got a pretty mama in tennessee
keep movin me on keep rollin on
so shovel the coal let this rattler roll
keep movin on

mister engineer take that throttle in hand
this rattler the fastest in the southern land
it keeps movin me on it keeps going on
you gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
and keep rollin on

ive told you baby from time to time
but you just wouldnt listen or pay me no mind
now im movin on im rollin on
youve broken your vow and its all over now
so im movin on
youve switched your engine now i aint got time
for a triflin woman on my main line
so im movin on you done your daddy wrong
i warned you twice now you can settle the price
but im movin on

but someday baby when youve had your play
you want your daddy but your daddy will say
keep movin on you stayed away too long
im through with you too bad youre blue
keep movin onyou might also likeembed"
