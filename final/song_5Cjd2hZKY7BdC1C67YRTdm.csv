starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiners place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of temple street north then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before georges church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends

of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary

music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephens collapse

did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience

both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism

were their views on some points divergent

stephen dissented openly from blooms view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while bloom dissented tacitly from stephens views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature bloom assented covertly to stephens rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year 432 in the reign of leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart 266 ad suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a womans hand

was there one point on which their views were equal and negative

the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees

had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past

in 1884 with ower goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonards corner and leonards corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue in 1885 with percy apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin barony of uppercross in 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps in front parlours in third class railway carriages of suburban lines in 1888 frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillons house in roundtown once in 1892 and once in 1893 with julius mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his blooms house in lombard street west

what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884 1885 1886 1888 1892 1893 1904 did bloom make before their arrival at their destination
he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations

as in what ways

from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived

what action did bloom make on their arrival at their destination

at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number 7 eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey

was it there

it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding

why was he doubly irritated

because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget

what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple

to enter or not to enter to knock or not to knock

blooms decision

a stratagem resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall
did he fall

by his bodys known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of francis fraedman pharmaceutical chemist of 19 frederick street north on the last feast of the ascension to wit the twelfth day of may of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo golden number  epact 13 solar cycle 9 dominical letters c b roman indication 2 julian period 6617 mxmiv

did he rise uninjured by concussion

regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery ignited a lucifer match by friction set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock lit a high flame which by regulating he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle

what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive

reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 c p a man lighting a candle a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of icp

did the man reappear elsewhere

alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle

did stephen obey his sign

yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the mans back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of blooms house

what did bloom do

he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and mdonald of 14 dolier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air

of what similar apparitions did stephen think
of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood sallins in the county of kildare of his father simon dedalus in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin number thirteen fitzgibbon street of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at 15 ushers island of his mother mary wife of simon dedalus in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francisxavier 1898 of the dean of studies father butt in the physics theatre of university college 16 stephens green north of his sister dilly delia in his fathers house in cabra

what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall

under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction

what did bloom see on the range

on the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle

what did bloom do at the range

he removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow

did it flow

yes from roundwood reservoir in county wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of 5 per linear yard by way of the dargle rathdown glen of the downs and callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at stillorgan a distance of 22 statute miles and thence through a system of relieving tanks by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at eustace bridge upper leeson street though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 12 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer mr spencer harty ce on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the grand and royal canals as in 1893 particularly as the south dublin guardians notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted of a wastage of 20000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation mr ignatius rice solicitor thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public selfsupporting taxpayers solvent sound

what in water did bloom waterlover drawer of water watercarrier returning to the range admire

its universality its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level its vastness in the ocean of mercators projection its umplumbed profundity in the sundam trench of the pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard the independence of its units the variability of states of sea its hydrostatic quiescence in calm its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides its subsidence after devastation its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps arctic and antarctic its climatic and commercial significance its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of capricorn the multisecular stability of its primeval basin its luteofulvous bed its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories its alluvial deposits its weight and volume and density its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents gulfstream north and south equatorial courses its violence in seaquakes waterspouts artesian wells eruptions torrents eddies freshets spates groundswells watersheds waterpartings geysers cataracts whirlpools maelstroms inundations deluges cloudbursts its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve its secrecy in springs and latent humidity revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at ashtown gate saturation of air distillation of dew the simplicity of its composition two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen its healing virtues its buoyancy in the waters of the dead sea its persevering penetrativeness in runnels gullies inadequate dams leaks on shipboard its properties for cleansing quenching thirst and fire nourishing vegetation its infallibility as paradigm and paragon its metamorphoses as vapour mist cloud rain sleet snow hail its strength in rigid hydrants its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea its solidity in glaciers icebergs icefloes its docility in working hydraulic millwheels turbines dynamos electric power stations bleachworks tanneries scutchmills its utility in canals rivers if navigable floating and graving docks its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level its submarine fauna and flora anacoustic photophobe numerically if not literally the inhabitants of the globe its ubiquity as constituting 90 of the human body the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes pestilential fens faded flowerwater stagnant pools in the waning moon

having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals why did he return to the stillflowing tap

to wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of barringtons lemonflavoured soap to which paper still adhered bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller

what reason did stephen give for declining blooms offer

that he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of october of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language

what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot

the incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius

what additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress

dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed

which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest

confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation

what concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire

the phenomenon of ebullition fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun primal source of heat radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether heat convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron in part reflected in part absorbed in part transmitted gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise i pound of water from 50° to 212° fahrenheit

what announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature

a double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously

for what personal purpose could bloom have applied the water so boiled

to shave himself

what advantages attended shaving by night

a softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postmans double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done

why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises

because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand

what quality did it his hand possess but with what counteracting influence

the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means preferring in their natural order heliotherapy psychophysicotherapeutics osteopathic surgery

what lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by bloom

on the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups a moustachecup uninverted and saucer of crown derby four white goldrimmed eggcups and open shammy purse displaying coins mostly copper and a phial of aromatic violet comfits on the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper a drum of table salt four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper an empty pot of plumtrees potted meat an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one jersey pear a halfempty bottle of william gilbey and cos white invalid port half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper a packet of eppss soluble cocoa five ounces of anne lynchs choice tea at 2 per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar two onions one the larger spanish entire the other smaller irish bisected with augmented surface and more redolent a jar of irish model dairys cream a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk converted by heat into water acidulous serum and semisolidified curds which added to the quantity subtracted for mr blooms and mrs flemings breakfasts made one imperial pint the total quantity originally delivered two cloves a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak on the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences

what attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser

four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets numbered 887 886

what reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow

reminiscences of coincidences truth stranger than fiction preindicative of the result of the gold cup flat handicap the official and definitive result of which he had read in the evening telegraph late pink edition in the cabmans shelter at butt bridge

where had previous intimations of the result effected or projected been received by him

in bernard kiernans licensed premises 8 9 and 10 little britain street in david byrnes licensed premises 14 duke street in oconnell street lower outside graham lemons when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway subsequently thrown away advertising elijah restorer of the church in zion in lincoln place outside the premises of f w sweny and co limited dispensing chemists when when frederick m bantam lyons had rapidly and successively requested perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the freemans journal and national press which he had been about to throw away subsequently thrown away he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the turkish and warm baths 11 leinster street with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race graven in the language of prediction

what qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations

the difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation

his mood

he had not risked he did not expect he had not been disappointed he was satisfied

what satisfied him

to have sustained no positive loss to have brought a positive gain to others light to the gentiles

how did bloom prepare a collation for a gentile

he poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls four in all of eppss soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed

what supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest

relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation crown derby presented to him by his only daughter millicent milly he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and in reduced measure to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife marion molly

was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality

his attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence eppss massproduct the creature cocoa

were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun

the reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 12 inches in the right side of his guests jacket a gift to his guest of one of the four ladys handkerchiefs if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition

who drank more quickly

bloom having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted three sips to his opponents one six to two nine to three

what cerebration accompanied his frequentative act

concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of william shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life

had he found their solution

in spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages aided by a glossary he had derived imperfect conviction from the text the answers not bearing on all points

what lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him potential poet at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10 5 and 26 respectively by the shamrock a weekly newspaper

an ambition to squint
at my verses in print
makes me hope that for these youll find room
if you so condescend
then please place at the end
the name of yours truly l bloom

did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him

name age race creed

what anagrams had he made on his name in youth

leopold bloom

ellpodbomool

molldopeloob

bollo edoom

old ollebo m p

what acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he kinetic poet sent to miss marion tweedy on the 14 february 1888

poets oft have sung in rhyme
of music sweet their praise divine
let them hymn it nine times nine
dearer far than song or wine
you are mine the world is mine

what had prevented him from completing a topical song music by r g johnston on the events of the past or fixtures for the actual years entitled if brian boru could but come back and see old dublin now commissioned by michael gunn lessee of the gaiety theatre 46 47 48 49 south king street and to be introduced into the sixth scene the valley of diamonds of the second edition 30 january 1893 of the grand annual christmas pantomime sinbad the sailor written by greenleaf whittier scenery by george a jackson and cecil hicks costumes by mrs and miss whelan produced by r shelton 26 december 1892 under the personal supervision of mrs michael gunn ballets by jessie noir harlequinade by thomas otto and sung by nelly bouverist principal girl

firstly oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest the anticipated diamond jubilee of queen victoria born 1820 acceded 1837 and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market secondly apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of their royal highnesses the duke and duchess of york real and of his majesty king brian boru imaginary thirdly a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the grand lyric hall on burgh quay and the theatre royal in hawkins street fourthly distraction resultant from compassion for nelly bouverists nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by nelly bouverists revelations of white articles of nonintellectual nonpolitical nontopical underclothing while she nelly bouverist was in the articles fifthly the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from everybodys book of jokes 1000 pages and a laugh in every one sixthly the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous associated with the names of the new lord mayor daniel tallon the new high sheriff thomas pile and the new solicitorgeneral dunbar plunket barton

what relation existed between their ages

16 years before in 1888 when bloom was of stephens present age stephen was 616 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of blooms present age bloom would be 54 in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 12 to 13 12 the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable conceiving that to be possible till then 1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen would be 38 as bloom then was bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714 would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age that of methusalah 969 years while if stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 ad bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83300 years having been obliged to have been born in the year 81396 bc

what events might nullify these calculations

the cessation of existence of both or either the inauguration of a new era or calendar the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species inevitable but impredictable

how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance

two the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillons house medina villa kimmage road roundtown in 1887 in the company of stephens mother stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation the second in the coffeeroom of breslins hotel on a rainy sunday in the january of 1892 in the company of stephens father and stephens granduncle stephen being then 5 years older

did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father

very gratefully with grateful appreciation with sincere appreciative gratitude in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret he declined

did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them

mrs riordan a widow of independent means had resided in the house of stephens parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892 1893 and 1894 in the city arms hotel owned by elizabeth odowd of 54 prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of bloom who resided also in the same hotel being at that time a clerk in the employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular road

had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her

he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings an infirm widow of independent if limited means in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north circular road opposite mr gavin lows place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres hackney carriages tandems private and hired landaus dogcarts ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the phoenix park and vice versa

why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity

because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without pedestrians quadrupeds velocipedes vehicles passing slowly quickly evenly round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe

what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased

the older her bezique cards and counters her skye terrier her suppositions wealth her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness the younger her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the immaculate conception her green and maroon brushes for charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt her tissue papers

were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable

the indoor exercises formerly intermittently practised subsequently abandoned prescribed in eugen sandows physical strength and how to obtain it which designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility

had any special agility been his in earlier youth

though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles

did either openly allude to their racial difference

neither

what reduced to their simplest reciprocal form were blooms thoughts about stephens thoughts about bloom and blooms thoughts about stephens thoughts about blooms thoughts about stephen

he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not

what the enclosures of reticence removed were their respective parentages

bloom only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag subsequently rudolf bloom of szombathely vienna budapest milan london and dublin and of ellen higgins second daughter of julius higgins born karoly and fanny higgins born hegarty stephen eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin and of mary daughter of richard and christina goulding born grier

had bloom and stephen been baptised and where and by whom cleric or layman

bloom three times by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m a alone in the protestant church of saint nicolas without coombe by james oconnor philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick together under a pump in the village of swords and by the reverend charles malone c c in the church of the three patrons rathgar stephen once by the reverend charles malone c c alone in the church of the three patrons rathgar

did they find their educational careers similar

substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively through a dames school and the high school substituting bloom for stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory junior middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation first arts second arts and arts degree course of the royal university

why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life

because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to him

what two temperaments did they individually represent

the scientific the artistic

what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied rather than towards pure science

certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example the aeronautic parachute the reflecting telescope the spiral corkscrew the safety pin the mineral water siphon the canal lock with winch and sluice the suction pump

were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten

yes rendering obsolete popguns elastic airbladders games of hazard catapults they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from aries to pisces miniature mechanical orreries arithmetical gelatine lozenges geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits globemap playingballs historically costumed dolls

what also stimulated him in his cogitations

the financial success achieved by ephraim marks and charles a james the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 georges street south the latter at his 6 12d shop and worlds fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 henry street admission 2d children 1d and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols vertically of maximum visibility divined horizontally of maximum legibility deciphered and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention to interest to convince to decide

which example did he adduce to induce stephen to deduce that originality though producing its own reward does not invariably conduce to success

his own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart drawn by a beast of burden in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing

what suggested scene was then constructed by stephen

solitary hotel in mountain pass autumn twilight fire lit in dark corner young man seated young woman enters restless solitary she sits she goes to window she stands she sits twilight she thinks on solitary hotel paper she writes she thinks she writes she sighs wheels and hoofs she hurries out he comes from his dark corner he seizes solitary paper he holds it towards fire twilight he reads solitary

what

in sloping upright and backhands queens hotel queens hotel queens ho

what suggested scene was then reconstructed by bloom

the queens hotel ennis county glare where rudolph bloom rudolf virag died on the evening of the 27 june 1886 at some hour unstated in consequence of an overdose of monkshood aconite selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment purchased by him at 1020 am on the morning of 27 june 1886 at the medical hall of francis dennehy 17 church street ennis after having though not in consequence of having purchased at 315 pm on the afternoon of 27 june 1886 a new boater straw hat extra smart after having though not in consequence of having purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid the toxin aforesaid at the general drapery store of james cullen 4 main street ennis

did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition

coincidence

did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see

he preferred himself to see anothers face and listen to anothers words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved

which domestic problem as much as if not more than any other frequently engaged his mind

what to do with our wives

what had been his hypothetical singular solutions

parlour games dominos halma tiddledywinks spillikins cup and ball nap spoil five bezique twentyfive beggar my neighbour draughts chess or backgammon embroidery darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society musical duets mandoline and guitar piano and flute guitar and piano legal scrivenery or envelope addressing biweekly visits to variety entertainments commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels state inspected and medically controlled social visits at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable

what instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned ninth solution

in disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and hebrew characters she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in canada quebec she understood little of political complications internal or balance of power external in calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid after completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas green vitriol and nutgall unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both metempsychosis met him pike hoses alias a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture

what compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons places and things

the false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances proved true by construction the counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person proved true by experiment

how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance

variously by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page by assuming in her when alluding explanatorily latent knowledge by open ridicule in her presence of some absent others ignorant lapse

with what success had he attempted direct instruction

she followed not all a part of the whole gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise with care repeated with greater difficulty remembered forgot with ease with misgiving reremembered rerepeated with error

what system had proved more effective

indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest

example

she disliked umbrella with rain he liked woman with umbrella she disliked new hat with rain he liked woman with new hat he bought new hat with rain she carried umbrella with new hat

accepting the analogy implied in his guests parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce

three seekers of the pure truth moses of egypt moses maimonides author of more neubkim guide of the perplexed and moses mendelssohn of such eminence that from moses of egypt to moses mendelssohn there arose none like moses maimonides

what statement was made under correction by bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth by name aristotle mentioned with permission by stephen

that the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher name uncertain

were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned

felix bartholdy mendelssohn composer baruch spinoza philosopher mendoza pugilist ferdinand lassalle reformer duellist

what fragments of verse from the ancient hebrew and ancient irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest

by stephen suil suil suil arun suil go siocair agus suil go cuin walk walk walk your way walk in safety walk with care

by bloom kifeloch harimon rakatejch mbaad lzamatejch thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate

how was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison

on the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style entitled sweets of sin produced by bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table with a pencil supplied by stephen stephen wrote the irish characters for gee eh dee em simple and modified and bloom in turn wrote the hebrew characters ghimel aleph daleth and in the absence of mem a substituted goph explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers videlicet 3 14 and 100

was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages the extinct and the revived theoretical or practical

theoretical being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary

what points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them

the presence of guttural sounds diacritic aspirations epenthetic and servile letters in both languages their antiquity both having been taught on the plain of shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by fenius farsaigh descendant of noah progenitor of israel and ascendant of heber and heremon progenitors of ireland their archeological genealogical hagiographical exegetical homilectic toponomastic historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees torah talmud mischna and ghemara massor pentateuch book of the dun cow book of ballymote garland of howth book of kells their dispersal persecution survival and revival the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto s marys abbey and masshouse adam and eves tavern the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts the restoration in chanan david of zion and the possibility of irish political autonomy or devolution

what anthem did bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple ethnically irreductible consummation

kolod balejwaw pnimali
nefesch jehudi homijah

why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich

in consequence of defective mnemotechnic

how did the chanter compensate for this deficiency by a periphrastic version of the general text

in what common study did their mutual reflections merge

the increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions semitic and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing celtic

did the guest comply with his hosts request

doubly by appending his signature in irish and roman characters

what was stephens auditive sensation

he heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past

what was blooms visual sensation

he saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future

what were stephens and blooms quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities

visually stephens the traditional figure of hypostasis depicted by johannes damascenus lentulus romanus and epiphanius monachus as leucodermic sesquipedalian with winedark hair

auditively blooms the traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe

what future careers had been possible for bloom in the past and with what exemplars

in the church roman anglican or nonconformist exemplars the very reverend john conmee sj the reverend t salmon dd provost of trinity college dr alexander j dowie at the bar english or irish exemplars seymour bushe kc rufus isaacs kc on the stage modern or shakespearean exemplars charles wyndham high comedian osmond tearle 1901 exponent of shakespeare

did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme

reassuringly their place where none could hear them talk being secluded reassured the decocted beverages allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa having been consumed

recite the first major part of this chanted legend

d little harry hughes and his schoolfellows all went out for to play ball
and the very first ball little harry hughes played
he drove it oer the jews garden wall
and the very second ball little harry hughes played
he broke the jews windows all

how did the son of rudolph receive this first part

with unmixed feeling smiling a jew he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window

recite the second part minor of the legend

then out there came the jews daughter
and she all dressed in green
come back come back you pretty little boy
and play your ball again

i cant come back and i wont come back
without my schoolfellows all
for if my master he did hear
hed make it a sorry ball

she took him by the lilywhite hand
and led him along the hall
until she led him to a room
where none could hear him call

she took a penknife out of her pocket
and cut off his little head
and now hell play his ball no more
for he lies among the dead

how did the father of millicent receive this second part

with mixed feelings unsmiling he heard and saw with wonder a jews daughter all dressed in green

condense stephens commentary
one of all the least of all is the victim predestined once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny it comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting it leads him to a strange habitation to a secret infidel apartment and there implacable immolates him consenting

why was the host victim predestined sad

he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told

why was the host reluctant unresisting still

in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy

why was the host secret infidel silent

he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder the incitation of the hierarchy the superstition of the populace the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity the envy of opulence the influence of retaliation the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism

from which if any of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune

from hypnotic suggestion once waking he had not recognised his sleeping apartment more than once waking he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds from somnambulism once sleeping his body had risen crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and having attained its destination there curled unheated in night attire had lain sleeping

had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family

twice in holles street and in ontario terrace his daughter millicent milly at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression

what other infantile memories had he of her

15 june 1889 a querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion a child renamed padney socks she shook with shocks her moneybox counted his three free moneypenny buttons one tloo tlee a doll a boy a sailor she cast away blond born of two dark she had blond ancestry remote a violation herr hauptmann hainau austrian army proximate a hallucination lieutenant mulvey british navy

what endemic characteristics were present

conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which though interrupted would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals

what memories had he of her adolescence

she relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess on the dukes lawn entreated by an english visitor she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image objection not stated on the south circular road in the company of elsa potter followed by an individual of sinister aspect she went half way down stamer street and turned abruptly back reason of change not stated on the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from mullingar county westmeath making a brief allusion to a local student faculty and year not stated

did that first division portending a second division afflict him

less than he had imagined more than he had hoped

what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently

a temporary departure of his cat

why similarly why differently

similarly because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male mullingar student or of a healing herb valerian differently because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation

in other respects were their differences similar

in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness

as

inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her cf neckarching cat moreover on the free surface of the lake in stephens green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit describing concentric circles of waterrings indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish cf mousewatching cat again in order to remember the date combatants issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair cf earwashing cat furthermore silly milly she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been joseph to whom which she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it he had appeared to have accepted cf hearthdreaming cat hence in passivity in economy in the instinct of tradition in unexpectedness their differences were similar

in what way had he utilised gifts 1 an owl 2 a clock given as matrimonial auguries to interest and to instruct her

as object lessons to explain 1 the nature and habits of oviparous animals the possibility of aerial flight certain abnormalities of vision the secular process of imbalsamation 2 the principle of the pendulum exemplified in bob wheelgear and regulator the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination videlicet 5 511 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression

in what manners did she reciprocate

she remembered on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown derby porcelain ware she provided at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities anticipating his desires she admired a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science the moiety the quarter a thousandth part

what proposal did bloom diambulist father of milly somnambulist make to stephen noctambulist

to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday proper and friday normal on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess

what various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation

for the guest security of domicile and seclusion of study for the host rejuvenation of intelligence vicarious satisfaction for the hostess disintegration of obsession acquisition of correct italian pronunciation

why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jews daughter

because the way to daughter led through mother the way to mother through daughter

to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer

if he had known the late mrs emily sinico accidentally killed at sydney parade railway station 14 october 1903

what inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host

a statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of mrs mary dedalus born goulding 26 june 1903 vigil of the anniversary of the decease of rudolph bloom born virag

was the proposal of asylum accepted

promptly inexplicably with amicability gratefully it was declined

what exchange of money took place between host and guest

the former returned to the latter without interest a sum of money œ17s0 one pound seven shillings advanced by the latter to the former

what counterproposals were alternately advanced accepted modified declined restated in other terms reaccepted ratified reconfirmed

to inaugurate a prearranged course of italian instruction place the residence of the instructed to inaugurate a course of vocal instruction place the residence of the instructress to inaugurate a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues places the residence of both speakers if both speakers were resident in the same place the ship hotel and tavern 6 lower abbey street w and e connery proprietors the national library of ireland 10 kildare street the national maternity hospital 29 30 and 31 holles street a public garden the vicinity of a place of worship a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences if both speakers were resident in different places

what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions

the irreparability of the past once at a performance of albert henglers circus in the rotunda rutland square dublin an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he bloom was his the clowns papa the imprevidibility of the future once in the summer of 1898 he bloom had marked a florin 2s with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by j and t davy family grocers 1 charlemont mall grand canal for circulation on the waters of civic finance for possible circuitous or direct return

was the clown blooms son

no

had blooms coin returned

never

why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him

because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity

he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions

there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay

why did he desist from speculation

because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed

did stephen participate in his dejection

he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void

was this affirmation apprehended by bloom

not verbally substantially

what comforted his misapprehension

that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void

i n what order of precedence with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected

lighted candle in stick borne by
bloom
diaconal hat on ashplant borne by
stephen

with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm

the 113th modus peregrinus in exitu israël de egypto domus jacob de populo barbaro

what did each do at the door of egress

bloom set the candlestick on the floor stephen put the hat on his head

for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress

for a cat

what spectacle confronted them when they first the host then the guest emerged silently doubly dark from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden

the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit

with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations

meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipent lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of sirius alpha in canis major 10 lightyears 57000000000000 miles distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet of arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in 1901 of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity

were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast

of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached

why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result

because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places eg the 9th power of the 9th power of 9 that the result having been obtained 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers

did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution

of a different order of difficulty conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under martian mercurial veneral jovian saturnian neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity

and the problem of possible redemption
the minor was proved by the major

which various features of the constellations were in turn considered

the various colours significant of various degrees of vitality white yellow crimson vermilion cinnabar their degrees of brilliancy their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th their positions the waggoners star walsingham way the chariot of david the annular cinctures of saturn the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns the interdependent gyrations of double suns the independent synchronous discoveries of galileo simon marius piazzi le verrier herschel galle the systematisations attempted by bode and kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion the sidereal origin of meteoric stones the libyan floods on mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of s lawrence martyr 10 august the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms the posited influence of celestial on human bodies the appearance of a star 1st magnitude of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns about the period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star 2nd magnitude of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of presumably similar origin which had effectively or presumably appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about the period of the birth of stephen dedalus and in and from the constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph bloom junior and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons the attendant phenomena of eclipses solar and lunar from immersion to emersion abatement of wind transit of shadow taciturnity of winged creatures emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals persistence of infernal light obscurity of terrestrial waters pallor of human beings

his blooms logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error

that it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman that it was a utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence

was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle

indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet

did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters

it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity

what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman

her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations her nocturnal predominance her satellitic dependence her luminary reflection her constancy under all her phases rising and setting by her appointed times waxing and waning the forced invariability of her aspect her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation her potency over effluent and refluent waters her power to enamour to mortify to invest with beauty to render insane to incite to and aid delinquency the tranquil inscrutability of her visage the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity her omens of tempest and of calm the stimulation of her light her motion and her presence the admonition of her craters her arid seas her silence her splendour when visible her attraction when invisible

what visible luminous sign attracted blooms who attracted stephens gaze

in the second storey rere of his blooms house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by frank ohara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer 16 aungier street

how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person his wife marion molly bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp

with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion

both then were silent

silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces

were they indefinitely inactive

at stephens suggestion at blooms instigation both first stephen then bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first blooms then stephens elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow

similarly

the trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar blooms longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at high school 1880 had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution 210 scholars stephens higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure

what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other

to bloom the problems of irritability tumescence rigidity reactivity dimension sanitariness pelosity to stephen the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus circumcised 1st january holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic church conserved in calcata were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails

what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed

a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo

how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer

by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left withdrawing a bolt from its staple pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress

how did they take leave one of the other in separation

standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base the lines of their valedictory arms meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles

what sound accompanied the union of their tangent the disunion of their respectively centrifugal and centripetal hands

the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of saint george

what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard

by stephen

liliata rutilantium turma circumdet
iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat

by bloom

heigho heigho
heigho heigho

where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south to glasnevin in the north

martin cunningham in bed jack power in bed simon dedalus in bed tom kernan in bed ned lambert in bed joe hynes in bed john henry menton in bed bernard corrigan in bed patsy dignam in bed paddy dignam in the grave

alone what did bloom hear

the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth the double vibration of a jews harp in the resonant lane

alone what did bloom feel

the cold of interstellar space thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of fahrenheit centigrade or réaumur the incipient intimations of proximate dawn

of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him

of companions now in various manners in different places defunct percy apjohn killed in action modder river philip gilligan phthisis jervis street hospital matthew f kane accidental drowning dublin bay philip moisel pyemia heytesbury street michael hart phthisis mater misericordi hospital patrick dignam apoplexy sandymount

what prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain

the disparition of three final stars the diffusion of daybreak the apparition of a new solar disk

had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena

once in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of luke doyle kimmage he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon seated on a wall his gaze turned in the direction of mizrach the east

he remembered the initial paraphenomena

more active air a matutinal distant cock ecclesiastical clocks at various points avine music the isolated tread of an early wayfarer the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon

did he remain

with deep inspiration he returned retraversing the garden reentering the passage reclosing the door with brief suspiration he reassumed the candle reascended the stairs reapproached the door of the front room hallfloor and reentered

what suddenly arrested his ingress

the right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered

describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures

a sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled union jack an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa the walnut sideboard a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table

describe them

one a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere which repelled in recoil had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration the other a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves placed directly opposite the former its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush

what significances attached to these two chairs

significances of similitude of posture of symbolism of circumstantial evidence of testimonial supermanence

what occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard

a vertical piano cadby with exposed keyboard its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes its musicrest supporting the music in the key of g natural for voice and piano of loves old sweet song words by g clifton bingham composed by j l molloy sung by madam antoinette sterling open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum forte pedal animato sustained pedal ritirando close

with what sensations did bloom contemplate in rotation these objects

with strain elevating a candlestick with pain feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence with attention focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active with solicitation bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe with amusement remembering dr malachi mulligans scheme of colour containing the gradation of green with pleasure repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration

his next proceeding

from an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone one inch in height placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus illustrated entitled agendath netaim unfolded the same examined it superficially rolled it into a thin cylinder ignited it in the candleflame applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion

what followed this operation

that truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense

what homothetic objects other than the candlestick stood on the mantelpiece

a timepiece of striated connemara marble stopped at the hour of 446 am on the 21 march 1896 matrimonial gift of matthew dillon a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle an embalmed owl matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper

what interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and bloom

in the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl before the mirror the matrimonial gift of alderman john hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded bloom while bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of luke and caroline doyle

what composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention

the image of a solitary ipsorelative mutable aliorelative man

why solitary ipsorelative

brothers and sisters had he none
yet that mans father was his grandfathers son

why mutable aliorelative

from infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix from maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator

what final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror

the optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite

hoziers history of the russo  turkish war

what among other data did the second volume of the work in question contain

the name of a decisive battle forgotten frequently remembered by a decisive officer major brian cooper tweedy remembered

why firstly and secondly did he not consult the work in question

firstly in order to exercise mnemotechnic secondly because after an interval of amnesia when seated at the central table about to consult the work in question he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement plevna

what caused him consolation in his sitting posture

the candour nudity pose tranquillity youth grace sex counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table an image of narcissus purchased by auction from p a wren 9 bachelors walk

what caused him irritation in his sitting posture

inhibitory pressure of collar size 17 and waistcoat 5 buttons two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion

how was the irritation allayed

he removed his collar with contained black necktie and collapsible stud from his neck to a position on the left of the table he unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat trousers shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points right and left on the summits of the mammary prominences he unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons arranged in pairs of which one incomplete

did the process of divestiture continue

sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions then inclined he disnoded the laceknots unhooked and loosened the laces took off each of his two boots for the second time detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted raised his right foot and having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender took off his right sock placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment

why with satisfaction

might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock

not impossibly with 1 or 2 stripper cows 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements eg an endtoend churn a turnip pulper etc

what would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry

arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order that of gardener groundsman cultivator breeder and at the zenith of his career resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto semper paratus duly recorded in the court directory bloom leopold p m p p c k p l l d honoris cause bloomville dundrum and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence mr and mrs leopold bloom have left kingstown for england

what course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity

a course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate real and personal to the crown loyal to the highest constituted power in the land actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution the upholding of the letter of the law common statute and law merchant against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations all resuscitators by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings of venville rights obsolete by desuetude all orotund instigators of international persecution all perpetuators of international animosities all menial molestors of domestic conviviality all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality

prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth

to master percy apjohn at high school in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the irish protestant church to which his father rudolf virag later rudolph bloom had been converted from the israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the society for promoting christianity among the jews subsequently abjured by him in favour of roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888 to daniel magrane and francis wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship terminated by the premature emigration of the former he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial eg canadian expansion and the evolutionary theories of charles darwin expounded in the descent of man and the origin of species in 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by james fintan lalor john fisher murray john mitchel j f x obrien and others the agrarian policy of michael davitt the constitutional agitation of charles stewart parnell m p for cork city the programme of peace retrenchment and reform of william ewart gladstone m p for midlothian n b and in support of his political convictions had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on northumberland road to see the entrance 2 february 1888 into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20000 divided into 120 trade corporations bearing 2000 torches in escort of the marquess of ripon and john morley

what rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase

were there schemes of wider scope

a scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal hydraulic power obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at dublin bar or at head of water at poulaphouca or powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500000 w h p of electricity a scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the north bull at dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland used for golf links and rifle ranges an asphalted esplanade with casinos booths shooting galleries hotels boardinghouses readingrooms establishments for mixed bathing a scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk a scheme for the development of irish tourist traffic in and around dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and ringsend charabancs narrow gauge local railways and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation 10 per person per day guide trilingual included a scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over irish waterways when freed from weedbeds a scheme to connect by tramline the cattle market north circular road and prussia street with the quays sheriff street lower and east wall parallel with the link line railway laid in conjunction with the great southern and western railway line between the cattle park liffey junction and terminus of midland great western railway 43 to 45 north wall in proximity to the terminal stations or dublin branches of great central railway midland railway of england city of dublin steam packet company lancashire yorkshire railway company dublin and glasgow steam packet company glasgow dublin and londonderry steam packet company laird line british and irish steam packet company dublin and morecambe steamers london and north western railway company dublin port and docks board landing sheds and transit sheds of palgrave murphy and company steamship owners agents for steamers from mediterranean spain portugal france belgium and holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the dublin united tramways company limited to be covered by graziers fees

positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis

given a guarantee equal to the sum sought the support by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donors lifetime or by bequest after donors painless extinction of eminent financiery blum pasha rothschild guggenheim hirsch montefiore morgan rockefeller possessing fortunes in 6 figures amassed during a successful life and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done

what eventually would render him independent of such wealth

the independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore

for what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation

it was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality

his justifications

as a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 27ths viz 20 years passed in sleep as a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any persons desires has been realised as a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence

what did he fear

the committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions

what were habitually his final meditations

of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder a poster novelty with all extraneous accretions excluded reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life

i rudolph virag now resident at no 52 clanbrassil street dublin formerly of szombathely in the kingdom of hungary hereby give notice that i have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of rudolph bloom

what other objects relative to rudolph bloom born virag were in the 2nd drawer

what fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke

tomorrow will be a week that i received it is no use leopold to be with your dear mother that is not more to stand to her all for me is out be kind to athos leopold my dear son always of me das herr gott dein

what reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in bloom

an old man widower unkempt hair in bed with head covered sighing an infirm dog athos aconite resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison

why did bloom experience a sentiment of remorse

because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices

as

the prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots the circumcision of male infants the supernatural character of judaic scripture the ineffability of the tetragrammaron the sanctity of the sabbath

how did these beliefs and practices now appear to him

not more rational than they had then appeared not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared

what first reminiscence had he of rudolph bloom deceased

rudolph bloom deceased narrated to his son leopold bloom aged 6 a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between dublin london florence milan vienna budapest szombathely with statements of satisfaction his grandfather having seen maria theresa empress of austria queen of hungary with commercial advice having taken care of pence the pounds having taken care of themselves leopold bloom aged 6 had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of europe political and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned

had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener

in narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences

what idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia

occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper

what two phenomena of senescence were more frequent

the myopic digital calculation of coins eructation consequent upon repletion

what object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences

the endowment policy the bank passbook the certificate of the possession of scrip

reduce bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune from which these supports protected him and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity

successively in descending helotic order poverty that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts the poor rate and deputy cess collector mendicancy that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s 4d in the  sandwichman distributor of throwaways nocturnal vagrant insinuating sycophant maimed sailor blind stripling superannuated bailiffs man marfeast lickplate spoilsport pickthank eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella destitution the inmate of old mans house royal hospital kilmainham the inmate of simpsons hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight nadir of misery the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper

with which attendant indignities

the unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females the contempt of muscular males the acceptance of fragments of bread the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles worth little or nothing or less than nothing

by what could such a situation be precluded

by decease change of state by departure change of place

which preferably

the latter by the line of least resistance

what considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable

constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects the habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated the necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest

what considerations rendered it not irrational

the parties concerned uniting had increased and multiplied which being done offspring produced and educed to maturity the parties if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication which was absurd to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties which was impossible

what considerations rendered it desirable

the attractive character of certain localities in ireland and abroad as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures

in ireland

the cliffs of moher the windy wilds of connemara lough neagh with submerged petrified city the giants causeway fort camden and fort carlisle the golden vale of tipperary the islands of aran the pastures of royal meath brigids elm in kildare the queens island shipyard in belfast the salmon leap the lakes of killarney

would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear

ever he would wander selfcompelled to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets astronomical waifs and strays to the extreme boundary of space passing from land to land among peoples amid events somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly suncompelled obey the summons of recall whence disappearing from the constellation of the northern crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger a wreaker of justice on malefactors a dark crusader a sleeper awakened with financial resources by supposition surpassing those of rothschild or of the silver king

blooms acts

he deposited the articles of clothing on a chair removed his remaining articles of clothing took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed

how

with circumspection as invariably when entering an abode his own or not his own with solicitude the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain prudently as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder lightly the less to disturb reverently the bed of conception and of birth of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage of sleep and of death

what did his limbs when gradually extended encounter

new clean bedlinen additional odours the presence of a human form female hers the imprint of a human form male not his some crumbs some flakes of potted meat recooked which he removed

if he had smiled why would he have smiled

to reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one each imagining himself to be first last only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity

what preceding series

assuming mulvey to be the first term of his series penrose bartell darcy professor goodwin julius mastiansky john henry menton father bernard corrigan a farmer at the royal dublin societys horse show maggot oreilly matthew dillon valentine blake dillon lord mayor of dublin christopher callinan lenehan an italian organgrinder an unknown gentleman in the gaiety theatre benjamin dollard simon dedalus andrew pisser burke joseph cuffe wisdom hely alderman john hooper dr francis brady father sebastian of mount argus a bootblack at the general post office hugh e blazes boylan and so each and so on to nolast term

what were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed

reflections on his vigour a bounder corporal proportion a billsticker commercial ability a bester impressionability a boaster

why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour corporal proportion and commercial ability

because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence inflammably transmitted first with alarm then with understanding then with desire finally with fatigue with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension

with what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected

envy jealousy abnegation equanimity

envy

of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse

jealousy

because a nature full and volatile in its free state was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied with inverse proportion of increase and decrease with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced if desired a fluctuation of pleasure

abnegation

in virtue of a acquaintance initiated in september 1903 in the establishment of george mesias merchant tailor and outfitter 5 eden quay b hospitality extended and received in kind reciprocated and reappropriated in person c comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity colleagual altruism and amorous egoism d extraracial attraction intraracial inhibition supraracial prerogative e an imminent provincial musical tour common current expenses net proceeds divided

equanimity

as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his her and their natured natures of dissimilar similarity as not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun as less reprehensible than theft highway robbery cruelty to children and animals obtaining money under false pretences forgery embezzlement misappropriation of public money betrayal of public trust malingering mayhem corruption of minors criminal libel blackmail contempt of court arson treason felony mutiny on the high seas trespass burglary jailbreaking practice of unnatural vice desertion from armed forces in the field perjury poaching usury intelligence with the kings enemies impersonation criminal assault manslaughter wilful and premeditated murder as not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances foods beverages acquired habits indulged inclinations significant disease as more than inevitable irreparable

why more abnegation than jealousy less envy than equanimity

from outrage matrimony to outrage adultery there arose nought but outrage copulation yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated

what retribution if any

assassination never as two wrongs did not make one right duel by combat no divorce not now exposure by mechanical artifice automatic bed or individual testimony concealed ocular witness not yet suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained selfinflicted not impossibly if any positively connivance introduction of emulation material a prosperous rival agency of publicity moral a successful rival agent of intimacy depreciation alienation humiliation separation protecting the one separated from the other protecting separator from both

by what reflections did he a conscious reactor against the void incertitude justify to himself his sentiments

the preordained frangibility of the hymen the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done the fallaciously inferred debility of the female the muscularity of the male the variations of ethical codes the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition parsed as masculine subject monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition parsed as feminine subject auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent in the passive voice the continued product of seminators by generation the continual production of semen by distillation the futility of triumph or protest or vindication the inanity of extolled virtue the lethargy of nescient matter the apathy of the stars

in what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections reduced to their simplest forms converge

satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored the land of the midnight sun the islands of the blessed the isles of greece the land of promise of adipose posterior female hemispheres redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression expressive of mute immutable mature animality

the visible signs of antesatisfaction

an approximate erection a solicitous adversion a gradual elevation a tentative revelation a silent contemplation

then

he kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump on each plump melonous hemisphere in their mellow yellow furrow with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation

the visible signs of postsatisfaction

a silent contemplation a tentative velation a gradual abasement a solicitous aversion a proximate erection

what followed this silent action

somnolent invocation less somnolent recognition incipient excitation catechetical interrogation

with what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation

negative he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between martha clifford and henry flower the public altercation at in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of bernard kiernan and co limited 8 9 and 10 little britain street the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of gertrude gerty surname unknown positive he included mention of a performance by mrs bandman palmer of leah at the gaiety theatre 46 47 48 49 south king street an invitation to supper at wynns murphys hotel 35 36 and 37 lower abbey street a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled sweets of sin anonymous author a gentleman of fashion a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display the victim since completely recovered being stephen dedalus professor and author eldest surviving son of simon dedalus of no fixed occupation an aeronautical feat executed by him narrator in the presence of a witness the professor and author aforesaid with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility

was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications

absolutely

which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration

stephen dedalus professor and author

what limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration

by the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth 8 september 1870 viz 8 october and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 june 1889 having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 september of the same year and complete carnal intercourse with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ having last taken place 5 weeks previous viz 27 november 1893 to the birth on 29 december 1893 of second and only male issue deceased 9 january 1894 aged 11 days there remained a period of 10 years 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ by the narrator a limitation of activity mental and corporal inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty indicated by catamenic hemorrhage of the female issue of narrator and listener 15 september 1903 there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females listener and issue complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed

how

by various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither the place where the time at which the duration for which the object with which in the case of temporary absences projected or effected

what moved visibly above the listeners and the narrators invisible thoughts

the upcast reflection of a lamp and shade an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow

in what directions did listener and narrator lie

listener s e by e narrator n w by w on the 53rd parallel of latitude n and 6th meridian of longitude w at an angle of 45ø to the terrestrial equator

in what state of rest or motion

in what posture

listener reclined semilaterally left left hand under head right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg flexed in the attitude of geatellus fulfilled recumbent big with seed narrator reclined laterally left with right and left legs flexed the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by percy apjohn the childman weary the manchild in the womb
