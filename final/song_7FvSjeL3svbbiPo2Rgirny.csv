life is so boring
its really got me snoring
im wearing out the flooring in a cheap motel
but i dont have to work and
i might be sinning
but im never gonna have to hear the rings of school bells
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo

verse 2
dont you remember
you told me in december
that a boy is not a man until he makes a stand
well im not a genius
but maybe youll remember this
i never said i ever wanted to be a man
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo

chorus
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
hey

my mom is so caring
shes really got me staring
at all the crazy little things she does for sure
and i cant seem to think of
another kind of love
that a boy could ever get from anyone but her
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo
dodo dodododo dodo dododododo

chorus
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
i get nervous when she comes around
when she comes around when she comes around
