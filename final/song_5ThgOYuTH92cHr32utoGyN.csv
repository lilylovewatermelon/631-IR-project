five am on the bathroom floor from the night before
do you find me dreadful
what a shame such a sad disgrace
such a pretty face but shes not regretful

prechorus
am i beautiful
am i usable

chorus
its killing time again
put on your face and lets pretend
these killing lights wont kill us all again

verse 2
three am on the city street
when the air is sweet ive had my mouth full
but it seems that outside the screen
such a pretty face often will look dreadful

prechorus
am i beautiful
am i usable

chorus
its killing time again
put on your face and lets pretend
these killing lights wont kill us all again
its killing time again
put on your face and lets pretend
these killing lights wont kill us all again
