margaret thatcher on tv
shocked by the deaths that took place in beijing
seems strange that she should be offended
the same orders are given by her

ive said this before now
you said i was childish and youll say it now
remember what i told you
if they hated me they will hate you

chorus
englands not the mythical land of madame george and roses
its the home of police who kill black boys on mopeds
and i love my boy and thats why im leavin
i dont want him to be aware that theres any such thing as grievin

verse 2
young mother down at smithfield
5 am looking for food for her kids
in her arms she holds three cold babies
and the first words that they learned were please

these are dangerous days
to say what you feel is to make your own grave
remember what i told you
if you were of the world they would love you
