well you aint that old but you aint that young
youve lived a life but you aint quite done
all eyes on you everywhere you go
its all good till you get too close

chorus
girl youre gonna hurt somebody
make somebody bleed
girl youre gonna hurt somebody
god i hope its me

verse 2
theres an innocence there this time of night
is it in your words is it in your eyes
and your red lipstick like a smoking gun
it could be aimed at anyone

chorus
girl youre gonna hurt somebody
make somebody bleed
girl youre gonna hurt somebody
god i hope its me

verse 3
theres a simple truth to the morning sun
things dont change they just light up
with a frontie mind and a restless heart
girl you cant change the way you are
