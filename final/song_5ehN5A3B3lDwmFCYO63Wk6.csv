id put the whiskey back in the bottle
put the smoke back in the joint
look up at the sky and say
okay okay okay think you made your point
id cover up the pool at skymont
id take some girls out of my phone
give the nightlife back to nashville
one night at a time til all the regrets gone

chorus
and id drive a thousand miles to your house
walk in like i walked out
put the tears back in your eyes
cause all my lies could still come true
id tell you everything was alright
and hold you baby all night
when your heart was all patched up
and our love was good as new
id take 2016
and give it back to you

verse 2
i thought i wanted my freedom
i told myself id have a ball
but it turns out going out and chasing
dreams and lonely women
aint freedom after all
if i could go back now
and take it back somehow

id drive a thousand miles to your house
walk in like i walked out
put the tears back in your eyes
cause all my lies could still come true
id tell you everything was alright
id hold you baby all night
when your heart was all fixed up
and our love was good as new
id take 2016
and give it back to you

bridge
if i could wrangle all my sins
take em back and make amends
and do it all over again
id take the wrongs and make em right
all the lonesome lonely nights
pack em up and haul em all back home to you

chorus
and id drive a thousand miles to your house
walk in like i walked out
put the tears back in your eyes
cause all my lies could still come true
id tell you everything was alright
id hold you baby all night
when your heart was all patched up
and our love was good as new
id take 2016
and all the lonely nights in between
and give em back to you
give it all back to youembed"
