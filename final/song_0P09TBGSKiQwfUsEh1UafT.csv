one two three four

full company except hamilton and burr

burr
there are ten things you need to know

company
number one

burr
we rowed across the hudson at dawn
my friend william p van ness signed on as my—

burr and company
number two

burr
hamilton arrived with his crew
nathaniel pendleton and a doctor that he knew

company
number three
you might also likeburr
i watched hamilton examine the terrain
i wish i could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain
this man has poisoned my political pursuits

company
most disputes die and no one shoots
number four

burr
hamilton drew first position
looking to the world like a man on a mission
this is a soldier with a marksman’s ability
the doctor turned around so he could have deniability

company
five

burr
now i didn’t know this at the time
but we were—

burr and philip  hamilton
near the same spot near the same spot
your son died is that my son died is that
why—why—
company
six

burr
he examined his gun with such rigor
i watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

company
seven

burr
confession time here’s what i got
my fellow soldiers’ll tell you i’m a terrible shot

company
number eight

burrhamiltonensemble men
your last chance to negotiate
send in your seconds see if they can set the record straight

burr
they won’t teach you this in your classes
but look it up hamilton was wearing his glasses
why if not to take deadly aim
it’s him or me the world will never be the same
i had only one thought before the slaughter
this man will not make an orphan of my daughter
company
number nine

burr
look him in the eye aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then count

company
one two three four five six seven eight nine
number ten paces fire—
hamilton
i imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
is this where it gets me on my feet sev’ral feet ahead of me
i see it coming do i run or fire my gun or let it be
there is no beat no melody
burr my first friend my enemy
maybe the last face i ever see
if i throw away my shot is this how you’ll remember me
what if this bullet is my legacy

legacy what is a legacy
it’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
i wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
america you great unfinished symphony you sent for me
you let me make a difference
a place where even orphan immigrants
can leave their fingerprints and rise up
i’m running out of time i’m running and my time’s up
wise up eyes up
i catch a glimpse of the other side
laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side
my son is on the other side
he’s with my mother on the other side
washington is watching from the other side
teach me how to say goodbye
rise up rise up rise up
eliza

my love take your time
i’ll see you on the other side
raise a glass to freedom

burr and company
he aims his pistol at the sky—

burr
wait
burr
i strike him right between his ribs
i walk towards him but i am ushered away
they row him back across the hudson
i get a drink

company
aaaah
aaaah
aaaah

burr
i hear wailing in the streets

company
aaaah
aaaah
aaaah

burr
somebody tells me “you’d better hide”

company
aaaah
aaaah
aaaah

burr
they say

burr and angelica
angelica and eliza—
burr
were both at his side when he died
death doesn’t discriminate
between the sinners and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
history obliterates
in every picture it paints
it paints me and all my mistakes
when alexander aimed
at the sky
he may have been the first one to die
but i’m the one who paid for it

i survived but i paid for it
now i’m the villain in your history
i was too young and blind to see
i should’ve known
i should’ve known
the world was wide enough for both hamilton and me
the world was wide enough for both hamilton and me33embed"
