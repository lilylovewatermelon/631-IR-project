breathe a sigh and push tonight
open your eyes and let the light
take you away forget the day
the hit makes you fizz something you gotta say

and i can still see the old days in your face
we have grown and we own it all

verse 2
this is a rave not a grave
everyone head to the light
cause we are not not afraid
of pushing the limit tonight

chorus
were gonna rock your body
lets get on it
the beat of your heart will ignite
were gonna shock your body
cpr it
the dead wont be sleeping tonight
ooh

verse 3
take a risk and feel the rush
its just begun a change in us
open your mind your mind your mind
and dont you be worried about what you find
you might also likeand i can still see the old days in your face
we have grown and we own it all

this is a rave not a grave
everyone head to the light

chorus
cause we are not not afraid
of pushing the limit tonight
were gonna rock your body
lets get on it
the beat of your heart will ignite
were gonna shock your body
cpr it
the dead wont be sleeping tonight

this is a rave not a grave
this is a rave not a grave
we are not not afraid

chorus
were gonna rock your body
lets get on it
the beat of your heart will ignite
were gonna shock your body
cpr it
the dead wont be sleeping tonight
were gonna rock your body
lets get on it
the beat of your heart will ignite
were gonna shock your body
cpr it
the dead wont be sleeping tonight
the dead wont be sleeping
the dead wont be sleeping
