that bino the realest uh
this beat made me kill it uh
her feet to the ceiling she said that she love me
she never said that in college 3005 is our mileage
im in my lane like a prius because im movin in silence
you still aint broke down yet yeah
all the flashing lights and a couple crown vics
wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
tell your nigga speed up she dont wanna get left
relationships look closer in that rear view
finally slow it down and realize she aint nowhere near you
so now you gotta stop stop park park
put that shit in neutral
yeah you really love her but is she worth yo future
your ciara your beyonc√© they be sayin he got money
think that kim be wit kanye if he left drive in the driveway
yeah i know who you are yeah i know who you is

i see you in that new ride i flash my lights when i see you
