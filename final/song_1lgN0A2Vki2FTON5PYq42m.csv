as a child you would wait and watch from far away
but you always knew that youd be the one
that work while they all play
in youth youd lay awake at night and scheme
of all the things that you would change
but it was just a dream

chorus
here we are dont turn away now dont turn away
we are the warriors that built this town this town
here we are dont turn away now dont turn away
we are the warriors that built this town this town
from dust

verse 2
the time will come when youll have to rise
above the rest and prove yourself
your spirit never dies
farewell ive gone to take my throne above
but dont weep for me cause this will be
the labor of my love

chorus
here we are dont turn away now dont turn away
we are the warriors that built this town this town
here we are dont turn away now dont turn away
we are the warriors that built this town this town
from dust

here we are dont turn away now dont turn away
