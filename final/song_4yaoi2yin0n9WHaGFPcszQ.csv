come away with me in the night
come away
and i will write you a song

verse 2
come away with me on a bus
come away where they cant tempt us
with their lies

bridge
and i wanna walk with you
on a cloudy day
in fields where the yellow grass grows kneehigh
so wont you try to come

verse 3
come away with me and well kiss
on a mountaintop
come away
and ill never stop loving you

instrumental interlude

outro
i wanna wake up with the rain
falling on a tin roof
while im safe there in your arms
so all i ask is
come away with me in the night
come away with me
come away
come away with me in the nightsee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
