tell me just what i should be expecting
‘cause here i am on my own free will
fortune favors the brave
so they say
i might as well fix up and play your game
make the memory the reason
remembering the time when you and i fell behind
but found a way to justify

prechorus
we cannot replay
the aesthetic or feel
we had our brighter day
was it synthetic or real

chorus x2
ill protect the memory
if baby you can’t recall it
you can’t recall that
22nd january
if baby you can’t recall it
i won’t forget that

verse 2
was it just as real as you expected
does looking back give you a chill
show me something you prefer today yeah
or maybe youve grown up and im the same
that amnesia gave you freedom
or maybe you’re the kind who tells a lie just to lie
and never have to say goodbye

bridge
putting faith in your relief
ill suspend your disbelief
