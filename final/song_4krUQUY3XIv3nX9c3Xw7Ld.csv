yeah its that knock right here
you fuck around not have the right speakers in your system
your shit be soundin like this funny sounds
big thangs thick chains aint shit changed
get brain in the fourdotsix range
shit mane switch lanes
every town i hit switch lames bitch flip big caine

verse 1 jayz
i givin em whiplash when im whippin the whip fast
which one pick one nigga i got a sick stash
continental ts no tints like i got a thick stack
big cigar old money when i drop it its so funny
sixfour switches slam doors on 6s
big trucks when i wanna fuck and its time to get ass
i turn automobiles to hotels on wheels
i got money for a room its just the fact that im trill
bitches love when i cruise up the boulevard
they have contests to guess which car ima pull out the yard
they know i come for dolo and pull off with a broad
spin away spend a day tryin to pull menage
just mackin this gorgeous sunlight hit the ice its flawless
run lights like im the king of new york im lawless
bitches they wanna hang like plaques in the office
cause i push black porsches benzs and jaguarses
when the rags off it gat on my lap im that cautious
never trust grimyass new yorkers
specially when youre sittin on 20s they get nauseous
standin in the azure with white air forces

you can catch me in the parkin lot
hollerin at bitches parkin lot pimpin
everyday we be off the chains
workin with grain sittin on them thangs
tryin to find out where them dollars at dollars at
so when i holla at you holla back holla back
everyday we be off the chains

verse 2 beanie sigel
holla at me mami sigel
you can catch mack in the parkin lot pimpin crazy
s5 navy cedes sittin on 80
thats four dubs not s4 dub
stash box push hot wheel like matchbox
bitches wanna push my world they flash box
160 push my wheel mash cops
cause 160 took my wheel to cash drop
run 60 you big will match cop
lookin through the rear view and mack was wylin
new driver screwdriver the cracked steerin column
pushin somethin stolen blastin picture me rollin
back then couldnt picture me rulin
now the truth different mack come through coupe roof missin
im the truth til my fuckin roof missin
mac stay stuck in the coupe to school pigeons
feathers gettin plucked in the truck from loose chickens listen
chorus lil mo
you can catch me in the parkin lot
hollerin at bitches parkin lot pimpin
everyday we be off the chains
workin with grain sittin on them thangs
tryin to find out where them dollars at dollars at
so when i holla at you holla back holla back
everyday we be off the chains
aint nothin different parkin lot pimpin

verse 3 memphis bleek
yo ayo i dip dip dive what can i say
i cant fit em all inside the escalade
so i called up murder to further my parkin lot pimpin
told em get the impala so i can start dippin
lay back seat recline they notice the hand
car movin slow driven by the invisible man
everything on the dash digital and
i got a fast stashbox dont make me spit at you man
in the parkin lot where i spark a lot
i come to show my new feet slide off with a few freaks
bleek turn up the beats
turn up the heat then we burn up the streets bitch

chorus lil mo
you can catch me in the parkin lot
hollerin at bitches parkin lot pimpin
everyday we be off the chains
workin with grain sittin on them thangs
tryin to find out where them dollars at dollars at
so when i holla at you holla back holla back
everyday we be off the chains
aint nothin different parkin lot pimpin
you can catch me in the parkin lot
hollerin at bitches parkin lot pimpin
everyday we be off the chains
workin with grain sittin on them thangs
tryin to find out where them dollars at dollars at
so when i holla at you holla back holla back
everyday we be off the chains
aint nothin different parkin lot pimpin7embed"
