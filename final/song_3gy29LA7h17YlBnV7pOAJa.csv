have patience in this sudden smoke from hell
so things disguise themselvesi cannot see
my own hand held thus broad before my face
and know it again answer you then that means
tell over twice what i the first time told
six months ago twas here i do believe
fronting you same three in this very room
i stood and told you yet now no one laughs
who thennay dear my lords but laugh you did
as good as laugh what in a judge we style
laughterno levity nothing indecorous lords
onlyi think i apprehend the mood
there was the blameless shrug permissible smirk
the pens pretence at play with the pursed mouth
the titter stifled in the hollow palm
which rubbed the eyebrow and caressed the nose
when i first told my tale they meant you know
the sly one all this we are bound believe
well he can say no other than what he says
we have been young toocome theres greater guilt
let him but decently disembroil himself
scramble from out the scrape nor move the mud
we solid ones may risk a fingerstretch
and now you sit as grave stare as aghast
as if i were a phantom now tisfriend
collect yourselfno laughing matter more
counsel the court in this extremity
tell us againtell that for telling which
i got the jocular piece of punishment
was sent to lounge a little in the place
whence now of a sudden here you summon me
to take the intelligence from justyour lips
you judge tommati who then tittered most
that she i helped eight months since to escape
her husband is retaken by the same
three days ago if i have seized your sense
i being disallowed to interfere
meddle or make in a matter none of mine
for you and law were guardians quite enough
o the innocent without a pert priests help
and that he has butchered her accordingly
as she foretold and as myself believed
and so foretelling and believing so
we were punished both of us the merry way
therefore tell once again the tale for what
pompilia is only dying while i speak
why does the mirth hang fire and miss the smile
my masters theres an old book you should con
for strange adventures applicable yet
tis stuffed with do you know that there was once
this thing a multitude of worthy folk
took recreation watched a certain group
of soldiery intent upon a game
how first they wrangled but soon fell to play
threw dicethe best diversion in the world
a word in your earthey are now casting lots
ay with that gesture quaint and cry uncouth
for the coat of one murdered an hour ago
i am a priesttalk of what i have learned
pompilia is bleeding out her life belike
gasping away the latest breath of all
this minute while i talknot while you laugh
yet being sobered now what is it you ask
by way of explanation theres the fact
it seems to fill the universe with sight
and soundfrom the four corners of this earth
tells itself over to my sense at least
but you may want it lower set i the scale
too vast too close it clangs in the ear perhaps
youd stand back just to comprehend it more
well then let me the hollow rock condense
the voice o the sea and wind interpret you
the mystery of this murder god above
it is too paltry such a transference
o the storms roar to the cranny of the stone
this deed you saw beginwhy does its end
surprise you why should the event enforce
the lesson we ourselves learned she and i
from the first o the fact and taught you all in vain
this guido from whose throat you took my grasp
was this man to be favoured now or feared
let do his will or have his will restrained
in the relation with pompiliasay
did any other man need interpose
oh though first comer though as strange at the work
as fribble must be coxcomb fool thats near
to knave as say a priest who fears the world
was he bound brave the peril save the doomed
or go on sing his snatch and pluck his flower
keep the straight path and let the victim die
i held so you decided otherwise
saw no such peril therefore no such need
to stop song loosen flower and leave path law
law was aware and watching would suffice
wanted no priests intrusion palpably
pretence too manifest a subterfuge
whereupon i priest coxcomb fribble and fool
ensconced me in my corner thus rebuked
a kind of culprit overzealous hound
kicked for his pains to kennel i gave place
to you and let the law reign paramount
i left pompilia to your watch and ward
and now you point methere and thus she lies
men for the last time what do you want with me
is ityou acknowledge as it were a use
a profit in employing meat length
i may conceivably help the august law
i am free to break the blow next hawk that swoops
on next dove nor miss much of good repute
or what if this your summons after all
be but the form of mere release no more
which turns the key and lets the captive go
i have paid enough in person at civita
am freewhat more need i concern me with
thank you i am rehabilitated then
a very reputable priest but she
the glory of life the beauty of the world
the splendour of heavenwell sirs does no one move
do i speak ambiguously the glory i say
and the beauty i say and splendour still say i
who a priest trained to live my whole life long
on beauty and splendour solely at their source
godhave thus recognised my food in one
you tell me is fast dying while we talk
pompiliahow does lenity to me
remit one deathbed pang to her come smile
the proper wink at the hotheaded youth
who lets his soul show through transparent words
the mundane love thats sin and scandal too
you are all struck acquiescent now it seems
it seems the oldest gravest signor here
even the redoubtable tommati sits
chopfallenunderstands how law might take
service like mine of brain and heart and hand
in good part better late than never law
you understand of a sudden gospel too
has a claim here may possibly pronounce
consistent with my priesthood worthy christ
that i endeavoured to save pompilia
then
you were wrong you see thats well to see though late
thats all we may expect of man this side
the grave his good isknowing he is bad
thus will it be with us when the books ope
and we stand at the bar on judgmentday
well then i have a mind to speak see cause
to relume the quenched flax by this dreadful light
burn my soul out in showing you the truth
i heard last time i stood here to be judged
what is priestsdutylabour to pluck tares
and weed the corn of molinism let me
make you hear this time how in such a case
man be he in the priesthood or at plough
mindful of christ or marching step by step
withwhats his style the other potentate
who bids have courage and keep honour safe
nor let minuter admonition teaze
how he is bound better or worse to act
earth will not end through this misjudgment no
for you and the others like you sure to come
fresh work is sure to followwickedness
that wants withstanding many a man of blood
many a man of guile will clamour yet
bid you redress his grievanceas he clutched
the prey forsooth a stranger stepped between
and theres the good gripe in pure waste my part
is done i the doing it i pass away
out of the world i want no more with earth
let me in heavens name use the very snuff
o the taper in one last spark shall show truth
for a moment show pompilia who was true
not for her sake but yours if she is dead
oh sirs she can be loved by none of you
most or least priestly saints to do us good
must be in heaven i seem to understand
we never find them saints before at least
be her first prayer then presently for you
she had done the good to me

what is all this
there i was born have lived shall die a fool
this is a foolish outsetmight with cause
give colour to the very lie o the man
the murderermake as if i loved his wife
in the way he called love he is the fool there
why had there been in me the touch of taint
i had picked up so much of knavespolicy
as hide it keep one hand pressed on the place
suspected of a spot would damn us both
or no not hernot even if any of you
dares think that i i the face of death her death
thats in my eyes and ears and brain and heart
lieif he does let him i mean to say
so he stop there stay thought from smirching her
the snowwhite soul that angels fear to take
untenderly but all the same i know
i too am taintless and i bare my breast
you cant think men as you are all of you
but that to hear thus suddenly such an end
of such a wonderful white soul that comes
of a man and murderer calling the white black
must shake me trouble and disadvantage sirs
only seventeen
why good and wise you are
you might at the beginning stop my mouth
so none would be to speak for her that knew
i talk impertinently and you bear
all the same this it is to have to do
with honest hearts they easily may err
but in the main they wish well to the truth
you are christians somehow no one ever plucked
a rag even from the body of the lord
to wear and mock with but despite himself
he looked the greater and was the better yes
i shall go on now does she need or not
i keep calm calm ill keep as monk that croons
transcribing battle earthquake famine plague
from parchment to his cloisters chronicle
not one word more from the point now

i begin
yes i am one of your body and a priest
also i am a younger son o the house
oldest now greatest once in my birthtown
arezzo i recognise no equal there
i want all arguments all sorts of arms
that seem to serveuse this for a reason wait
not therefore thrust into the church because
o the piece of bread one gets there we were first
of fiesole that rings still with the fame
of capoinsacco our progenitor
when florence ruined fiesole our folk
migrated to the victorcity and there
flourishedour palace and our tower attest
in the old mercatothis was years ago
four hundred fullno it wants fourteen just
our arms are those of fiesole itself
the shield quartered with white and red a branch
are the salviati of us nothing more
that were good help to the church but better still
not simply for the advantage of my birth
i the way of the world was i proposed for priest
but because theres an illustration late
i the day thats loved and looked to as a saint
still in arezzo he was bishop of
sixty years since he spent to the last doit
his bishopsrevenue among the poor
and used to tend the needy and the sick
barefoot because of his humility
he it waswhen the granduke ferdinand
swore he would raze our city plough the place
and sow it with salt because we aretines
had tied a rope about the neck to hale
the statue of his father from its base
for hates sakehe availed by prayers and tears
to pacify the duke and save the town
this was my fathers fathers brother you see
for his sake how it was i had a right
to the selfsame office bishop in the egg
so grew i the garb and prattled in the school
was made expect from infancy almost
the proper mood o the priest till time ran by
and brought the day when i must read the vows
declare the world renounced and undertake
to become priest and leave probationleap
over the ledge into the other life
having gone trippingly hitherto up to the height
oer the wan water just a vow to read

i stopped short awestruck how shall holiest flesh
engage to keep such vow inviolate
how much less minei know myself too weak
unworthy choose a worthier stronger man
and the very bishop smiled and stopped the mouth
in its midprotestation incapable
qualmish of conscience thou ingenuous boy
clear up the clouds and cast thy scruples far
i satisfy thee theres an easier sense
wherein to take such vow than suits the first
rough rigid reading mark what makes all smooth
nay has been even a solace to myself
the jews who needs must in their synagogue
utter sometimes the holy name of god
a thing their superstition boggles at
pronounce aloud the ineffable sacrosanct
how does their shrewdness help them in this wise
another set of sounds they substitute
jumble so consonants and vowelshow
should i knowthat there grows from out the old
quite a new word that means the very same
and oer the hard place slide they with a smile
giuseppe maria caponsacchi mine
nobody wants you in these latter days
to prop the church by breaking your backbone
as the necessary way was once we know
when dioclesian flourished and his like
that building of the buttresswork was done
by martyrs and confessors let it bide
add not a brick but where you see a chink
stick in a sprig of ivy or root a rose
shall make amends and beautify the pile
we profit as you were the painfullest
o the martyrs and you prove yourself a match
for the cruellest confessor ever was
if you march boldly up and take your stand
where their blood soaks their bones yet strew the soil
and cry take notice i the young and free
and welltodo i the world thus leave the world
cast in my lot thus with no gay young world
but the grand old church she tempts me of the two
renounce the world nay keep and give it us
let us have you and boast of what you bring
we want the pick o the earth to practise with
not its offscouring halt and deaf and blind
in soul and body theres a rubblestone
unfit for the front o the building stuff to stow
in a gap behind and keep us weathertight
theres porphyry for the prominent place good lack
saint paul has had enough and to spare i trow
of ragged runaway onesimus
he wants the righthand with the signetring
of king agrippa now to shake and use
i have a heavy scholar cloistered up
close under lock and key kept at his task
of letting fenelon know the fool he is
in a book i promise christendom next spring
why if he covets so much meat the clown
as a larks wing next friday or any day
diversion beyond catching his own fleas
he shall be properly swinged i promise him
but you who are so quite another paste
of a mando you obey me cultivate
assiduous that superior gift you have
of making madrigalswho told me ah
get done a marinesque adoniad straight
with a pulse o the blood apricking here and there
that i may tell the lady and hes ours

so i became a priest those terms changed all
i was good enough for that nor cheated so
i could live thus and still hold head erect
now you see why i may have been before
a fribble and coxcomb yet as priest break word
nowise to make you disbelieve me now
i need that you should know my truth well then
according to prescription did i live
conformed myself both read the breviary
and wrote the rhymes was punctual to my place
i the pieve and as diligent at my post
where beauty and fashion rule i throve apace
subdeacon canon the authority
for delicate play at tarocs and arbiter
o the magnitude of fanmounts all the while
wanting no whit the advantage of a hint
benignant to the promising pupilthus
enough attention to the countess now
the young one tis her mother rules the roast
we know where and puts in a word go pay
devoir tomorrow morning after mass
break that rash promise to preach passionweek
has it escaped you the archbishop grunts
and snuffles when one grieves to tell his grace
no soul dares treat the subject of the day
since his own masterly handling it ha ha
five years agowhen somebody could help
and touch up an odd phrase in time of need
he heand somebody helps you my son
therefore dont prove so indispensable
at the pieve sit more loose i the seat nor grow
a fixture by attendance morn and eve
arezzos just a haven midway rome
romes the eventual harbourmake for port
crowd sail crack cordage and your cargo be
a polished presence a genteel manner wit
at will and tact at every pore of you
i sent our lump of learning brother clout
and father slouch our piece of piety
to see rome and try suit the cardinal
thither they clumpclumped beads and book in hand
and ever since tis meat for man and maid
how both flopped down prayed blessing on bent pate
bald many an inch beyond the tonsures need
never once dreaming the two moony dolts
theres nothing moves his eminence so much
asfar from all this awe at sanctitude
heads that wag eyes that twinkle modified mirth
at the closetlectures on the latin tongue
a lady learns so much by we know where
why body o bacchus you should crave his rule
for pauses in the elegiac couplet chasms
permissible only to catullus there
now go do duty brisk break priscians head
by reading the days officetheres no help
youve ovid in your poke to plaster that
amens at the end of all then sup with me

well after three or four years of this life
in prosecution of my calling i
found myself at the theatre one night
with a brother canon in a mood and mind
proper enough for the place amused or no
when i saw enter stand and seat herself
a lady young tall beautiful strange and sad
it was as when in our cathedral once
as i got yawningly through matinsong
i saw facchini bear a burden up
base it on the highaltar break away
a board or two and leave the thing inside
lofty and lone and lo when next i looked
there was the rafael i was still one stare
whennay ill make her give you back your gaze
said canon conti and at the word he tossed
a papertwist of comfits to her lap
and dodged and in a trice was at my back
nodding from over my shoulder then she turned
looked our way smiled the beautiful sad strange smile
is not she fair tis my new cousin said he
the fellow lurking there i the black o the box
is guido the old scapegrace shes his wife
married three years since how his countship sulks
he has brought little back from rome beside
after the bragging bullying a fair face
andthey do saya pocketfull of gold
when he can worry both her parents dead
i dont go much there for the chambers cold
and the coffee pale i got a turn at first
paying my dutyi observed they crouched
the two old frightened family spectres close
in a corner each on each like mouse on mouse
i the cats cage ever since i stay at home
hallo theres guido the black mean and small
bends his brows on usplease to bend your own
on the shapely nether limbs of lightskirts there
by way of a diversion i was a fool
to fling the sweetmeats prudence for gods love
tomorrow ill make my peace een tell some fib
try if i cant find means to take you there
that night and next day did the gaze endure
burnt to my brain as sunbeam thro shut eyes
and not once changed the beautiful sad strange smile
at vespers conti leaned beside my seat
i the choirpart said part sungin excelsis
alls to no purpose i have louted low
but he saw you staringquia subdont incline
to know you nearer him we would not hold
for herculesthe man would lick your shoe
if you and certain efficacious friends
managed him warilybut theres the wife
spare her because he beats her as it is
shes breaking her heart quite fast enoughjam tu
so be you rational and make amends
with little lightskirts yonderin secula
seculoooorum ah you rogue every one knows
what great dame she makes jealous one against one
play and win both

sirs ere the week was out
i saw and said to myself lightskirts hides teeth
would make a dog sickthe great dame shows spite
should drive a cat mad tis but poor work this
counting ones fingers till the sonnets crowned
i doubt much if marino really be
a better bard than dante after all
tis more amusing to go pace at eve
i the duomowatch the days last gleam outside
turn as into a skirt of gods own robe
those lancetwindows jewelled miracle
than go eat the archbishops ortolans
digest his jokes luckily lent is near
who cares to look will find me in my stall
at the pieve constant to this faith at least
never to write a canzonet any more

so next week twas my patron spoke abrupt
in altered guise young man can it be true
that after all your promise of sound fruit
you have kept away from countess young or old
and gone play truant in church all day long
are you turning molinist i answered quick
sir what if i turned christian it might be
the fact is i am troubled in my mind
beset and pressed hard by some novel thoughts
this your arezzo is a limited world
theres a strange popetis said a priest who thinks
rome is the port you say to rome i go
i will live alone one does so in a crowd
and look into my heart a little lent
endedi told friendsi shall go to rome

one evening i was sitting in a muse
over the opened summa darkened round
by the midmarch twilight thinking how my life
had shaken under mebroke short indeed
and showed the gap twixt what is what should be
and into what abysm the soul may slip
leave aspiration here achievement there
lacking omnipotence to connect extremes
thinking moreoveroh thinking if you like
how utterly dissociated was i
a priest and celibate from the sad strange wife
of guidojust as an instance to the point
nought morehow i had a whole store of strengths
eating into my heart which craved employ
and she perhaps need of a fingers help
and yet there was no way in the wide world
to stretch out mine and so relieve myself
how when the page o the summa preached its best
her smile kept glowing out of it as to mock
the silence we could break by no one word
there came a tap without the chamberdoor
and a whisper when i bade who tapped speak out
and in obedience to my summons last
in glided a masked muffled mystery
laid lightly a letter on the opened book
then stood with folded arms and foot demure
pointing as if to mark the minutes flight

i took the letter read to the effect
that she i lately flung the comfits to
had a warm heart to give me in exchange
and gave itloved me and confessed it thus
and bade me render thanks by word of mouth
going that night to such a side o the house
where the small terrace overhangs a street
blind and deserted not the street in front
her husband being away the surly patch
at his villa of vittiano

and youi asked
what may you becount guidos kind of maid
most of us have two functions in his house
we all hate him the lady suffers much
tis just we show compassion furnish aid
specially since her choice is fixed so well
what answer may i bring to cheer the sweet
pompilia

then i took a pen and wrote
no more of this that you are fair i know
but other thoughts now occupy my mind
i should not thus have played the insensible
once on a time what made youmay one ask
marry your hideous husband twas a fault
and now you taste the fruit of it farewell

there smiled i as she snatched it and was gone
there let the jealous miscreantguidos self
whose mean soul grins through this transparent trick
be baulked so far defrauded of his aim
what fund of satisfaction to the knave
had i kicked this his messenger downstairs
trussed to the middle of her impudence
setting his heart at ease so no indeed
theres the reply which he shall turn and twist
at pleasure snuff at till his brain grow drunk
as the bear does when he finds a scented glove
that puzzles hima hand and yet no hand
of other perfume than his own foul paw
last month i had doubtless chosen to play the dupe
accepted the mockinvitation kept
the sham appointment cudgel beneath cloak
prepared myself to pull the appointers self
out of the window from his hidingplace
behind the gown of this partmessenger
partmistress who would personate the wife
such had seemed once a jest permissible
now i am not i the mood
back next morn brought
the messenger a second letter in hand
you are cruel thyrsis and myrtilla moans
neglected but adores you makes request
for mercy why is it you dare not come
such virtue is scarce natural to your age
you must love someone else i hear you do
the barons daughter or the advocates wife
or bothalls one would you make me the third
i take the crumbs from table gratefully
nor grudge who feasts there faith i blush and blaze
yet if i break all bounds theres reason sure
are you determinedly bent on rome
i am wretched here a monster tortures me
carry me with you come and say you will
concert this very evening do not write
i am ever at the window of my room
over the terrace at the ave come

i questionedlifting half the womans mask
to let her smile loose so you gave my line
to the merry lady she kissed off the wax
and put what paper was not kissed away
in her bosom to go burn but merry no
she wept all night when evening brought no friend
alone the unkind missive at her breast
thus philomel the thorn at her breast too
singswrites this second letter even so
then she may peep at vespers forthwhat risk
do we run o the husbandahno risk at all
he is more stupid even than jealous ah
that was the reason why the mans away
beside his bugbear is that friend of yours
fat little canon conti he fears him
how should he dream of you i told you truth
he goes to the villa at vittianotis
the time when springsap rises in the vine
spends the night there and then his wifes a child
does he think a child outwits him a mere child
yet so full grown a dish for any duke
dont quarrel longer with such cates but come

i wrote in vain do you solicit me
i am a priest and you are wedded wife
whatever kind of brute your husband prove
i have scruples in short yet should you really show
sign at the windowbut nay best be good
my thoughts are elsewheretake her that

again
let the incarnate meanness cheat and spy
mean to the marrow of him make his heart
his food anticipate hells worm once more
let him watch shivering at the windoway
and let this hybrid this his lightoflove
and lackeyofliesa sage economy
paid with embracings for the rank brass coin
let her report and make him chuckle oer
the breakdown of my resolution now
and lour at disappointment in good time
so tantalise and so enrage by turns
until the two fall each on the other like
two famished spiders as the coveted fly
that toys long leaves their net and them at last
and so the missives followed thick and fast
for a month sayi still came at every turn
on the soft sly adder endlong neath my tread
i was met i the street made sign to in the church
a slip was found i the doorsill scribbled word
twixt page and page o the prayerbook in my piece
a crumpled thing dropped even before my feet
pushed through the blind above the terracerail
as i passed by day the very window once
and ever from corners would be peering up
the messenger with the selfsame demand
obdurate still no flesh but adamant
nothing to cure the wound assuage the throe
o the sweetest lamb that ever loved a bear
and ever my one answer in one tone
go your ways temptress let a priest read pray
unplagued of vain talk visions not for him
in the end youll have your will and ruin me

one day a variation thus i read
you have gained little by timidity
my husband has found out my love at length
sees cousin conti was the stalkinghorse
and you the game he covered poor fat soul
my husband is a formidable foe
will stick at nothing to destroy you stand
prepared or better run till you reach rome
i bade you visit me when the last place
my tyrant would have turned suspicious at
or cared to seek you in waswhy say where
but now alls changed beside the seasons past
at the villawants the masters eye no more
anyhow i beseech you stay away
from the window he might well be posted there

i wroteyou raise my courage or call up
my curiosity who am but man
tell him he owns the palace not the street
underthats his and yours and mine alike
if it should please me pad the path this eve
guido will have two troubles first to get
into a rage and then get out again
be cautious though at the ave

you of the court
when i stood question here and reached this point
o the narrativesearch notes and see and say
if some one did not interpose with smile
and sneer and prithee why so confident
that the husband must of all needs not the wife
fabricate thuswhat if the lady loved
what if she wrote the letters

learned sir
i told you theres a picture in our church
well if a lowbrowed verger sidled up
bringing me like a blotch on his prods point
a transfixed scorpion let the reptile writhe
and then said see a thing that rafael made
this venom issued from madonnas mouth
i should reply rather the soul of you
has issued from your body like from like
by way of the ordurecorner

but no less
i tired of the same black teazing lie
obtruded thus at every turn the pest
was far too near the picture anyhow
one does madonna service making clowns
remove their dungheap from the sacristy
i will to the window as he tempts said i
yes whom the easy love has failed allure
this new bait of adventure mayhe thinks
while the imprisoned lady keeps afar
there will they lie in ambush heads alert
kith kin and count mustered to bite my heel
no mother nor brother viper of the brood
shall scuttle off without the instructive bruise

so i went crossed street and street the next streets turn
i stand beneath the terrace see above
the black of the ambushwindow then in place
of hands throw of soft prelude over lute
and cough that clears way for the ditty last
i began to laugh alreadyhe will have
out of the hole you hide in on to the front
count guido franceschini show yourself
hear what a man thinks of a thing like you
and after take this foulness in your face

the words lay living on my lip i made
the one turn moreand there at the window stood
framed in its black square length with lamp in hand
pompilia the same great grave griefful air
as stands i the dusk on altar that i know
left alone with one moonbeam in her cell
our lady of all the sorrows ere i knelt
assured myself that she was flesh and blood
she had looked one look and vanished

i thoughtjust so
it was herself they have set her there to watch
stationed to see some weddingband go by
on fair pretence that she must bless the bride
or wait some funeral with friends wind past
and crave peace for the corpse that claims its due
she never dreams they used her for a snare
and now withdraw the bait has served its turn
well done the husband who shall fare the worse
and on my lip again wasout with thee
guido when all at once she reappeared
but this time on the terrace overhead
so close above me she could almost touch
my head if she bent down and she did bend
while i stood still as stone all eye all ear

she beganyou have sent me letters sir
i have read none i can neither read nor write
but she you gave them to a woman here
one of the people in whose power i am
partly explained their sense i think to me
obliged to listen while she inculcates
that you a priest can dare love me a wife
desire to live or die as i shall bid
she makes me listen if i will or no
because you saw my face a single time
it cannot be she says the thing you mean
such wickedness were deadly to us both
but good true love would help me now so much
i tell myself you may mean good and true
you offer me i seem to understand
because i am in poverty and starve
much money where one piece would save my life
the silver cup upon the altarcloth
is neither yours to give nor mine to take
but i might take one bit of bread therefrom
since i am starving and return the rest
yet do no harm this is my very case
i am in that strait i may not abstain
from so much of assistance as would bring
the guilt of theft on neither you nor me
but no superfluous particle of aid
i think if you will let me state my case
even had you been so fancyfevered here
not your sound self you must grow healthy now
care only to bestow what i can take
that it is only you in the wide world
knowing me nor in thought nor word nor deed
who all unprompted save by your own heart
come proffering assistance nowwere strange
but that my whole life is so strange as strange
it is my husband whom i have not wronged
should hate and harm me for his own souls sake
hinder the harm but there is something more
and that the strangest it has got to be
somehow for my sake too and yet not mine
this is a riddlefor some kind of sake
not any clearer to myself than you
and yet as certain as that i draw breath
i would fain live not dieoh no not die
my case is i was dwelling happily
at rome with those dear comparini called
father and mother to me when at once
i found i had become count guidos wife
who then not waiting for a moment changed
into a fury of fire if once he was
merely a man his face threw fire at mine
he laid a hand on me that burned all peace
all joy all hope and last all fear away
dipping the bough of life so pleasant once
in fire which shrivelled leaf and bud alike
burning not only present life but past
which you might think was safe beyond his reach
he reached it though since that beloved pair
my father once my mother all those years
that loved me so now say i dreamed a dream
and bid me wake henceforth no child of theirs
never in all the time their child at all
do you understand i cannot yet so it is
just so i say of you that proffer help
i cannot understand what prompts your soul
i simply needs must see that it is so
only one strange and wonderful thing more
they came here with me those two dear ones kept
all the old love up till my husband till
his people here so tortured them they fled
and now is it because i grow in flesh
and spirit one with him their torturer
that they renouncing him must cast off me
if i were graced by god to have a child
could i one day deny god graced me so
then since my husband hates me i shall break
no law that reigns in this fell house of hate
by usingletting have effect so much
of hate as hides me from that whole of hate
would take my life which i want and must have
just as i take from your excess of love
enough to save my life with all i need
the archbishop said to murder me were sin
my leaving guido were a kind of death
with no sinmore death he must answer for
hear now what death to him and life to you
i wish to pay and owe take me to rome
you go to rome the servant makes me hear
take me as you would take a dog i think
masterless left for strangers to maltreat
take me home like thatleave me in the house
where the father and the mother are and soon
theyll come to know and call me by my name
their child once more since child i am for all
they now forget me which is the worst o the dream
and the way to end dreams is to break them stand
walk go then help me to stand walk and go
the governor said the strong should help the weak
you know how weak the strongest women are
how could i find my way there by myself
i cannot even call out make them hear
just as in dreams i have tried and proved the fact
i have told this story and more to good great men
the archbishop and the governor they smiled
stop your mouth fair onepresently they frowned
get you gone disengage you from our feet
i went in my despair to an old priest
only a friar no great man like these two
but good the augustinian people name
romanohe confessed me two months since
he fears god why then needs he fear the world
and when he questioned how it came about
that i was found in danger of a sin
despair of any help from providence
since though your husband outrage you said he
that is a case too common the wives die
or live but do not sin so deep as this
then i toldwhat i never will tell you
how worse than husbands hate i had to bear
the lovesoliciting to shame called love
of his brotherthe young idle priest i the house
with only the devil to meet there this is grave
yes we must interfere i counselwrite
to those who used to be your parents once
of dangers here bid them convey you hence
but said i when i neither read nor write
then he took pity and promised i will write
if he did sowhy they are dumb or dead
either they give no credit to the tale
or else wrapped wholly up in their own joy
of such escape they care not who cries still
i the clutches anyhow no word arrives
all such extravagance and dreadfulness
seems incident to dreaming cured one way
wake me the letter i received this morn
saidif the woman spoke your very sense
you would die for me i can believe it now
for now the dream gets to involve yourself
first of all you seemed wicked and not good
in writing me those letters you came in
like a thief upon me i this morning said
in my extremity entreat the thief
try if he have in him no honest touch
a thief might save me from a murderer
twas a thief said the last kind word to christ
christ took the kindness and forgave the theft
and so did i prepare what i now say
but now that you stand and i see your face
though you have never uttered word yetwell i know
here too has been dreamwork delusion too
and that at no time you with the eyes here
ever intended to do wrong by me
nor wrote such letters therefore it is false
and you are true have been true will be true
to rome thenwhen is it you take me there
each minute lost is mortal wheni ask

i answered it shall be when it can be
i will go hence and do your pleasure find
the sure and speedy means of travel then
come back and take you to your friends in rome
there wants a carriage money and the rest
a days work by tomorrow at this time
how shall i see you and assure escape

she replied pass tomorrow at this hour
if i am at the open window well
if i am absent drop a handkerchief
and walk by i shall see from where i watch
and know that all is done return next eve
and next and so till we can meet and speak
tomorrow at this hour i pass said i
she was withdrawn
here is another point
i bid you pause at when i told thus far
someone said subtly here at least was found
your confidence in erroryou perceived
the spirit of the letters in a sort
had been the ladys if the body should be
supplied by guido say he forged them all
here was the unforged factshe sent for you
spontaneously elected you to help
what men call loved you guido read her mind
gave it expression to assure the world
the case was just as he foresaw he wrote
she spoke
sirs that first simile serves still
that falsehood of a scorpion hatched i say
nowhere i the world but in madonnas mouth
go on suppose that falsehood foiled next eve
pictured madonna raised her painted hand
fixed the face rafael bent above the babe
on my face as i flung me at her feet
such miracle vouchsafed and manifest
would that prove the first lying tale was true
pompilia spoke and i at once received
accepted my own fact my miracle
selfauthorised and selfexplainedshe chose
to summon me and signify her choice
afterwardoh i gave a passing glance
to a certain ugly cloudshape goblinshred
of hellsmoke hurrying past the splendid moon
out now to tolerate no darkness more
and saw right through the thing that tried to pass
for truth and solid not an empty lie
so he not only forged the words for her
but word for me made letters he called mine
what i sent he retained gave these in place
all by the mistressmessenger as i
recognised her at potency of truth
so she by the crystalline soul knew me
never mistook the signs enough of this
let the wraith go to nothingness again
here is the orb have only thought for her
thought nay sirs what shall follow was not thought
i have thought sometimes and thought long and hard
i have stood before gone round a serious thing
tasked my whole mind to touch and clasp it close
as i stretch forth my arm to touch this bar
god and man and what duty i owe both
i dare to say i have confronted these
in thought but no such faculty helped here
i put forth no thoughtpowerless all that night
i paced the city it was the first spring
by the invasion i lay passive to
in rushed new things the old were rapt away
alike abolishedthe imprisonment
of the outside air the inside weight o the world
that pulled me down death meant to spurn the ground
soar to the skydie well and you do that
the very immolation made the bliss
death was the heart of life and all the harm
my folly had crouched to avoid now proved a veil
hiding all gain my wisdom strove to grasp
as if the intense centre of the flame
should turn a heaven to that devoted fly
which hitherto sophist alike and sage
saint thomas with his sober grey goosequill
and sinner plato by cephisian reed
would fain pretending just the insects good
whisk off drive back consign to shade again
into another state under new rule
i knew myself was passing swift and sure
whereof the initiatory pang approached
felicitous annoy as bittersweet
as when the virginband the victors chaste
feel at the end the earthly garments drop
and rise with something of a rosy shame
into immortal nakedness so i
lay and let come the proper throe would thrill
into the ecstacy and outthrob pain

i the grey of dawn it was i found myself
facing the pillared front o the pievemine
my church it seemed to say for the first time
but am not i the bride the mystic love
o the lamb who took thy plighted troth my priest
to fold thy warm heart on my heart of stone
and freeze thee nor unfasten any more
this is a fleshly womanlet the free
bestow their lifeblood thou art pulseless now
see day by day i had risen and left this church
at the signal waved me by some foolish fan
with half a curse and half a pitying smile
for the monk i stumbled over in my haste
prostrate and corpselike at the altarfoot
intent on his corona then the church
was ready with her quip if word conduced
to quicken my pace nor stop for pratingthere
be thankful you are no such ninny go
rather to teach a blackeyed novice cards
than gabble latin and protrude that nose
smoothed to a sheeps through no brains and much faith
that sort of incentive now the church changed tone
now when i found out first that life and death
are means to an end that passion uses both
indisputably mistress of the man
whose form of worship is selfsacrifice
now from the stone lungs sighed the scrannel voice
leave that passion come be dead with me
as if i the fabled garden i had gone
on great adventure plucked in ignorance
hedgefruit and feasted to satiety
laughing at such high fame for hips and haws
and scorned the achievement then come all at once
o the prize o the place the thing of perfect gold
the apples self and scarce my eye on that
was ware as well o the sevenfold dragons watch

sirs i obeyed obedience was too strange
this new thing that had been struck into me
by the look o the ladyto dare disobey
the first authoritative word twas gods
i had been lifted to the level of her
could take such sounds into my sense i said
we two are cognisant o the master now
it is she bids me bow the head how true
i am a priest i see the function here
i thought the other way selfsacrifice
this is the true seals up the perfect sum
i pay it sit down silently obey

so i went home dawn broke noon broadened i
i sat stonestill let time run over me
the sun slanted into my room had reached
the west i opened bookaquinas blazed
with one black name only on the white page
i looked up saw the sunset vespers rang
she counts the minutes till i keep my word
and come say all is ready i am a priest
duty to god is duty to her i think
god who created her will save her too
some new way by one miracle the more
without me then prayer may avail perhaps
i went to my own place i the pieve read
the office i was back at home again
sitting i the dark could she but knowbut know
that were there good in this distinct from gods
really good as it reached her though procured
by a sin of minei should sin god forgives
she knows it is no fear withholds me fear
of what suspense here is the terrible thing
if she should as she counts the minutes come
on the fantastic notion that i fear
the world now fear the archbishop fear perhaps
count guido he who having forged the lies
may wait the work attend the effecti fear
the sword of guido let god see to that
hating lies let not her believe a lie

again the morning found me i will work
tie down my foolish thoughts thank god so far
i have saved her from a scandal stopped the tongues
had broken else into a cackle and hiss
around the noble name duty is still
wisdom i have been wise so the day wore

at eveningbut achieving victory
i must not blink the priests peculiar part
nor shrink to counsel comfort priest and friend
how do we discontinue to be friends
i will go minister advise her seek
help at the sourceabove all not despair
there may be other happier help at hand
i hope itwherefore then neglect to say

there she stoodleaned there for the second time
over the terrace looked at me then spoke
why is it you have suffered me to stay
breaking my heart two days more than was need
why delay help your own heart yearns to give
you are again here in the selfsame mind
i see here steadfast in the face of you
you grudge to do no one thing that i ask
why then is nothing done you know my need
still through gods pity on me there is time
and one day more shall i be saved or no
i answeredlady waste no thought no word
even to forgive me care for what i care
only now follow me as i were fate
leave this house in the dark tomorrow night
just before daybreaktheres new moon this eve
it sets and then begins the solid black
descend proceed to the torrione step
over the low dilapidated wall
take san clemente theres no other gate
unguarded at the hour some paces thence
an inn stands cross to it i shall be there

she answered if i can but find the way
but i shall find it go now

i did go
took rapidly the route myself prescribed
stopped at torrione climbed the ruined place
proved that the gate was practicable reached
the inn no eye despite the dark could miss
knocked there and entered made the host secure
with caponsacchi it is ask and have
i know my betters are you bound for rome
i get swift horse and trusty man said he

then i retraced my steps was found once more
in my own house for the last time there lay
the broad pale opened summa shut his book
theres other showing twas a thomas too
obtainedmore favoured than his namesake here
a gift tied faith fast foiled the tug of doubt
our ladys girdle down he saw it drop
as she ascended into heaven they say
he kept that safe and bade all doubt adieu
i too have seen a lady and hold a grace

i know not how the night passed morning broke
presently came my servant sir this eve
do you forget i startedhow forget
what is it you knowwith due submission sir
this being last monday in the month but one
and a vigil since tomorrow is saint george
and feast day and moreover day for copes
and canon conti now away a month
and canon crispi sour because forsooth
you let him sulk in stall and bear the brunt
of the octavewell sir tis important

true
hearken i have to start for rome this night
no word lest crispi overboil and burst
provide me with a laic dress throw dust
i the canons eye stop his tongues scandal so
see theres a sword in case of accident
i knew the knave the knave knew me

and thus
through each familiar hindrance of the day
did i make steadily for its hour and end
felt times old barriergrowth of right and fit
give way through all its twines and let me go
use and wont recognised the excepted man
let speed the special serviceand i sped
till at the dead between midnight and morn
there was i at the goal before the gate
with a tune in the ears low leading up to loud
a light in the eyes faint that would soon be flare
ever some spiritual witness new and new
in faster frequence crowding solitude
to watch the way o the warfaretill at last
when the ecstatic minute must bring birth
began a whiteness in the distance waxed
whiter and whiter near grew and more near
till it was she there did pompilia come
the white i saw shine through her was her souls
certainly for the body was one black
black from head down to foot she did not speak
glided into the carriageso a cloud
gathers the moon up by san spirito
to rome as if the road burned underneath
reach rome then hold my head in pledge i pay
the run and the risk to hearts content just that
i saidthen in another tick of time
sprang was beside her she and i alone

so it began our flight thro dusk to clear
through day and night and day again to night
once more and to last dreadful dawn of all
sirs how should i lie quiet in my grave
unless you suffer me wring drop by drop
my brain dry make a riddance of the drench
of minutes with a memory in each
recorded motion breath or look of hers
which poured forth would present you one pure glass
mirror you plainas gods sea glassed in gold
his saintsthe perfect soul pompilia men
you must know that a man gets drunk with truth
stagnant inside him oh theyve killed her sirs
can i be calm
calmly each incident
proves i maintain that action of the flight
for the true thing it was the first faint scratch
o the stone will test its nature teach its worth
to idiots who name parian coprolite
after all i shall give no glareat best
only display you certain scattered lights
lamping the rush and roll of the abyss
nothing but here and there a firepoint pricks
wavelet from wavelet well

for the first hour
we both were silent in the night i know
sometimes i did not see nor understand
blackness engulphed mepartial stupor say
then i would break way breathe through the surprise
and be aware again and see who sat
in the dark vest with the white face and hands
i said to myselfi have caught it i conceive
the mind o the mystery tis the way they wake
and wait two martyrs somewhere in a tomb
each by each as their blessing was to die
some signal they are promised and expect
when to arise before the trumpet scares
so through the whole course of the world they wait
the last day but so fearless and so safe
no otherwise in safety and not fear
i lie because she lies too by my side
you know this is not love sirsit is faith
the feeling that theres god he reigns and rules
out of this low world that is all no harm
at times she drew a soft sighmusic seemed
always to hover just above her lips
not settlebreak a silence music too

in the determined morning i first found
her head erect her face turned full to me
her soul intent on mine through two wide eyes
i answered them you are saved hitherto
we have passed perugiagone round by the wood
not through i seem to thinkand opposite
i know assisi this is holy ground
then she resumed how long since we both left
arezzoyearsand certain hours beside

it was atah but i forget the names
tis a mere posthouse and a hovel or two
i left the carriage and got bread and wine
and brought it herdoes it detain to eat
they stay perforce change horsestherefore eat
we lose no minute we arrive be sure
she saidi know not wheretheres a great hill
close over and the stream has lost its bridge
one fords it she begani have heard say
of some sick body that my mother knew
twas no good sign when in a limb diseased
all the pain suddenly departsas if
the guardian angel discontinued pain
because the hope of cure was gone at last
the limb will not again exert itself
it needs be pained no longer so with me
my soul whence all the pain is past at once
all pain must be to work some good in the end
true this i feel now this may be that good
pain was because ofotherwise i fear

she saida long while later in the day
when i had let the silence beabrupt
have you a mothershe died i was born
a sister thenno sisterwho was it
what woman were you used to serve this way
be kind to till i called you and you came
i did not like that word soon afterward
tell me are men unhappy in some kind
of mere unhappiness at being men
as women suffer being womanish
have you now some unhappiness i mean
born of what may be mans strength overmuch
to match the undue susceptibility
the sense at every pore when hate is close
it hurts us if a baby hides its face
or child strikes at us punily calls names
or makes a mouthmuch more if stranger men
laugh or frownjust as that were much to bear
yet rocks splitand the blowball does no more
quivers to feathery nothing at a touch
and strength may have its drawback weakness scapes

once she asked what is it that made you smile
at the great gate with the eagles and the snakes
where the company entered tis a long time since
forgivei think you would not understand
ah but you ask metherefore it was this
that was a certain bishops villagate
i knew it by the eaglesand at once
remembered this same bishop was just he
people of old were wont to bid me please
if i would catch preferment so i smiled
because an impulse came to me a whim
what if i prayed the prelate leave to speak
began upon him in his presencehall
what still at work so grey and obsolete
still rocheted and mitred more or less
dont you feel all that out of fashion now
i find out when the day of things is done 

at eve we heard the angelus she turned
i told you i can neither read nor write
my life stopped with the playtime i will learn
if i begin to live again but you
who are a priestwherefore do you not read
the service at this hour read gabriels song
the lesson and then read the little prayer
to raphael proper for us travellers
i did not like that neither but i read

when we stopped at foligno it was dark
the people of the post came out with lights
the driver said this time tomorrow may
saints only help relays continue good
nor robbers hinder we arrive at rome
i urgedwhy tax your strength a second night
trust me alight here and take brief repose
we are out of harms reach past pursuit go sleep
if but an hour i keep watch guard the while
here in the doorway but her whole face changed
the misery grew again about her mouth
the eyes burned up from faintness like the fawns
tired to death in the thicket when she feels
the probing spear o the huntsman oh no stay
she cried in the fawns cry on to rome on on
unless tis you who fearwhich cannot be

we did go on all night but at its close
she was troubled restless moaned low talked at whiles
to herself her brow on quiver with the dream
once wide awake she menaced at arms length
waved away somethingnever again with you
my soul is mine my body is my souls
you and i are divided ever more
in soul and body get you gone then i
why in my whole life i have never prayed
oh if the god that only can would help
am i his priest with power to cast out fiends
let god arise and all his enemies
be scattered by morn there was peace no sigh
out of the deep sleep

when she woke at last
i answered the first lookscarce twelve hours more
then rome there probably was no pursuit
there cannot now be peril bear up brave
just some twelve hours to press through to the prize
then no more of the terrible journey then
no more o the journey if it might but last
always my lifelong thus to journey still
it is the interruption that i dread
with no dread ever to be here and thus
never to see a face nor hear a voice
yours is no voice you speak when you are dumb
nor face i see it in the dark i want
no face nor voice that change and grow unkind
that i liked that was the best thing she said

in the broad day i dared entreat descend
i told a woman at the gardengate
by the posthouse white and pleasant in the sun
it is my sistertalk with her apart
she is married and unhappy you perceive
i take her home because her head is hurt
comfort her as you women understand
so there i left them by the gardenwall
paced the road then bade put the horses to
came back and there she sat close to her knee
a blackeyed child still held the bowl of milk
wondered to see how little she could drink
and in her arms the womans infant lay
she smiled at me how much good this has done
this is a whole nights rest and how much more
i can proceed now though i wish to stay
how do you call that tree with the thick top
that holds in all its leafy green and gold
the sun now like an immense egg of fire
it was a millionleaved mimosa take
the babe away from me and let me go
and in the carriage still a day my friend
and perhaps half a night the woman fears
i pray it finish since it cannot last
there may be more misfortune at the close
and where will you be god suffice me then
and presentlyfor there was a roadsideshrine
when i was taken first to my own church
lorenzo in lucina being a girl
and bid confess my faults i interposed
but teach me what fault to confess and know
so the priest saidyou should bethink yourself
each human being needs must have done wrong
now be you candid and no priest but friend
were i surprised and killed here on the spot
a runaway from husband and his home
do you account it were in sin i died
my husband used to seem to harm me not
not on pretence he punished sin of mine
nor for sins sake and lust of cruelty
but as i heard him bid a farmingman
at the villa take a lamb once to the wood
and there illtreat it meaning that the wolf
should hear its cries and so come quick be caught
enticed to the trap he practised thus with me
that so whatever were his gain thereby
others that i might become prey and spoil
had it been only between our two selves
his pleasure and my painwhy pleasure him
by dying nor such need to make a coil
but this was worth an effort that my pain
should not become a snare prove pain threefold
to other peoplestrangersor unborn
how should i know i sought release from that
i think or else fromdare i say some cause
such as is put into a tree which turns
away from the northwind with what nest it holds
the woman said that trees so turn now friend
tell me because i cannot trust myself
you are a man what have i done amiss
you must conceive my answeri forget
taken up wholly with the thought perhaps
this time she might have saidmight did not say
you are a priest she said my friend

day wore
we passed the places somehow the calm went
again the restless eyes began to rove
in new fear of the foe mine could not see
she wandered in her mindaddressed me once
gaetanothat is not my name whose name
i grew alarmed my head seemed turning too
i quickened pace with promise now now threat
bade drive and drive nor any stopping more
too deep i the thick of the struggle struggle through
then drench her in repose though deaths self pour
the plenitude of quiethelp us god
whom the winds carry

suddenly i saw
the old tower and the little whitewalled clump
of buildings and the cypresstree or two
already castelnuovorome i cried
as good as romerome is the next stage think
this is where travellers hearts are wont to beat
say you are saved sweet lady up she woke
the sky was fierce with colour from the sun
setting she screamed out no i must not die
take me no farther i should die stay here
i have more life to save than mine

she swooned
we seemed safe what was it foreboded so
out of the coach into the inn i bore
the motionless and breathless pure and pale
pompiliabore her through a pitying group
and laid her on a couch still calm and cured
by deep sleep of all woes at once the host
was urgent let her stay an hour or two
leave her to us all will be right by morn
oh my foreboding but i could not choose

i paced the passage kept watch all night long
i listenednot one movement not one sigh
fear not she sleeps so sound they saidbut i
feared all the same kept fearing more and more
found myself throb with fear from head to foot
filled with a sense of such impending woe
that at first pause of night pretence of grey
i made my mind up it was mornreach rome
lest hell reach her a dozen miles to make
another long breath and we emerge i stood
i the courtyard roused the sleepy grooms have out
carriage and horse give haste take goldsaid i
while they made ready in the doubtful morn
twas the last minuteneeds must i ascend
and break her sleep i turned to go

and there
faced me count guido there posed the mean man
as mastertook the field encamped his rights
challenged the world there leered new triumph there
scowled the old malice in the visage bad
and black o the scamp soon triumph suppled the tongue
a little malice glued to his dry throat
and he part howled part hissedoh how he kept
well out o the way at arms length and to spare
my salutation to your priestship what
matutinal busy with book so soon
of an april day thats damp as tears that now
deluge arezzo at its darlings flight
tis unfair wrongs feminity at large
to let a single dame monopolize
a heart the whole sex claims should share alike
therefore i overtake you canon come
the ladycould you leave her side so soon
you have not yet experienced at her hands
my treatment you lay down undrugged i see
hence this alertnesshence no deathinlife
like what held arms fast when she stole from mine
to be sure you took the solace and repose
that first night at folignonews abound
o the road by this timemen regaled me much
as past them i came halting after you
vulcan pursuing mars as poets sing
still at the last here pant i but arrive
vulcanand not without my cyclops too
the commissary and the unpoisoned arm
o the civil force should mars turn mutineer
enough of fooling capture the culprits friend
here is the lover in the smart disguise
with the swordhe is a priest so mine lies still
there upstairs hides my wife the runaway
his leman the two plotted poisoned first
plundered me after and eloped thus far
where now you find them do your duty quick
arrest and hold him thats done now catch her
during this speech of that manwell i stood
away as he managedstill i stood as near
the throat of himwith these two hands my own
as now i stand near yours sirone quick spring
one great good satisfying gripe and lo
there had he lain abolished with his lie
creation purged o the miscreate man redeemed
a spittle wiped off from the face of god
i in some measure seek a poor excuse
for what i left undone in just this fact
that my first feeling at the speech i quote
wasnot of what a blasphemy was dared
not what a bag of venomed purulence
was split and noisomebut how splendidly
mirthful what ludicrous a lie was launched
would molières self wish more than hear such man
call claim such woman for his own his wife
even though in due amazement at the boast
he had stammered she moreover was divine
she to be hiswere hardly less absurd
than that he took her name into his mouth
licked and then let it go again the beast
signed with his slaver oh she poisoned him
plundered him and the rest well what i wished
was that he would but go on say once more
so to the world and get his meed of men
the fists reply to the filth and while i mused
the minute oh the misery was gone
on either idle hand of me there stood
really an officer nor laughed i the least
they rendered justice to his reason laid
logic to heart as twere submitted them
twice two makes four
and now catch herhe cried
that sobered me let myself lead the way
ere you arrest me who am somebody
and as you hear a priest and privileged
to the ladys chamber i presume youmen
expert instructed how to find out truth
familiar with the guise of guilt detect
guilt on her face when it meets mine then judge
between us and the mad dog howling there
up we all went together in they broke
o the chamber late my chapel there she lay
composed as when i laid her that last eve
o the couch still breathless motionless sleeps self
waxwhite seraphic saturate with the sun
o the morning that now flooded from the front
and filled the window with a light like blood
behold the poisoner the adulteress
and feigning sleep too seize bindguido hissed

she started up stood erect face to face
with the husband back he fell was buttressed there
by the window all aflame with morningred
he the black figure the opprobrious blur
against all peace and joy and light and life
away from between me and hellshe cried
hell for me no embracing any more
i am gods i love god godwhose knees i clasp
whose utterly most just award i take
but bear no more lovemaking devils hence
i may have made an effort to reach her side
from where i stood i the doorwayanyhow
i found the arms i wanted pinioned fast
was powerless in the clutch to left and right
o the rabble pouring in rascality
enlisted rampant on the side of hearth
home and the husbandpay in prospect too
they heaped themselves upon mehaand him
also you outrage him too my sole friend
guardian and saviour that i baulk you of
sincesee how god can help at last and worst
she sprung at the sword that hung beside him seized
drew brandished it the sunrise burned for joy
o the blade die cried she devil in gods name
ah but they all closed round her twelve to one
the unmanly men no womanmother made
spawned somehow deadwhite and disarmed she lay
no matter for the sword her word sufficed
to spike the coward through and through he shook
could only spit between the teethyou see
you hear bear witness then write downbut no
carry these criminals to the prisonhouse
for first thing i begin my search meanwhile
after the stolen effects gold jewels plate
money and clothes they robbed me of and fled
with no few amorous pieces verse and prose
i have much reason to expect to find

when i saw thatno more than the first mad speech
made out the speaker mad and a laughingstock
so neither did this next device explode
one listeners indignationthat a scribe
did sit down set himself to write indeed
and sundry knaves began to peer and pry
in corner and holethat guido wiping brow
and getting him a countenance was fast
losing his fear beginning to strut free
o the stage of his exploit snuff here sniff there
i took the truth in guessed sufficiently
the service for the momentwhat i say
slight at your peril we are aliens here
my adversary and i called noble both
i am the nobler and a name men know
i could refer our cause to our own court
in our own country but prefer appeal
to the nearer jurisdiction being a priest
though in a secular garbfor reasons good
i shall adduce in due time to my peers
i demand that the church i serve decide
between us right the slandered lady there
a tuscan noble i might claim the duke
a priest i rather choose the churchbid rome
cover the wronged with her inviolate shield

there was no refusing this they bore me off
they bore her off to separate cells o the same
ignoble prison and separate thence to rome
pompilias face then and thus looked on me
the last time in this life not one sight since
never another sight to be and yet
i thought i had saved her i appealed to rome
it seems i simply sent her to her death
you tell me she is dying now or dead
i cannot bring myself to quite believe
this is a place you torture people in
what if this your intelligence were just
a subtlety an honest wile to work
on a man at unawares twere worthy you
no sirs i cannot have the lady dead
that erect form flashing brow fulgurant eye
that voice immortal oh that voice of hers
that vision in the bloodred daybreakthat
leap to life of the pale electric sword
angels go armed withthat was not the last
o the lady come i see through it you find
know the manaeuvre also herself said
i had saved her do you dare say she spoke false
let me see for myself if it be so
though she were dying a priest might be of use
the more when hes a friend tooshe called me
far beyond friend come let me see herindeed
it is my duty being a priest i hope
i stand confessed established proved a priest
my punishment had motive that a priest
i in a laic garb a mundane mode
did what were harmlessly done otherwise
i never touched her with my fingertip
except to carry her to the couch that eve
against my heart beneath my head bowed low
as we priests carry the paten that is why
to get leave and go see her of your grace
i have told you this whole story over again
do i deserve grace for i might lock lips
laugh at your jurisdiction what have you
to do with me in the matter i suppose
you hardly think i donned a bravos dress
to have a hand in the new crime on the old
judgments delivered penalty imposed
i was chained fast at civita hand and foot
she had only you to trust to you and rome
rome and the church and no pert meddling priest
two days ago when guido with the right
hacked her to pieces one might well be wroth
i have been patient done my best to help
i come from civita and punishment
as a friend of the courtand for pure friendships sake
have told my tale to the endnay not the end
for waitill endnot leave you that excuse

when we were partedshall i go on there
i was presently brought to romeyes here i stood
opposite yonder very crucifix
and there sat you and you sirs quite the same
i heard charge and bore question and told tale
noted down in the book thereturn and see
if by one jot or tittle i vary now
i the colour the tale takes theres change perhaps
tis natural since the sky is different
eclipse in the air now still the outline stays
i showed you how it came to be my part
to save the lady then your clerk produced
papers a pack of stupid and impure
banalities called letters about love
love indeedi could teach who styled them so
better i think though priest and loveless both
how was it that a wife young innocent
and stranger to your person wrote this page
she wrote it when the holy father wrote
the bestiality that posts thro rome
put in his mouth by pasquinnor perhaps
did you return these answers verse and prose
signed sealed and sent the lady theres your hand
this precious piece of verse i really judge
is meant to copy my own character
a clumsy mimic and this other prose
not so much even both rank forgery
verse quotha bembos verse when saint john wrote
the tract de tribus i wrote this to match
how came it then the documents were found
at the inn on your departurei opine
because there were no documents to find
in my presenceyou must hide before you find
who forged them hardly practised in my view
who found them waited till i turned my back
and what of the clandestine visits paid
nocturnal passage in and out the house
with its lord absent tis alleged you climbed
flew on a broomstick to the man i the moon
who witnessed or will testify this trash
the trusty servant margheritas self
even she who brought you letters you confess
and you confess took letters in reply
forget not we have knowledge of the facts
sirs who have knowledge of the facts defray
the expenditure of wit i waste in vain
trying to find out just one fact of all
she who brought letters from who could not write
and took back letters to who could not read
who was that messenger of your charity
well so far favours you the circumstance
that this same messengerhow shall we say
sub imputatione meretricis
laboratwhich makes accusation null
we waive this womansnought makes void the next
borsi called venerino he who drove
o the first night when you fled away at length
deposes to your kissings in the coach
frequent frenetic when deposed he so
after some weeks of sharp imprisonment
granted by friend the governor i engage
for his participation in your flight
at length his obduracy melting made
the avowal mentioned was dismissed forthwith
to liberty poor knave for recompense
sirs give what credit to the lie you can
for me no word in my defence i speak
and god shall argue for the lady

so
did i stand question and make answer still
with the same result of smiling disbelief
polite impossibility of faith
in such affected virtue in a priest
but a showing fair play an indulgence even
to one no worse than others after all
who had not brought disgrace to the order played
discreetly ruffled gown nor ripped the cloth
in a bungling game at romps i have told you sirs
if i pretended simply to be pure
honest and christian in the caseabsurd
as well go boast myself above the needs
o the human nature careless how meat smells
wine tastesa saint above the smack but once
abate my crest own flaws i the flesh agree
to go with the herd be hog no more nor less
why hogs in common herd have common rights
i must not be unduly borne upon
who had just romanced a little sown wild oats
but scaped without a scandal flagrant fault
my name helped to a mirthful circumstance
joseph would do well to amend his plea
undoubtedlysome toying with the wife
but as for ruffian violence and rape
potiphar pressed too much on the other side
the intrigue the elopement the disguisewell charged
the letters and verse looked hardly like the truth
your apprehension wasof guilt enough
to be compatible with innocence
so punished best a little and not too much
had i struck guido franceschinis face
you had counselled me withdraw for my own sake
baulk him of bravohiring friends came round
congratulated nobody mistakes
the pettiness o the forfeiture defines
the peccadillo guido gets his share
his wife is free of husband and hooknose
the mouldy viands and the motherinlaw
to civita with you and amuse the time
travesty us de raptu helenae
a funny figure must the husband cut
when the wife makes him skiptoo ticklish eh
do it in latin not the vulgar then
scazonswell copy and send his eminence
mindone iambus in the final foot
hell rectify it be your friend for life
oh sirs depend on me for much new light
thrown on the justice and religion here
by this proceeding much fresh food for thought

and i was just set down to study these
in relegation two short days ago
admiring how you read the rules when clap
a thunder comes into my solitude
i am caught up in a whirlwind and cast here
told of a sudden in this room where so late
you dealt out law adroitly that those scales
i meekly bowed to took my allotment from
guido has snatched at broken in your hands
metes to himself the murder of his wife
full measure pressed down running over now
can i assist to an explanationyes
i rise in your esteem sagacious sirs
stand up a renderer of reasons not
the officious priest would personate saint george
for a mock princess in undragoned days
what the blood startles you what after all
the priest who needs must carry sword on thigh
may find imperative use for it then there was
a princess was a dragon belching flame
and should have been a saint george also then
there might be worse schemes than to break the bonds
at arezzo lead her by the little hand
till she reached rome and let her try to live
but you were the law and the gospelwould one please
stand back allow your faculty elbowroom
you blind guides who must needs lead eyes that see
fools alike ignorant of man and god
what was there here should have perplexed your wit
for a wink of the owleyes of you how miss then
whats now forced on you by this flare of fact
as if saint peter failed to recognise
nero as no apostle john or james
till someone burned a martyr make a torch
o the blood and fat to show his features by
could you fail read this cartulary aright
on head and front of franceschini there
largelettered like hells masterpiece of print
that he from the beginning pricked at heart
by some lust letch of hate against his wife
plotted to plague her into overt sin
and shame would slay pompilia body and soul
and save his mean selfmiserably caught
i the quagmire of his own tricks cheats and lies
that himself wrote those papersfrom himself
to himselfwhich i the name of me and her
his mistressmessenger gave her and me
touching us with such pustules of the soul
that she and i might take the taint be shown
to the world and shuddered over speckled so
that the agent put her sense into my words
made substitution of the thing she hoped
for the thing she had and held its opposite
while the husband in the background bit his lips
at each fresh failure of his precious plot
that when at the last we did rush each on each
by no chance but because god willed it so
the spark of truth was struck from out our souls
made all of me descried in the first glance
seem fair and honest and permissible love
o the good and trueas the first glance told me
there was no duty patent in the world
like daring try be good and true myself
leaving the shows of things to the lord of show
and prince o the power of the air our very flight
even to its most ambiguous circumstance
irrefragably proved how futile false
why menmen and not boysboys and not babes
babes and not beastsbeasts and not stocks and stones
had the liars lie been true one pinpoint speck
were i the accepted suitor free o the place
disposer of the time to come at a call
and go at a wink as who should say me nay
what need of flight what were the gain therefrom
but just damnation failure or success
damnation pure and simple to her the wife
and me the priestwho bartered private bliss
for public reprobation the safe shade
for the sunshine which men see to pelt me by
what other advantagewe who led the days
and nights alone i the housewas flight to find
in our whole journey did we stop an hour
diverge a foot from strait road till we reached
or would have reachedbut for that fate of ours
the father and mother in the eye of rome
the eye of yourselves we made aware of us
at the first fall of misfortune and indeed
you did so far give sanction to our flight
confirm its purpose as lend helping hand
deliver up pompilia not to him
she fled but those the flight was ventured for
why then could you who stopped short not go on
one poor step more and justify the means
having allowed the endnot see and say
heres the exceptional conduct that should claim
to be exceptionally judged on rules
which understood make no exception here
why play instead into the devils hands
by dealing so ambiguously as gave
guido the power to intervene like me
prove one exception more i saved his wife
against law against law he slays her now
deal with him

i have done with being judged
i stand here guiltless in thought word and deed
to the point that i apprise youin contempt
for all misapprehending ignorance
o the human heart much more the mind of christ
that i assuredly did bow was blessed
by the revelation of pompilia there
such is the final fact i fling you sirs
to mouth and mumble and misinterpret there
the priests in love have it the vulgar way
unpriest me rend the rags o the vestment do
degrade deep disenfranchise all you dare
remove me from the midst no longer priest
and fit companion for the like of you
your gay abati with the wellturned leg
and rose i the hatrim canons cross at neck
and silk mask in the pocket of the gown
brisk bishops with the worlds musk still unbrushed
from the rochet ill no more of these good things
theres a crack somewhere something thats unsound
i the rattle

for pompiliabe advised
build churches go pray you will find me there
i know if you comeand you will come i know
why theres a judge weeping did not i say
you were good and true at bottom you see the truth
i am glad i helped you she helped me just so

but for count guidoyou must counsel there
i bow my head bend to the very dust
break myself up in shame of faultiness
i had him one whole moment as i said
as i remember as will never out
o the thoughts of mei had him in arms reach
thereas you stand sir now you cease to sit
i could have killed him ere he killed his wife
and did not he went off alive and well
and then effected this last featthrough me
menot through youdismiss that fear twas you
hindered me staying here to save hernot
from leaving you and going back to him
and doing service in arezzo come
instruct me in procedure i conceive
in all due selfabasement might i speak
how you will deal with guido oh not death
death if it let her life be otherwise
not deathyour lights will teach you clearer i
certainly have an instinct of my own
i the matter bear with me and weigh its worth
let us go awayleave guido all alone
back on the world again that knows him now
i think he will be found indulge so far
not to die so much as slide out of life
pushed by the general horror and common hate
low lowerleft o the very ledge of things
i seem to see him catch convulsively
one by one at all honest forms of life
at reason order decency and use
to cramp him and get foothold by at least
and still they disengage them from his clutch
what you are he then had pompilia once
and so forwent her take not up with us
and thus i see him slowly and surely edged
off all the tableland whence life upsprings
aspiring to be immortality
as the snake hatched on hilltop by mischance
despite his wriggling slips slides slidders down
hillside lies low and prostrate on the smooth
level of the outer place lapsed in the vale
so i lose guido in the loneliness
silence and dusk till at the doleful end
at the horizontal line creations verge
from what just is to absolute nothingness
lo what is this he meets strains onward still
what other man deep further in the fate
who turning at the prize of a footfall
to flatter him and promise fellowship
discovers in the act a frightful face
judas made monstrous by much solitude
the two are at one now let them love their love
that bites and claws like hate or hate their hate
that mops and mows and makes as it were love
there let them each tear each in devilsfun
or fondle this the other while malice aches
both teach both learn detestability
kiss him the kiss iscariot pay that back
that snatch o the slaver blistering on your lip
by the better trick the insult he spared christ
lure him the lure o the letters aretine
lick him oer slimysmooth with jellyfilth
o the verseandprose pollution in loves guise
the cockatrice is with the basilisk
there let them grapple denizens o the dark
foes or friends but indissolubly bound
in their one spot out of the ken of god
or care of man for ever and ever more

why sirs whats this why this is sorry and strange
futility divagation this from me
bound to be rational justify an act
of sober manwhereas being moved so much
i give you cause to doubt the ladys mind
a pretty sarcasm for the world i fear
you do her wit injusticeall through me
like my fate all throughineffective help
a poor rash advocate i prove myself
you might be angry with good cause but sure
at the advocateonly at the undue zeal
that spoils the force of his own plea i think
my part was just to tell you how things stand
state facts and not be flustered at their fume
but then tis a priest speaks as for loveno
if you let buzz a vulgar fly like that
about your brains as if i loved forsooth
indeed sirs you do wrong we had no thought
of such infatuation she and i
there are many points that prove it do be just
i told youat one little roadsideplace
i spent a good halfhour paced to and fro
the garden just to leave her free awhile
i plucked a handful of spring herb and bloom
i might have sat beside her on the bench
where the children were i wish the thing had been
indeed the event could not be worse you know
one more halfhour of her saved shes dead now sirs
while i was running on at such a rate
friends should have plucked me by the sleeve i went
too much o the trivial outside of her face
and the purity that shone thereplain to me
not to you what more natural nor am i
infatuatedoh i saw be sure
her brow had not the right line leaned too much
painters would say they like the straightup greek
this seemed bent somewhat with an invisible crown
of martyr and saint not such as art approves
and how the dark orbs dwelt deep underneath
looked out of such a sad sweet heaven on me
the lips compressed a little came forward too
careful for a whole world of sin and pain
that was the face her husband makes his plea
he sought just to disfigureno offence
beyond that sirs let us be rational
he needs must vindicate his honouray
yet shirks the coward in a clowns disguise
away from the scene endeavours to escape
now had he done so slain and left no trace
o the slayerwhat were vindicated pray
you had found his wife disfigured or a corpse
for what and by whom it is too palpable
then heres another point involving law
i use this argument to show you meant
no calumny against us by that title
o the sentenceliars try to twist it so
what penalty it bore i had to pay
till further proof should follow of innocence
probationis ob defectumproof
how could you get proof without trying us
you went through the preliminary form
stopped there contrived this sentence to amuse
the adversary if the title ran
for more than fault imputed and not proved
that was a simple penmans error else
a slip i the phraseas when we say of you
charged with injusticewhich may either be
or not betis a name that sticks meanwhile
another relevant matter fool that i am
not what i wish true yet a point friends urge
it is not trueyet since friends think it helps
she only tried me when some others failed
began with conti whom i told you of
and guillichini guidos kinsfolk both
and when abandoned by them not before
turned to me thats conclusive why she turned
much good they got by the happy cowardice
conti is dead poisoned a month ago
does that much strike you as a sin not much
after the present murderone mark more
on the moors skinwhat is black by blacker still
conti had come here and told truth and so
with guillichini hes condemned of course
to the galleys as a friend in this affair
tried and condemned for no one thing i the world
a fortnight since by who but the governor
the just judge who refused pompilia help
at first blush being her husbands friend you know
there are two tales to suit the separate courts
arezzo and rome he tells you here we fled
alone unhelpedlays stress on the main fault
the spiritual sin rome looks to but elsewhere
he likes best we should break in steal bear off
be fit to brand and pillory and flog
thats the charge goes to the heart of the governor
if these unpriest me you and i may yet
converse vincenzo marzimedici
oh sirs there are worse men than you i say
more easily duped i mean this stupid lie
its liar never dared propound in rome
he gets arezzo to receivenay more
gets florence and the duke to authorise
this is their rotas sentence their granduke
signs and seals rome for me henceforwardrome
where better men aremost of all that man
the augustinian of the hospital
who writes the letterhe confessed he says
many a dying person never one
so sweet and true and pure and beautiful
a good man will you make him pope one day
not that he is not good too this we have
but oldelse he would have his word to speak
his truth to teach the world i thirst for truth
but shall not drink it till i reach the source

sirs i am quiet again you see we are
so very pitiable she and i
who had conceivably been otherwise
forget distemperature and idle heat
apart from truths sake whats to move so much
pompilia will be presently with god
i am on earth as good as out of it
a relegated priest when exile ends
i mean to do my duty and live long
she and i are mere strangers now but priests
should study passion how else cure mankind
who come for help in passionate extremes
i do but play with an imagined life
of who unfettered by a vow unblessed
by the higher callsince you will have it so
leads it companioned by the woman there
to live and see her learn and learn by her
out of the low obscure and petty world
or only see one purpose and one will
evolve themselves i the world change wrong to right
to have to do with nothing but the true
the good the eternaland these not alone
in the main current of the general life
but small experiences of every day
concerns of the particular hearth and home
to learn not only by a comets rush
but a roses birthnot by the grandeur god
but the comfort christ all this how far away
mere delectation meet for a minutes dream
just as a drudging student trims his lamp
opens his plutarch puts him in the place
of roman grecian draws the patched gown close
dreams thus should i fight save or rule the world
then smilingly contentedly awakes
to the old solitary nothingness
so i from such communion pass content
o great just good god miserable meembed"
