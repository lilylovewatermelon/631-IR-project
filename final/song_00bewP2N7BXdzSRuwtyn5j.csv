verse 1 the game
to all my niggas on the porch gettin they hair braided
cornrowed by a la bitch
and i cant forget my niggas ridin the train yankee fitted
snub nose under that pelle shit
i love new york but gangbangin thats la shit
and im proud of it spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
haters you know who you are you could turn it down fuck it
i could shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
im gangsta let the 40 cal blow in public
more hatred inside my soul than pac had for delores tucker
every time one of my niggas get shot the more i suffer
cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
i seen it all through the range tints
got niggas doin life in the state pen
so i dread like jamaicans
if i die for one of my statements
then break up the streets of compton
spread my blood in the pavement
