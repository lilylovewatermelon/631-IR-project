we slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
and i dont even have the time to figure what its worth
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse

but if i move my place in line ill lose
and i have waited the anticipations got me glued

i am waiting for something to go wrong
i am waiting for familiar resolve

sometimes it seems that i dont have the skills to recollect
the twists and turns of plot that turned us from lovers to friends
im thinking i should take that volume back up off the shelf
and brush off all the dust  and read to help remind myself

but if i move my place in line ill lose
and i have waited the anticipations got me glued

i am waiting for something to go wrong
i am waiting for familiar resolve
i am waiting for another repeat
as the hours turn to days that turn to weeks
i am waiting for that sense of relief
i am waiting for you to split the scene
and make it just like it was when we were young
before we knew that this day would ever come
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likebreak

sometimes i think this cycle never ends
we slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb again
and i dont even have the time to figure what its worth
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse

the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel is getting worseembed"
