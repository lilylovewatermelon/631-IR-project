i have heard of a land on the far away strand
this is a beautiful home of the soul
built by jesus on high there we never shall die
this is a land where we never grow old
never grow old never grow old
in a land where well never grow old
never grow old never grow old
in a land where well never grow old
in that beautiful home where well never more roam
we shall be in the sweet by and by
happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
this is a land where we never shall die
when our work here is done and the life crown is won
and out troubles and trials are oer
all our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
with the loved ones whove gone on beforeyou might also likeembed"
