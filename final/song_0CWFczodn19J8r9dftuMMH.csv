scatter gun blast tens in the air
half a million in a burlap sack
yall have a nice day as we make our way
to the caddie in the ally out back
see when the times get hard
some good old boys turn to a life a sin
were like robin hood were just twice as good
but we can never go home again
well i grew up singing amazing grace
in a little white church in the woods
my momma prayed hard for all her boys
but her praying didnt do a bit of good
the sheriff and a banker man came to push us off of our land
now were six feet deep
and my brothers and me we can never go home again
lord forgive me i know just what i do
ill take what i need and then
i leave the rest to my momma and you
and that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
but its closer than ive ever been
god bless an outlaws weary soul
i can never go home again
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likesometimes i dream of that old front porch and my momma patching up a quilt
while my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill
now its hideout shacks better watch your back and cover every track of where youve been
a thousand wrongs will never make it right i can never go home again

lord forgive me i know just what i do
ill take what i need and then
i leave the rest to my momma and you
and that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
but its closer than ive ever been
god bless an outlaws weary soul
i can never go home again

scatter gun blast tears a ten inch hole
through an empty burlap sack
as i say my peace for my brothers and me
my whole world fades to black
heres three new graves underneath the shade of
that live oak tree on the hill
overlooking mommas porch with a fresh coat of paint
and a shiny new coup de ville

lord forgive me i know just what ive done
ive been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
and that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but its closer than ive ever been
god bless an outlaws weary soul i thought id never make it home
god bless an outlaws weary soul i guess i finally made it home again1embed"
