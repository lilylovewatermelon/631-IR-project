and were at it again
i turn around another fucking war man
i dont know where to begin
but ill start with the radical leaders
their steps were following

refrain
running dont go back and fight too many youll lose
and as clowns you follow suit
behind the blood between the red and white and blue
but its too deep for you to see and everyone eventually will take the step
cause its in sight you take the left ill take the right
i feel the hate youve built for me and i say pay attention baby

chorus
as they thank the lord
the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain
deadly disease woah

verse 2
but it wasnt a sin
a sorry life judging every action
and as theyre feeding your mind with this shit
you forget how to speak
how to ask all the questions
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likerefrain
the business at hand tonight make the people choose
i see another side in you but theres not much more i can do
from on the outside looking in your government is listening
to push you on the story of immortal father mortal son
give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself

prechorus
if they had it their way id burn in hell
and your futures a fucking disaster cant you see
dont give them all the power
when your futures in desperate trouble baby

chorus
as they thank the lord
the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain
deadly disease woah
id run away tonight with my mind still intact
you gotta make it alright
easier said than done with no place to hide
and having no place to

postchorus
running away from condition
i see you but youre running away from
your scared seductive system
bridge
most would claim i live a lie i live a lie
when pointing out its easy to predict these things predict these things
every color has its side i have a side
they live together vote and most embrace the same dark times
please help us please save us
of course they have control were all the same
up on the cross crucified their problem
drove the nail and let him rot
family and friends it wont matter in the end
im sure theyll understand
now look at the world and see
how the humans bleed
as i sit up here and wonder about
how you sold your mind body and soul
looking at the fields so green
i know this sounds obscene
i see youre living for tomorrow
but decisions you have made will leave you empty

chorus
as they thank the lord
the blind cant see
like a plague fed to the brain
deadly disease woah
id run away tonight with my mind still intact
you gotta make it alright
easier said than done with no place to hide
and having no place to run
instrumental break

outro
you have fallen asleep in denial
look at the way were dying one by one
how it ends ill never know
just live your life blind like me8embed"
