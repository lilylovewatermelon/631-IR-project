i have lived in a junkyard
where the weeds eat up the rain
if you get anything there out of place
you know theres hell to pay

chorus
and he said youre as sick as you are lovely
and in need of a hand
he tells me you are never worthy
but i was just a child you see
that was my reality

verse 2
he had a sick little girl
dirty and hard with a breast plate made of metal
she drives all day in her rusty buick
and her feet dont reach the pedals
got a jar of flies fathers disguise
where his heart should be
her mouth is sewn together
she screams with those eyes screams with those eyes
she screams with those eyes

chorus
she fell sick she is lovely
and in need of my hand yeah he uses his hands
he tells her you are never worthy
she was all alone you see
that was her reality

yeah when i should have been sleeping
should have been dreaming
but i wake up to broken glass
therell be one more empty desk in my homeroom class
i got an old bone pocket knife tight in my right hand
to save my poor mother from the junkyard man

chorus
hes as sick as she is lovely
and in need of a hand
he will know hes not worthy
when he dies alone you see
thats his reality

chorus
im not sick i am lovely
hatred is the curse of man
i will not feel unworthy
because i have washed my hands you see
thats my realityembed"
