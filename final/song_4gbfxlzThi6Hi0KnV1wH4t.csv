verse 1 iggy azalea
you used to dealing with basic bitches basic shit all the time
im a new classic upgrade your status from a standby to a frequent flyer
hop out your past life and ill renovate your future
then i integrate my genius shit we purchasin not perusing
yeah i love your hustle baby just let me add a little bit of muscle baby
joint venture well partner up until the shares are up and i up your wages
on a private island dolo where one meal cost a car note
them broads before me was locals through customs accustom your wardrobe damn
stamped passports where they all pass ports til the clocks fast forward
therell be dark blue shores where they dont do chores we just get chauffeured
damn this is the life exclusive shit with all access granted
in the country where the accents are grand and they landin on top of all the mansions
