yeah
do you still scroll through them texts messages
this henny got me thinkin bout the things that you said
it was real
for real
up for three weeks
feeling half past dead
sitting here reflecting
on whats in my head
and how i feel
for real

im running low so dont play with my time
im searching but its nothing left to find
send out a call but no ones on the line
so if you want it please make up your mind
please make up your mind

you know everything cause i put it in my songs
if i tell you that im working i aint out doing you wrong
i got too much on my plate to add some shit that i dont need
i aint asking you for space just some room to fucking breathe
but i cant stress myself by tryna prove my fucking love
i stand up say i had enough
she stand up boy you think you tough
take my phone search what you want
whos this bitch girl thats my mom
whos this woman girl thats my aunt
i could be a lame nigga thats what you want
see you want me to be a pretty liar so bad
but i cant fuck with karma cause she always comes back
so call me every name you can find in the book
but dont try to discredit every chance that i took
