all i want is nothing more
to hear you knocking at my door
cause if i could see your face once more
i could die a happy man im sure
when you said your last goodbye
i died a little bit inside
i lay in tears in bed all night
alone without you by my side

chorus
but if you loved me whyd you leave me
take my body take my body
all i want is and all i need is
to find somebody ill find somebody
like you oh oh oh
like you like you

verse 2
so you brought out the best of me
a part of me id never seen
you took my soul and wiped it clean
our love was made for movie screens

chorus
but if you loved me whyd you leave me
take my body take my body
all i want is and all i need is
to find somebody ill find somebody
