that mornin sun made its way
through the windshield of my chevrolet
whiskey eyes and ashtray breath
on a chert rock gravel road

verse 1
what the hell did i do last night
thats the story of my life
like tryin to remember words
to a song nobody wrote

chorus
and its sad and its long and cant nobody sing along
its a southbound train its a whistle in the wind
aint no one there to care where ive been
im hummin on that lonesome song again

verse 2
i took a trip across the country from montgomery
discovered id been wrong for so long
i thought it was the fame and the glory and the money
but all ive got to show is a damn song

chorus
and its sad and its long cant nobody sing along
its a southbound train its a whistle in the wind
theres no one there to sing to in the end
im hummin on that lonesome song again
