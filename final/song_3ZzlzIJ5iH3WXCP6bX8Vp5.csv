well she was standing in a bar
i said hello how do you do
she handed me a beer with a kangaroo
she spoke of places i had never been
that she had traveled to
and we slow danced alone to faster tunes
and i made her laugh i made a pass
i showed her my halfdollar ring
she said thats pretty cool
but classy girls dont kiss in bars you fool
no they dont

verse 2
so later on the crowd calmed down
and i believe it was as if
something drew me closer to her lips
so picture my surprise when i had tried
to lean in for a kiss
and she just smiled and turned her head down
and i asked her why and she replied
it was nothing i was doin wrong
its just what it is
no classy girls dont kiss in bars like this

chorus
no classy girls dont kiss in bars
boys will break their backs and hearts
but its alright the hardest part is through
