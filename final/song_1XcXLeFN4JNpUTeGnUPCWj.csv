the lights are bright tonight the music loud
a perfect mess thats what surrounds me
then i see you over there i cant seem to break the stare
maybe its cause your shirt is my favorite color
then you walk on over with a smolder
and you hand me your number i say what is this
you say love at first sight it exists
but ive had my heart broken so many times before
yeah ive walked through so many empty doors

chorus
but if i see you in my dreams tonight
then maybe you were right
and ill call you in the morning
if i see you in my dreams tonight
and you take my hands and tell me
ive been waiting for you
then ill tell you me too
if i see you in my dreams tonight

verse 2
i start to drive away and smile like im insane
how can i feel this way i dont even know your name
the napkin doesnt say
then i remember that i vowed not let anyone enter my heart
i say what is this
i know love at first sight cant exist
you might also likechorus
but if i see you in my dreams tonight
then maybe you were right
and ill call you in the morning
if i see you in my dreams tonight
and you take my hands and tell me
ive been waiting for you
then ill tell you me too
if i see you in my dreams tonight

bridge
maybe well meet in a different dimension
and you can tell me all the things you didnt mention
maybe well meet in a different dimension
and you can tell me all the things you didnt mention
youll say what is this
ill say i guess love at first sight exists

chorus
cause i saw you in my dreams that night
and i knew that you were right
so i called you in the morning
in the morning in the morning
yeah i saw you in my dreams that night
and you took my hands and told me
ive been waiting for you
and i told you me too
yeah i saw you in my dreams that night
if i see you in my dreams tonight3embed"
