come up to meet you tell you im sorry you dont know how lovely you are
i had to find you tell you i need you and tell you i set you apart
tell me your secrets and ask me your questions no lets go back to the start
runnin in circles comin up tails heads on a science apart

chorus
nobody said it was easy its such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start
verse 2
i was just guessin at numbers and figures pullin your puzzles apart
questions of science science and progress do not speak as loud as my heart
and tell me you love me come back and haunt me oh and i rush to the start
runnin in circles chasin our tails comin back as we are

chorus
nobody said it was easy oh its such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy no one ever said it would be so hard
im goin back to the start
