one time is all it takes to want me
one time is all it takes to think youre the only
one might believe that i might care
one night is all i need to make you disappear

chorus
i always hate the way you love me
i always seem to love what never can be mine
i need to hurt myself so i can feel something
just one time

verse 2
ill pull you in and keep you closely closely
then spit you out and make you feel like you owe me
your heart ill use to heal my pain heal my pain
so hard for me to feel like anything or any way

chorus
i always hate the way you love me
i always seem to love what never can be mine
i need to hurt myself so i can feel something
just one time time

chorus
i always hate the way you love me
i always seem to love what never can be mine
i need to hurt myself so i can feel
i always curse myself when somethings real
i need to hurt myself so i can feel something
