five days
underwater
near your island
off the coast i know

five ways
you were my lover
incantation
of the tide in rhyme

verse
oh
all in the glow of fire youre waiting
oh
has it been so long now ahah ah

oh
i thought you knew that id be coming
the way you move a foreign groove
at night i could never

i could never hold you

chorus
watch it rise up where you hide
your pearls
feel it pile up where you cast
those stones you wear
you might also likewhen no ones home
do they feel cold on your bones
all the years i miss your warmth
have you missed my warmth

on your island oh

outro
oohooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh oohooh
oohooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh oohooh
oohooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh oohooh
oohooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh oohooh6embed"
