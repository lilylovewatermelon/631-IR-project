verse 1
only nineteen they expectin me to change shit
started chasin dreams in a year i was famous
youngin on that billboard came a long way from the gang shit
know they must look at me like i speak another language
i be goin off off the top put my city in a lock
try my shot look this is what i got
i couldnt wait i guess some of us couldnt relate
i wouldnt hate if i saw someone doin great
i actually did it motivated me and look at me here
started thumpin from the top of the year
all of a sudden bitches stop and they stare
when thе watch wasnt there they aint bеlieve in me i didnt care i could shit now told them haters on my body put my dick down
cause everything i breathe is a hit now
its my own flow im in my mojo
in my dm tryna chat you up
i can talk hot cause im on go even when im solo
niggas know i keep it on me dolo
dont go runnin to the popo
i been knew i would pass you
