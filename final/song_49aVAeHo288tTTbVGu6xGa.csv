twentysix years and seems like ive just begun
to understand my my intimate is no one
when the director sold the show who bought its last rites
they cut the cast the music and the lights

chorus
this is my line this is eternal
how did i ever end up here
discarnate preternatural
my prayers to disappear
absent of grace marked as infernal
ungranted in dead time left me disowned
to this nature so unnatural
i remain alone

verse 2
twentysix years end still speaking in these tongues
such revelations while understood by no one
when the new actor stole the show who questioned his grace
please clear this house of illacquired taste

chorus
this is my line this is eternal
how did i ever end up here
discarnate preternatural
my prayers to disappear
absent of grace marked as infernal
ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
to this nature so unnatural
i remain alone

give me something give me something
give me something give me something
give me something give me something real

bridge 2
i lay strewn across the floor cant solve this puzzle
everyday another small piece cant be found
i lay strewn across the floor pieced up in sorrow
the pieces are lost these pieces dont fit
pieced together incomplete and empty

chorus
this is my line this is eternal
how did i ever end up here
discarnate preternatural
my prayers to disappear
absent of grace marked as infernal
ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
to this nature so unnatural
i remain alone

this is my line this is eternal
how did i end up here
discarnate preternatural
this is my prayers to disappear
absent of grace marked as infernal
ungranted in dead time and left me disowned
to this nature so unnatural
i remain alone2embed"
