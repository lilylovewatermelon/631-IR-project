that day ill always remember yes i will
cause that was the day that my daddy died
i never got a chance to see him
never heard nothin but bad things about him
mama im depending on you to tell me the truth
and momma just hung her head and said

son papa was a rolling stone
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
papa was a rolling stone my son
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
well well

hey mama is it true what they say
that papa never worked a day in his life
and mama some bad talk goin round town
sayin that papa had three outside children and another wife
and that aint right
heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin
talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the lord
mama just hung her head and said
see the temptations liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likepapa was a rolling stone my son
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
hey papa was a rolling stone my son
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
uh

hey mama i heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave
folks say papa would beg borrow steal to pay his bills
hey mama folks say that papa never was much on thinking
spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
mama im depending on you to tell me the truth
and momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said

son papa was a rolling stone
well well well well
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
lone lone lone alone

papa was a rolling stone
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
i said papa was a rolling stone yes he was
wherever he laid his hat was his home
and when he died all he left us was alone
my daddy was
papa was a rolling stone
wherever he laid his hat was his homeembed"
