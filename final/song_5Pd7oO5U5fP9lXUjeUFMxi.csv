refrain 1
hella cheese hella trees lsd
selling d feeling like the 70s
getting paid like we seventy

verse 1 big sean
float around my town like its the motherfucking seven seas
hit the club lose seven gs film it all on 7ds
spilling liquor rest in peace rest of my gs rest with a piece
start the day dissecting weed then strategize then rest my team
same show different seats same game different league
living life i hope that everyone i love will get to see
get to see get to see get to see get to see
living life i hope that everyone i love will get to see
get to see get to see get to see get to see
bitch

verse 2 big sean
i was thinking about the ice that i put on money that ive blown
bitches that i know everything that ive done wrong
all the licks i hit all the bullets missed
got my shit legit a lot of people pissed well
i got money coming through
drugs and women coming too
got my family living comfortable
got me thinking im doing what im supposed to do
im doing what im supposed to do
im doing what im supposed to do
