every time i fall i get back up again
cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
let it take me where it wants to go
another one horse town another damned old rodeo

pre  chorus
i know this life is crazy
but ill be home soon baby

chorus
ill ride in on a sunny day
sing you a song steal your heart away
like a cowboy
hang my hat like im here for a while
kick off my boots and drive you wild
like a cowboy
well baby you know i cant stay long
you wake up ill be gone
until then ill hold on
like a cowboy

verse 2
i keep your picture tucked inside my old hat
it brings me luck i need a bunch of that
this midnight winding road runs through my blood
i cant give it up like i said i would
