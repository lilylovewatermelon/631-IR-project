verse 1 yung maraschino
outhside shorty on them all black forgis
uicide for life but i aint touring at 40
bitches begging for a ring just cause i can kinda sing
but the only thing that i want is to be a fucking normie
hold up lil mama i got them thangs what about em
whats the problem i got my own you aint gotta solve em
i promise it wont affect you im just tryna holla
starving for attention but im not tryna bother you
baby you can call on me
i used to come in last focused on the past
now im drifting down the highway until i run out of gas
don’t want to be recognized but i aint wearing a mask
just point and fucking wave i dont wanna be tagged

interlude young north

im a northside player snorting southside dope
pull up in the benz give the southside hope
joe exotic what im smoking backwood flaming
backwoods claiming yo lick what you sayin
im a praying motherfucker lying motherfucker
okay up and spray a motherfucker if they step in my business
keep spraying motherf sorry thats my mental illness
need to pop me a pill before i finish these lyrics
baby you can call on me okay
