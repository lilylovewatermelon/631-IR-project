theyre kicking us out saying its time to close
were leaning on each other trying to beat the cold
i carry your shoes and i give you my coat
were walking these streets like theyre paved with gold
make any old excuses not to go
neither one of us want to take that taxi home

chorus
singing our hearts out
standing on chairs
spending our time
like we are millionaires
laughing our heads off
the two of us there
spending our time
like we are millionaires
millionaires

verse 2
lost my heart and i hope to die
seeing that sunlight hit your eyes
been up all night but you still look amazing to me

had the type of night you only dream about
if god came down he could take me now
cause in my mind yeah we will always be

and the band was on playing our song
we messed up the lyrics
as we sang along
but we didnt care
cause it felt like we were the only ones there
our feet were sore our throats were raw
theyre turning out the lights but were shouting more
were shouting more
