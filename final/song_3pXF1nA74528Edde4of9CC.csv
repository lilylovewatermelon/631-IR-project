dont dont play with her dont be dishonest ayy
still not understandin this logic ayy
im back and im better and im better
i want you bad as ever
dont let me just let up
i wanna give you better
baby its whatever
somebody gotta step up
girl im that somebody so im next up
be damned if i let him catch up
its easy to see that youre fed up
i am on a whole nother level
girl he only fucked you over cause you let him
fuck him girl i guess he didnt know any better
girl that man didnt show any effort
do all i can just to show you youre special
certain its your love that holds me together
lately you say he been killin the vibe
gotta be sick of this guy
pull up skrr get in the ride
left hand is steerin the other is grippin your thigh
light up a spliff and get high
shawty you deserve what youve been missin
lookin at you im thinkin he must be trippin
play this song for him tell him just listen

verse 2
girl said he keeps on playin games
and his lovin aint the same
i dont know what to say but
what a shame
if you were mine you would not get the same
if you were mine you would top everything
suicide in the drop switchin lanes
and that thing so fire baby no propane
got good pussy girl can i be frank
to keep it 100 girl i aint no saint
but he the only reason that im feelin this way
givin you the world baby when you get space
pen game get me laid baby thats penetrate
oh baby
