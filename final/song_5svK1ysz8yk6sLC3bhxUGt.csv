butterflies in my stomach enough to make me fly away
pretty brown eyes i seen you from a mile away
but i was on the stage
so i couldnt get your name but
baby girl i got your face
can’t believe i lost you in the crowd
i think about you every day
and girl i wont be here for long for long
so baby if you hear this song can you come to me
pretty brown skin in houston i could use your company
oohwoah ohwoah oh

outro crowd cheering
woo
