verse 1 jadakiss
just relieve your stress relax
chill your ring finger and freeze ya chest
cop you the new beemer the beads is next
and even though its a want i need the sex
i hope its just insecurity
cause i know she feeling me
digging the growth and the maturity
but i got hard luck cause honey keep keeping her guards up
so im just trying to even the odds up
and that part sucks to have to keep going back in on her
when she know that i been on her
since back in the days in manhattan after the matinee
when she just happened to wave
thats when i knew she had the right shine right shine
and the right mind right mind
its just on me to catch her at the right time right time
when i get her ima grab her by the wrist
pull her close to me hug her and tell her this

if the ice dont matter and the money dont phase you
cars dont impress you i bet the sexll amaze you
look you dont want to past the chance hey
spend the summer in the bottom half of france
dont be alarmed i dont mean no harm
ill help you before i hurt you im trying to rebirth you
i wanna love you i aint just have to nail you
