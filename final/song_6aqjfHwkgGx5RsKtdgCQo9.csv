maybe im old fashioned feeling as i do
maybe i am living in the past
but when i meet the right one
i know that ill be true
my first love will be my last

chorus
when i fall in love it will be forever
or ill never fall in love
in a restless world like this is
love is ended before its begun
and too many moonlight kisses
seem to cool in the warmth of the sun oh oh

verse 2
when i give my heart it will be completely
or ill never never never give my heart
and the moment i can feel that you feel that way too
is when i give my heart to youyou might also likeembed"
