verse 1
you only give me what you dont want no more
ask the questions that you dont know at all

chorus
lets lie down for a while
you canâ€™t smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

verse 2
you know how it is my friend
in the boxes of those picture frames
hold your inside cause youre cold at night
warm your heart love cause youre by my side

chorus
lets lie down for a while
you can smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

bridge
lay your head in the apple orchard
take your time you can settle down
hold your breath
cause youre youre good at nothing
hold your head on me
