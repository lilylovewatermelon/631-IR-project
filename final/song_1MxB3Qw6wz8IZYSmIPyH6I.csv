scream

verse 1
full force destroy the source
cant see and my voice is hoarse
tried to wash your hands of us
but you should know better than to leave us in disgust
let me take you right to the point
all you ever do is dedicate the disjoint
that does it the time has arrived
take it or leave it you better not side

you did it again
all you ever did was doubt
what do you want
let me tell you what its all about
one life
nine hearts
and eighteen hands thatll rip you all apart
were here to decimate
to show you all we will never fall
its gonna get serious and critical
dont stop because the feeling is terminal

prechorus
scream
scream like you never have before
scream
scream till you cant scream anymore
scream
scream like your throat is bleeding
scream
scream till your heart stops beating
scream for me
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeverse 2
get off of me and give a lie
show the whole damn world this will never die
no matter how the energies scatter
got to know nothing exists but the dream
give it all till theres nothing left to give
save it all cause its saving you
if youre going to let the pain inside
never underestimate the way you live your life

prechorus
scream
scream like you never have before
scream
scream till you cant scream anymore
scream
scream like your throat is bleeding
scream
scream till your heart stops beating
scream for me

chorus
all our lives
all we ever sacrificed has paid
everything
everything is possible to me
why no fate
found everything that i had to take away
save your life
save it all and make a better way
all our lives
all we ever sacrificed has paid
everything
everything is possible to me
why no fate
found everything that i had to take away
save your life
save it all and make a better way
instrumental break
yeah

verse 3
this stress is a feeling that you cant compress
everything youre going through is total stress
are you going to be a momentary king of the rhetoric
or will you handle the matter and prove you exist

chorus
all our lives
all we ever sacrificed has paid
everything
everything is possible to me
why no fate
found everything that i had to take away
save your life
save it all and make a better way
all our lives
all we ever sacrificed has paid
everything
everything is possible to me
why no fate
found everything that i had to take away
save your life
save it all and make a better way
outro
