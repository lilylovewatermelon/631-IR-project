hello lord its me again
i just wanna make love to the whole globe
and all her girlfriends
now dont that make ya mind move
like smoke patterns me on my way to saturn wit a bomb
namviet viet or saudi shawty
i figure before the first gun blast they know who gon win
now wont that make us all fools like class clowns
praying private ryan comes round
sound travels at onethousandonethirty feet per second
niggas in the street they want it hurry
when niggas stop biting thats when 3000 starts to worry
a little knowledge from the college of wizard ray murray
answer quick do you know what desire is huh
apparently not thats why you get what you got
now answer this do you know what fire is yeah
the body of hot the motivator of pots
snot spit shit are characteristics of release
ask your niece or nephew you think we left you
what the future holds in its sweaty palms
think im finna vom
you move it like you mean it shell come
prom night might excite a down right fight like
white blood cells to the common cold rebel
night gets jealous of day play is no longer
the feelin gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade

even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
and we some homemade bombs
finna blow right up in your face
verse 2 breal
look at the way you look at me i see it on your face
all your hate emanates but you still hesitate
cause you want inside of my head but dont know how
to brainwash me to be a commercial clown
fuck that i see the way you were
see the way you smirk
im catching you where you work
god only knows all the trouble that grows
deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
can i blast those who point the finger at me
who criticize and talk shit so freely
fuck xxl—youre a size too small
i should hire eminem so we can kill you all
whether you live to talk shit about the real
then kiss my ass in person how much you love the hill
im the outcast coming to blaze the grass
outlaw due to my life thats come to pass
dré pass me the glass of wine
so i can pour it over my homies grave and mine
for all those who fallen and answered when god was calling
jump into my ragtop and get all in
im the bomb planted in your car—why you frozen
pop the tape in ignite the explosion
the world is mine the world is yours the world is ours
the world is lost the world is tossed
chorus witchdoctor
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
and we some homemade bombs
finna blow right up in your face

verse 3 big boi
with a onetwo punch breal and andré drop they verses
your homeboy daddy fat sax playin cleanup so it worsens
people and persons on the opposite teams oh yes its curtains
no bullets burpin oh just lyrically twerking oh
making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
its kinda hard to execute when you aint feeling it that day
jumpin the gun and rushing your flow
babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
got the publics ears fucked up cant hear
atlanta georgia where yall at right here
outkast this dirty south to death the dungeon family camp
got this thang licked like stamps and ninevolt battery end caps
making that music that make your neck hurt
and the beats that bother your back in my cadillac
six woofers and four amps
lo pro vogues on swole with the carriage lamps
diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
come in peace but then explode like boobie traps
chorus witchdoctor
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
we just cant be amazed
and we some homemade bombs
finna blow right up in your face
