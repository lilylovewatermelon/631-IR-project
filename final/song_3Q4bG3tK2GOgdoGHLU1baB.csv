i’ve run from you for so long
kept all my pain in the dark
but here face down on this floor
i don’t wanna hide anymore

chorus
here’s my broken pieces
all my incompleteness
take this shattered heart
and make a work of art
won’t you show me jesus
what your love can do
like a stained glass window
i wanna feel your light shine through

verse 2
i know the list of my wrongs
still you hold me close in your arms
there’s no soul that can’t be restored
so i don’t want to hide anymore

chorus
here’s my broken pieces
all my incompleteness
take this shattered heart
and make a work of art
won’t you show me jesus
what your love can do
like a stained glass window
i wanna feel your light shine through
i wanna feel your light shine through
you might also likebridge
all to you lord i surrender
all to you i give

chorus
here’s my broken pieces
all my incompleteness
take this shattered heart
and make a work of art
oh won’t you show me jesus
what your love can do
like a stained glass window oh lord
like a stained glass window
i wanna feel your light shine through
i wanna feel it
oh i just need to feel your light shine throughembed"
