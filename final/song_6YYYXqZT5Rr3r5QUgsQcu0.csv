you aint no shrinkin violet are you
and you love to bat your eyelids dont you
you know all the times that im ashamed
and all those words you said misspoken
to all the boys who left you broken
aint no need for placing any blame

verse 2
cause if it wasnt for you cryin there
in ohio just last year
all the love i got wouldve been in vain
so ill wake up for work
and tug a little on your shirt
hope you know the depths id go would be insane

chorus
a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
who wants love but would be fine on her own
a girl like you with your daddys mannerisms
and a soft smile makes the distance less alone
in a world thats full of wanting what is next
ill stay here with you elisabeth

verse 3
you are here at just the right time
at twentythree years its felt a lifetime
my mama she must trust you through and through
cause she left me with a girl like you
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
who wants love but would be fine on her own
a girl like you with her daddys mannerisms
and a soft smile makes the distance less alone
in a world thats full of wanting what is next
ill stay here with you elisabeth

outro
you aint no shrinkin violet are you
and you love to bat your eyelids dont you
you know all the times that im ashamedembed"
