well you can have her
i dont want her
she didnt loved me anyway
she only wanted
someone to play with
but all i wanted was love to stay

verse 1
the girl i love
upped and left me
she ran away with my best friend
comes home at night
for just an hour
when daylight comes shes gone again

chorus

verse 2
when youre stuck
with the wrong woman
there aint that much that you can do
you just dig a hole
and crawl right in it
then you pull the ground right over you

verse 3
life without love
is mighty empty
but confession is good for your soul
id rather have love
for just an hour
than have the world and all of its gold
