verse 1 lil oozing
living on this earth is parallel to living in hell
i cant seem to break the spell
detach my soul and separate my cells
let my spirit dwell inside another realm
throw my lifeless body down the haunted wishing well
my carcass starts to swell the explanations that i fell
at the hour of my death make sure they swing from broken bells
wipe the blood off of my face but leave the stains on my lapel

horrifying images on replay in me mind
come take a walk with me and see the other side
counting down the days until me sacrifice
secret seances me feel the poltergeist
come and play down by the river got fiftynine killers in masks
scarecrow deliver the pull of a trigger while you fucking die and i laugh
hear the sounds demons surround swell from the ground
feel the flames we drown in pain lets die in vain mane
