ive been waiting until midnight
slowly dying since the sunrise

in the night in the night i survive
all the poison the pleasure the highs

verse 1
be so insane i tell my heart to sleep all day
cause i dont wanna deal with anything i need a break
dusk til dawn in the city where the wild things are
when the wolves are out no doubt theyre crying out my name

im in a mooooood
my leather boooooots
are coming out coming out

chorus
ive been waiting until midnight
slowly dying since the sunrise
cause i i was born i was born to the night
in the night in the night i survive
all the poison the pleasure the highs
i was born i was born to
