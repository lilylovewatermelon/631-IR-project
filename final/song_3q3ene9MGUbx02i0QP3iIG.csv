verse 1
i pour an eight inside the lam truck fell asleep flyin
i thought them niggas had my back but im steady seein signs
and i cant turn my back on boona like i aint see him tryin
these tears shed whenever he dead its different seein him die
bah get close up on em you know that shit be graphic
you gotta pop out with that ratchet you know this shit get tragic
and you cant fumble with that stick you know this shit aint madden
all that shit you did in the streets you know that shit gon vanish
yeah i pop these pills they try to read my thoughts
and you cant dig back in your past cause you got time you lost
and make that time up for your kids cause you know time aint bought
booka bought me a diamond cross but he know he wont cross me
they turned they back and said theyd kill me yeah thats when they lost me
i put baguettie inside the cartier cause im feelin bossy
they feel some type of way in the county jail i told em call me
i built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
yeah i seen my chance and thats when i grabbed it
fuck bein a hundred i spent a couple hundred on niggas tablets
lean gave me chest pain thats when i popped the perky tablet
i tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasnt established

verse 2
this shit was different we was together like ten years ago
and i dont talk to a lotta niggas but they still the bros

and some niggas try to hide they hate but that shit still show
i never fucked on block hoes because i call em sisters

cut the loose ends i cut em off they try to say im a butcher
bitch you a rat never mind i changed my life im muslim
i talked to chops on facetime he say damn you back smokin
he say that back door damn near closed i say its back open
i say these blocks could be back one he say you back hopin
you gotta watch them niggas you love cause they still backdoorin
he aint got no hope in beatin his trial because he lost his motion
