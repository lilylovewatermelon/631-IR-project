feel the sweet exciting nerves like when we were just friends
i wouldnt change a thing even if i was able
i just wanna feel you twice for the fable

if you could fall in love
twice with me
start brand new like we’re kissing in a tree
would you
and could you

i know i can fall in love
twice with you
i do it every day
so i swear its nothing new
its crazy
my baby

i wish i could feel your skin against mine
long distance sucks i forget what you smell like
if i could snap my fingers and be in chicago
know i would be there right away tomorrow

if you could fall in love
twice with me
start brand new like we’re kissing in a tree
would you
and could you
you might also likei know i can fall in love
twice with you
i do it every day
so i swear its nothing new
its crazy
my baby

its hard not to feel like a pile of rocks
i dont know what im doing and im stuck in your socks
lovin you twice is
my daydream
i can only hope that’s what you are craving
too

so what about you

if you could fall in love
twice with me
start brand new like we’re kissing in a tree
would you
and could you

i know i can fall in love
twice with you
i do it every day
so i swear its nothing new
it’s crazy
my babyembed"
