in our sleep
theres more to this nightmare
will she beg for your mercy
slowly but sure
im hoping what comes
in the absence of love
at night
shell kick and shell fight
should they fail in his sight
at night
ill worry from all
the end of us all

prechorus
please mom
theyre coming for me
please mom
run lock your door theyre coming for me

in the words of father to son

outro
in those days we lost our dignity
the eager dare to stand
the ride home through victory
on the innocent they tread
but irobot will never die
irobot will never die
but irobot will never die
but irobot will never dieembed"
