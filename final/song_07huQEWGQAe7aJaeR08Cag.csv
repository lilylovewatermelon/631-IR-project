carry me under
leave me abandoned
show me whats left
show me whats left
beautiful anger
breaking the pattern
show me whats left
show me whats left

chorus
take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
well make it through
well make it through

verse 2
empty and perfect
shattered and worthless
show me whats left
show me whats left
dragging me further
forget to remember
show me whats left
show me whats left

take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
well make it through
well make it through

never again
never again
time will not take the life from me
never again
never again
time will not take the life from me

verse 3
and after this world is out of reach
sober and silent fading and violent
hopeless i fight to fall between
never surrender out of the embers
so save a space inside for me

chorus
take the color from your eyes
i bleed for you
i bleed for you
bring the broken back to life
well make it through
well make it through
outro
never again
never again
time will not take the life from me
never again
never again
time will not take the life from me1embed"
