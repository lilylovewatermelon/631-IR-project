when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleans
and them boys from amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
when memphis arenâ€™t got the blues
thats when ill stop loving you
when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleans

verse 1
baby i dont mind you asking
if theres going to come a day
when ill say goodbye
maybe i guess anything could happen
but its as close to never
as youre ever going to find

chorus
when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleans
and them boys from amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
when theres no tequila in mexico
thats when im going to let you go
when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleans

verse 2
darling some things wont ever change
my love is one of those things

when new york is a one horse town
thats when i wont need you round
when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleans
when its sunny in seattle and its snowing down in new orleansembed"
