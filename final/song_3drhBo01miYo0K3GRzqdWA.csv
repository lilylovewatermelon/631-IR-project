back in the day everything seemed to be okay
but okay is just okay
and just alright makes you think
what could be on the other side
running with the big dogs left those puppies on the porch
scratching fleas is the least in the real world
if i knew then what i know now
just alright would be okay somehow

chorus 1
shhhhh
keep it down now
could you keep it down

verse 2
had it made had it played itself out
in a sitcom style
so the landlord has his key in my door
ill have amnesia for a while
ive seen ridiculous sunsets in a sickening sky
it made me feel really ill in a beautiful way
ive seen perfect people and i shield my eyes
i dont deserve to see their shame

chorus 2
shhhhh
keep it down now
just keep it down now
i cant hear myself think
who needs to think
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeinstrumental bridge
