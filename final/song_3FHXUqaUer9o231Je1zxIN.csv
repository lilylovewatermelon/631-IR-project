verse 1 ed sheeran
i been away on the road for a little while
today im headin home to make my baby smile
she hates it when i am over a thousand miles

shes always lookin back and sayin there was a time
when you would be around every single night
now im not sayin that i want another guy
but i need you here for the good times and the bad times
yeah the pullin out my hair gettin mad times
not just the when im in your bed on my back times
baby every time i call its a bad time
just want you here on your own
