in the summer took my gun
and made him go to neverland
he was something my old husband
he had all youd ever want
did you say something whatd you say
was that your voice or was that me
little voices buzzing poison
backward noise from everything
dr swango says im psycho
says they all from neverland
theyll never ever let me be
was that your voice or was that me

instrumental break

verse 2
dirty dustin said he saw him
playing ball with dizzy jim
dizzy jim had never spoken
whispered back you murdered him
my heart strings broke and it was me
i pull they stretch infinitely

chorus
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing

play with me my love in the summer sun
ill be waiting in your favourite cheshire grin
lay with me my dear in the evening clear
ill be dreaming in my paperpale skin

chorus
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing
in the summer silence i was getting violent
in the summer silence i was doing nothing

outro
in the summer silence in the summer silence
in the summer silence i was doing nothing21embed"
