your eyes so crisp so green
sour apple baby but you taste so sweet
you got hips like jagger and two left feet
and i wonder if youd like to meet
your voice is velvet through a telephone
you can come to mine but both my roommates are home
think i know a bar where they would leave us alone
and i wonder if youd take it slow

prechorus
oh were dancin in my living room and up come my fists
and i say im only playing but the truth is this
that ive never seen a mouth that i would kill to kiss
and im terrified but i cant resist
and i said

chorus
beautiful stranger here you are in my arms and i know
that beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
and i hope beautiful stranger here you are in my arms
but i think its finally finally finally finally finally safe
for me to fall

postchorus
ohohoh
ohohoh

i grab your hand and then we run to the car
singing in the street and playing air guitar
stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
and i wonder if it goes too far to say
ive never recognized a purer face
you stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
used to think that loving meant a painful chase
but youre right here now and i think youll stay

prechorus
oh were dancin in my living room and up come my fists
and i say im only playing but the truth is this
ive never seen a mouth that i would kill to kiss
and im terrified but the truth is this
i said

chorus
beautiful stranger here you are in my arms and i know
that beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
and i hope beautiful stranger here you are in my arms
and i think its finally finally finally finally finally safe
for me to fall

postchorus
ohohoh
ohohoh
yeah i think its finally finally finally finally38embed"
