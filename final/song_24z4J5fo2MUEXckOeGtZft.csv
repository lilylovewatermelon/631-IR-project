747 come 11 to bust
somebody take me home i wanna live in lust
when trust is low and stakes are high
thats all i ever did in denver was die
thats all i ever did in new york was die
thats all i ever did in la was die
so put em up put em up to the sky
and wave bye bye to miss american pie
cause you been tellin lies you took it all and abused it
whatever happened to the feel good music
somewhere somehow some way somebody pulled the plug
and left me sittin in a dirty little pub

chorus
i gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me
and i know that makes you mad
cause thats something you cant see
i got everything i ever wanted
and ill never give that back
oh i know you hate that factor
but you aint gotta look at me like that
i said you aint gotta look at me like that
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeverse 2
you run around pullin stunts like that
see never in my life could i front like that
i aint cut like that i couldnt run like that
im a keep it non fiction and take my hat off off
remember back when things looked grim
i spent a lot of time and money on whims
i remember the crew remember the good times
remember the orange and i remember the sunshine
its all gone thats a thing of the past
the fact remains that it moves real fast
so why you sit around hopin things wont change
ill be sittin pretty singin hey pockey way

chorus
i gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me
and i know that makes you mad
cause thats something you cant see
i got everything i ever wanted
and ill never give that back
oh i know you hate that factor
but you aint gotta look at me like that
i said you aint gotta look at me like that
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at
bridge
youll hear me comin hummin songs of redemption huh
ive been oppressed for less than attention
i got your extension but ill probably never call
cause this time last year you aint seen me in your crystal ball
and im appalled by the things youve done
left a trail of wrongs and cant account for one
now youre done and im glad but its a shame youd waste it
you want this so bad you can taste it
detroit love can you feel that feel that
thats stick an move can you feel that feel that
im on the rack number two triple zero
full failure all american hero


chorus
i gotta tell you baby lifes been good to me
and i know that makes you mad
cause thats something you cant see
i got everything i ever wanted
and ill never give that back
oh i know you hate that factor
but you aint gotta look at me like that
i said you aint gotta look at me like that
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at whatchu lookin at
whatchu lookin at
im here to tell you baby lifes been good to me
i know that makes you mad
cause thats something you cant see
i got everything i ever wanted
and ill never give that back
i know you hate that fact
but you aint gotta look at me like that
i said you aint gotta look at me like that
