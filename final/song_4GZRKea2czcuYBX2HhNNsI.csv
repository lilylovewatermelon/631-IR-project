the question is wouldnt mama be proud
theres a silver lining in the corporate cloud
and the pretty post that youre taking as a as an nco
of the great pretender i should sure think so

refrain
wouldnt mama be proud

verse 2
can i take your order asked the heavenly host
ticket to the jet stream blowing coast to coast
the longstem glasses a movie and a pleasant dream in midair
you gotta tell me quickly cause were almost there

wouldnt mama be proud

pointed out of the window
at the sky gone black
kid youre on the right track

photographs of moving parts about to implode
if i crawl to keep it together
like you say you know i can do
to transmit the moment from me to you
