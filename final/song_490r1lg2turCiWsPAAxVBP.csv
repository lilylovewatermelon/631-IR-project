ohohoh yeah

chorus skylar grey
do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies
and i knew better than to look in your eyes in your eyes
they only pretend you would be mine
and oh how you made me believe oh
you had me caught in every web that you weaved
but do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies

verse 1 nicki minaj
you could never make eye contact
everything you got was based off of my contacts
you a fraud but ima remain iconstat
balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
you was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
you was with me way before i hit a quarter mil in it
put you in the crib and you aint never pay a bill in it
i was killin it now you got me poppin pills in it
i told baby hit you i said this nigga buggin
cause i was doin it for us i told em fuck the public
couldnt believe that i was home alone contemplatin overdosin
no more coastin no more toastin over oceans

they say you dont know what you got til its gone
they say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
but there was something that i shoulda asked all along
ima ask on the song

chorus skylar grey
do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies
and i knew better than to look in your eyes in your eyes
they only pretend you would be mine
and oh how you made me believe oh
you had me caught in every web that you weaved
but do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies

verse 2 nicki minaj
i just figured if you saw me if you looked in my eyes
youd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
i just figured i was something that you couldnt replace
but there was just a blank stare and i couldnt relate
i just couldnt understand and i couldnt defend
what we had what we shared and i couldnt pretend
when the tears rolled down its like you aint even notice em
if you had a heart i was hopin that you would show it some
what the fuck you really tellin me what you tellin me
i could tell you lyin get the fuck out dont yell at me
i aint mean to cut you i aint wanna catch a felony
this aint how to be a player you aint bill bellamy
prechorus nicki minaj
they say you dont know what you got til its gone
they say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
but there was something that i shoulda asked all along

bridge skylar grey
so does she know ive been in that bed before bed before
a thousand count and not a single thread of truth
if i was just another girl just another girl
then im ashamed to say that im not over you
theres one thing i need to know
so call me when youre not so busy
just thinkin of yourself thinkin of yourself

chorus skylar grey
do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies bed
and i knew better than to look in your eyes in your eyes
they only pretend you would be mine
and oh how you made me believe oh
you had me caught in every web that you weaved
but do you ever think of me when you lie when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies414embed"
