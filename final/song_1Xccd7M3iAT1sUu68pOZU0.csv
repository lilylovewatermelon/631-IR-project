cut the skin to the bone fall asleep all alone
hear your voice in the dark
lose myself in your eyes choke my voice say good night
as the world falls apart

chorus mark hoppus
fuck i cant let this kill me let go
i need some more time to fix this

verse 2 mark hoppus
heres a letter for you but the words get confused
and the conversation dies
apologize for the past talk some shit take it back
are we cursed to this life

chorus mark hoppus
fuck i cant let this kill me let go
i need some more time to fix this problem
i need some more time to fix this problem
i need some more time to fix this

bridge mark hoppus
im talking to the ceiling my life just lost all meaning
do one thing for me tonight im dying in this silence
the last star left in heaven is falling down to earth and
do you still feel the same way do you still feel the same way

fuck i cant let this kill me let go
