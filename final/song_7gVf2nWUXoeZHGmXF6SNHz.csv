verse 1
yeah you pulled up on me like you know me i was by my doley doley
asked me for a picture checked my rollie and said okey dokey
that fan love i decide to give my fan a hug
she said she gon post it when i really get my bands up
name miranda with the body of a dancer
she was smokin hot but not the type to give you cancer
besides that her shit fat with a six pack
yeah she threw it at me ‘fore we even got to chitchat
like ooh girl you might as well forget that
said she got a man im thinkin he could have his bitch back
future lookin bright and i ain’t even bout to risk that
shorty you a dime so fine learn to take your time
goin in so fast its potential goin in the trash
i aint even act that shit make me wanna do the dash
i need a bitch to hold the grip when shit get lit
the type that i aint got to worry when she kiss me on my lips

verse 2
yeah i mean its crazy cause i never tried to play you
you aint never fall through i was only tryna save you
and this 1942 got me stuck up in my ways
had dreams and nightmares like we back up in the days
figured you would hold it down i was bound to beat the case case
bitch you tryna sneak diss i should punch you in your face
made me call another bitch and tell her put you in your place
member everything was fine member everything was great
and i peeped it in your eyes you resemblin a snake
how you link another nigga cause he said he got an eighth
you aint wanna keep it real you aint figure it was safe
i just rap about my pain cause i know others can relate
but fuck it nah bitch you stayin on this subject
you fuckin with a brokey his pockets is on a budget
i got my money up and im poppin these bitches love it
i got my money up and im poppin these bitches love it
chorus
