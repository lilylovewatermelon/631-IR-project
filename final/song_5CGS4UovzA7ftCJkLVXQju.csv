i miss the old kanye straight from the go kanye
chop up the soul kanye set on his goals kanye
i hate the new kanye the bad mood kanye
the always rude kanye spaz in the news kanye
i miss the sweet kanye chop up the beats kanye
i gotta say at that time id like to meet kanye
see i invented kanye it wasnt any kanyes
and now i look and look around and theres so many kanyes
i used to love kanye i used to love kanye
i even had the pink polo i thought i was kanye
what if kanye made a song about kanye
