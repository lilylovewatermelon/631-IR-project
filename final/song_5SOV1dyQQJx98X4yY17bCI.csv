shes got bruises on her feet
i sat down like i always did
and tried to calm her down

i sent her my warmth and my silence
and all she sends me back is rain    rain

the universe shes wounded
but shes still got infinity ahead of her
shes still got you and me
and everybody says that shes beautiful

the universe shes dancing now
they got her lit up lit up on the moon
they got stars doing cartwheels all the nebulas on the tune
and the universe shes whispering so softly i can hear all
the croaking insects all the taxicabs all the bums spent change
all the boys playing ball in the alleyways
theyre just folds in her dress

the universe shes wounded
but shes still got infinity ahead of her
shes still got you and me
and everybody says that shes beautiful
and everybody says  see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
