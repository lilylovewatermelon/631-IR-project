pray silence im begging
too tired to tell you i aint coming home
stop for a second
guess i got caught up in leading you on
and i aint responsible for the lump in your throat

prechorus
havent you had enough of all of this
havent you had enough of loneliness

chorus
dont get me wrong id love to stay too long
dont get me wrong id love to tell you whatever you want
but havent you had enough of loneliness
and havent we had enough of second best
so dont get me wrong

verse 2
innocent then
way back before we knew how to pretend
picking up where we left
it aint meant to be easy shouldnt be hard as this
and i aint responsible for letting this go

prechorus
havent you had enough of all of this
havent you had enough of loneliness

i just dont wanna be the devil you know
it hurts the most when you come too close
