young harleezy yall grew up shooting rpgs
i was in seventh grade selling hard cds thats true
i was on stage talent show heart beating
now i make it sound like i write the bars easy
but im ten years in it took me eight to start eating uhhuh
six to start drinking nine to give it up
now the bottles in my section mark fiji
and its hard to find some girls that arent freaky mmmhmm
the pressure keeps building but luckily im built for it tough
tryna turn these money trees to a lil forest
it used to feel forced now i got the feel for it
i know you wanna see me but im still touring ah
used to be on norris back when twiggy was in chorus
rocking 990s not jordans
