i once loved a tailor who took eager care of me
sewed together my loose ends with stitches neat and clean
but now my love is gone
and i am left unraveling
unraveling

verse 2
i once loved a gardener with his dirtsmudged face and hands
trimmed my weeds and gave me room to grow my flowers again
but now my love is gone
and i am left here withering
withering

verse 3
i once loved a carpenter who carved a smile for me
sanded my rough edges crafted new and lovely things
but now my love is gone
and i can’t help the fracturing

bridge
i never knew that i needed you

verse 4
i once loved a man who kissed me once before he left
tied me up in knots and said he’d soon return again
but now my love is gone
and i am left unraveling
unraveling
unraveling
