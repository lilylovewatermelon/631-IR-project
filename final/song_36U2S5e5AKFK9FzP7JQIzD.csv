hey we break out the fiddle stay up all night
aint got no disco ball we kick it round the firelight yeah
oooo we jump in the river get your skinny dip on
feel like were walking on water
rockin your body til the cows come home
give the jar a little twist let you take a little sip
cant wait to taste it on your lips
end the night with a kiss we do it like this
