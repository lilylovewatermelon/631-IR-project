parumpumpumpum
a new born king to see
parumpumpumpum
our finest gifts we bring
parumpumpumpum

peace on earth can it be
years from now perhaps well see
see the day of glory
see the day when men of good will
live in peace live in peace again

peace on earth can it be

every child must be made aware
every child must be made to care
care enough for his fellow man
to give all the love that he can

i pray my wish will come true
for my child and your child too
hell see the day of glory
see the day when men of good will
live in peace live in peace again
