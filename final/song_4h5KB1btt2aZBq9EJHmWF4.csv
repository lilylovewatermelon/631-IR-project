she dances in the sheets at night
she dances to his needs
she dances til he feels just right
until he falls asleep
she dances at the crack of dawn
and quickly cooks his food
she cant be late cant take too long
the kids must get to school

chorus
cause shes a slave to the rhythm
cause shes a slave to the rhythm of
cause shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
a rhythm of love a rhythm of love
cause shes a slave to the rhythm
cause shes a slave to the rhythm of
cause shes a slave to the rhythm
a slave to the rhythm of
a rhythm of love a rhythm of love

verse 2
she dances for the man at work
who works her overtime
she cant be rude as she says
sir i must be home tonight
she dances to the kitchen stove
dinner is served by nine
he says his foods an hour late
she must be out her mind

she works so hard just to make a way
for a man to just dont appreciate
and though he takes her love in vain
still she could not stop couldnt break his chains

verse 3
she danced the night that they fell out
she swore shed dance no more
but dance she did he did not quit
as she ran out the door
she danced through the night in fear of her life
she danced to a beat of her own
she let out a cry and swallowed the pride
she knew she was needed back home home
chorus
