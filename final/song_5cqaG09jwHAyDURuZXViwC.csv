once when i saw her there
white light she stood so still
warming her eyes to the sea
hardly her way to be free

chorus
auburn and ivory
heartbreak and pony tails

verse 2
holding her bones by the fire
writing the letter she saves
white page turns gold to her lies
wanting her one sacrifice

chorus
auburn and ivory
heartbreak and pony tails

she said
ill wait for you

white page turns gold to her lies
her one sacrifice
