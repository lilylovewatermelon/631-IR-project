wildflowers
wild horses

verse 1
in the middle of the night
i hear a corn field coyote cry
up at the moon no matter what
sky im laying under
in the eye of a hurricane
when i got one foot in the grave
ill dig my boots into the dirt
and face the rolling thunder

chorus
im five generations
of blazing a trail
through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
im barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
whoaoohoh oohoh
im four fifths of reckless
and one fifth of jack
i push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
yeah my kinda crazys still running its courses
with wildflowers and wild horses
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 2
its in thе water in my veins
that bread of hеaven falls like rain
so im taken care of either way
make something out of how im made
until i hitch a ride on glorys train

chorus
im five generations
of blazing a trail
through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
im barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
whoaoohoh oohoh
im four fifths of reckless
and one fifth of jack
i push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
yeah my kinda crazys still running its courses
with wildflowers and wild horses
im five generations
of blazing a trail
through barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells
im barefoot and bareback and born tough as nails
whoaoohoh oohoh
im four fifths of reckless
and one fifth of jack
i push like a daisy through old sidewalk cracks
yeah my kinda crazys still running its courses
with wildflowers and wild horses
outro
yeah my kinda crazys still running its courses
with wildflowers and wild horses
