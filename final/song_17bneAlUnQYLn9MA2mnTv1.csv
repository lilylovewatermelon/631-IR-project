there’s too much work and i’m spent
there’s too much pressure and im bent
ive got no time to move ahead
have you heard one thing that i’ve said

chorus
and all these little things in life
they all create this haze
there’s too many things to get done
and i’m running out of days

verse 2
and i can’t last here for long
i feel this current it’s so strong
it gets me further down the line
it gets me closer to the light

chorus
and all these little things in life
they all create this haze
there’s too many things to get done
and i’m running out of days
and all these little things in life
they all create this haze
there’s too many things to get done
and i’m running out of days
will all these little things in life
they all create this haze
and now i’m running out of time
i can’t see through this haze
my friend tell me why it has to be this way
there’s too many things to get done
and i’m running out of daysyou might also likeembed"
