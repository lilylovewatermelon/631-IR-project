verse
im looking back now thinking maybe i was wrong
i been so out of place and desperate for so long
i wrote about it think i made a billion songs
but nothing would ever heal the wound
no nothing would ever seal the wound
no nothing

chorus
now i gotta go
im coming home coming home
its been too long
if they wanna know tell em i went home
coming home

outro
we got greens and cherry pie everyone aint always nice
well thats because they love you right
and bitches bark but they dont bite at all
coming home

part ii

refrain
go left foot then right cmon just take your time
keep on keep on moving moving

keep on keep on moving moving

i know stop holding me back quit pushing me forward
keep on keep on moving moving
i move at my own pace just leave me alone
cause im too this and im too that
im too skinny im too fat
im all good cause where im at i keep it moving
im the sweetest peach to fall but some dont like peaches at all
im too short and im too tall keep it moving

refrain
go left foot then right cmon just take your time
gotta get it right i cant pause and rewind
keep on keep on8embed"
