theres a humming in the restless summer air
and were slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos there is calculation
dropdropdropdrop dropping glasses just to hear them break
youve been drinking like the world was gonna end it didnt
took a shiner from the fist of your best friend go figure
its clear that someones gotta go
we mean it but i promise were not mean

prechorus
and the cry goes out oh
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out oh
now were in the ring and were coming for blood

chorus
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious
you might also likeverse 2
delicate in every way but one the swordplay
god knows we like archaic kinds of fun the old ways
chance is the only game i play with baby
we let our battles choose us

prechorus
and the cry goes out oh
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out oh
now were in the ring and were coming for blood

chorus
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious

bridge
noone round heres good at keeping their eyes closed
the suns starting to light up when were walking home
tired little laughs goldlie promises
well always win at this i dont ever think about death
its all right if you do its fine
we gladiate but i guess were really fighting ourselves
roughin up our minds so were ready when the killtime comes
wide awake in bed words in my brain
secretly you love this do you even wanna go free
let me in the ring ill show you what that big word means
chorus
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but were the gladiators
oh oh everyone a rager
oh oh but secretly theyre saviours
glory and gore go hand in hand
thats why were making headlines
oh oh you could try and take us
oh oh but victorys contagious
