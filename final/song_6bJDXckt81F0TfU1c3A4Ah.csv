my dreams is big reality set in huh
let off a clip from a automatic weapon yeah
through shots in the door it died in vegas
though it fought so hard i knew it wouldnt make it
im a tortured soul i live in disguise
rest in peace to the leader of the jackson 5 ooh woo
i died in my sleep im still big pimpin
i ball at the mall beginning of the ending yeah
where the fuck is the sun its been a while
mama look at your son what happened to my smile
my tears is tatted my rag in my pocket
im just looking for love i know somebody got it
champagne for the pain weed for the low
goddamn im so high where the fuck did i go
im losing myself im stuck in the moment
i look in the mirror my only opponent
where the fuck is the press where the fuck is the pres
either they know or dont care im fucking depressed
no crying in public just lying to judges
riskin my life im already dying so fuck it well
