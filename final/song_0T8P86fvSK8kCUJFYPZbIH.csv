i hate this town its so washed up
and all my friends dont give a fuck
dont tell me that its just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in two three four

verse 1
remember when i tried
i never strayed too far from you
forever by your side
no matter what i was going through

prechorus
but now i never know the things to say to you
that help me prove that im still on your side
i never show just what you do to me
guess i was always wrong

chorus
i hate this town its so washed up
and all my friends dont give a fuck
dont tell me that its just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in

verse 2
i hate this town
cause no one can understand
i just cant be tied down
nothing comes between me and my plans
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likeprechorus
so now i never know the things to say to you
that help me prove that im still on your side
i never show just what you do to me
guess i was always wrong

postchorus
and dont believe a word theyre telling to you
dont believe a word theyre telling to you
they let me down
when will i find where i fit in i hate this town

bridge
my world cannot ever bring me down
gave everything i had to turn it back around
cause our times worth something
bigger than both you and me
i cant live my life always backing down
i gotta do this right then they cant make a sound
cause im not here for nothing
least i can say i stand for something
breakdown
you and me we stand for something

chorus
i hate this town its so washed up
and all my friends dont give a fuck
dont tell me that its just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in

postchorus
and dont believe a word theyre telling to you
dont believe a word theyre telling to you
they let me down
when will i find where i fit in i hate this town
