up and over satellites
to draw out the timid wild one
to convince you its alright
and i listen for the whisper
of your sweet insanity
while i formulate denials
of your effect on me
youre a stranger
so what do i care
you vanished today
not the first time i hear
or the last
what am i to do with all this silence
shy away shy away phantom
run away terrified child
wont you move away you fucking tornado
im better off without you
tearing my world downyou might also like4embed"
