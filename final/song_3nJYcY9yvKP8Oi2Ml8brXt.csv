can i be real a second
for just a millisecond
let down my guard and tell the people how i feel a second
now im the model of a modern major general
the venerated virginian veteran whose men are all
lining up to put me up on a pedestal
writin letters to relatives
embellishin my elegance and eloquence
but the elephant is in the room
the truth is in ya face when ya hear the british cannons go…

washington
any hope of success is fleeting
how can i keep leading when the people im
