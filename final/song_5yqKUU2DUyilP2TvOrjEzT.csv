theres a monster under my bed
and at my window theres a dragon
i accepted the challenge
it turned me into a savage
i broke a promise to myself again
i dont know why i am so vulnerable
they try to help but i wont let them in
i guess rock bottoms where im comfortable
both my feet planted when most people wouldve panicked
i embraced the storm i found beauty in what was damaged
im not afraid of the boogieman
instead i look at him like hes a friend
theres not a monster out there in the world
thats scarier than the one thats within

chorus jelly roll
theres a creature in my closet
i can hear him rumblin round
the demons screamin in the distance
creates such a humblin sound
the monster thats outside my window
hes like family to me now
the things that people are afraid of
never let me down

not a sadist no
but im hated so
while religious freaks say im the biggest beast
and that ive made it grow
when i spray this flow
i created more
creatures unlike when i heated the mic
im a breed of the night but im tainted though
by the darkness im binded
i sparked it and shined it
they find it cause mine is whoa
for that they labeled me a demon seed
want to disable n9na see him bleed
hinder me fatally and see them greed nooh
chea
you would not believe the creature inside me
if you deceive khalifahs are lively
we disagree when people defy me
or tryna take his
whatever the fuckery taught him you dont wanna break this
you forsake his
what is sacred
then its over no matter what your faith is
im a creature
chorus jelly roll
theres a creature in my closet
i can hear him rumblin round
the demons screamin in the distance
creates such a humblin sound
the monster thats outside my window
hes like family to me now
the things that people are afraid of
never let me down

verse 3 krizz kaliko
yeah i managed to get myself in trouble all of this pain
yeah im down and the doubledosin liquors always to blame
if i could keep myself sober id keep my hands to myself
i take a shot and its over thats how i end up in hell i do
i hope i dont pass it down to my offspring yeah
they get everything from their daddy feel like im addicted to all things yeah
yeah theres no reason to change gone too far now
and im stuck in my ways back at the bar now
they said im a flirt and they right yeah i aint perfect aight yeah
so when im thirsty and perkin and purposely searchin for somethin its hurtin me so
i just get back up and go i just back out of a show
thats how it go i knock the back out a ho
and next night act i dont know okay
i think they be laughin at me hands be grabbin at me
feel like god let it happen to me
thatd be blasphemy
and at least it be happenin naturally okay yeah
i think i better let it go yeah
either that or i gotta let her know
and i cant do that
chorus jelly roll
theres a creature in my closet
i can hear him rumblin round
the demons screamin in the distance
creates such a humblin sound
the monster thats outside my window
hes like family to me now
the things that people are afraid of
never let me down2embed"
