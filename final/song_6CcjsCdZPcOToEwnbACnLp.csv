i met a little girl in saskatoon
she was beaming bold and beautiful and higher than the moon
before i could profess she left too soon
the words she spoke were enough to make me blue

chorus
she said i know just what youre wishing
two folks in our condition
well never leave this barroom with our pride
so go about your earthly mission
dont trust no politicians
you look to yours and i will look to mine

verse
i met a nashville honkytonkin queen
and the caress of her amber lips was reserved for jim beam
took her by the arm she made a scene
whiskey was yet to dull her tongue it seemed

chorus
she said i know just what youre wishing
two folks in our condition
well never leave this barroom with our pride
so go about your earthly mission
dont trust no politicians
you look to yours and i will look to mine

out west by god virginias where im bound
shes as wild shes as wonderful as any girl ive found
so keep me just as long as im around
i never have to hear that awful sound

chorus
well i know just what youre wishing
two folks in our condition
well never leave this barroom with our pride
so go about your earthly mission
dont trust no politicians
you look to yours and i will look to mine
you look to yours and i will look to mineembed"
