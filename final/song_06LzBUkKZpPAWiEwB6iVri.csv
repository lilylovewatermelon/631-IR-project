can you hear me hear me screamin
breakin in the muted sky
this thunder heart like bombs beatin
echoin a thousand miles

chorus
mine is yours and yours is mine there is no divide
in your honor i would die tonight
mine is yours and yours is mine i will sacrifice
in your honor i would die tonight
for you to feel alive

verse 2
can you feel me feel me breathin
one last breath before i close my eyes
this sufferin for receivin
deliver me into the other side

chorus
mine is yours and yours is mine there is no divide
in your honor i would die tonight
mine is yours and yours is mine i will sacrifice
in your honor i would die tonight
for you to feel alive
