theres a gap in between
theres a gap where we meet
where i end and you begin
and im sorry for us
the dinosaurs roam the earth
the sky turns green
where i end and you begin

verse 2
i am up in the clouds
i am up in the clouds
and i cant and i cant come down
i can watch but not take part
where i end and where you start
where you you left me alone
you left me alone

x will mark the place
like the parting of the waves
like a house falling in the sea
in the sea
