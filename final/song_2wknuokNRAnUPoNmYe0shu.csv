cigarettes and sex are on your breath again
its cool im the same the way we kiss
girl you’re special i wanna protect you and i’ll kill so you could live
but when the first body went down you wouldnt tell me that i know it again
id rather lay it down and get back cuz killin is a sin
were chillin instead give me a kiss
girl

chorus syd
if not for me
for the world

verse 2 syd  james fauntelroy
false arrest unrest was on the docket
it’s cool at least that’s what cnn says
girl you’re special i wanna protect you and i’ll kill so you could live
but when the last body goes down it won’t make any sense
i’d rather lay you back down on your back than killin and shit
chillin and shit give me a kiss
girl
