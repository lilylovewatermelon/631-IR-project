i can grab the fireworks and soda all the cookies we can eat
make you nauseous but be cautious this is not dawsons creek
we could sneak away fuck it you can bring an eighth
im not gon smoke but im just asking baby could you meet me by the lake
said bring a towel well baby meet me by the lake
bathin suit its going down shit just meet me by the lake
we could count the shooting stars well could you meet me by the lake
summer never has to end with me

verse 1 hodgy
im give it to her she want that summer time
im give it like no other cause she know im hers
damn right shes mine we both know it
so when we separate everything fine her phone ringin in her purse
damn right its me im her nigga nigga
come for mines in summer time ima bust that trigger nigga hahaha
catch us venice beachin she wanna go shopping
sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
sangria on my freedmind cause she likes to get it popping
no ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
drop topping i measure her pleasure
then drop in when she get out of place i quantinize
she is my concubine i am her porcupine
i poke her face her throat for taste give me head like im on her mind
i know her analyzation so when she try to fake
summer time in the boat of love meet me by the lake

verse 2 tyler the creator
i packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
and brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
we should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
then do something thats beyond what we both can imagine
