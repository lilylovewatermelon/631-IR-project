verse 1
im sippin pink lucozade
were blazin on that new found haze
im seeing in the blacks and greys
im hoping that the basket sways
left to right sit and talk shit all night
does that make it right for smoke
maybe or am i just seeing shit
seeing the pain inside this house of fear

verse 2
you dont even wanna know about the things i hear
quick fix headlights shine bright
youre the fuckin deer
im just wishing its ambition that got you your position
youll be fishing for far too long
youre the bad guy in this movie and i aint wrong
i dont breathe the pollution
and the only solution is making shit confusin

verse 3
aint about whos winnin or losin
about the path that youre choosin
time heals pain and promotes selfsoothin
when the scars are gone you cant see bruising
wanna take these watches chains and gold rings
im gettin caught up in the feelings that they bring
a lack of sanity losing touch with reality
smoking too much its starting to fog up my clarity
travelin in the day but youre still lookin far to me

bulls eye you the dot to me
emotions splattered same pattern
cant even begin to spot em
im sad about shit that never happened
no lies in my eyes nothing but truth will leave my mouth
im tryna fuckin scream but the words wont come out
ooh im tryna fuckin scream but the words wont come out

verse 5
shes older i told her we aint meant to be
it takes two not three but im here anyway
i hope hes leaving soon
started not to see the elephant in this room
disguised as your perfume but the smell of it consumes
it takes all my mind
you can search the world but you will never find
i see everything youve done to me be there you run to me
i dont need to pace i dont need the stamina
if this shit was it girl i probably woulda ran from ya
kept runnin outwit cause you cunnin
that outfit cause you stunnin begging cause im losing mage
got me feeling some type of way i cant explain
the fuck is goin on i think i got it wrong
when i told you i was over you or were you under me20embed"
