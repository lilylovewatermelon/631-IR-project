i wish i was that girl from that gucci store
she never wore any makeup and she owns couture
i got pimples where my beauty marks should be
i got dry skin on my elbows and knees
i never liked her wanted to be like her
hate how you look at her cause you never saw me
like i was an art piece like i was an ordinary girl

chorus
i wish i was special
i gave all my special
away to a loser
now im just a loser
i used to be special
but you made me hate me
regret that i changed me
i hate that you made me
just like you
just like you

verse 2
i wanted to be thick now i wanna be thin
heard pilates is in bash your windows out
you gon hear my mouth you could kick me out
you say im too wild you gon hate me now
boy you got me fucked up now im gettin fucked up

i wish i was special
i gave all my special
away to a loser
now im just a loser
i used to be special
but you made me hate me
regret that i changed me
i hate that you made me

just like you
