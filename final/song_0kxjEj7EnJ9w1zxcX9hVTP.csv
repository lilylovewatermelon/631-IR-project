sometimes in the summer itll lightnin itll thunder
but the rain dont seem to come it rolls on by
thunder sounds like laughter as the lightning hits the pasture and you know that has lands been dry for some time
and it burns and it burns oh it burns

verse 2
the river it stopped flowin back through town some time ago and the train tracks rest below a bed of weeds
the truck stop shut its door on the day that oil hit a hundred and four dollars a barrel
yall then the grocery store came next and then the bank

bridge
and it burns oh it burns it burns
oh it burns yeah it burns oh it burns

chorus
you do the things you know to just to make it by the day
you can hear the kids a cryin but theres just no time to play you work the way you know how just the way youve always done and youd like to curse the skies that bring no rain and block the sun

bridge
and it burns

instrumental

verse 3
sometimes when its rainin and there seems there aint no stoppin and a storm surge rushes past and all goes down
that river roars with laughter as it strips away the pasture land the home you built and work for your own hands

and it rains oh it rains yeah it rains
and it rains oh it rains yeah it rains

chorus
you do the things you know to just to make it by the day
you can hear the kids a cryin but theres just no time to play you work the way you know how just the way youve always done and youd like to curse the skies that bring the rain and block the sun and it rains


sometimes in the summer itll lightnin itll thunder
but the rain dont seem to come it rolls on byembed"
