verse 1
i see you in the lonely place
how can you be so blind
you still regretting the love you left left behind
oh darling i seen you go through the changes
sitting alone each night
are you expecting to find the love love thats right

hook
darling open your eyes
let me show you light
girl you never find a love thats right
darling open your eyes
let me show you the light
girl you think youre so wise youre so wise

verse 2
there are times when you need someone

oh darling there is a light that shines
