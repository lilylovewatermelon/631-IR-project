i have this little thing
its probably just a fling
two girls i like a lot
i think theyre really hot
but im not sure if they know
how my love began to grow
it took a lot of time
but right now its solely mine

verse 2
today i drew a mural of
the things id like to love
and where my heart resides
is with two girls with great eyes
if they just gave me a chance
id show them what they want and teach em what theyve got
id tickle each and every one of their fancies
and id take the key to my heart and open it and let the love shine through

chorus

that i love you a lot and i wanna be your man
and i think that itd be totally cool
if i hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school

verse 3
i saw you on tv
you dressed up like a bee
reminds me of the time
how its gone and its gone and its gone
its sadness every day that passes
without you and i really wanna really wanna
really wanna hold you both tight
and tell you youre mine but instead i sing

chorus
marykate and ashley i hope you understand
that i love you a lot and i wanna be your man
and i think that itd be totally cool
if i hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school
