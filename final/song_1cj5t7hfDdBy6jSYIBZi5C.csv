its been days now
and youve changed your mind again
it feels like years
and i can tell how time can bend your ideas

and theres gold
falling from the ceiling of this world
falling from the heartbeat of this girl
falling from the things we should have learned
falling from the things we could have heard

verse 2
well its been days now
and youve changed your mind again
all the cracks in the walls
reminds you of things we said

and i could tell you
that i wont hurt you this time
but its just safer
to keep you in this heart of mine
