down empty streets sniffing glue me and you
blank open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
its been a long hard twentyyear summer vacation
all these twenty years trying to fill the void
chorus
crack baby you dont know what you want
but you know that you had it once
and you know that you want it back
crack baby you dont know what you want
but you know that youre needing it
and you know that you need it bad

postchorus
with wild horses running through your hollow bones
wild horses running through your hollow bones
oohoh

verse 2
went to your room thinking maybe youll feel something
but all i saw was your burning body waiting
all these twentyyears on a vacation

chorus
crack baby you dont know what you want ooh
but you know that you had it once ooh
and you know that you want it back
crack baby you dont know what you want ooh
but you know that youre needing it ooh
and you know that you need it bad
