verse 1
they call me lupe ill be your new date
they wanna smell like me they want my bouquet
but they cant they accented like the uk
turn that eau de lupe to pepe le pew spray
flagrantly fragrant and they cant escape it
my perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
you dont want a loan leave my cologne alone
its a little too strong for you to be putting on
trust me i say this justly
i went from musty to musky and yall cant mush me
i warn yall cornballs i hush puppies
the swans in the pond call my duck ugly
but now they hug me because its lovely
they love the aroma of a roamer of the world
got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl

we used to gangbang a lot of that done died down
children of the hat tiltin keepin hope alive now
all with no high i do it so fly
banksys attack helicopter with the bow tie
i love my city really hope that god bless it
have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
welcome all of yall to my dark recesses
this is where i keep the bars like bathtub edges
my ivories and my doves my levers and my zests
this takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
the belly of the beast you know im from it
i wrap it in a towel hit gomer pyle in the stomach
and i be on my green like irish spring and i coast
fudge with it get a mouth full of soap

verse 3
and so to sign off this beat i rhyme off
is from thelonious p and hugo mind boss
you feel it in the air its such a fine force
but you dont hear me though just like a mimes talk
thats cause im in europe me in my french tour
im on my pimp my temperature is tempura
i take it easy on my watch im watching tv
in my cleanest maharashi see the hare is tryna beat me
i continue to do lus pace
they say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
but see my secrets safe its in my secret safe
thats in my secret room on my secret base
so from the runner of the fnf crew
come in hip hop weve come to resurrect you
