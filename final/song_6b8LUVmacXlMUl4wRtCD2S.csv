you are mine again
every mistake that you made
all the people that you saved took a little piece of you with them
and you are mine again
and im so damn glad youre here
talkin strong sober and clear like you couldnt back then

verse 2
how many sad songs it take to get your stubborn ass awake
what finally got you risin from your bed
was it the sunset on her cheeks leadin down to a delicate collar bone
or the judgement of your mind when youre alone

chorus
mine again fondest friend where the hell you been
ive been strugglin to get back to you
and if you fight all night im sure youll gain the guts to try
to get past the things that youve been through
cause no one plays it cool quite the way you do

verse 3
are those tires you got still turnin
is that spirit you had still burnin
do you still talk that shit the way you did before
all the women and the wages and the wars that ive been wagin
i just dont feel like fightin anymore

mine again fondest friend where the hell you been
ive been strugglin to get back to you
and if you fight all night im sure youll gain the guts to try
to get past the things that youve been through
cause no one plays it cool quite the way you do

bridge
mine again
so head back home and be who you know you can
mine again
so dont be so cruel and play god with all his plans

outro
well i am mine again
every mistake that i made
and i aint ashamed to say who the hell i am
cause i am mine again
and im so damn glad im here
talking strong sober and clear like i couldnt back then1embed"
