when you try not to look at me
scared that ill see you hurting
youre not hiding anything no
and frankly its got me worried
nobody knows you better than i do
i keep my promises im fighting for you

chorus
youre not alone
ill listen till your tears give out
youre safe and sound i swear that i wont let you down
whats hurting you i i feel it too
i mean it when i say
when you cry i cry with you with you

verse 2
im not going any place
i just hate to see you like this
no i cant make it go away
oh but keeping it inside wont fix it
i cant give you every answer that you need
but i wanna hear everything you wanna tell me

chorus
youre not alone
ill listen till your tears give out
youre safe and sound i swear that i wont let you down
whats hurting you i i feel it too
i mean it when i say
when you cry i cry with you with you
