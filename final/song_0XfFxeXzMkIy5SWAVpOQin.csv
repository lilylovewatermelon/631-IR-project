i left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
swore i was not coming back
said id enough
saw you in the rear view standing
fading from my life
but i wasnt turning round
no not this time

chorus
but dont think i dont think about it
dont think i dont have regrets
dont think it dont get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
do not think i do not wonder about
could have been should have been all worked out
i know what i felt and i know what i said
but dont think i dont think about it

verse 2
when we make choices we got to live with them
heard you found a real good man and you married him
i wonder if sometimes i cross your mind
where would we be today
if i never drove that car away

but dont think i dont think about it
dont think i dont have regrets
dont think it dont get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
do not think i do not wonder about
could have been should have been all worked out
i know what i felt and i know what i said
but dont think i dont think about it
dont think i dont think about it

chorus
but dont think i dont think about it
dont think i dont have regrets
dont think it dont get to me
between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
do not think i do not wonder about
could have been should have been all worked out
i know what i felt and i know what i said
but dont think i dont think about it
