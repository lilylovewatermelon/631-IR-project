i dont love you baby that was the pill talking
i been running lately avoiding my real problems

verse 1
im just sitting here thinking theres gotta be more to life
for everything that i been through my heart is colder than ice
man its frozen i cant wait till this chapter closes
im hopeless the bible full of pressed roses
sitting on the counter reminds of times
that my eyes flowed like a fountain
my mind is full of cowards
memories that i wish i could finally escape
i really wish that happiness had a time and a place

hook
one thing i know its so hard letting go
i hold on to what kills me baby
sometimes i know id be better alone
im so cold i been damaged baby
i dont love you baby that was the pill talking
i been running lately avoiding my real problems

verse 2
im addicted to the hurt i like that shit
and if pain was a women i would wife that bitch
i take the pin out the grenade hold it and hug it
and let that motherfucker blow im so selfdestructive
two words that describe me savage and flawed
cared nothing at all about the damage i cause
i walk out of a thang as fast as i came
every time i try to change its gas to a flame
i get on a rollercoaster and dont even buckle up
every time i get love i feel the need to fuck it up
i do it every time with no hesitation
i dont know why but im in love with selfdeprecation
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likehook
one thing i know its so hard letting go
i hold on to what kills me baby
sometimes i know id be better alone
im so cold i been damaged baby
i dont love you baby that was the pill talking
i been running lately avoiding my real problems

bridge
theres something else that i feel in my soul
for so long i know my heart has froze
just how it goes its the highs and the lows
this i know this i know

hook
one thing i know its so hard letting go
i hold on to what kills me baby
sometimes i know id be better alone
im so cold i been damaged baby
i dont love you baby that was the pill talking
i been running lately avoiding my real problemsembed"
