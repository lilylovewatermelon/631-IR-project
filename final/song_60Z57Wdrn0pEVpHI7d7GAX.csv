take me to the river
yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 1 eminem
its 2002 everything was totally new
we were globally huge watchin sales go through the roof
we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included
a multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
we were so bulletproof—wrote souped and soaked in our youth
thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe
the death of doody broke us in two
we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do
and at the time i was goin through my own struggles too
so i wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through
everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew
i was hopin they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew
the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds
i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group
shoot

prechorus mario resto eminem  both
if i could leave this all behind
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
down to the river with you
help me leave this all behind
you might also likechorus eminem
ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

verse 2 eminem
it was never the same and its bothered me since
and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
the more time goes by the more life happens
and we gotta be men we got responsibilities
plus we dont say how we feel
and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in
been with you guys thick and thin
but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends
which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit
yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
if youda put d12 on it wish i coulda did
more to try talkin you into comin up off it
i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is
i think of all of the trips to bet
and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with
maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features
but thats water under the bridge
but im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed
prechorus mario resto eminem  both
if i could leave this all behind
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
down to the river with you
help me leave this all behind

chorus
ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

verse 3 eminem
bacardi and hen never thought the party would end
one minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits
you can already sense the climate is startin to shift
to these kids you no longer exist
went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch
to tiny drops little drips
and by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed
you start thinkin of all the artists you dissed
all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get
for turnin your fuckin back on bizzy kuniva and swift
a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished
i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment
but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none
i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this
to my partners i cant say how sorry i am
this is not how i planned for our story to end
i love all of you men
but i just cant be the guy everybody depends
on for entire careers cause thats not even fair
i will always be here but that spark isnt there
and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era
ive tried hearkening back to but im fightin for air
im barely chartin myself
feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent
to treat yall like a stepping stone
though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road
done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up
but the longer we spend livin this lie that we live
the less is left for closure so lets let this go
its not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over
chorus eminem
ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

outro eminem
i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones161embed"
