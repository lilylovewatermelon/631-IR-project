she seemed dressed in all of me
stretched across my shame
all the torment and the pain
leaked through and covered me

prechorus
id do anything to have her to myself
just to have her for myself
now i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do
when she makes me sad

verse 2
she is everything to me
the unrequited dream
a song that no one sings
the unattainable

prechorus
shes a myth that i have to believe in
all i need to make it real is one more reason
i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do
when she makes me sad

i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me

torn into pieces

chorus
but i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
