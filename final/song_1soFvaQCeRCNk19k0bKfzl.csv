verse 1
come inside and be afraid
of this impressive mess i’ve made
if you take a look now you will find
i have thrown away my vice
done away with paradise
see what’s going on inside my mind

prechorus
please let me out
please let me out
please let me

chorus
branded like an animal
i can still feel the burn in my mind
i do believe that you’ve made your message clear
i think i’m losing my mind i think i’m losing my mind
deprivating isolating all that i feel
leaving me with images i know are not real
are those words of condemnation that i hear
i think im losing my mind
i think i’m losing my

i dont know how much i can take
the secret thoughts inside me wake
i’ve lost what was within me

oh sweet insanity
now i try again to find
the thing that was my mind
behold the other side
who said ive lost my mind
now i try again to find
the thing that was my mind
behold the other side
who said ive lost my mind
