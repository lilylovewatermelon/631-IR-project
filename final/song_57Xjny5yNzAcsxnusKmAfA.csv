he seemed impressed by the way you came in
tell us a story i know youre not boring
i was afraid that you would not insist
you sound so sleepy just take this now leave me

prechorus
i said please dont slow me down if im going too fast
youre in a strange part of our town

chorus
yeah the nights not over youre not trying hard enough
our lives are changing lanes you ran me off the road
the wait is over im now taking over
youre no longer laughing im not drowning fast enough

verse 2
now every time that i look at myself
i thought i told you this world is not for you
the room is on fire as shes fixing her hair
you sound so angry just calm down you found me

prechorus
i said please dont slow me down if im going too fast
youre in a strange part of our town
