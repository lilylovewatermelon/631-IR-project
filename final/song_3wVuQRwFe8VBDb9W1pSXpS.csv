five foot seven with light green eyes
body built like a woman over twentyfive
plus she push the whip that the average women couldnt get
less she worked about two nine to fives
girly played the game just a little too mature
she damn near had everything i was looking for
but things seemed shady
when i asked my lady to meet at the club
she had trouble at the door
thats when i found out that

chorus
oh she was only seventeen years old
and i couldnt see her no more
oh i aint tryin to see myself locked up
for knockin up some young joan
oh how could i explain this situation to my family
and all of my boys
oh im sorry shorty but youve got to get gone
yeah

verse 2
i tried to cut her off but she wasnt having it
she kept telling me her age didnt mean shit
and thats when she started to cry
baby i need you in my life
and without you i just couldnt handle it
so whats a brother to do
cause either way i lose
so i could just say my piece
or piss off her peeps
and talk it out with the boys in blue
cause when it comes down to it

oh she was just seventeen years old
and i was dead wrong from the door
oh i aint tryin to see myself locked up
for knockin up some young joan
oh how could i explain this situation to my family
and all of my boys
oh sorry shorty but youve got to get gone
yeah
