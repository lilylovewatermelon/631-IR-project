verse 1 rod wave
while in the cell with lil hakeem after i slapped him i had told him
i dont know how you get down with them clowns but im a soldier
no one could understand i had way too much aggression brrt
that built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
see i done been lied to backstabbed and heartbroken
i wanted to cry but i was too afraid to open
prayin one day id find a peace of mind by the ocean
i spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
while at my nana house i play the couch starin at the ceiling
tryin not to get in my feelings
thinkin of a way i can make these millions
maybe thatll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days yeah

chorus rod wave
