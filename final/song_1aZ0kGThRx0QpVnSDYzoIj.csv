chorus 24heavy  rylo rodriguez
ima ride for my niggas wrong or right
devil in my eyes you can see him when we slide
pistol on my side i cant let em kill my vibe
niggas pickin sides and these niggas switchin sides
i promise ima ride
we tread spin bullets flyin
even at the red light his mama still cant stop from cryin
if my chain fell out my pocket the only way i drop a dime
i know ray charles had it good he aint never had to see a homicide
stevie wonder aint see his brothers die he aint feel my pain
he dont know my mama couldnt pay the light bill and i felt that pain
but mark had died he wasnt breaking a dollar but i tried to help him change
interrogatin i still wouldnt crack if i was on cocaine

verse 1 lil baby
got this shit from out the projects aint no silver spoons
the morning after the night we slide only time we watch the news
i wanna comment on niggas picture but i just keep it cool
i know them pussy niggas bitches and they know it too thats why im confused
i was stackin gettin money when i was in school
went to sellin packs from jackin then made rappin cool
lookin up to rich niggas let me rock they jewels
got the game from real steppers thats why i walk with tools
never let these bitches knock me off my pivot spin em
dm her best friend im tryna get up in her kill it
rapping like an expert but i just be doin it to blow off in it
two thousand on all my denim im always working im never chillin

i come from the bottom like the curb do

ride with that fire cant let em swerve you
gotta watch your own back cant let em hurt you haha
shooters on the roof thatll murk you
and i treat em like my son like i birth you
when i was runnin through the street it was on curfew
and all them times i had him down i couldve murked you
before i went and did my time in the feds
i was skippin school thats why i was upset
i was trappin on sunset on the hill i couldnt beg
keep that fire by my side yeah you know i aint scared yeah
you know how i play it

and billy died sober shootin dice hear what im sayin im hollow
and my niggas went to snortin coke i remember pourin up in fanta
asking god why that cat geeked i dont never get no answers
