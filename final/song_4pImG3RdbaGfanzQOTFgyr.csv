im drunk off your kiss
for another night in a row
this is becoming too routine for me
but i didnt mean to lead you on
and its alright to pretend
that we still talk
its just for show isnt it
its my fault that it fell apart

prechorus
just maybe you need this
and i didnt mean to
lead you on

chorus
you were everything i wanted
but i just cant finish what ive started
theres no room left here on my back
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
id still pick my friends over you

postchorus
my friends over you
you might also likeverse 2
please tell me everything
that you think that i should know
about all the plans you made
when i was nowhere to be found
and its alright to forget
that we still talk
its just for fun isnt it
its my fault that it fell apart

prechorus
just maybe you need this
and i didnt mean to
lead you on

chorus
you were everything i wanted
but i just cant finish what ive started
theres no room left here on my back
it was damaged long ago
though you swear that you are true
id still pick my friends over you
