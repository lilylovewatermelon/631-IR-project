well breathe in
she said thats fine whats on your mind

just give me time to get things right then well begin

prechorus mitchel cave
oh she says im out of her league i dont think so
im not ready to leave but i should go
theres such a wonderful breeze from the window
and now were takin it down like a free throw
and im ready if youre ready to go
just say that word just say that word
just say that word

this could take some time hands all over mine
let this feeling slide and girl im yours tonight
and she said how i love the vibes hey
and shes feeling so alright
and were not coming down were high so high

the cigarette to ease the stress he left you with
i think youll find that i dont mind if im dismissed
but youll be fine with pouted lines break through your skin
and you tell me when
