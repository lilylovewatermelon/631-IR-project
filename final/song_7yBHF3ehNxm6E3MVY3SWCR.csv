verse 1 50 cent
cocaine heroin ecstasy marijuana
im mule on that greyhound from ny to the carolina
paper chase different name same face dont catch a case
my road dogs on parole his baby girls four years old
we play the block pistol cocked you could shoot or get shot
kill you for your crack spot take everything your ass got
semiautomatic spray bust back or run away
niggas talkin in the hood well handle this another day
in november you make my shitlist you dead you can cancel christmas
ill send you a gift niggasll come and leave your ass twisted
them hollow tip shells burn baby burn
see a nigga get merked a babys born man the world turns
i seen it all crystal clear so i keep my pistol near
hearts never full of fear homie i stay well aware
of whats going on around me motherfuckers want me dead

verse 2 lloyd banks
lil niggas i done paved the way yall should thank him
but if you think otherwise

verse 3 young buck
my papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
hed just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
i would hop in my impala and ride all through the night
they gave my homeboy life so when you do it do it right
my fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
i still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
no other solution you think we hollering and hooting
until you wake up and then you got to hear bout these shootings
i take a pull from a loosey and put the clip in my pocket
before i take another bullet im gon pull it and pop it
and if its beef my nigga then let your guns do your talking
the graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
they say that we responsible for boosting the crime rate
they say that we the reason that these young niggas buying weight
but im gonna keep this glock on my waist til my dying day
its nuthin but a g thang gunit and dr dre
chorus 50 cent
