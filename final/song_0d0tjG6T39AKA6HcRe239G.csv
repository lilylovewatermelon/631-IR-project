i spent the morning at an old friends grave
flowers and amazing grace he was a good man
he spent his whole life spinnin his wheels
never knowin how the real thing feels
he never took a chance or took the time to dance
and i stood there thinking as i said goodbye
today is the first day of the rest of my life

prechorus
im gonna stop looking back and start moving on
and learn how to face my fears
love with all of my heart make my mark
i want to leave something here
go out on a ledge without any net
thats what im gonna be about
yeah i want to be running
when the sand runs out

verse 2
cause people do it everyday
promise themselves theyre gonna change
ive been there but im changing from the inside out
that was then and this is now
im a new man yeah im a brand new man
and when they carve my stone theyll write these words
here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth

im gonna stop looking back and start moving on
and learn how to face my fears
love with all of my heart make my mark
i want to leave something here
go out on a ledge without any net
thats what im gonna be about
yeah i want to be running
when the sand runs out

bridge
and as the cold wind blows across the graveyard i think i hear
the voice of my old friend whisper in my ear

chorus
im gonna stop looking back and start moving on
and learn how to face my fears
love with all of my heart make my mark
i want to leave something here
go out on a ledge without any net
thats what im gonna be about
yeah i want to be running
when the sand runs out

i want to be running when the sand runs out
