there goes my heart beating
cause you are the reason
im losing my sleep
please come back now
and there goes my mind racing
and you are the reason
that im still breathing
im hopeless now

chorus
id climb every mountain
and swim every ocean
just to be with you
and fix what ive broken
oh cause i need you to see
that you are the reason

verse 2
there goes my hands shaking
and you are the reason
my heart keeps bleeding
i need you now
if i could turn back the clock
id make sure the light defeated the dark
id spend every hour of every day
keeping you safe
