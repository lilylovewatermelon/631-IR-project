be it enacted by the council of the district of columbia that this act may be cited as the “large retailer accountability act of 2013”

sec 2 findings

the council of the district of columbia finds that

1 the council of the district of columbia declares that it is the policy of the district to promote living wage jobs to help working families make ends meet and protect the health safety and welfare of our community

2 large retailers are becoming an important source of jobs for local residents by adopting living wage standards for large retailers the district can ensure that economic development better meets the community’s need for familysupporting jobs

3 the district has the authority to mandate social and economic policies as long the policy is rationally related to a legitimate state interest

4 there are three legitimate interests in requiring large retailers to pay a living wage which are
a save the district government money on costs associated with social services

b expand the districts economy by augmenting spending by district residents who would earn a living wage and

c provide a higher income to district residents so they can better afford to live in the district

5 retailers that pay living wages and provide affordable health benefits face growing pressure to cut back when their competitors are permitted to pay low wages and offer no benefits the result could be increased costs to the district when businesses that provide health care to their employees are replaced by businesses that do not and instead rely on city health clinics public hospitals and publicly funded programs such as medicaid to provide health care to their employees
6 a living wage would provide a family more income which in turn would reduce the earned income tax credit they receive from the district government a family would rely more on wage income and less on government tax subsidies to make ends meet

7 providing fulltime employment with a living wage would lift twothirds of district working poor families out of poverty and help them get off the temporary assistance for needy families program

8 requiring a living wage would not only give more money to working families when they need it most but it would be a positive impact on the districts economy lowwage workers are more likely than any other income group to spend any extra earnings immediately on previously unaffordable basic needs or services

9 a living wage would help shift revenues that would be made from businesses that are not located in the district to district residents thereby augmenting their spending power in turn district residents would spend those extra funds within the district on goods and services the increased spending would boost the economy and create jobs

10 states that have mandated higher minimum wages have seen growth in
employment 50 greater than in states where the federal minimum wage prevails

11 retail employment grew by 61 in the states with a higher minimum wage versus 19 in states with a lower minimum wage

12 the cost of living in the district is a real hardship for lowwage workers the district is the ninth most expensive city in the united states to reside

13 living wages would make it easier for families to be able to afford to live in the district

14 walmart has already detailed to district residents that it intends to offer full and parttime employees a healthcare plan and they plan to create jobs that would pay an average of 1249 an hour

15 the district should embrace businesses’ wage and benefit promises such as walmarts and require by law that large retailers provide living wages and benefits

16 the retail industry has oversaturated the rural and suburban markets so the only way they can grow is to expand in large urban centers

17 with the influx of over 1000 residents a month there is a growing and dynamic market for large retailers to thrive in the district

18 it is appropriate to set a standard for larger businesses in the retail industry because
a large retailers are better able to afford the cost of paying a living wage than many other kinds of employers since most of them make profits well in excess of 1 billion a year
b a number of large retailers in the region are already paying a living wage providing evidence that it is feasible for employers in this industry to create good jobs while still operating profitably

c large retailers generally are less likely than other kinds of businesses to respond to such regulation by closing or reducing employment because the retail industry is more locationdependent and

d other cities such as sante fe and san francisco which have enacted living wage laws have experienced no negative impact on retail employment and development
