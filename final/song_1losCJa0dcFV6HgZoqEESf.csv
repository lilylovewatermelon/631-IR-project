sometimes we only live for the here and now
sometimes were lonely
sometimes we feel we need a place to be grounded
or fly away again

prechorus
i will
fly away again
oh i will
fly away again

chorus
i feel rain pourin down
i wait to
rot away live again
here forever the spiral never ends
never ends

verse 2
why are we feeling somethings familiar around us
are we just dreaming
always we search for the answers but nothing is found
we fly away again

prechorus
i will
fly away again
oh i will
fly away again
