theyd been high school sweethearts since they were just fifteen
a storybook beginning with the wedding of their dreams
consumed by his ambition he soon left her at home
with a promise and an empty house and too much time alone

her boredom turned to drinking and drinking turned to lies
and he let her get too far gone before he realized
and you wouldnt recognize them if youd known them way back when
cause now the flame of loves burned out and cant be lit again

and its the same old story
youve heard a thousand times
somebodys trust gets broken
somebodys left behind
you try walking a tightrope
but its all uphill
and if the fall dont kill you
lord the heartbreak will

two more childhood sweethearts in a small town far away
committed to each other since before their wedding day
this will last forever thats what the whole town said
but there are some temptations that can turn a good mans head
see travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeshe was unexpeced when she came home from town
she never even noticed all the window shades pulled down
and though he begged forgiveness she turned and ran away
with the image of betrayal that time just cant erase

and its the same old story
youve heard a thousand times
somebodys trust gets broken
somebodys left behind
you try walking a tightrope
but its all uphill
and if the fall dont kill you
lord the heartbreak will

and its a sad old benediction to a wasted slice of life
and theres an overwhelming price youve got to pay
its a losin proposition and it cuts just like a knife
you cant expect the hurt to go away

and its the same old story
youve heard a thousand times
somebodys trust gets broken
somebodys left behind
you try walking a tightrope
but its all uphill
and if the fall dont kill you
lord the heartbreak will
and if the fall dont kill you
lord the heartbreak will
oh yeahembed"
