i dont know why im with you
the only right thing i do is get along with you
and days go byebye for you
but they fly by for me its true

verse 2
i talked to you late last night
you said it wasnt all right but it would be alright
and when you sleep by yourself
youre not alone im with you ooh wee ooh

chorus
but you werent listening
when i told you everything
that you need i aint got
you should be gone by now but youre not

verse 3
ill play guitar all night long
and i know hundreds of songs and ill just play them all
and even when i get home
somehow youre still alone its true

verse 4
i dont know why youre with me
the only reason i see is some sort of fetish thing
some people like to be pleased
and some like to be teased which are you

but you said just play dead
as long as we stay true
