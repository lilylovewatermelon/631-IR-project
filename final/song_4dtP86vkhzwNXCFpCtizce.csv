fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
that you would rather be beside than in front of
but shes never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

verse 1
she swam out of tonights phantasm
grabbed my hand and made it very clear
theres absolutely nothing for us here
its a magnolia celebration to be attended on a wednesday night
its better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
at least thats the conclusion she came to in this overture

bridge
and the secret door swings behind us
shes saying nothing shes just giggling along

verse 2
her arms were folded most indignant
not looking like she was soon to leave
i had to squint in order to believe
then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
and unveiling the unexpected
i who was earlier reluctant
was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
how could such a creature survive in such a habitat
you might also likebridge
and the secret door swings behind us
shes saying nothing shes just giggling along
even if they were to find us
i wouldnt notice im completely occupied

chorus
as all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
ones you would rather be beside than in front of
but shes never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
but youre daft to think shed care

outro
fools on parade
fools on parade
fools on parade
