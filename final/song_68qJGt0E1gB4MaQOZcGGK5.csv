why did she have to go
so young i just dont know why
things happen half the time
without reason without rhyme
lovely sweet young woman
daughter wife and mother
makes no sense to me
i just have to believe

chorus
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waitin
and i know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

verse 2
loved ones she left behind
just tryin to survive
and understand the why
feelin so lost inside
anger shot straight at god
then askin for his love
empty with disbelief
just hopin that maybe

she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waitin
and i know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

its hard to say goodbye
her picture in my mind
will always be of times ill cherish
and i wont cry cause

chorus
she flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
by the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
and she walks with jesus and her loved ones waitin
and i know shes smilin sayin dont worry bout me

outro
dont worry bout me
