youre tuned to dawn fm
the middle of nowhere on your dial
so sit back and unpack
you may be here a while
now that all future plans have been postponed
and its time to look back on the things you thought you owned
do you remember them well
were you high or just stoned
and how many grudges did you take to your grave
when you werent liked or followed how did you behave
was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming
were you ever in tune with the song life was humming

if pains living on when your bodys long gone
and your phantom regret hasnt let it go yet
you may not have died in the way that you must
all specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
when youre all out of time theres nothing but space
no hunting no gathering no nations no race
and heaven is closer than those tears on your face
when the purple rain falls were all bathed in its grace
heavens for those who let go of regret
and you have to wait here when youre not all there yet
but you could be there by the end of this song
where the weeknds so good and he plays all week long
bang a gong get it on
and if your broken hearts heavy when you step on the scale
youll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
consider the flowers they dont try to look right
they just open their petals and turn to the light
are you listening real close heavens not that its this
its the depth of this moment we dont reach for bliss
god knows life is chaos but he made one thing true
you gotta unwind your mind train your soul to align
and dance til you find that divine boogaloo
you might also likein other words
you gotta be heaven to see heaven
may peace be with you35embed"
