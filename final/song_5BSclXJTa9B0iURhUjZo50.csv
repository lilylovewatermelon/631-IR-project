hey baby save the poetry
keep your happiness to yourself

verse 1 shakira  alejandro sanz
i dont ask for every day to be sunny
i dont ask for there to be a party every friday
nor do i ask that you return to me begging for forgiveness
if you cry with dry eyes and talking about her
oh my love it hurts me so much it hurts me so much
that you left without telling me where you were going
oh my love it was torture to lose you

chorus shakira  alejandro sanz
i know i havent been a saint
but i can fix it love
man cannot live on bread alone
and i cannot live off of excuses
we only learn from mistakes
and today i know that my heart is yours
its best if you save all that
throw that bone to another dog
and well say goodbye

verse 2 shakira  alejandro sanz
i cant ask winter to pardon a rose
i cant ask the elm trees to bear pears
i cant ask for eternity from a mere mortal
and walk around throwing thousands of pearls to the pigs
oh my love it hurts so much it hurts so much
that you dont believe in my promises anymore
oh my love its torture to lose you

bridge alejandro sanz
dont leave dont leave
hey baby look dont get angry
you have my love from monday to friday
but its best if you leave saturday to me
hey baby dont punish me anymore
because out there without you i cant find peace
im just a regretful man
im like a bird that returns to its nest

chorus shakira  alejandro sanz
i know i havent been a saint
and its because im not made of stone
man cannot live on bread alone
and i cannot live off of excuses
we only learn from mistakes
and today i know that my heart is yours
outro shakira
ay ay ay ay ay ay
oh all that ive done for you
it was torture to lose you
it hurts me so much that its like this
keep crying im sorry
but im not going to cry for you todayembed"
