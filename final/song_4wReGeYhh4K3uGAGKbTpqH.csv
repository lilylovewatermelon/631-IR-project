i come with the toast

i’m hanging out the hummer with sos’
exploding missile glock ringing at the front of your door like jehovah witness’
sober forget it

the youngest soldier come with it
cock back guns put holes in your fitted
nigga i told you to quit it
i load it with 50
i blow ‘til it’s empty
the dro and henny got me lokin’ and limpin’
ropin’ up when i drink ‘til i’m over the limit
hoppin’ out the rover with semis
wildin’ out go straight to your momma’s house
with a rag on my face with more 9s than dialing out
now who hating
niggas cheapskating underestimating
the heat take him put him under extra pavement
some one week in jamaica come back with a accent like 

outro lil wayne
