if food needed pleasing
youd suck all the seasoning off
suck it off
well treat me like disease
like the rats and the fleas
ahaha ahaha
bang your head like a gong
cause its filled with all wrong
ahaha clangclangclang

chorus
if you think you know enough to know
you know weve had enough
and if you think you dont you probably will
our tails wagged and then fell off
but we just turned back marched into the sea

bridge
well treat me like the sea
oh so salty and mean
ahhaha ohhaha
well treat me like disease
like the rats and the fleas
ahhahaha

ill be beating my hearts record for speeding
ill be beating the record for hearts skipping
in the dark our tails wagged then fell off
but we just turned back marched into the sea
well we just turned round marched into the sea

verse 2
take all that you need
like my sign says for free
til its gone til its gone
well discard whom you please
like the leaves off a tree
ahaha ahaha
lets shake hands if you want
but soon both hands are gone
ohhaha haha

bridge
well treat me like the sea
oh so salty and mean
ahaha
oh treat me like the sea
oh so salty and mean
ahaha
outro
well treat me like disease
like the rats and the fleas
bang your head like a gong
cause you called it all wrong
move your tongue
clangclang clangclang clangclang clangclang
cut me down like the trees
like the lumber or weeds
drag me out of the sea
and then teach me to breathe
give me forced health
til i wish death on myself
give me forced health
til i wish death on myself
ahhaha ahha ahha ahha ahha
well we all stumbled round
tangled up in our cords
from the phones vcrs
and our worldly woes
ahhaha
march on march on march on march on
well march on4embed"
