even then i had the uneasy feeling it wasnt young viktor vaughn who would need my protection
motherfuckers thats why i aint playin with their ass thats whats gon happen to them niggas
motherfuckers done fucked up man
aint it some shit like that

verse 1
yo im only rhyming where the drums is at
yall niggas think yall slick with that bullshit—bump that
yall pay v for flowing to the beat
not for what he know that got hoes hoeing in the streets
thats for him to know and for they to never find out
about the kidnap blind fold and the blind mouse
the coroner report say he simply signed out
oh and i know yall wanna see a wino bring the wine out
cat with a dead mouse is how he catch a phrase and pause
plays with it kill it and eat off it for days get it
whoever aint get it aint supposed to
for standing still close to bandits will ghost you
no shoot sherlock i dont know how they do on your block
out here we rock on to the sure shot
shit still aint stop keep it on til your peeps is gone
v be on the creep no matter what you keep it on

v catch the beat too ridiculously
people think he study levitations true mystery
had a pal named ed leedskalnin until he got him for his sweet 16
he said ed be wilin
rumor has it things got violent
he clobbered him and broke the fuck out
but he aint try to rob him
i told her dont tell your man thats the trouble with these chicks
next experiment twelve strands from double helix
no i havent seen kes neelix
oh yeah just you stay away from her with those lyrics
please—aint nobody fuckin after her
im out of here as soon as i fix the flux capacitor
and oh and speak to v in a proper manner
before he stabs you and put out all types of propaganda
stop the slander chop the hand of a thief
and cut the mouth off of who ever come out they teeth
v sell time to an inmate
and then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate
they know whos the renown beat critic
and do a street lyric like thats a neat trick
off on a tangent they aint got a cent
supposed to went to management and spent it getting bent
sparky i had enough of your malarkey
for one dont mark me and who you calling darkie
outro
i had to take the nigga car key
