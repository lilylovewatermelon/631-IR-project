i hold on so nervously to me and my drink
i wish it was cooling me
but so far has not been good its been shitty
and i feel awkward as i should
this club has got to be the most pretentious thing
since i thought you and me

prechorus
well i am imagining a dark lit place
or your place or my place

chorus
well im not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i wanna make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you

verse 2
i hold out for one more drink before i think
im looking too desperately
but so far has not been fun i should just stay home
if one thing really means one
this club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
that would be cool with me

chorus
well im not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you

chorus
well im not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i wanna make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you
not paralyzed but i seem to be struck by you
i wanna make you move because youre standing still
if your body matches what your eyes can do
youll probably move right through me on my way to you

outro
youll probably move right through me on my way to you
youll probably move right through me on my way to you24embed"
