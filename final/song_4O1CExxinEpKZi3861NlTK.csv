verse 1
yeah girl been diggin on you
sippin on drink number two
and tryin to come up with somethin smooth
and waitin on the right time to make my move
but i just cant wait no more
cant let you slip out that door
prettiest thing i ever seen before
got me spinnin around i aint even on a dance floor

chorus
youre shakin that money maker
like a heart breaker like your college major
was twistin and tearin up friday nights
love the way youre wearin those jeans so tight so tight
i bet your kiss is a soulsaver
