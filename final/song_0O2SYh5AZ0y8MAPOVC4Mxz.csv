its quite possible that im your third man girl
but its a fact that im the seventh son
its quite possible that im your third man girl
but its a fact that im the seventh son
and right now you could care less about me
but soon enough you will care by the time im done

verse 2
lets have a ball and a biscuit sugar
and take our sweet little time about it
lets have a ball girl
and take our sweet little time about it
tell everybody in the place to just get out
well get clean together
and ill find me a soapbox where i can shout it

read it in the newspaper

and i can think of one or two things to say about it
