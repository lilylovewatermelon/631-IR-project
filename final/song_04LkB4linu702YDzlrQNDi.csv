les poissons
les poissons
how i love les poissons
love to chop
and to serve little fish
first i cut off their heads
then i pull out the bones
ah mais oui
ca cest toujours delish
les poissons
les poissons
hee hee hee
hah hah hah
with the cleaver i hack them in two
i pull out whats inside
and i serve it up fried
god i love little fishes
dont you

heres something for tempting the palate
prepared in the classic technique
first you pound the fish flat with a mallet
then you slash through the skin
give the belly a slice
then you rub some salt in
cause that makes it taste nice

sacre bleu
what is this
how on earth could i miss
such a sweet little succulent crab
quel dommage
what a loss
here we go in the sauce
now some flour i think
just a dab
now i stuff you with bread
it dont hurt cause youre dead
and youre certainly lucky you are
cos its gonna be hot
in my big silver pot
toodleloo mon poisson
