careful as i write her name
on the corner of the page
make it look like it was her all along
and i put the paper in my bag
as im walking back to class
and the notes i wrote
that took me so long

prechorus
she doesnt notice me
she just smiles and says
thank you for the trigonometry
cause thats all it meant to her

chorus
but i spent
22 days and 21 nights
crossing every t just making it right
only to discover its not worth
doing annabelles homework
doesnt matter how many papers i write
end of the equation wont be you and i
and now im just another who got hurt
doing annabelles homework

careful as i walk away
so she cant see it on my face

im disappointed in myself
cause i know loves not for sale
oh my mother raised me better than that

prechorus
she doesnt notice me
she just smiles and says
thank you for the geography
cause thats all it meant to her

chorus
but i spent
22 days and 21 nights
crossing every t just making it right
only to discover its not worth
