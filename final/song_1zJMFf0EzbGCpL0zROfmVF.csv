i know youve been cutting ties youve been telling lies
i know you dont know the time its all up in your mind
but i cant get with it no
i cant get with it no
wont get a whiff of that sickness

chorus
you say you wanna fly thats alright
gotta buckle up better hold on tight
gotta get in your right side of mind
get in your right side of mind
if youre tryna fly
better hold on hold on tight
get in your right side of mind
get in your right side of mind
if youre tryna fly

verse 2
human spend so much time tryna figure out life
tryin to classify wrong and right
better hold on hold on tight
its gonna be a bumpy ride its gonna be a bumpy ride
full of lies and pasttimes
full of lights and endless nights
you dont feel your merkabah spin
just try again and again just try and again like
i try again and again
i try again and again
i try again and again
i try again and again

if youre tryna fly

bridge
circles circles elipses
trees and flowers breeze and grass and laughs
shes drawing
circles circles elipses
trees and flowers breeze and grass and laughs
straight lines hes running out of time
trying to get from a to b from he to she
straight lines hes running out of time
trying to get from a to b to eternity

chorus
you say you wanna fly thats alright
gotta buckle up better hold on tight
gotta get in your right side of mind
get in your right side of mind
if youre tryna fly
better hold on hold on tight
get in your right side of mind
get in your right side of mind
if youre tryna fly
outro
get in your right side
if youre tryna fly tell me tell me if youre tryna fly
to your right side of mind
to your right side of mind
to your right side of mind5embed"
