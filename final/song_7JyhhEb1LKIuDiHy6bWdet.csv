sick of the city locked in with all the pretty people
you need a vacation
somewhere that no one ever would dream to go
somewhere mundane hop on the train
see where it goes
finish your ride hop off and hide
now that youre finally alone

chorus
oh yeah yeah
honey youre finally alone
oh yeah yeah ho

verse 2
out in the country tending to all the pretty cattle
it turns out the cowboy dreams of the city
who could have ever known
hop on a plane fly out to spain
int√©ntalo yeah
pick up your bags cure your jet lag
now that youre finally alone

chorus
oh yeah yeah
honey youre finally alone
oh yeah yeah
honey youre finally alone
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
honey youre finally alone
oh yeah yeah hoyou might also like3embed"
