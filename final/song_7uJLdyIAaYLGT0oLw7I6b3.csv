new fang no thing had it made
to parade found a sucker now i want another
stand up step aside open wide
hanging out and on until the feelings gone
want to yes i do
wanna learn taking turns getting carpet burns
loose lips lipstick spit
come and go i think its both i gotta know

chorus
sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
think youve got me confused for a better man
sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
say youve got me confused oh
i aint a better man

verse 2
no slack cadillac couldnt quit
gums flap so heres your teeth back
accept what i left
far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
tailgate by the lake
too much too young every button gonna come undone
tightrope no joke
nothing left so you go baroque
you might also likechorus
sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
said you got me confused with a better man
sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
i know you got me confused

interlude
oh

instrumental break

outro
look out what ive
new fang pressing down low
no more waiting around for
new fang pressing down ah
no more waiting around oh
new fang new fang
they aint gonna wait no
new fang new oh
aint gonna wait no more5embed"
