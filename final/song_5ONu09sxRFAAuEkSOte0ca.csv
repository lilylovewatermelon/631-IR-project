she is picture perfect to me
at first she has the sweetest intentions
now are you gonna believe
shes always had a secret to tell
but why she keep a secret from me
everybody likes to feel the infection
but are you ready to bleed

and my world is alive she gets her trouble from me

she is a great pretender
she wanted me to believe
she is a great pretender
so dont believe what you see

my baby is feeling so insecure now
shes got no reason to be
i want to touch i want to taste her body
oh no shes got no use for me
uneasy in the way that i want it
she get herself what she needs
everybody is so sick of the silence
so are you ready to scream

and my world is alive she gets her trouble from me
you might also likeshe is a great pretender
she wanted me to believe
she is a great pretender
so dont believe what you see

open up your eyes
open up my eyes

she is a great pretender
she wanted me to believe
she is a great pretender
so dont believe what you see

she is a great pretender
she is a great pretenderembed"
