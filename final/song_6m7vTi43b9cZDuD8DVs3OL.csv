somebody told you that my broken heart started mending
im getting by but the truth is that im still standing
knee deep in yesterdays rain

verse 1
well i aint high and dry i aint got a big boat
but i got a new umbrella and an overcoat
and if the good lords willing and the sun breaks through
thatll be one more day that i made it without you
that i made it without you

chorus
i dont care what the future holds
and dont care about what youve been told
dont want to hear what the weatherman has to say
cause im standing knee deep in yesterdays rain

verse 2
all those fools go rushing they dont hesitate
and the lonely go looking where the losers wait
and im thinking somewhere in the middle theres a love thats true
but i aint found one yet and i aint got you
no i aint got you baby

chorus
i dont care what the future holds
and dont care about what youve been told
dont want to hear what the weatherman has to say
cause im standing knee deep in yesterdays rain
yesterdays rain yesterdays rain yesterdays rain
