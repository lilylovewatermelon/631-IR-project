all i see is a fourleaf clover
may be a sign of things to come
should i jump or should i run

chorus
after i fall where do i stand
after my heart is in your hands
and youve got it all
after i fall where do i stand
after ive loved you all i can
will i still stand tall
after i fall
its as clear as a blue sky
i dont fear you telling me a lie
so ill become your only dancer
and let the sunrise bring the answer
repeat chorus
youre a move i want to make
youre a chance im gonna take
youre every dream rolled up in one
after i fall where do i stand
after i loved you all i can
will i still stand tall
after i fall
after i fall
