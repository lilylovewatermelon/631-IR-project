lets get it on
its time to get in the game
you gotta fight till it hurts
and then you do it again
lets tear it up
im saying straight to the core
aint no room for second place
go big or go home

prechorus
rise
its dogeatdog
rise
man versus beast
rise
the strong will survive
rise
ive got no time for the weak

chorus
its time to rise up man up get back up
ive never been and wont be broken
dust off and then
come back for more
youve gotta reach down dig deep break ground
show them all you wont be beaten
brush it off and then
come back for more
come back for more

its do or die
time to settle the score
gotta give it all you got
and then you give it some more
there will be blood
you gotta fight till you break
talk a lot of trash
now step up to the plate

prechorus
rise
refuse to give in
rise
ashes to dust
make them remember your name
cause in yourself you can trust

chorus
its time to rise up man up get back up
ive never been and wont be broken
dust off and then
come back for more
youve gotta reach down dig deep break ground
show them all you wont be beaten
brush it off and then
come back for more
come back for more
