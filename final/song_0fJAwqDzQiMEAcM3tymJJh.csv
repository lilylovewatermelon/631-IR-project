she said im rosie
i said i thought you were lucy she said no rosie i told you so
was here with your sister
but shes going out the back i want to dance and have fun yknow
of all the shitty little places i meet you its here
and im freaking out
i heard you got a brand new name
selling es in the dark but hey its nothing to shout about

prechorus
dont just say yes to tease me
do your utmost to please me
i dont mean to be sleazy
being you cant be easy

chorus
when youre creepin up the backstairs mothers nightmares
falling in the front door my my
climbing in the window get dressed lets go
take your brothers car keys bye bye

verse 2
well i see your yellow fingers
and your crucifix bones all covered in cellophane
was there when your best friend said
sweetheart im just here to get drunk again
i wouldnt move if i was you
i wouldnt wanna get caught when the lights go out
she said you think youre so special
i said sunshine im just bored im just checking out
