just come get all your stuff i guess my love aint good enough

verse 1
just come get all your stuff i guess my love aint good enough
you act so hard with me but i just saw you in a picture lookin soft with her
be calm if you wanna get along with me
way you talk really think its something wrong with me
why i feel like i gotta share you with the city
you dont even make a bitch feel like she pretty
make a bitch feel like she pretty
kiss me in the middle of the party when its litty
remember who you belong to when they friendly
i shouldnt have to teach you somethin you should be feelin
