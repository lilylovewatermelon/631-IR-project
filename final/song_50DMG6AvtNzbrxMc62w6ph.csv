anger he smiles
towering in shiny metallic purple armor
queen jealousy envy waits behind him
her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
blue are the lifegiving waters taken for granted
they quietly understand
the once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
but wonder why the fight is on

chorus
but theyre all bold as love
yeah theyre all bold as love
theyre all bold as love
just ask the axis

verse 2
my red is so confident that he flashes
trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
orange is young full of daring
but very unsteady for the first go around
my yellow in this case is not so mellow
in fact im trying to say its frightened like me
and all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
giving my life to a rainbow like you

im bold bold as love
yeah im bold bold as love
im bold bold as love
just ask the axis
yeah he knows he knows he knows he knows everything
