did you ever find the garden where the doves go to bathe
did you open up your heart there or were you quiet and afraid
did you light up every lantern your flame whipping against the wind
or did you fall back to the alleys with all your secrets to defend

verse 2
between the cities and the temple
between the jury and the judge
gavel pounds down like thunder
thatâ€™s inside of all of us

verse 3
were we kids out in the desert or birds running cross the sun
did i stumble through your darkness or was i just another onesee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
