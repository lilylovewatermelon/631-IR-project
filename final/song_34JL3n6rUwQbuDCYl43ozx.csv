aw shit
chris
im coming
bring your ass downstairs so we can discuss this report card
please explain to me how the fuck you go to school every single day and then bring home all fs
what are you doing all day

verse
i remember being scared to go home
cause my mama found out i did wrong
i could see the tears fall from her eyes
her child was always in something
why wont you hold me i just wanna be held
sweet dark and holy
im safe in your arms
there was a time where all i needed was a pencil
just to keep the stresses of this cold world out my mental real life
they dont know what i been through
do the same things my friends do
so who am i
i aint got the time for no rainy days
cause who gon listen when i talk about my day to day
not that im hiding
its just safer being silent these days
