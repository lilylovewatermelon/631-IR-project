give me the dust of my father
stand on the face of the ancients
bare the secret flesh of time itself

prechorus
follow me ive come so far im behind again
follow me i wish so hard im there again
follow me follow me

chorus
all that i wanted were things i had before
all that i needed i never needed more
all of my questions are answers to my sins
all of my endings are waiting to begin

verse 2
i know the way but i falter
i cant be afraid of my patience
theres a sacred place raziel keeps safe

prechorus
follow me ive seen so much im blind again
follow me i feel so bad im alive again
follow me
