verse 1
im sitting contemplating
is it worth it should i take it
take that shot and change my life
get that glock and take his life
hospitals and bloody noses
this would end all

i suppose that i could leave
knowing i cant leave
so its either him or me
cause hes gon kill me if i stay i know
hes gon kill me he cant change i know

from the first time that he did it
made a promise that hed quit it shit
its gotten so much worse
dont wanna end up in a hearse
i guess i gotta do it first
guess i gotta do it first

i cant go back now back now im runnin
nowhere to go cops i hear them comin
but if they catch me i still aint sorry
if that was wrong just call me guilty
cause if you knew what he did to me
i know i would get your sympathy
so if they catch me i still aint sorry
just lock me up and call me guilty

verse 2
i did it pulled the trigger
it wasnt so hard to figure
before i did it i said
this was for all the blood i shed
for all the women whove gone through this shit
cant think of what to do this shit
done tore em up inside and out
whose still trynna get out
hes gon kill you if you stay i know
ive been through this so yes i know
i know he promised that hed quit it
if you believe him girl forget it shit
you know im right
dont wanna see him take your life
and it will only just get worse
thats why i had to do it first
chorus
i cant go back now back now im runnin
nowhere to go cops i hear them comin
but if they catch me i still aint sorry
if that was wrong just call me guilty
cause if you knew what he did to me
i know i would get your sympathy
so if they catch me i still aint sorry
just lock me up and call me guilty

bridge
theres so much blood i grab my stuff
but before i could leave the cops busted in
you have the right to remain silent
no i have the right to stay alive
but guess what id do it again
he woulda killed me before i killed him
it woulda been him up in this building
it woulda been him faking tears
but whats funny is that im the one standing here

chorus
i cant go back now back now im runnin
nowhere to go cops i hear them comin
but if they catch me i still aint sorry
if that was wrong just call me guilty
cause if you knew what he did to me
i know i would get your sympathy
so if they catch me i still aint sorry
just lock me up and call me guilty1embed"
