i was full by your count
i was lost but your fool
was a long visit wrong
say you are the only

chorus
so many foreign worlds so relatively fucked
so ready for us so ready for us
the creature fear

verse 2
i was teased by your blouse
spit out by your mouth
i was loud by your lowered
seminary sold
tear on tail on
take all on the wind on
the soft bloody nose
sign another floor

chorus
so many territories ready to reform
don’t let it form us don’t let it form us
the creature fear
so did he foil his own is he ready to reform
so many torahs so many for us
