you speak to me
i know this will be temporary
you ask to leave
but i can tell you that ive had enough

chorus
i cant take it this welcome is gone
and ive waited long enough to make it
and if youre so strong
you might as well just do it alone and ill watch you go

verse 2
step up to me
i know that youve got something buried
ill set you free
you set conditions but ive had enough

chorus
i cant take it this welcome is gone
and ive waited long enough to make it
and if youre so strong
you might as well just do it alone and ill watch you go

bridge
come back home wont you come back home
you step in line youve got a lot to prove
it comes and goes ya it comes and goes
a step in time ya its a lot to move

i know this will be temporary
i know this will be temporary
i know this will be
but ive had enough

chorus
i cant take it this welcome is gone
and ive waited long enough to make it
and if youre so strong
you might as well just do it alone and ill watch you go
i cant take it this welcome is gone
and ive waited long enough to make it
and if youre so strong
you might as well just do it alone and ill watch you go1embed"
