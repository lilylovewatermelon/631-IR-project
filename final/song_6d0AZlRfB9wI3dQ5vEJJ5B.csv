while were young and beautiful
kiss me like you mean it
treat me like im special
cover me with sweetness
cause a time will come
when were not so young and beautiful
while were young and beautiful
living free and easy
here without a worry
dancin in our bare feet
cause when the summers done
we might not be so young and beautiful

chorus
its a crazy ride
and baby you and i
are keeping our sweet love alive
tonight while were young and beautiful

verse 2
while were young and beautiful
well party down on main street
wearing next to nothing

havin fun while were still young and beautiful
