american queen is the american dream
american queen is the american dream

she is a polish girl in america
tall tan hot blonde called anya
i asked her why would you wanna be a hollywood wife
because i dont want to end up living in a dive on vine
a dive on vine

verse 2
air hostesses doing gossip magazine
crosswords on a flight to jfk
thirtynine years old with a milehigh sheen
trying to stimulate a mind
that is slowly starting to decay
prechorus
i itch my skin i jump up and say
lady i know why your thoughts turn grey

chorus

you wanted kissing in the rain oh oh

puking american dreams oh oh
im obsessed with the mess thats america ooh

im obsessed with the mess thats america ooh
im obsessed with the mess thats america
