everywhere i look i see an ignorant fool
why must i be placed inside a world so distasteful
only thing i smile for is children and a blunt too
all you little rappers are so easily immeasurable
boy we heard your music and that shit is so unpleasurable
why the fuck do labels pay these niggas to record you for
you might be doing shows but no one comes and gives a fuck
but when we do a show we will come light your whole city up
i pull up and turn him into a duck he aint showing up
i can tell from by the way he talk that he a bitch boy
from across the street i saw him faint lemme pull him up
he was talking plenty damn shit until he sobered up
bitch they think im ryu mixed with ken when i upper cut
bitch call me kazuya when you know im finna power up
bitch know im heihachi let my squad send them choppers up
i don’t need no guns bitch i’ll pull a helicopter up
she was talking proper till she fucked around and hit my blunt
now she stumbling talking like she from from where i’m from
bitch you niggas aint come from from where im from
it aint no fucking life
boy you niggas weak watch you be born and dead the same night
play with me i bring the damn missile to a knife fight
im the type to send that boy to hell just cause i felt like it
i control myself sometimes but most times im on autopilot
thats a fair warning in the air  im unconscious and violent
i could turn your whole neighborhood into a lost island
after that you see me smoking blunts i dont give no fuck smiling
now me and my niggas being bothered by them label scouters
im the navigator i will always find my way around them
