verse 1 flo rida
hey walk out of the house with my swagger
hop in there we go i got places to go
people to see time is precious
i look at my cartier outta control
just like my mind where im goin
no women no shorties no nothin but clothes
no stoppin now my pirellis on roll
i like my jewelry thats always on gold
i know the storm is comin
my pockets keep tellin me its gonna shower
call up my homies
its on and poppin tonight cause its meant to be ours
we keep a fadeaway shot
cause we be ballin its platinum patron that be ours
lil mama i owe you just like the flowers
girl you the truth with all of that goody power cause
