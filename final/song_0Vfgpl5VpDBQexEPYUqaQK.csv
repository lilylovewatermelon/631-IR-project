well city freeze for i just realised i dont like you
me and my girl are going out for some air
and i will do my best just to get under her dress
and catch you out if i can on the other side of my sofa

chorus
wont you come on over the other side of my sofa
oh wont you come on over

verse 2
the city heated up
it got blurry cause id had enough
and he tried to take your soul
but didnt realise you keep it in a different hole

chorus
wont you come on over the other side of my sofa
oh wont you come on over

bridge
so here he comes a man with a loaded gun
i dont know if he wants my soul or my cash flow
i suppose i dont know
so here he comes a man with a loaded gun
i dont know if he wants my girls heart or her pearls oh
i suppose i dont know

i suppose i dont know
i suppose i dont know
i suppose i dont know
i suppose i dont know
i suppose i dont know4embed"
