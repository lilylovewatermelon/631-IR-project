im ridin full speed leavin from the ghetto doin
a hundred miles an hour you can barely see me movin
gotta shorty waitin for me that i been pursuin
and i aint got far to go
she a bad chick somethin i aint tryna ruin
shes steady callin so i know she ready to get to it
im tryna get there but i just cant
seem to catch up to her
by the time i got there she was gone
and so i walked upstairs and i heard this sound
so pretty so gritty so funny that no ones around
so i locked myself inside and closed the door
but there was this funny feeling inside
that i couldnt get rid of then i sing it

hook
miss melody who could she be describin me
all alone with my ears pressed against the wall
miss melody who could she be describin me
alone with my ears pressed against the wall

verse 2
standin in front of my window pane
the sound got me starin at the rain
the more she play the more i feel the pain
why is she doing this whats it to gain
seems like she tryna take my soul away
startin to feel im under her control today
i cant see her but i hear her from the shades
and it seems like she really knows me
every fiddle makes me wanna run away
i cant take it no more gotta get away
got me talkin about the dark nights
in the cage while she starin at me
you might also likehook
miss melody who could she be describin me
all alone with my ears pressed against the wall
miss melody who could she be describin me
alone with my ears pressed against the wall
miss melody is killin me
miri benari
who could she be
i cant wait no more im about to walk the whole door
miss melody why you playing my life with melody
answer me woman
miss melody who could she be describin me
all alone with my ears pressed against the wall
miss melody who could she be describin me
well ill be damned
its miri benariembed"
