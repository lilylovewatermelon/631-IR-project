ooh hey
im trying to decide
which way to go
think i made a wrong turn back there somewhere
ooh hey
im trying to decide
which way to go
think i made a wrong turn back there somewhere

chorus
didnt cha know didnt cha know
tried to move but i lost my way
didnt cha know didnt cha know
stopped to watch my emotions sway
didnt cha know didnt cha know
knew the toll but i would not pay
didnt cha know didnt cha know
cause you never know where the cards may lay

verse 2
time to save the world
where in the world is all the time
so many things i still dont know
so many times ive changed my mind
guess i was born to make mistakes
but i aint scared to take the weight
so when i stumble off the path
i know my heart will guide me back
see erykah badu liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeverse 3
ooh hey
im trying to decide

chorus
didnt cha know didnt cha know
tried to run but i lost my way
didnt cha know didnt cha know
stopped to watch my emotions sway
didnt cha know didnt cha know
knew the toll but i would not pay
didnt cha know didnt cha know
i said ya never know how the cards may lay

outro
love is life and life is free
take a ride of life with me
free your mind and find your way
there will be a brighter day
love is life and life is free
take a ride of life with me
free your mind and find your way
there will be a brighter day
love is life and life is free
take a ride of life with me
free your mind and find your way
there will be a brighter day23embed"
