hopes and dreams are held so close you can’t let go
but you can only see when i look into your eyes
you pulled me in too deep

take me in take me out
till i’m nothing more than words spoken from your sweet sweet mouth
dance around like no one can see
move your body with the rhythm move your body next to me

wanted is love
not going insane
you know you’ve got to hold onto what you love before it’s gone away

one step to you and i’m sinking in your lies
only to see the truth hidden behind your evil eyes
no light could lead me to the way of you
is it me or am i alone it’s all such mystery

wanted is love
not going insane
you know you’ve got to hold onto what you love before it’s gone away

wanted is love
not going insane
you know you’ve got to seek everything you love before it’s gone away

not going insane
you know you’ve got to seek everything you lost before1embed"
