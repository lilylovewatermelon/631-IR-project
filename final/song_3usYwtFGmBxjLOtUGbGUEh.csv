but im back againback with all my friends
ive been floatin away
on a silver cloudlined with all my wildest dreams

im back in your system now
and ive waited much too long back in your system
and im back in your system now
and ive finally come back home

ive been thinking of days
back when we beganwhen we first made our first stand
and i get taken away
on a silver cloudlined with all my wildest dreams

chorus
im back in your system now
and ive waited much too long
and im back in your system now
and ive finally come back home

im back into your system
theres a way to find it repeat 3x
theres a way to see it repeat 3x
theres a way to get back into your system repeat 3x
