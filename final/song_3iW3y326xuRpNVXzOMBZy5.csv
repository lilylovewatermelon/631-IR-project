stop thinking of this as being money
its just money ima make more
no no no no no no
please decondition yourself
its not just money
its happiness
its the difference between happy being happy and sad
its the difference between having a home and living on the streets
thats what it is its not just money
its so much more than that
right now its the difference between you being able to go to a prom
and disappointing a girl
as i told you from the beginning i dont have money
i have bills to pay but that meant nothing to you
absolutely nothing
lets see i have
ooh yeah ima make myself a hot link when i get home
it meant nothing to you
saving my seven dollarsyou might also like11embed"
