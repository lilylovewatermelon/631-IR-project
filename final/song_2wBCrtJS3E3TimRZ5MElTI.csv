tell me whatcha say now
tell me whatcha say
come again
if you cannot stay down
then you do not have to pretend
like there is no way out
i shoulda never let you in
cause you got me face down

prechorus 1
and dont take this personal
but youre the worst
you know what youve done to me
and although it hurts i know
i just cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away

chorus
i dont need you i dont need you
i dont need you i dont need you
but i want you
i dont mean to i dont mean to
i dont mean to i dont mean to
but i love you

tell me whatcha say now
tell me whatcha say
you said that you would come again
you said that we would remain friends but
you know that i do not depend on
nothing or no one
so why would you show up
so uninvited then
just change my mind like that

prechorus 2
please dont take this personal
but you aint shit
and you werent special
til i made you so
you better act like you know
that ive been through worse than you
i just cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away
i cant keep runnin away

chorus
but i dont need you
i dont need you i dont need you
i dont need you i dont need you
but i but i want you
i dont mean to i dont mean to
i dont mean to i dont mean to
but i love you its lost in hope ayeaye
verse 3
everybodys like hes no item
please dont like him
he dont wife em
he one nights em
i never listen no
i should have figured though
all that shit you was spittin so unoriginal
but it was you so i was with it
then tell you the truth wish we never did it
cause i usually do stick to the business
but you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
god damn god damn baby my minds blown
be forgettin you live in a different time zone
i think i know what this is
its just the times wrong
and yeah i know what you did
but baby im grown
and my love is patient
and kind of shit
if this is real we can build
through different types of shit
if you was really the realest
wouldnt be fightin it
i think your pride is just
bridge
in the way
funny how everything changed
once you got all that you wanted
nothing was ever the same

outro
and though i dont need you i dont need you
i dont need you i dont need you
i still want you oh
i dont mean to i dont mean to
i dont mean to i dont mean to
but i but i love you
i dont need you i dont need you
i dont need you i dont need you
but i want you
i dont mean to i dont mean to
i dont mean to i dont mean to
but i love you932embed"
