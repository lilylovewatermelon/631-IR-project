head down head down head down
do you understand me
aw shit

verse 1
waitin in a room
all dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair
its so unfair
i dont dare to move
for the pain she puts me through is what i need
so make it bleed

chorus
im in distress
oh mistress i confess so do it one more time
these handcuffs are too tight well
you know i will obey
so please dont make me beg
for blood sex and booze you give me

postchorus
say im disturbed
its what i deserve
another lesson to be learned
from a girl called kill
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 2
my head is in the gutter
thank you sir strike up another mandolin
of discipline
throw me to the dogs
let them eat my flesh down to the wood
it feels so good

chorus
im in distress
oh mistress i confess so do it one more time
these handcuffs are too tight well
you know i will obey
so please dont make me beg
for blood sex and booze you give me

postchorus
say im disturbed
its what i deserve
another lesson to be learned
from a girl called kill
