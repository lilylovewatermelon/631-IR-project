its just not right
you said theres a better place for you to be
its not with me
then you turned and walked away
i cant believe what i see
and i cant go to sleep at night when i think of how it used to be

she cant give you what ive got
and she cant stop your pain
and she cant love you the way i do
god i want you back again
maybe she could try with money
or she could buy you clothes
but baby when its dark and youre home at night
does she ever hold you close

she takes you out in style
she treats you right
she gives you all the things i never could shes so good
but dont you think of me
baby late at night
and i just cant take it boy together we could be so right

she cant give you what ive got
and she cant stop your pain
and she cant love you the way i do
god i want you back again
maybe she could try with money
or she could buy you clothes
but baby when its dark and youre home at night
does she ever hold you close

ooh youre gonna need me
ooh youre gonna need me
take me back
ooh youre gonna need me
all those things we did before
whatever happened to them
and all those things ive been living for
gotta start em all over again

you said it couldnt last
that we were meant to part
a guy like you and a girl like me didnt stand a chance  not from the start
but then you looked at me
i had to ask you why
as i see and try to find out why you left me for those hungry eyes

she cant give you what ive got
and she cant stop your pain
and she cant love you the way i do
god i want you back again
maybe she could try with money
or she could buy you clothes
but baby when its dark and youre home at night
does she ever hold you close
take me back
ooh youre gonna take me
take me back
ooh youre gonna take me
take me back
ooh youre gonna take me
take me backembed"
