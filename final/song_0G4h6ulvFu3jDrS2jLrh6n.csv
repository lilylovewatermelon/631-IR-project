take your head around the world
and see what you get from your mind
write your soul down word for word
see whos your friend and who is kind

prechorus
well its almost like a disease
and i know soon you will be

chorus
over the lies youll be strong
youll be rich in love and you will carry on and on
but no oh no
no you wont be mine

verse 2
and take your straight line for a curve
make it stretch in the same old line
then try to find if it was worth
what you spent why youre guilty for the way youre feelin now

prechorus
its almost like bein free
well i know soon you will be

over the lies and youll be strong
youll be rich in love and you will carry on and on
but no oh no
no you wont be mine

bridge
well take yourself out to the curb
sit and wait a fool for life

prechorus
and its almost like a disease
well i know soon you will be

chorus
youll be over the lies and youll be strong
and youll be rich in love and you will carry on and on
oh but no no oh no
oh no you wont won’t be mine1embed"
