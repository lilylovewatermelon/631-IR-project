i had a handmedown ride painted rattlecan red
second hand tires with poor boy tread
made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
truck that got stuck a lot
just letter jacket boys singing jerry jeff songs
drinking everything we could get our hands on
learnin ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
hopin’ we didn’t get caught

chorus
and we spent what little bit of money we had
on wintergreen skoal and main street gas
go get your girl go make the drag
if you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
where the man in the moon works his magic
on the second runner up of the 4h pageant
seems like yesterday even though
that was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
oh

verse 2
skipped that town on my birthday
for eighteen years i was headed that way
where old red stopped i just stayed
in a room without a view
i met a one look girl in a two bit bar
i had a place and she had a car
i won her heart with my guitar
i sang her the homesick blues
you might also likechorus
bout spendin what little bit of money we had
on wintergreen skoal and main street gas
go get your girl go make the drag
if you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
where the man in the moon works his magic
on the second runner up of the 4h pageant
seems like yesterday even though
that was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
oh

chorus
we spent what little bit of money we had
on wintergreen skoal and main street gas
go get your girl and go make the drag
if you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
where the man in the moon works his magic
on the second runner up of the 4h pageant
seems like yesterday even though
that was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
whole lot of highway a whole lot of years
sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago
