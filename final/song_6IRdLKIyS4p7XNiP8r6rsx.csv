my lucifer is lonely

verse 1
standing there killing time
cant commit to anything but a crime
peters on vacation an open invitation
animals evidence
pearly gates look more like a picket fence
once you get inside em
got friends but cant invite them

prechorus
hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
dont say i didnt warn ya

chorus
all the good girls go to hell
cause even god herself has enemies
and once the water starts to rise
and heavens out of sight
shell want the devil on her team

postchorus
my lucifer is lonely
you might also likeverse 2
look at you needing me
you know im not your friend without some greenery
walk in wearin fetters
peter should know better
your cover up is caving in
man is such a fool why are we saving him
poisoning themselves now
begging for our help wow
prechorus
hills burn in california
my turn to ignore ya
dont say i didnt warn ya

chorus
all the good girls go to hell all the good girls go to hell
cause even god herself god herself has enemies
and once the water starts to rise water starts to rise
and heavens out of sight
shell want the devil on her team

postchorus
my lucifer is lonely
theres nothing left to save now
my god is gonna owe me
theres nothing left to save now
