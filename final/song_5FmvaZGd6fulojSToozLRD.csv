17 in a small town
weak knees in a cvs
door locked in the bathroom
whats it gonna be waitin on that test
never thought that theyd be
puttin those life plans on the shelf
a couple american babies raisin one up their self

chorus all
one beer turns into a lit cigarette
burnin into a two beer buzz
three beers turns into five and six
then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
just like that everything rearranges
life changes out of the blue
its just a bud light but aint it funny
what one beer can turn into

verse 2 devin dawson  lauren alaina
sesame street on the tv
a race car rollin on a cardboard bridge
crayon stick figure family
stuck right there front center on the fridge
flash back to two pink lines
a whole bunch of prayin and doubtin
felt like the end of the world
now the world dont spin without em hey yeah
oh cause
you might also likechorus all  lauren alaina
one beer turns into a lit cigarette
burnin into a two beer buzz
three beers turns into five and six
then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
in the back of that truck
just like that everything rearranges
life changes out of the blue
its just a bud light but aint it funny
what one beer can turn into

bridge hardy  lauren alaina
a boy and a girl and a three on the tree
kissing
first comes lust then the shotgun marriage
six months later come a baby in a carriage
you know what yall you know what yall
the whole thing started with some alcohol
the whole thing started with some alcohol hey yeah

chorus all  hardy
one beer turns into a lit cigarette
burnin into a two beer buzz into a two beer buzz
three beers turns into five and six
then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
just like that everything rearranges
life changes out of the blue
its just a bud light but aint it funny
what one beer can turn into
outro all lauren alaina hardy  lauren alaina hardy
a boy and a girl and a three on the tree
kissing oh
first comes lust then the shotgun marriage
six months later come a baby in a carriage
