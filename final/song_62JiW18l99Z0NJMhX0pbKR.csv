i remember you in that rocking chair
i was in my boots and my underwear
playing rodeo all night long
you used to count til it hit eight seconds
when you hit sixtys the time you left us
but youre in my heart so ill never be alone
i know youre watching over me

chorus
i hope one day ill be the man you used to be
quick to love and slow to anger
no you never met a stranger
i hope one day when youre looking down on me
i make you smile i make you proud
i may not be there now
but i hope one day ill be man enough to be sitting there
in my granddaddys chair

verse 2
you were eight track tapes and conway twitty
road trip with nana to panama city
everybody knew she was your girl
you taught me love you taught me living
cars and jokes and good catfishing
i gave you hell and you gave me the world
im sure missing you right now

i hope one day ill be the man you used to be
quick to love and slow to anger
no you never met a stranger
i hope one day when youre looking down on me
i make you smile i make you proud
i may not be there now
but i hope one day ill be man enough to be sitting there
in my granddaddys chair
my granddaddys chair
