everywhere someones getting over
everybody cries and sometimes
you can still lose even if you really try
talkin bout the dream like the dream is over
talk like that wont get you nowhere
everybodys trustin in the heart like the heart dont lie

chorus
and thats all that i need yeah
someone else to cling to well
someone i can lean on until
i dont need to
just stay all through the night
and in the morning let me down
cause thats all that i need right now

verse 2
everywhere someones getting over
everybodys lied to someone
people still use other people with a crooked smile
all around the world theres a sinking feelin
out there right now someones really
down on themselves and dont know why every night

chorus
and thats all that i need yeah
someone else to cling to well
someone i can lean on until
i dont need to
just stay all through the night
and in the morning let me down
cause thats all that i need right now
