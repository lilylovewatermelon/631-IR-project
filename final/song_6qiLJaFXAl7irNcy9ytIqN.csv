verse 2
ya dont know
what my hate is baby
9 kids in the yard
it was kinda crazy
still
no kids thus far myself
im scared of the pain
i might not do well as a mom
still the work gets done
yes i worry bout bills
but a change gonna come
i wanna play rapper
rock the bells
but i only gotta stack
for the little estelza
you dont wanna know
bout them days that go
i got pain overload
you dont wanna know
about the things i know
i just cant take no more
most of the time
though i gotta stay on
i gotta stay real
i gotta stay strong
you know im heavy
cause i roll with gem
so im gonna be fresh
when the lights come on
come on
