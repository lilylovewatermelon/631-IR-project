verse 1
take away the sensation inside
bitter sweet migraine in my head
its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
i can’t take this feeling anymore

chorus
drain the pressure from the swelling
this sensations overwhelming
give me a long kiss goodnight
and everything will be alright
tell me that i wont feel a thing
so give me novacaine

verse 2
out of body and out of mind
kiss the demons out of my dreams
i get the funny feeling that’s alright
jimmy says its better than here
ill tell you why

chorus
drain the pressure from the swelling
this sensations overwhelming
give me a long kiss goodnight
and everything will be alright
tell me that i wont feel a thing

part ii shes a rebel

chorus
shes a rebel she’s a saint
she’s the salt of the earth and shes dangerous
she’s a rebel vigilante
missing link on the brink of destruction

verse 1
from chicago to toronto
shes the one that they call ol whatsername
shes the symbol of resistance
and she’s holding on my heart like a hand grenade
verse 2
is she dreaming what im thinking
is she the mother of all bombs gonna detonate
is she trouble like im trouble
make it a double twist of fate or a melody

bridge
she sings the revolution
the dawning of our lives
she brings this liberation
that i just cant define
nothing comes to mind

chorus
shes a rebel shes a saint
shes the salt of the earth and shes dangerous
shes a rebel vigilante
missing link on the brink of destruction

outro
shes a rebel
shes a rebel
shes a rebel
and shes dangerous1embed"
