theres some things that i regret
some words i wish had gone unsaid
some starts
that had some bitter endings
been some bad times ive been through
damage i cannot undo
some things
i wish i could do all all over again

prechorus
but it dont really matter
life gets that much harder
it makes you that much stronger
oh some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were
lessons learned

chorus
and every tear that had to fall from my eyes
every day i wondered how id get through the night
every change life has thrown me
im thankful for every break in my heart
im grateful for every scar
some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were lessons learned

theres mistakes that i have made
some chances i just threw away
some roads
i never shouldve taken
been some signs i didnt see
hearts that i hurt needlessly
some wounds
that i wish i could have one more chance to mend

prechorus
but it dont make no difference
the past cant be rewritten
you get the life youre given
oh some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were
lessons learned

chorus
and every tear that had to fall from my eyes
every day i wondered how id get through the night
every change life has thrown me
im thankful for every break in my heart
im grateful for every scar
some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were lessons learned
bridge
and all the things that break you
are all the things that make you strong
you cant change the past cause its gone
and you just gotta move on
because its all
lessons learned

chorus
and every tear that had to fall from my eyes
every day i wondered how id get through the night
from every change life has thrown me
im thankful for every break in my heart
im grateful for every scar
some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were lessons learned
oh some pages turned
some bridges burned
but there were lessons learned
