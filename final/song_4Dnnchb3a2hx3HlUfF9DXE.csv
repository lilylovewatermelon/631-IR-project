i just cant believe it was all a lie
no man in the moon just a big light in the sky
i hear disneyland might lose mickey mouse
in some giant hostile corporate shake up
tell me its a nightmare please wake me up
say it isnt so

verse 2
i found a book of matches some place weve never been
how come you hang the phone up the minute i walk in
last night i had this dream that i was losing you
i woke up in a cold sweat shaking
rescue me my heart is breaking

chorus
say it isnt so tell me its not true
say it isnt so i believe in you
tell me its a lie i dont need no proof
say everythings alright couldnt be not you
say it isnt so

verse 2
superman dont fly they did all with strings
elvis presley died they deepfried the king

like some tacky cheesy bathing beauty
dancing on the beach in a bad bmovie

chorus
say it isnt so tell me its not true
say it isnt so i believe in you
tell me its a lie i dont need no proof
say everythings alright couldnt be not you
say it isnt so dont give up on me
say it isnt so dont give up on you
get me through the night well make it through
make everything alright couldnt be not you
say it isnt so

chorus
say it isnt so tell me its not true
say it isnt so i believe in you
tell me its a lie i dont need no proof
say everythings alright couldnt be not you
say it isnt so dont give up on me
say it isnt so dont give up on you
get me through the night well make it through
make everything alright couldnt be not you
say it isnt soembed"
