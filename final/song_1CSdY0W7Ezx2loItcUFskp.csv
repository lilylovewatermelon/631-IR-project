okay i forgot about the trash
i didnt trim the long hairs on my mustache
i did buy you a ring i believe it was back in 93
alright i admit it i forgot our anniversary
but i did pick up the baby this morning at the nursery
that aint no big thing but its a gold star for me

chorus
you get tired and disgusted with me
when i cant be just what you want me to be
i still love you and i try real hard
i swear one day youll have a brand new car
i even asked the lord to try to help me
he looked down from heaven and said to tell you please
just be patient im a work in progress

verse 2
im sorry i got mad waiting in the truck
it seemed like hours you getting all dressed up
just to go to shoneys on a wednesday night
i read that book you gave me about mars and venus
i think its sinking in but i probably need to reread it
but im starting to see now what youve been saying is right

chorus
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
i know you meant well when you gave me those clogs
but my heels sure get hot down by the muffler on my hog
im sure theyre stylish but ill take my boots
i try to do that healthy thing like you want me to do
but that low fat no fats getting hard to chew
now i love your cooking honey
but sometimes i need some real food

chorus

outro
oh honey just be patient now
im a work in progressembed"
