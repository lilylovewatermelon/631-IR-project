hear that lonesome whippoorwill
he sounds too blue to fly
the midnight train is whining low
im so lonesome i could cry

verse 2 nick cave
ive never seen a night so long
when time goes crawling by
the moon just went behind a cloud
to hide its face and cry

verse 3 johnny cash
did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves begin to die
that means hes lost his will to live
im so lonesome i could cry

instrumental bridge

verse 4 johnny cash  nick cave
the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as i wonder where you are
im so lonesome i could cry
