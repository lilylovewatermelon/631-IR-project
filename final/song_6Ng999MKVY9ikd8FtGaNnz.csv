im a reckless mistake
im a cold nights intake
im a one night too long
im a come on too strong

chorus
all my life ive been living in the fast lane
cant slow down im a rollin freight train
one more time gotta start all over
cant slow down im a lone red rover

verse 2
im a hold my cards close
im a wreck what i love most
im a first class letdown
im a shut up sit down

prechorus 1
i am a head case
i am the color of boom
thats never arriving
and you are the pay raise
always a touch out of view
