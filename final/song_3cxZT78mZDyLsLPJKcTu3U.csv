you said you cant change your haircut
but it looks good anyway
i kinda wonder where you got it
and i doubt you even paid

chorus
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you

verse 2
i wonder if you got home
but we just said goodbye
you looked back at me once
but i looked back two times

chorus
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you

outro
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my neck
still smells like you
the right side of my necksee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like5embed"
