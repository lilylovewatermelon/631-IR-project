i work all night i work all day to pay the bills i have to pay
aint it sad
and still there never seems to be a single penny left for me

in my dreams i have a plan
if i got me a wealthy man
i wouldnt have to work at all
id fool around and have a ball

all the things i could do
if i had a little money
its a rich mans world

verse 2
a man like that is hard to find but i cant get him off my mind
aint it sad
and if he happens to be free i bet he wouldnt fancy me
thats too bad
