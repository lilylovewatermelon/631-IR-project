dont tell my love it dont belong
you got no right to do me wrong
if you cant be good be gone

you say one thing and mean another
now its all comin back on you
i trusted your lies for the last time
what makes you do the things you do

if you cant be good be gone
dont tell my love it dont belong
you got no right to do me wrong
if you cant be good be gone

if you dont wanna love me darlin
i dont know what you want me for
take the ring off of your finger
it dont mean nothin anymore

if you cant be good be gone
dont tell my love it dont belong
you got no right to do me wrong
if you cant be good be gone

if you cant be good be gone
dont tell my love it dont belong
you got no right to do me wrong
if you cant be good be gone
