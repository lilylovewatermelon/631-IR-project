my first rifle was a 243
that papa gave daddy and daddy gave to me
and they taught me how to shoot with a steady hand
i guess thats something you dont understand

verse 2
now i grew up on a prison farm
sneakin pulls of shine from a mason jar
used to go fishin out pickle creek dam
but i guess thats somethin you dont understand

chorus
and grandmas in the kitchen
papas done passed on
we sit out on the front porch
just a pickin on a song
and theres blood on the table
cause we work for what we have
and i was raised in this land
i guess thats somethin you dont understand

verse 3
i still fly that southern flag
whistlin dixie loud enough to brag
and i know all the words to simple man
i guess thats somethin you dont understand
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeverse 4
i pledge my allegiance the original way
say merry christmas not happy holidays
i cant change my ways i know who i am
i guess thats somethin you dont understand

chorus
grandmas in the kitchen
papas done passed on
we sit out on the front porch
just a pickin on a song
and theres blood on the table
cause we work for what we have
and i was raised in this land
i guess thats somethin you dont understand

verse 5
theyll grind us up in a big machine
theyll feed us all on the same beliefs
for the dollar and a credit card
but we got a way of doin things
and no bankers gonna steal from me
they wanna tear it all apart

chorus
grandmas in the kitchen
and papas done passed on
we sit out on the front porch
just a pickin on a song
and theres a bible on the table
cause he bled for what we have
and thats the ballad of a southern man
i guess thats somethin you dont understand
