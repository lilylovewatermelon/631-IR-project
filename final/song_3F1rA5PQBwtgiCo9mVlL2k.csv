i was awoken from a dream last night
the climax right before mornings first light
it felt my arms were made of acolyte
it felt my legs frozen in carbonite
but i cant move cause im the sterile man
it terrifies me that there is no plan
the future breaking right on top of me
the waves are washing hope right out of me right out of me

chorus
i know you
i swear ive seen your face before
must be true
i saw it through the open door
something new
an older me i met before
déjà vu

verse 2
now when the vision shows itself to me
kiss mother mary yes i close to see
events unfolding i cant understand
and when i try it falls right through my hands
in relaxation lately i have found
inside the chaos i can hear a sound
inside the chatter a message for me
unless youre quiet you will never see you will never see
you might also likechorus
i know you
i swear ive seen your face before
must be true
i saw it through the open door open
something new
an older me i met before
déjà vu
i know you
i swear ive seen your face before i swear ive seen your face before
must be true must be true
i saw it through the open door saw open
something new
an older me i met before
déjà vu

outro
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh
oohooh
it terrifies me it terrifies me oohembed"
