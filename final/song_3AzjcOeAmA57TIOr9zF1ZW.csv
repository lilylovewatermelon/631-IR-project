common love isnt for us
we created something phenomenal

who needs to go to sleep when i got you next to me

all night ill riot with you
i know you got my back and you know i got you
so come on come on come on come on come on come on

lights out follow the noise
baby keep on dancing like you aint got a choice
so come on come on come on come on come on
lets get physical
