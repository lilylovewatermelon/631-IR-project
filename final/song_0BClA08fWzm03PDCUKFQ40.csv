what if i went down to the pinegrove
and didn’t find anything
what if i went past it
yet nothing in me sang yeah
now i’m behind again
because my bones won’t align that way
some other time yeah
in another life

verse 2
ever since “the archangel
michael killing satan”
i’ve been tryna capture
both ends of the splinter
the visible part between my fingernails
and the part still in my finger
ever since i can remember
since the day before they split
i’ve been tryna capture
some realm i don’t know yet
you and i we’re immiscible
i’ve known it since we laid in the thistles
and in the moments when i’m difficult
you silence me in my revolt
you might also likeoutro
ever since “i”
since the moments when the night limped by
and all of a sudden it was morningtime
morningtime
