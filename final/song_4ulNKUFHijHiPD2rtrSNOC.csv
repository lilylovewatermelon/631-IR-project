drop down on a desert ride
just outside the 95
never felt more more alive
i got my chicas by my side

prechorus
and if we want it we take it
if we need money we make it
nobody knows if we fake it
you like to watch while we shake it
i know were making you thirsty
you want us all in the worst way
but you dont understand
i dont need a man

chorus
me and my girls me and my girls
me and my me and my me and my me and my girls
me and my girls me and my girls
no jodas nosotras
me and my girls
me and my girls

verse 2
the night is dark but the moon is bright
were staring at this summer night
tan skin looks damn good in white
stripping down by the hollywood sign
