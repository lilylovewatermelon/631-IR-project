alone at the edge of a universe humming a tune
for merely dreaming we were snow
a siren sounds like the goddess who promises endless apologies of paradise
and only she can make it right
so things are different tonight
well go together in flight
verse 1
its now and never a reverie endeavor
awaits somnambulant directives to take the helm
believe me darling the stars were made for falling
like melting obelisks as tall as another realm
bridge 1
un ensemble denfants la galaxie sétend
jardin de limagination
combler la lacune voler face à la lune
vois comme nous évoluons

verse 2
it feels like flying but maybe were dying
a cosmic confluence of pyramids hologrammed
she knows you heard her staging music murder
inline before the show began to be where i am

children born of one emotion
our devotions deepest ocean
no division reasoned well be free
to know we are beyond a bow
and lo the hues arrange to show its perfectly clear

verse 3
you look quite divine tonight
here among these vibrant lights
pure delights surround us as we sail
signed yours truly the whale
joy mirages kingdom come
no one left at stake
now that existence is on the wake
lets see what we can make
verse 4
the part is wholly ending
a line in any final song
so long so far
we will be atoning
at last eternal through the past
above a blinding star
verse 5
bye hi sigh hawaii
we never meant to part sublime thy art
one light higher than the sun
invisible to some until its time58embed"
