verse
sip hitech in the dark she said leave it to me ayy
percs really hurt my stomach uh but that’s how i feel free ayy
chasethemoney chasethemoney
i know nothin’ ain’t free i turn that bitch into me ayy
i operate fast cars i sip slow but i really like speed ayy
i drink when i’m on lake shore i know somebody worried bout me uh
i did everything i could do uh i still set it up just to leave
through the week tryna flip my money on friday i still pop beans
this finesse shit still like art that bitch still mean nothing to me
i get a thrill when it slide down the bottle i can’t go back from the better things
and i did it all by myself and you gon’ help me when you leave
another win under my belt that shit still mean nothing to me
get money nigga like my pops that’s another ten hundred on lean ayy
chasethemoney chasethemoney
haha that’s another ten hundred on beans
did it all by myself that bitch still mean nothing to me ayyyou might also likeembed"
