do the fuckin happy dance
even when youre really fuckin mad
i guess that its supposed to subside
even though youre probably really mad
even if youre really really sad
you can probably be worse
just have that sink in for a while
its okay if its not goin your way
it never was
dont believe their hype
its probably all covered in lies
i should take my own advice
even if it hurts its always gonna hurt the same
hurt the same
dance away the pain
its gonna be alright
just do the fuckin dance
even if you started to cry
its okay
everything will be alright
take your time rome wasnt built in a day
its okay its time to dance away your pain
its alright
just do the happy dance
even if youre not alright
its okay
joy inside your pain
thats alright
sometimes pain it just fades
and then youll breathe
just dance
you will be alright
keep dancin
even though youre not alright again
its alright
dance
the sun will eventually shinesee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like1embed"
