verse 1
ever since i was a small boy
no one else compared to you no way
i always thought heroes stayed close
whenever troubled times arose
i didnt know
aint always how it goes

verse 2
every single word you told me
i believed without a question always
to save all of us you told us both to trust
but now i know you only saved yourself

chorus
did you think id never know
never wise up as i grow

instrumental

bridge
and you could store an ocean in the holes
in any of the explanations that you gave
and while you still had time you had a chance
but you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave
you might also likechorus
did you think id never know
never wise up as i grow
did you hope id never doubt
never one day work it out
part ii

verse 3
you were runnin for cover
doin like any other
fallin out with a lover
you didnt know that i suffered
what a thing to discover
if there was time to recover
oneonone with each other
just a boy and a father
what id give for another
everything that i have
wouldnt need this for long
never speak of the time
that you left us alone
me and steve on our own

refrain
i wanna tell you bout the time
wanna tell you bout my life
wanna play you all my songs
learn the words sing along
verse 4
this time wanna tell you bout the time
i know i was in abbey road
or the time that i had
mick jagger on the phone
i thought of you when we spoke

refrain
wanna tell you bout the time
wanna tell you bout my life
wanna play you all my songs
hear your voice sing along

verse 5
this time i wanna say its all right
i know youre just a man after all
and i know you had demons
i got some of my own
i think you passed them along

refrain
wanna tell you bout the time
wanna tell you bout my life
wanna play you all my songs
and hear your voice sing along49embed"
