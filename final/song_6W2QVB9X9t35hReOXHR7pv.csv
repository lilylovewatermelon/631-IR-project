we were wrapped up in a blanket
red wine buzz kickin in
a little sarasota moonlight
driftwood fire burnin
she was on break from ohio state
and i was down there sellin parasail rides
just another summer day
til i strapped her in and watched her fly

chorus
talk about a sunset
all i could see were purples and reds
and her silhouette wavin goodbye
she didnt come there lookin for love
and the cool thing was
neither did i
and neither did i

verse 2
she dipped down in the water
as i slowed down holdin that line
wet tshirt on a two piece
we ditched that boat and hung outside
and we walked ankle deep in ocean
you know that place where footprints disappear
just like that evenin she drove away
itll be burned in my mind for a million years

talk about a sunset
all i could see were purples and reds
and her silhouette wavin goodbye
she didnt come there lookin for love
and the cool thing was
neither did i

talk about a sunset
all i could see were purples and reds
and her silhouette wavin goodbye
she didnt come there lookin for love
and the cool thing was
neither did i
neither did i
