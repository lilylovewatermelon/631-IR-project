ghetto ghetto
ghetto ghetto livin

verse 1
these streets remind me of quicksand
when youre on it youll keep goin down
and theres no one to hold on to
and theres no one to pull you out
you keep on fallin no one can hear you callin
so you end up selfdestructin
on the corner with the toolie on the waist line
just got up out the thing doin state time
teeth marks on my back from the k9
dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘cause they said that i wouldnt make it
i remember like yesterday
holdin on to what god gave me

hook
‘cause thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
and eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto
ghetto thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
and eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto ghetto

no need to cherish luxuries
‘cause everything come and go
even the life that you have is borrowed
‘cause youre not promised tomorrow
so live your life as if every day is gon be your last
once youve moved forward
you cant go back just to remove your past
‘cause you gotta be willin to pray
yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way
yes you gotta be willin to pray
‘cause there gotta be there gotta be a better day
whoever said that the struggle would stop today
a lot a niggas dead or locked away
teenage women growin up with aids

hook
‘cause thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
oh eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto
ghetto thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
oh eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto ghetto
bridge
gun shots every night in the ghetto
crooked cops on sight in the ghetto
everyday is a fight in the ghetto
oh oh oh oh oh ghetto livin
got kids to feed in the ghetto
sellin coke and weed in the ghetto
everyday somebody bleed in the ghetto
oh oh oh oh oh ghetto livin

hook
‘cause thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
oh eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto
ghetto thats the life
when youre livin in the ghetto
oh eatin in the ghetto
oh sleepin in the ghetto ghetto16embed"
