verse 1
handsome tender soft
why do you look right through me
thinking
no i cant deny my feelings
growing strong
i try to keep believing dreaming on
and every time i see you i crave more
i wanna pull you closer closer closer closer
but you leave me feeling frozen

chorus

i can be all you need
wont you please stay with me

choking back emotion
i try to keep on hoping
for a way
a reason for us both to
come in close
i long for you to hold me
like your boyfriend does
and though my dream is
slowly fading
i wanna be the object
object object object
of your passion but its hopeless
