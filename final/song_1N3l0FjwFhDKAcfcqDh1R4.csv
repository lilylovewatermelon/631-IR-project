coco this your season right now

verse
wake up and get straight to that money i cant wait for nothin oh yeah
long as i keep this paper comin they cant take shit from me
eviction letters traumatized me even though its sunny
i know the drought is always coming
god came to see me in my cell he seen my heart was pure
hard to be vegan when you surrounded by carnivores yeah
lions tigers and sharks in they darkest form i seen em in they darkest form
in they darkest form
trapped in the trenches oh trapped in them
so many days so many hours so many minutes
so many niggas aint get to make it its amazing that i made it
how i come out dry it was storming and raining
i brought the maybach through the hood to see they faces yeah
i used to look up to them niggas now they hating its crazy
you knew me since a baby knew me since a child
you know i deserve this life posed to be proud of me
yeah be proud
uh they keep throwing dirt on top my name yeah yeah
all you niggas ought to be ashamed yeah yeah
i could stop this rapping shit today uh
just cant take back the history we made yeah
even though the deck was stacked on me yeah
and the odds was against me
no chance of winning
we still came out better
still came out better youngin yeah
i thought itd be smiles on they faces
tears coming out they eyes
hearing congratulations
but they make it no better
yeah they make it no better oh
