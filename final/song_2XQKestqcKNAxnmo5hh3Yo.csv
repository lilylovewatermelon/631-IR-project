yeah the crazy the wizard
so much whiskey all in my liver
i really like the punch it delivers
makes me warm while i highfive sinners
all alone trying to hide from the shadows
aint no use it seems everywhere they follow
they know where i be at
infect my mind tryna get me

chorus mary j blige  kid cudi
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more no more
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more no more

bridge kid cudi
life is like that
beat me up and ill fight right back
poof poof be gone
i see the devil linger on

yeah the rager the menace
hate me now then hate me when im winning

im tired of motherfuckers saying that they worried bout me
when in fact they probably never gave a fuck about me

chorus mary j blige  kid cudi
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more

beat me up and im fighting right back
poofpoof be gone
i see the devil linger on
yeah i wanna win
as long as i can do the work within
lord let me in
i feel like youre my only friend
chorus mary j blige  kid cudi
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more
these worries are heavy they rest on my shoulders
my pride it wont let me fall victim no more
