are you all ready out where you are
are you all ready out where you are
are you ready out where you are
and im coming for you now ow
nanananana nanananana
nanananana nanananana right now

verse 1 gerard way
i hope youre ready for a firefight
cause the devils got your number tonight
they say were never leaving this place alive
but if we sing these words well never die
get off the ledge and drop the knife
not a victim of a victims life because
this aint a room full of suicides
were believers i believe tonight

chorus gerard way
we can leave this world leave it all behind
we can steal this car if your folks dont mind
we can live forever if youve got the time
nanananana nanananana
if you save yourself tonight
nanananana nanananana
if you save yourself tonight

ill tell you all how the story ends
where the good guys die and the bad guys win who cares
it aint about all the friends you made
but the graffiti they write on your grave
for all of us whove seen the light
salute the dead and lead the fight hail hail who gives a damn if we lose the war
let the walls come down let the engines roar

chorus gerard way
we can leave this world leave it all behind
we can steal this car if your folks dont mind
we can live forever if youve got the time woah
im the only friend that makes you cry
youre a heart attack in black hair dye
so just save yourself and ill hold them back tonight

bridge gerard way
ah
are you all ready where you are at
if you save yourself tonight
cause im coming for you
can you save yourself tonight
right now
cause ill hold them back
chorus gerard way
we can leave this world leave it all behind
we can steal this car if your folks dont mind
we can live forever if youve got the time
you motherfucker woah
youre the broken glass in the morning light
be a burning star if it takes all night
so just save yourself and ill hold them back tonight
nanananana nanananana
if you save yourself tonight
nanananana nanananana
