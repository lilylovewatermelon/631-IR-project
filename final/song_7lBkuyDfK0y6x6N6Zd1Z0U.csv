if i found me somebody who could pay me cash money
a dollar for every beer i ever drank
a 10 for every camel light give me 50 for a fist fight
id have a million dollars in the bank

chorus
well id fish this same ol hole hunt these same ol woods
wouldnt change one thing even if i could
drink these same ol coors wear these same ol boots
be the same ol me lovin the same ol you
be the same road same truck same town
singin the same old song

verse 2
wish i could get a buck for every one of them green head ducks
that ive knocked down in that mississippi mud
and if money grew on trees then i could buy anything
id buy the same ol same old everything

chorus
and id fish this same ol hole hunt these same ol woods
wouldnt change one thing even if i could
drink these same ol coors wear these same ol boots
be the same ol me lovin the same ol you
be the same road same truck same town
singin the same old song
