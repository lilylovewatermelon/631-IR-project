time to put the ear covers on
no

verse 1
born to born to multiply
born to gaze into night skies
all you wants one more saturday

well look here until then
they gonna buy your lifes time
so keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
till the day

prechorus 1
we come in doing cartwheels
we all crawl out by ourselves
and your shape on a dance floor
will have me thinking such filth to gouge my eyes

chorus 1
youll be damned to be one of us girl
faced with the dodos conundrum
i felt like i could just fly
but nothing happened every time i try oohooh
you might also likeverse 2
a duotone on the wall
selfless fool who hoped hed save us all
never dreamt of such sterile hands
you keep em folded in your lap
or raise them up to beg for scraps
you know hes holding you down with the tips of his fingers
just the same

prechorus 2
will you be pulled from the ocean
ajust a minute too late
or changed by a potion
to find a handsome young mate for you to love

chorus 2
youll be damned to pining through the windowpanes
you know youd trade your life for any ordinary joe
well do it now or grow old
your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold

guitar solo

bridge
been alone since you were twentyone
you havent laughed since january
you try and make like this is so much fun
but we know it to be quite contrary
lalalala
chorus 3
dare to be one of us girl
facing the androids conundrum
i felt like i should just cry

but nothing happens every time i take one on the chin
you himmler in your coat you dont know how long ive been
watching the lantern dim
starved of oxygen
so give me your hand and lets jump out the window
