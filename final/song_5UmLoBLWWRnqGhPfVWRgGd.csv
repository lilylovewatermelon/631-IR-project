used to be a major scale
but the melody went stale
musical cacophony let
insy winsy spider free
youre a rich little boy
whos had to work for his toys
youve got all sensibilities oh
of an upper class guy

prechorus
no no im not your little slave
no i dont twist and turn that way
only got bad things to say
youre always asking what is up up with me

chorus
could never tell you what happened
the day i turned seventeen
the rise of a king and the fall of a queen oh
seventeen
seventeen

verse 2
oh you were embarrassed of me
cause i used my tongue freely
bet you wish i couldnt speak cause when i do
you know i tell you why you appear weak
you want a hasslefree life
go get your upper class wife
oh shes got all the personality oh
of a lemon that has been
truly sucked dry
see marina liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus
you teach me how to behave
i felt you question the way
i was brought up as a baby
well you dont know fuck about my family

chorus
could never tell you what happened
the day i turned seventeen
the rise of a king and the fall of a queen oh
seventeen seventeen
no seventeen
oh seventeen
the rise of a king and the fall of a queen oh
seventeen

outro
never fell down like a princess
i used to kid myself in this dress
that it was just how things
were meant to be
oh seventeen
