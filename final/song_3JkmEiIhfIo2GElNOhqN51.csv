nothing is forever nothing will be better
than the love youre giving me
i just gotta have you wish you didnt have to
when you gonna set me free
like it or not we were doomed from the start
i know that youll agree
that nothing is forever nothing would be better better
than you and me and me and me
than you and me and me and me
you and me

verse 1
i take the worst of what you got
it hurts more than sticks and rocks
you know ill be there you know ill be there
and i would be your punching bag
throw it all and dont hold back
still ill be there you know ill be there

cause i used to live in fear it was my home
but there are harder things to be than all alone
youâ€˜re the broken part of me that makes me whole

we dont turn around unless were throwing stones
and were crawling like theres cracks all in my bones
youre the broken part of me that makes me whole
