in the latest midnight hour when the world has gone to sleep
you gotta get up
when doubts begin to rise and the world is at your feet
you gotta get up

chorus
reach
its not as bad as it seems
i cleanse in the river for somebody else
for anyone but myself

postchorus
but myself

verse 2
im not a selfless man im not a man of wealth
if i had all the world probably give it to myself
but the trees begin to walk
and the ground begins to talk by myself

chorus
reach
its not as bad as it seems
i cleanse in the river for somebody else
for anyone but myself

chorus

its not as bad as it seems
love doesnt come til you give it up
