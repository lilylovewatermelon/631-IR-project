i used to tear that town up
used to burn them bars down
used to act all real tough
used to try to show out
i hate to say it but the cops used to know my name
a lot of them daddies sure hated me too
thats the reason my momma prayed
prayed id meet a girl like you

chorus
i could talk the talk in the back of a bar
walk the walk any girl to her car
i could drink the drink to just get drunk
kiss the kiss without falling in love
i did what i did and didnt give a damn
i was who i was now i am who i am
but you wouldnt love the man
if youdve known the boy i was back then

verse 2
i wasnt a good guy
i wasnt a bad guy
but i sure wasnt the guy that youd wanna spend your life with
yeah when i think about those days
all the nights stayed out past two
i aint sorry for the hell i raised
cause hell it led me straight to you

i could talk the talk in the back of a bar
walk the walk any girl to her car
i could drink the drink to just get drunk
kiss the kiss without falling in love
i did what i did and didnt give a damn
i was who i was now i am who i am
but you wouldnt love the man
if youdve known the boy i was back then

bridge
back when
i was a wrecking ball id wreck it all
then i grew up when you made me fall
in love with you

chorus
i could talk the talk in the back of a bar
walk the walk any girl to her car
i could drink the drink to just get drunk
kiss the kiss without falling in love
i did what i did and didnt give a damn
i was who i was now i am who i am
but you wouldnt love the man
if youdve known the boy i was back thenembed"
