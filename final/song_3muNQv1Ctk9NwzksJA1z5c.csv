my story starts the day they said she cant be found
the news so dark heart stopped stood silent without a sound
its over shes finished mother lies with your father and sister too
coldblooded they suffered shot down by the outlaws after you
sorrow swallows my screams

chorus
strength of the world is on my shoulders
strength of the world is on my side
strength of the world the one true beholder
ice in my veins for those wholl die
ive seen my family fade away youve taken my whole life
theres nothing left to say

verse 2
avenge the dead killed all who crossed me in my path
suicidal i never planned on coming back
i want it i need it revenge is dripping from my teeth
need nothing to feel power and bring the killers to their knees
nothing to lose vengeance to gain you know ill never be the same
so taste my breath im close behind you so desperate on your final day
sorrow swallows my screams

chorus
strength of the world is on my shoulders
strength of the world is on my side
strength of the world the one true beholder
ice in my veins for those wholl die
ive seen my family fade away youve taken my whole life
theres nothing left to say
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likebridge
sitting in silence with heaven above me i prayed every night by their graves
while i search for closure i feel it no longer
i cant turn my cheek away
i stand before you ill sin when i have to
but now i leave your side to avenge my familys pride
ive seen my family fade away youve taken my whole life
theres nothing left to say

chorus
strength of the world is on my shoulders
strength of the world is on my side
strength of the world the one true beholder
ice in my veins for those whove died

outro
so far forever now alone a greater punishment on me has been imposed
a killer falling from the light ill miss my family ill never be alright
