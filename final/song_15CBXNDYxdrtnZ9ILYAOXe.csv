oh come on oh come on
oh come on
oh come on oh come on
oh come on

verse 1
this growing old is getting old
i often find myself here thinking
about the birds the boats and past loves
that flew away or started sinking
and its crazy here without you
i used to think this all was ours
wed stay up late debate on how wed find our way
say its all up in the stars

verse 2
some nights i rule the world
with bar lights and pretty girls
but most nights
i stay straight and think about my mom
oh god i miss her so much
and there are people on the street
theyre coming up to me
theyre telling me that they like what i do now
and so i tried my best when i took the fall
to get right back up back in your arms
if youre out here why do i miss you so much
i feel like i had it all
back before i lost it all
now i just wait for you to talk to me
but you wont even look at me baby
you might also likechorus
and id be saying that you
youre always holding on to stars
i think theyre better from afar
cause no one is gonna save us
oh and me
well i have faded in the dark
so dont you ever kiss me
dont you wish on me
why cant you see that no ones gonna save us

bridge
oh come on girl
i just need a helping hand
i close my eyes and think about tomorrow
it never came true it came true
it never came true

chorus
oh and you
youre always holding onto stars
youre always holding onto stars
cause no one is gonna save us

oh and you
youre always holding onto stars
i think theyre better from afar
because no one is gonna save us
oh and me
well i am fading in the dark
so dont you ever kiss me
dont you wish on me
why cant you see that
no ones gonna save us

outro
no ones gonna save us
no ones gonna save me now
no no no no no no
no ones gonna save us
who we are who we are
who you are who you are
youre always holding on to stars
youre always holding on to stars
youre always holding on to stars
youre always holding on to stars13embed"
