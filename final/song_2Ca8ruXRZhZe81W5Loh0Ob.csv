your flowers are withering
your mothers gone insane
your leaves have drifted away

but the clouds are clearing up
and ive come reveling
burning incandescently
like a bastard on the burning sea

youre drifting like a fire
buried deep under the water
youre pressing on your low low
is stepping on my toes

whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and bow
come lay with me on the ground

you competing like mud swings
spastic and bodily
whipping me into a storm
shaking me down to the floor

but you run away from me
and youve left me shimmering
like diamond wedding rings
spinning dizzily down on the floor
you might also likeyoure drifting like a fire
buried deep under the water
youre pressing on your low low
is stepping on my toes

whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and bow
come lay with me on the ground

youre drifting like a fire
buried deep under the water
youre pressing on your low low
is stepping on my toes

whose side are you on
what side is this anyway
put down your sword and bow
come lay with me on the groundembed"
