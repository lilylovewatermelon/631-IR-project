hey there its good to see you again
it never felt right calling this just friends
im happy if youre happy with yourself
take off your shirt your shoes
those skinny jeans i bought for you
were diving in theres nothing left to lose

chorus
im gonna break down these walls i built around myself
i wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
together well move on just dont turn around
let the walls break down

verse 2
i used to wear you like a ball and chain
id run and hide at the call of my name
it was obvious you were too much for me
oblivious i was young and horny
in retrospect i wouldnt do it again
stop talking shit to every one of your friends
im not the same boy you knew back then

chorus
cause i could break down these walls i built around myself
i wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
together well move on just dont turn around
let the walls break
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likebridge
i cant breathe my bodys shaking
youve got a way with the way you take me
cause you break me down
you know you break me down

chorus
im gonna break down these walls i built around myself
i wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
together well move on just dont turn around
let the walls break down
let the walls break down

outro
cause you break me down
let the walls break down1embed"
