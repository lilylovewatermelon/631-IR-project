times before i walked through the valley
below the sun
ive wandered endlessly and waited for
my time to come

chorus
i think im drowning
can someone lend a hand
can someone save me
cause i dont think i can

verse 2
ive gone too far to turn around
its hard to reach for you
when im lying face down
i cant relieve my soul
im lost in a moment
lying face down

prechorus
returning home i find myself
wishing i was already gone
but how long does it take to find me
well im waiting for someone

ive gone too far to turn around

i cant relieve my soul
im lost in a moment

in a moment
