prechorus
dont make me go and get the wraith
im tryna dodge another case
order ace of spades by the case
tell em shoot the nigga in his face
i keep a pack of wolves by the safe
i rob the bank im goin on a chase
i hear the styrofoams are goin crazy
i got my chains on they like lasers
now you gon make me go and get the carbine
and i was tacky back when i was starvin
and i aint lookin back with these fortunes
