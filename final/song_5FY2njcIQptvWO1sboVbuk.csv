i noticed tonight that the world has been turning
while ive been stood here dithering around
though i know i said id wait around till you need me
i have to go i hate to let you down

chorus
but i cant stop now
ive got troubles of my own
cause im short on time
im lonely and im
too tired to talk

verse 2
i noticed tonight that the world has been turning
while ive been stuck here withering away
though i know i said i wouldnt leave you behind
but i have to go it breaks my heart to say

chorus
but i cant stop now
ive got troubles of my own
cause im short on time
im lonely and im
too tired to talk
to no one back home
ive got troubles of my own
and i cant slow down
for no one in town
and i cant stop now
and i cant slow down
for no one in town
and i cant stop now
for no one
