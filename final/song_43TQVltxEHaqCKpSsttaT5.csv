your words to me just a whisper
your face is so unclear
i try to pay attention
your words just disappear

chorus
oh
cause its always raining in my head
oh
forget all the things i should have said

verse 2
so i speak to you in riddles
cause my words get in my way
i smoke the whole thing to my head
and feel it wash away

verse 3
cause i cant take anymore of this
i wanna come apart
or dig myself a little hole
inside your precious heart

chorus
oh
cause its always raining in my head
oh
forget all the things i should have said
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likeverse 4
i am nothing more than
a little boy inside
that cries out for attention
yet i always try to hide

verse 5
cause i talk to you like children
though i dont know how i feel
but i know ill do the right thing
if the right thing is revealed

outro
cause its always raining in my head
forget all the things i should have said7embed"
