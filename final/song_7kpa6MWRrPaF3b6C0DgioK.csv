i hear a voice say dont be so blind
its telling me all these things
that you would probably hide
am i your one and only desire
am i the reason you breathe
or am i the reason you cry

prechorus
always always always always always always
i just cant live without you

chorus
i love you i hate you
i cant get around you
i breathe you i taste you
i cant live without you

i just cant take any more
this life of solitude
i guess that im out the door
and now im done with you
done with you done with you done with you done with you done with you

verse 2

i guess ill pack all my things
i guess ill see you around
its all been bottled up until now
