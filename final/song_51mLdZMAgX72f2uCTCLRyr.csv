i pull out three blunts lit up
then roll some more because i want
haters cant get what they want
they mad cus they cant chill with us
little boy cant come near to us
the pressure is to furious
she say im too dear to her but
i forgot bout who she was
all my niggas pullin up so
deep you cant do nuthin to us
switch it back to me im sitting
back cus they dont bother us
who can say who who i give
no fuck bout him or anyone
bitch come fuck with creaking
and my emotion dont come visit her
