watching my life passing right in front of my eyes
hell of a story or is it boring
cant claim to care never been reluctant to share
passing out pieces of me dont you know nothing comes free

chorus
what mom dont know has taken its toll on me
its all ive seen that cant be wiped clean
its hard to believe what its made of me

verse 2
passing my life living it out with her side
listening closely hearing her mostly
canâ€™t shake concern seems that every time that i turn
im passing out pieces of me dont you know nothing comes free

chorus
what mom dont know has taken its toll on me
its all ive seen that cant be wiped clean
its hard to believe what its made of meyou might also like26embed"
