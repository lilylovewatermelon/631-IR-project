to begin what is ending
if at first you dont succeed
then we just end up pretending
if the dream isnt real
is the lie worth defending
close your eyes
cover your ears
shut your mouth

you can act naïve
but i know youre not stupid

youll wake up when i walk out
isnt that the way it plays
the leaver leaves the stayer stays
you wouldnt make a move so i made mine
isnt it a pity
i wish you were really in it for life
i wish that you were in it for life

what you give is what you get
and what youve gots now next to nothing
cause the life that youve accepted
is the one thats least disruptive
are you aware of the fact
that when i pull theres no pulling back
you have half the mind
half the heart
half the will
you might also likeyou can act naïve
but i know youre not stupid

youll wake up when i walk out
isnt that the way it is
the leaver leaves the stayer stays
you wouldnt make a move so i made mine
isnt it a pity
i wish you were really in it for life
i wish that you were in it for life

some people talk like they cant hear
some people walk but get nowhere
and when im done with the run im going on
im sure ill be
your biggest regret
youll never forget

youll wake up when i walk out
isnt that the way it plays
the leaver leaves the stayer stays
you wouldnt make a move so i made mine
isnt it a pity
i wish you were really in it for life
i wish that you were in it for life
you can run but you cant hide
cause everything youre running from is locked inside
so let it the fuck outembed"
