people who know me know that i love hiphop i fashion myself a metalhead as well ive talked about metal quite a bit but hiphop is my passion i also have a bit of a reputation as a recovering backpacker and tend to talk old school quite a bit i could give you lines from a lot of public enemy im rather proud of the fact that im one of the few people who listen to macklemore who knew who krsone was dont any of you macklemore stans play the whole “but i did” card

while it should come as no surprise that my favorite album is by a veteran of this rap game it will probably shock you that my favorite album of all time is not even 10 years old that whittles down the list quite spectacularly dark fantasy recovery to pimp a butterfly whatever 50 cents last album was well no actually none of those

my favorite album of all time is raekwons only built 4 cuban linx pt ii a mafioso rap classic released in 2009 on emi and iceh2o records it remains one of the few albums ive ever preordered its one of the few hiphop albums you can listen to censored and its still good it spoiled me on toptier lyricism and production it remains to me a gem of a project perfectly encapsulating one mans unending genius

but to understand the brilliance of ob4cl2 you have to understand raekwons career up to that point his work with the wutang clan is pretty well known and respected but his own career has been a little iffier in 95 rae released his debut album only built 4 cuban linx with rzas sampling the awesome guest verses and the immaculate storytelling it changed the game

then shit went south both literally and metaphorically but the formers irrelevant to this history lesson in late 99 rae dropped his anticipated followup immobiliarity it charted incredibly well peaking at 4 on the billboard 200 but fell flat of expectations to this day the critical consensus is a big fat “meh” his next album the lex diamond story wherein he tried recapturing his classic flavor couldnt get either quite right unable to crack even the top 100 with a critical consensus of favorable reviews that still paled in comparison it seemed like things were going bad

at the same time the wus time in the spotlight had started to fade rza and method man maintained public favorability by acting on the side but the rest either faded into the speakers of hiphop heads or the arms of the reaper becoming elder statesmen more than anything else so it was with great excitement that folks heard about raekwons plan to release a sequel to his legendary debut only built 4 cuban linx pt ii in 2005

yeah the album experienced multiple delays not to mention raekwon shifting from one label to another some classic wutang infighting and how much hiphop changed over this period of time it should then come as a rather interesting surprise that ob4cl2 did ob4cl1 numbers so the question becomes how did rae break a career slump that long well lets get into the album

before we do though the following is completely and utterly my opinion you are free to agree or disagree with it and by disagree i of course mean laugh at my pain1embed"
