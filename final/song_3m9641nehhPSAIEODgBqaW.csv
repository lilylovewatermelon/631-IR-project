chorus
i said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
the first time i say no its like i never said yes
its like i never said yes
i said yes we can be together yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight you actin so ungratefully
the first time i say no its like i never said yes
its like i never said yes

verse 1
you was on the wall i was with my crew
you was watchin me baby i was watchin you
slowly you walked over i maintained my cool
you said hello to me i said hello to you
you asked me where im from i asked you what you do
you somehow intrigued me i thought you were so cool
somewhere between hi and goodbye i felt so comfortable
i felt like we could talk all night so i gave my number to you

chorus
i said yes to your number and yes to you dating me
yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
the first time i say no its like i never said yes
its like i never said yes
i said yes we can be together yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight you actin so ungratefully
the first time i say no its like i never said yes
its like i never said yes

why you getting so upset

you are so ungrateful mmmmmm

verse 2
you was at my house i was sittin on my couch
you was really buggin so i told you to get out
i had been misjudging you you had a lot of nerve
you too damn old to be so immature i hope you learn
you said i move too slow i showed you to the door
you said youd call me later i said dont call no more
it is cool if you cant wait for me im glad you let me know
cause you showed me your true face baby the first time i said no

ooh i said yes we can be together yes you can stay with me
but when i say no not tonight you actin so ungratefully
the first time i say no the very first time i say no its like i never said yes
its like i never said yes i never never said yes before
outro

yes we can be together but you gotta wait for me
