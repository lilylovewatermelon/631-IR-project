i got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
fighting was against the rules and it didnt matter why
when dad got home i told that story just like id rehearsed
then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst

chorus
and he said let me tell you a secret about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
he said daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end amen
its a love without end amen

verse 2
when i became a father in the spring of 81
there was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my fathers son
and when i thought my patience had been tested to the end
i took my daddys secret and i passed it on to him

chorus
i said let me tell you a secret about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
i said daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end amen
its a love without end amen

last night i dreamed i died and stood outside those pearly gates
when suddenly i realized there must be some mistake
if they know half the things ive done theyll never let me in
and then somewhere from the other side i heard these words again

chorus
and they said let me tell you a secret about a fathers love
a secret that my daddy said was just between us
you see daddies dont just love their children every now and then
its a love without end amen
its a love without end amen2embed"
