one shot is never enough
i just wait for us to go in circles
a lifetime of giving my all for you
hostile give me a break
dont say its in the bottle of air

prechorus
and first he would tell me im his friend
actually no thanks im okay
and then he would send weird looks my way

chorus
i want new friends but they dont want me
theyre making plans while i watch tv
thought it was you but maybe its me
i want new friends but they dont want me

postchorus
and the 80s song yeah how did it go
when they said this is the beginning of the best years
even though false break

verse 2
one shot is never enough
i just wait for this to go into circles
and the distance from my room is anything so necessary
i was thinking about that thing that you said last night so boring
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeprechorus
and the 80s bands oh where did they go
can we switch into the chorus right now

chorus
i want new friends but they dont want me
they have some fun but then they just leave
is it just them or maybe all me
why my new friends dont seem to want me

postchorus
hurts my case but thats okay
it hurts my case but thats okay
were dancing on a moonbeam
on and on and on and on and on
