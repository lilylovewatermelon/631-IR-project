verse 1
emotions running wild
i could feel it when im next to you
somethings on ya mind
you wanna stay but wont tell me
its a bunch of secrecy
so what are you tryna hide
i know what that look means
you hold my hand so tightly
whenever we say goodbye
standing by the door
i could tell you cant take no more
blow your secret open wide

chorus
so maybe if you say it say it
tell me what it is you like like
baby baby dont be shy shy
maybe you can spend the night night
