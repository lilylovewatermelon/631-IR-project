i am here to make them true dont wander
you dont have to rub a lamp
cause ill take care of you
nobody knows nobody knows

prechorus
tell me what you think im one of your kind
you know a girl like me is difficult to find
i bet youve never seen nothing like this before
i bet youve never met someone who loved you more
you know that im a witch and i can read your mind boy
where do i have to sign im on board

chorus
my new resolution is to trust you
my business to love you until youve had it
im not gonna miss out on the good stuff
the grass is much greener with us on it
