remember the feelings remember the day
my stone heart was breaking my love ran away
this moment i knew i would be someone else
my love turned around and i fell

be my weekend lover but dont be my friend

be my weekend lover but dont be my friend
you can be my bad boy but understand
that i dont need you again
no i dont need you again
