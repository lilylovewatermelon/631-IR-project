you dont have to say
anything that you dont wanna say
hey you dont have to go
we can take it slow
or we can move it alone move it along

we can keep it on the couch
and keep the lights on
naked makin out or keep our clothes on
dont worry bout where its going
if it dead ends or if its headed

up the stairs or down the block
if it last forever until one oclock

it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
if its right then its right
if its wrong then its wrong
lets keep playing the song til its over

if its love if it aint if its only the drinks
and it just hangs around til were sober
it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
til is over
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeso we never really know
which way the winds goin blow
so lets ride it out for a while right here
you can spend the night but you dont have to
i can spend the night just looking at you
here i cannot lie wheres going
if it dead ends or if its headed

upstairs or down the block
if it lasts forever or until three oclock

it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
if its right then its right
if its wrong then its wrong
lets keep playing the song til its over

if its love if it aint if its only the drinks
and it just hangs around til were sober
it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
til is over

lets just let it be
put your hands on me
lets not worry about tomorrow
or the rest of our lives
lets just let it be
put your hands on me
all i know is we gonna be alright
its gonna be alright

it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
if its right then its right
if its wrong then its wrong
lets keep playing the song til its over

if its love if it aint if its only the drinks
and it just hangs around til were sober
it is what it is til it was what it was
let it do what it does til its over
til is over
til is overembed"
