she is the sun she is the queen of love
i am a burden always uncertain
she is a raft only believes in us

and i know that she cries by the red in her eyes
shes been waiting for signs that never come
all she ever really wanted was

one woman one man
thats all that she asks
no other demands
one woman one man yeah

i am a loser i only confuse her
she is the sail no matter where we go
tradition innovates passed down
the way i live is for tonight
oh i wish it wasnt so lord i wish it wasnt so

i know that she cries by the red in her eyes
shes been waiting for signs that never come
all she ever really wanted was

one woman one man
thats all that she asks
no other demands
one woman one man yeah
