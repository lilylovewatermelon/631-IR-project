verse 1
i had five hundred grams and fifty in 58 bags
fohundred benz eight thousand in cash
then the ball dropped gun popped banks got blast
i make it so hot one shotll melt yo ass
got popped up cried til my eyes turned red
then told myself in the mirror nigga you aint dead
im far from eccentric im so psychotic
i dont need you to shoot for me nigga i got it
when you see me in the hood motherfucker dont talk to me
less you wan talk about using the hawk for me
when al blew black away i had him on some stupid shit
then my rap shit worked now im super stupid rich
all i do is stunt now im so maybach
there i go fronting again i meant to say laid back
go head move reckless get banged for your necklace
i serve him with the semi feed him a clip for breakfast

hook
you want some come get some
nigga its murder one when i toss my gun
you might see me let it off you might see me run
but you wont see shit time the police come
huh you want some come get some
nigga its murder one when you see my gun
i just squeeze and squeeze til the whole clip done
you just bleed and bleed til the police come
huh you want some

i got a eighth of dope left half a pound of purple

you wanna be nice to me you wanna shoot dice with me
you want a ace on purpose why you so nervous
nigga we from the same hood we come from the same shit

getting money is necessary see me im a visionary
and im saying that house should be a crack house
now see it how i see it or ill bring the straps out
