some people sleep five to a bed
three at the feet two at the top
so i cant really talk about how they should live
when i know in my heart if it came down to it
id be getting down the same as them
see lord tryna hustle must be something heaven sent
a lot of rent wouldnt be made without this trade
that we call hustlin
this goes out to the cats on the corner
stressin and strugglin just to get a dollar
i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you
this goes out to the girls in the streets
like going all out just so their kids can eat
like i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you
this goes out
i used to be half between
going all out and doings things that i know just wasnt right
and now im looking back
and i think just do it or never did something
but i can tell you that
id probably take a bullet in my head than leave my family unfed
and thats the way it is
this goes out to my homies yeah
this goes out to the cats on the corner
stressin and strugglin just to get a dollar
i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you
this goes out to the girls in the streets
like going all out just so their kids can eat
like i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you

like i welcome the hustle
find the right one take it and bubble
thats on the muscle
i aint giving in im trying to win
and if i gotta get my hands a little dirty
then im sorry for sin
but the fed dont understand aint bred
so brothers gotta learn to bake to make bread
chicks use their ass and shake to make breat
but i understand shorty keep them kids fed
this goes out to my whole 5581 click
i often reminisce when we just dreamed of this
rich cars fine homes girls with nice toes
dime pieces standing in line to show us their thongs
went from riding six deep in a little ass jeep
to cadillac trucks and benzes prowling the streets
we gon ball till we fall
cause we fadin em all
put your glasses in the air this goes out to yall
this goes out to the cats on the corner
stressin and strugglin just to get a dollar
i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you
this goes out to the girls in the streets
like going all out just so their kids can eat
like i aint mad atcha gotta do something
hold your head up cause they cant touch you
