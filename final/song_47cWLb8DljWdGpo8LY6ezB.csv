this song is called dead memories

verse 1
sitting in the dark i cant forget
even now i realize the time ill never get
another story of the bitter pills of fate
i cant go back again i cant go back again
but you asked me to love you and i did
traded my emotions for a contract to commit
and when i got away i only got so far
the other me is dead
i hear his voice inside my head

chorus
and we were never alive
and we wont be born again
but ill never survive
with dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart

verse 2
you told me to love you and i did
tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
so when i got away i only kept my scars
the other me is gone
now i dont know where i belong
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
and we were never alive
and we wont be born again
but ill never survive
with dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart

spoken

dead visions in your name
dead fingers in my veins

dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart
dead memories in my heart oh
dead memories in my heart oh
oh oh whoa
oh oh whoaembed"
