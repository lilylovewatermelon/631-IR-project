let me in your room
ive seen the rest of you
but i know theres something more in your room
im right outside your door
show me things youve never shown before

chorus 1
a few pictures from your past
and those walls you painted black
and the secrets that you keep under your bed
all you have to do is let me in your room

verse 2
you can be yourself
you dont have to hide from me i wont tell
i know everyone youve ever trusted has let you down
and you dont want to come out
and show me show me

chorus 1
a few pictures from your past
and those walls you painted black
and the secrets that you keep under your bed
all you have to do is let me in your room

you know every part of me
i let you in i let you see
all the dark and every color of my room
let me do that for you
and tell me all about your past
why you painted those walls black
baby its all right youre safe in here with me
open up so i can see

chorus 2
a few pictures from your past
and those walls you painted black
and the secrets that you keep under your bed
an unopened letter from your dad
a poster of your favorite band
it dont matter ill take every part of you
all you have to do is let me in your room
let me in your room1embed"
