verse 1
baby we tried to fight it
we all been there some days
thought i needed something else
and acted like i was okay
we just had to work it out
and baby i needed space
aint nobody round here on your level
youre so far away
youre pouring your heart out
im acting like i knew
you held me so down
so down i never grew oh
i tried to find out
when none of them came through
and now im stuck in the middle
and baby had to pull me out oh

ill put the ring on when you ready
we play our fantasies out in real life ways and
no final fantasy can we end these games though
you give me energy make me feel lightweight woo
like the birds of a feather baby woo

when other bitches tryna get with my dude and
when other chickens tryna get in my coop
cause youre a one in a million
