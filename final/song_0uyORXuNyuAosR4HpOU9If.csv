its more of a letter to you
i remember all them nights we spent together
i remember every single i love you
hell youre better off without me
but ill always have you
in my heart and in my memory
and ill keep you there til my days are few

so lay your head down on his pillow
let him hold you tight
cause he didnt hurt you the way i did
and ill just wish i was him tonight

and i heard you took up drinkin
i guess you learned that from me
i was always gonna quit somehow
when i started my family
we were on the verge of that happiness
why did it have to end so soon
doubt ill ever put this on a record
but itll sound just right in a smoke filled room

so lay your head down on his pillow
let him hold you tight
cause he didnt hurt you the way i did
and ill just wish i was him tonight
you might also likei wish i had a chance to go back
and if i did id make it right
but i dont expect you to believe that
after all youre twice shy
and im still standing on the fighting side of time

so lay your head down on his pillow
let him hold you tight
cause he didnt hurt you the way i did
and ill just wish i was him tonightembed"
