we can always talk about
no need to medicate
cause i know youre strong without it
you got me through the days
when i thought i couldnt face it
let me count the ways
the love we have you cant replace it

just hold on im not that strong

theres a little piece of heaven
right here where you are
the fact that you keep trying
is what sets you apart
help me find the reason
and ill help you find the way
to get rid of all your pain
little by little day by day

now youre far away
and im alone to cry about it
its not a better place
when you die and leave me here to say

hold on i was never that strong
you might also liketheres a little piece of heaven
right here where you are
the fact that you keep trying
is what sets you apart
help me find the reason
and ill help you find the way
to get rid of all your pain
little by little day by day

youll get stronger
if you need me im not far away
so just hold on
ill help you find a way
ill help you find the way

theres a little piece of heaven
right here where you are
the fact that you keep trying
is what sets you apart
help me find the reason
and ill help you find the way
to get rid of all your pain
little by little day by day

little by little day by day1embed"
