make sure that you do it at the right time of day
in the middle of the night a moment of grace
as she hits every green light from here to la

your friends blew your cover
as sluts turn to mothers
and the legendary lovers
get sick of one another
as dreams turn to daydreams
and punks learn to behave
don’t worry about me babe
cause i’ll never change
ill never change

here she comes here she comes youd better run

how many platitudes can you say
in the time that it takes for beauty to fade
sedentary fireworks going bad
like pouring out a bottle of gin on a drowning man
shiny new fighter jets getting strafed on the deck
for every insolent bboy who tripped and landed on his neck
untameable stallions that got turned into glue
but don’t worry about me babe
cause i worry about you
yes i do
