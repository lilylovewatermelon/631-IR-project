o soul are you weary and troubled
no light in the darkness you see
theres light for a look at the saviour
and life more abundant and free

chorus
turn you eyes upon jesus
look full in his wonderful face
and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace

verse 2
through death into life everlasting
he passed and we follow him there
over us sin no more hath dominion
for more than conqurors we are

chorus

verse 3
his word shall not fail you he promised
believe him and all will be well
then go to a world that is dying
his perfect salvation to tell

and the things of earth will grow strangely dim
in the light of his glory and grace2embed"
