verse 2 dmx
what we seeing is
the streets the cops the system harassment uhhuh

the lawyers the part they are of the puzzle uhhuh
the release the warning try not to get in trouble damn
the snitches the odds uh probation parole what
the new charge the bail the warrant the hole damn
the cell the bus the ride up north uhhuh
the greens the boots the yard these hearts uh
the fightin the stabbin the pullin the grabbin what
the riot squad with the captain nobody knows what happened what
the two years in a box revenge the plots uh
the twentythree hours thats locked the one hour thats not uh
the silence the dark the mind so fragile aight
the wish that the streets would have took you when they had you damn
the days the months the years despair
one night on my knees here it comes the prayer
