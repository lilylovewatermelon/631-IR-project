if i asked you to trust me on all things
could you do it
if i needed you to map your position
would you try it
your constantly talking about how much you
love me want me need me
you told me stop talking
no more conversation
necessary

chorus
show me x14

verse 2 jill scott
if i needed you to replenish my faith in brothers
could you do it
if i needed you to be cool with my strength
could you do it
your constantly talking about how much you
love me want me need me
you told me stop talking
no more conversation
necessary

chorus
show me x14

your word is love but you push me away
and wont say why
you show me your exterior i need
to see your interior i need
to be absolutely clear wit cha
if we are to ever stand a chance
its the last dance dont you see
show me the warrior youre gonna be


warrior keep fightin i know youre there
keep fightin warrior i know youre there
repeat to endembed"
