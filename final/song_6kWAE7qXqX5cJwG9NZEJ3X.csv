im all alone tonight no stars are shining on me
im thinkin id be alright if somebody would just call me yeah
i know that im not crazy everybody must get this way sometimes
so look around for the people in your life that say

chorus
save me
i need somebodys help here
thought it would be alright
but im not pulling through on my own
is anyone around who can save me
im falling down its crazy
if this is the pain god gave me
im cool with that
but wont somebody save me

verse 2
i guess you missed the signs
but honey i can never blame you
i dont want you feeling guilty
thatd keep you in pain too oooh
now i cant hear you when im far away away
so maybe you could learn from this
and help somebody else someday
cause im human after all
and i could not catch my fall
and nobody ever came around my way o check up on me
and see if i was doing alright
nobody came to save me nobody nobody
