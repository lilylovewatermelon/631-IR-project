here we are
midair off of the cliff
staring down at the end again
but then again maybe were finally on
the road thats headed away from all your complaining
of hearing the same song
but baby well hear it when im gone

chorus
its time to turn on the last song
ohoh
the last song
ohoh

verse 2
what if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
and the sad song ends up being the last song youll ever hear
it was ours
but id do it again holding hands with my friend again
but then again maybe we gave our all
a song well never forget
baby let em play it maybe itll save the world
they gon miss hearing it when its gone

chorus
but its time to turn on the last song
ohoh
the last song
ohoh

what if we left every moment that we could spare
and the perfect song ends up being the last song youll ever hear
youll never know when the songs gonna play
the last song youll hear is the one you made
your song was beautiful
thats why i started singing it
but this song is our song its playing til the end
even if its the last song

chorus
the last song
ohoh
the last song
ohoh

outro
what if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
and the perfect song ends up being the last song youll ever hear3embed"
