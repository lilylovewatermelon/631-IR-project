put away that bullshit big boys they dont cry to their mommas
 shell be back soon
put away your raincoat and make your bed
take another bullet right to your head
now were going on a picnic and well get there soon

and she says maybe its over
he says theres plenty more fish in the sea
i say dont go away from me

now put away your dinner and have a snack
tie your little brother up in a sack now
were moving to the country and well get there soon she says

now pack up all the things that you dont deserve
take another swing well here comes a curve ball
i bet you cant hit it cuz youll swing to soon

and she says maybe its over
he says theres plenty more fish in the sea
i say dont go awaydont go away
please dont go away from me

but can you take it too hard
see five for fighting liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeill never leave

take those damn pictures off of that shelf
put away your mommy you dont need her
i found you a new one shell be here soon

and she saysmy god its over
he saysi found another fish in the sea
i say why me
