rebel for the hell of it hella rich
never have to sell a brick again—must i tell a bitch again
the bullshit im addressing check im on some nextlevel shit
never been fucked in the game im celibate
rarely out my element barely out the ghetto with
one foot out and one foot in intelligent as fellas get
listen lets settle this be clear—
i could fall back seven years still it aint no one ahead of me
consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
fivestar general og veteran
caked like entenmanns blowing that celery
stack that cash like the us treasury
every single thing i ever did was done heavily
rap until youre seventy still aint no catching me
put it on my pops big phil and beverly
be standing on the top still after they bury me
nose in the air so stuckup arrogant
aint got long hot songs best cherish it
cause when i drop mine thats over finito
you payin for your foul like a free throw—bow
now how could a nigga think that he could see me
other than the magazine covers or the tv
know i sold more mixtapes than your cd
youre waiting on your big break praying you could be me
and you aint made it far as dc
on the low i been all around the globe
like a god how they treat me
broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
mouth wide open just begging me to skeetskeet
you in a deep sleep—stop dreaming
im six albums in for ten years i been firing hot semen
the limelights mine im gleaming beaming
ask why i say im king bitch i got my reasons hey

verse 2
where niggas get off piss off yeah
me and mine ought to take time to pop a lid off
shit all over the whereabouts of me
is yall sick in your fuckin mind you figuring ima fizzle
never cooled off tip scorching
minimal injury though they wishing me maximum misfortune
number one hands down flows paint portraits
everybody thinks you stink like horse shit
house full of chicks on some girl next door shit
a king of oneself thirty mil out the store quick
of course this case—lost all my endorsements
tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
but tip bankrupt according to your sources
im still caked up along with more reinforcements
tore shit up from the lobby to the rooftops
officially the hottest nigga rapping since 2pac
fore you rap bout me best ask bout me
im out my fucking mind need counseling
please dont doubt me trust me drama aint nothing
its all fun and games til somebody start busting
limit my discussion when rappers be battling
i find out about it better get to skeedaddling
pack your family bags move em out to seattle and
we ever cross paths youll need ambulance and bandages
live life glamorous so extravagant
mandarin oriental worldwide traveling
hiphop champion for real though
you couldnt fuck with me with a brazil ho nigga
but still though hey hahahaha
