he was just juggin right by the store
then they saw the patrol it was time to roll
saw the patrol it was time to ride
motor runnin on memorial drive
got a country cousin cruisin’ with the blammer
in savannah at the floridageorgia line
got a couple family members in atlanta

they just gon let that beretta fly
cause you niggas buggin spray pesticides
its me and the bros its no extra guys
and they movin weight its no exercise
we could pick a date to come stretch you out
only showin’ muscle when it’s flexin time
you could see the hustle you could recognize
overcame struggle when the devil tried
lemme bear it all when i’m tellin god
