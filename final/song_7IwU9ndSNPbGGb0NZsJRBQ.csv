life it’s a mixture of sunshine and rain
laughter pleasure teardrops and pain
all days can be bright but it’s certainly true
there will never be a cloud that the sunshine couldn’t shine through
so keep on smiling whatever betide you
secure the knowledge that this world is beside you
and you’ll find when you smile your day will be brighter
and all of your burdens will seem so much lighter
for each time you smile you will find it is true
somebody somewhere will smile back at you
there’s nothing on this earth that can make life more worthwhile
then the sunshine and the warmth of a beautiful smile
