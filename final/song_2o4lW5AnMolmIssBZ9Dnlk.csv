girl i finally got you up in the seat of my old truck
and i bet youre wonderin what were gonna do
we could hit the county line hell we do that all the time
tell you what if you dont mind we could start with something new
instead of waiting like we usually do

chorus
it started with a goodnight kiss my lips your lips
baby lets just keep gettin there
it started with a long goodbye get wrapped up tight
lets spend all night right here
it started with a goodnight kiss

verse 2
i know that you told all your friends we were meetin up with them
i can call em all again and tell them we aint coming
let me find a little spot let me throw this thing in park
let me light that little spark that gets you going like you do
just tell me that you want to

chorus
it started with a goodnight kiss my lips your lips
baby lets just keep gettin there
it started with a long goodbye get wrapped up tight
lets spend all night right here
it started with a goodnight kiss
it started with a goodnight kiss
