they say the government mislead the youth youth youth youth
tell em when you went to the park and everybody came back and
and welfare dont mean well for you you you you
what about when you tried to do a side for that but you
they tell me that my bills past due due due due
talk about the charge you got
and preacher man dont always tell the truth truth truth truth
do you believe in god if you dont its cool
segno sza  kendrick lamar
but head is the answer head is the future
dont second guess yourself
dont tell them when you second guess yourself i need you in the kitchen now i forgot
