theres things in my life that ive been missing
the touch of a woman and loving after dark
come here lately with the woman ive been kissing
she comes from kentucky boys and she dont have a heart

chorus
bartender he dont mind he sets em up the same
i aint been sober since its over got no plans to change
i traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
whiskey tears are falling here and each one cries her name

verse 2
i used to be so afraid of dying
i lived every moment for loving her
but when she walked away my heart quit trying
and now im no stranger to hurt

chorus

outro
bartender he dont mind he sets em up the same
whiskey tears are falling here and each one cries her namesee dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeembed"
