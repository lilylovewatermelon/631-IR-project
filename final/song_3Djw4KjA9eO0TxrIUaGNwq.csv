verse 1 jc with chris  all
girl when we started baby we were friends
but thats not how this fairytale is gonna end
see i was thinking that it clicked one day
clicked one day
that no one else has ever made me feel this way
next time i saw you girl i knew i had to try
to tell you everything that ive been feeling deep inside
and listen good cause what i say is from my heart
so if youre ready

chorus jc with all
you see i toss and turn when im alone
and i just cant wait til you get home
waiting for your call
cause tonight were gonna do it all
girl its just the two of us
cause im thinkin bout you day and night
and i just cant get you off my mind
when you get a minute baby i was thinking we could hook up
its just the two of us
the two of us
cause in a room full of people youre the only one around
and nothing in this world could ever bring us down
baby ill be there
telling you i care this i swear
girl its just the two of us

baby i wonder if you feel the same as i do
i wonder if youre going through the things im going through
i sent you flowers on a saturday saturday
insides a letter with a message and no name
see i just love the feeling knowin i can make you smile
and i havent felt that way about someone in quite a while
just listen to these words i have to say ooh ooh
just take a chance take a chance

chorus justin with all
