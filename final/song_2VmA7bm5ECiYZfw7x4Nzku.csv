ive known it for a long time
daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
disappearing all night
i dont wanna know where hes been lying
i know what i wanna do
wanna runaway runaway with you
gonna grab clothes six in the morning go

prechorus
how long you leaving
well dad just dont expect me back this evening
oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
its been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but

chorus
i love him from my skin to my bones
but i dont wanna live in his home
theres nothing to say cause he knows
ill just run away and be on my own

verse 2
ive never seen my dad cry
cold as stone in the kitchen light
ill tell you its about time
but i was raised to keep quiet
this is what im gonna do
gonna run away gonna make that move
gonna grab clothes and when its morning go

how long you leaving
well dad just dont expect me back this evening
oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
its been a long day thumb on side of the roadway but

chorus
i love him from my skin to my bones
but i dont wanna live in his home
theres nothing to say cause he knows
ill just run away and be on my own

bridge
backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
as i packed my clothes up
my dad wasnt down with that plan to attack
intends to show love
i don’t wanna live this way
gonna take my things and go
if things change in a matter of days
i could be persuaded to hold on
mama was the same
none of us are saints i guess that god knows that
i dont wanna run away
and one of these days i might just show that
put my home in a suitcase
tie both shoe laces and hope that
things change but for now ill leave town
with a backpack on my shoulder
chorus
i love him from my skin to my bones
but i dont wanna live in his home
there’s nothing to say cause he knows
ill just run away and be on my own50embed"
