tonight my head is spinning
i need something to pick me up
i’ve tried but nothing is working
i won’t stop i won’t say i’ve had enough

prechorus
tonight i start the fire
tonight i break away

chorus
break away from everybody
break away from everything
if you can’t stand the way this place is
take yourself to higher places

verse 2
at night i feel like a vampire
it’s not right but i just can’t give it up
i’ll try to get myself higher
let’s go we’re going to light it up

tonight we start the fire
tonight we break away
