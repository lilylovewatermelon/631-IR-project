we’ve all been here before
it’s kinda crazy but i need to settle the score
maybe i’m not man enough maybe i can’t compare
the way she lives her life really makes me care

prechorus
lying and conniving insides are dying
why does it have to come to this
lying and conniving i’m tired of tryin
to keep my cool playing the fool

chorus
she doesn’t know she doesn’t know
that she’s hitting too low she’s hitting too low
we want her gone forever its time to let her go
and he doesn’t know he doesn’t know
this is starting to blow starting to blow
if we’re gonna last forever its time to let her go
its not that i want to see him torn
but for a warning this is the calm before the storm
we’ve given her too much of a chance
too much trust too much too fast
i don’t know how much longer i can last

prechorus
lying and conniving i’m tired of fighting
i’m gonna burst at my seems
lying and conniving i’m tired of biting
my wicked tongue i’m not gonna run

we want her gone forever its time to let her go
and he doesn’t know he doesn’t know
this is starting to blow starting to blow
if we’re gonna last forever its time to let her go

bridge
we’ve got to stay together
doesn’t matter on the day’s weather
i know that you love her
but we’re all brothers
can’t let these feelings
stay under the covers

chorus
she doesn’t know she doesn’t know
that she’s hitting too low she’s hitting too low
we want her gone forever its time to let her go
and he doesn’t know he doesn’t know
this is starting to blow starting to blow
if we’re gonna last forever its time to let her go
she doesn’t know she doesn’t know
that she’s hitting too low she’s hitting too low
we want her gone forever its time to let her go1embed"
