i got 99 problems and they all bitches
wish i was jigga man carefree livin
but im not shawn or martin louis
im that cleveland nigga rollin with them brooklyn boys
you knowin how it be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted howd you do it mom huh
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
why he by himself
he got two older brothers one hood one good
an independent older sister kept me fly when she could
but they all didnt see
the little bit of sadness in me
scotty

chorus
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring them to the light for you its only right
this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life

verse 2
im super paranoid like a sixth sense
since my father died i aint been right since
and i tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
split an eighth of shrooms just so i could see the universe
i try and think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they aint the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room
and soon im consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
its all said and done and my cocks been sucked
so now im in the cut alcohol in the wound
my hearts an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancún
where it is never sunny the dark side of the moon
so its more than right i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand fam

ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring em to the light for you its only right
this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life

verse 3
im this close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending would be slittin my throat
ignorance to cope man ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then id prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then id prolly be a jackass
dont give a shit what people talkin bout fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see 30
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred cook when im hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down pussy and some cali tree
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy thats just the saddest lie

chorus
ive got some issues that nobody can see
and all of these emotions are pouring out of me
i bring em to the light for you its only right
this is the soundtrack to my life the soundtrack to my life
outro
to my life to my life to my life
