while truckin down the road of life
although all hope seems gone
i just move on

roxie
when i cant find a single star
to hang my wish upon
i just move on
i move on

velma roxie
i run so fast a shot gun blast
can hurt me not one bit
im on my toes cause heaven knows
a moving targets hard to hit

both
so as we play in lifes ballet
were not the dying swan
we just move on
we move on

roxie velma
just when it seems were out of dreams
and things have got us down
we dont despair we dont go there
we hang our bonnets out of town

so theres no doubt were well cut out
to run lifes marathon
we just move on
we just move on

so fleet of foot
we cant stay put
we just move on
yes we move onembed"
