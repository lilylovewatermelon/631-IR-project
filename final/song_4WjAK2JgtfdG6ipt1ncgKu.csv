verse 1 funny man
yo flood the scene hit the strip get my fix
got some sniffles in the sack run this town like a sprinter on the track
come on lay back to attack in the lac
we aint cutting no slack girl what you know about that
i aint trying to be your lover but i gotta say
that we can keep it undercover when you wanna play
blazed up smoked out out of my mind
we just cruise around my town all the time

chorus danny
when the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
so drink em down cause some things never change
baby sing it loud we aint gonna fuck around
when the sun goes down let me hear you say

if the city never sleeps then fuck it neither will i
you know we keep it thirtydeep and were as high as the sky
you can watch us thirtycreep as we just ride and we ride
you can watch the fiesta drop from one side to side
were breaking the boulevard cause we get it better
if ever you need to find me bitch you can send me a letter
forever drunk and disorderly off this vodka im pouring me
goddamn man i want it all my city of glory

chorus danny
when the sun goes down the stars come out like the ghosts of yesterday
so drink em down cause some things never change
baby sing it loud we aint gonna fuck around
when the sun goes down let me hear you say

the streets you walk give you a reason
cause its all you got and thatll never change
so keep singing that song and we can live forever
pour a little out for the ones who passed away
chorus danny
