protecting you protecting me
i throw the evidence into a trunk and drop it in the sea
lie awake i sleep awake
i sleep with one eye on the bedroom door the other on the cake
protecting me protecting you
carving away our fingerprints out of our fingertips until theyre smooth

chorus 1
lie awake i sleep awake
i sleep with one eye on my royal flush the other on the take
i sleep awake

verse 2
protecting this protecting that
calling a deadbeat with his dead bolt wrapped around his artifact
protecting that
lie awake i sleep awake
i sleep with one hand on my 45 the other round my babys waist

chorus 2
lie awake i sleep awake
i go to bed with all my lights turned on so i dont slip away
i stay awake
out on the street i keep a started car who only waits for me
conveniently

lie awake i sleep awake
lie awake i sleep awake
