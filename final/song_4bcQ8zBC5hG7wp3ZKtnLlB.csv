a twenty dollar bet
adam wont get
his lunchbox back

i took it
an hour ago
hes crying in the snow
ill never let it go

i hope
when adam goes home
he hides it from his mom
he thinks of me alone

and when
were swimming at the y
ill splash him in the eye
ill dunk him til he cries

ill make
a twenty dollar bet
adam wont get
his lunchbox back

i took it
an hour ago
hes crying in the snow
i want him soyou might also likeembed"
