grandma burned the biscuits
nearly took the house down with it
now shes in assisted living
we all knew that day would come
we knew she was too gone to drive
the day she parked on i65
found her on the shoulder crying
she didnt know where she was
its like her mind just quit
oh but bring up grandpa
its like someone flipped a switch

chorus
a front porch light and a blue desota
couple of straws in a cocacola
you can see it all going down
a handsome boy in army green
a tear on his face down on a knee
shaky voice a diamond ring
shell put you in that town
tomorrow she wont remember what she did today
but just ask her about ellsworth kansas 1948

verse 2
she takes out his medals
a cigar box of letters
sits and scatters pictures
black and whites of days gone by
we started losing her when she lost him
but to hear her carry on youd swear shes seventeen again
you might also likechorus
football games and leaves acrackling
walking her home in his letter jacket
you can see it all going down
a perfect night on a front porch glider
saying goodnight for the next three hours
her tired eyes grow wide and bright
when she talks about that town
tomorrow she wont remember what she did today
but just ask her about ellsworth kansas 1948

outro
while the world is fading all around her
sharing a sundae at the counter
hes going on and on about her
bet shes right there right now
tomorrow she wont remember what she did today
but just ask her about ellsworth kansas 19481embed"
