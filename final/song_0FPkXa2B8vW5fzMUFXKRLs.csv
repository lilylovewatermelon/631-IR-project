on the stage of your own life
trailing behind footsteps
theres comfort in ghosts
who are no longer with you
hiding behind your steps

i let you down
youve lost your taste
im losing ground
i fall from grace
well just listen
sometimes

you gotta set free what you love
just to bring it back
would you ever lose me
would you ever let go for that
and if the love is real
you gotta let yourself go
just to bring it back sometimes
just to bring it back

hiding inside my asylum
im always hanging on by a thread
i cant expect you to respect me
until ive learned to respect myself
you might also likei let you down
youve lost your taste
im losing ground
i fall from grace
well just listen
sometimes

you gotta set free what you love
just to bring it back
would you ever lose me
would you ever let go for that
and if the love is real
you gotta let yourself go
just to bring it back sometimes
just to bring it back
the love youre bringing back

i let you down
youve lost your taste
im losing ground
i fall from grace
well just listen
sometimes
sometimes
sometimes
you gotta set free what you love
just to bring it back
would you ever lose me
would you ever let go for that
and if the love is real
you gotta let yourself go
just to bring it back sometimes
just to bring it back
the love youre bringing back

you gotta set free what you love
just to bring it back
would you ever lose me
would you ever let go for that
and if the love is real
you gotta let yourself go
just to bring it back sometimes
just to bring it back
the love youre bringing backembed"
