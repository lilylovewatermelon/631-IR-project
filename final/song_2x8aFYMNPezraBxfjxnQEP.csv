twenty years its breaking you down
now that you understand theres no one around
take a breath just take a seat
youre falling apart and tearing at the seams

chorus
heaven forbid you end up alone and dont know why
hold on tight wait for tomorrow youll be alright

verse 2
its on your face is it on your mind
would you care to build a house of your own
how much longer how long can you wait
its like you wanted to go and give yourself away

chorus
heaven forbid you end up alone and dont know why
hold on tight wait for tomorrow youll be alright
heaven forbid you end up alone and dont know why
hold on tight wait for tomorrow youll be alright
