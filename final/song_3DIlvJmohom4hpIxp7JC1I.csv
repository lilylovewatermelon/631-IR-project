well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from down
well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from

verse 1
man i feel like hell so come on over
be a love machine and i could be your friend
aint no shame feel strong for one another
make a real true color come end to end then
goddamn change of pace
i think youve got a piece of my heart on your face
its a shame to let it waste
how does it taste
how does it taste

verse 2
break it down in pieces make it simple
cause you know damn well that im a simple man
all these things go changing like the weather
and they stay that way until the weather man says
one down gone to waste
i think theres still a piece of that smile on your face
and i would like it erased
there aint no two ways about it no

well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from down
well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from down down down

verse 3
bring it on then gone use a lover
like a cigarette the way that lovers do
one sweet song that starts a little slow and
then goes on and on and makes you want to
move around the room in circles
everybody wants to be you
try to find my place up on the map
of all the men youve been through
dig a little deeper and youll realize
all im building up youre tearing down

chorus
well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from down
well i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from down down down down down down

interlude
outro
all you needed was a crutch
one step away from down
and i could never be your crutch
i could break you down
and i dont want to be the crutch
hey i dont want to be the crutch
no i dont want to be the crutch
one step away from1embed"
