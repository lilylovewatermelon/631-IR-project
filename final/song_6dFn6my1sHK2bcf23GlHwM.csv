i dont need to lie no more

oh no i take it if its mine i dont stay inside the lines
it aint 2009 no more
yeah i know whats behind that door

verse 1
yeah okay you gotta jump in to swim
well the light was dim in this life of sin
now every day i wake up and breathe
i dont have it all but thats alright with me
take it nice and easy took a flight to see me
send you back home with a light thats beamin
the whole team bout to figure it out
we ice cold thats what winter about
and sometimes sometimes i wish i took a simpler route
instead of havin demons thats as big as my house mhmm
have a ball with a dribble and bounce
cause the party aint over til theyre kickin me out yeah
isnt it funny we can make a lot of money
buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
i was yea high and muddy
lookin for what was lookin for me
you might also likechorus
but i dont need to lie no more
nowadays all i do is shine take a breath and ease my mind and
she dont cry no more
she tell me that i get her high cause an angels sposed to fly and
i aint askin why no more
oh no i take it if its mine i dont stay inside the lines
it aint 2009 no more
yeah i know whats behind that door

verse 2
yeah they ask me what im smilin for
well because ive never been this high before
its like i never felt alive before
mhmm id rather have me peace of mind than war
see me and you we aint that different
i struck the fuck out and then i came back swingin
take my time to finish mind my business
a life aint a life til you live it i was diggin me a hole
big enough to bury my soul
weight of the world i gotta carry my own
my own with these arms i can carry you home
im right here when you scared and alone and i aint never in a hurry
you dont ever gotta worry
even when its 730 and the time is runnin low
when your heart get cold
see whats behind all them unturned stones
and im a pro when it come to my job
but really im just tryna start believin in god
now when it gets hard
i dont panic i dont sound the alarm
chorus
because i dont need to lie no more
nowadays all i do is shine take a breath and ease my mind and
she dont cry no more
she tell me that i get her high cause an angels sposed to fly and
i aint askin why no more
oh no i take it if its mine i dont stay inside the lines
it aint 2009 no more
yeah i know whats behind that door
i dont need to lie no more
nowadays all i do is shine take a breath and ease my mind and
she dont cry no more
she tell me that i get her high cause an angels sposed to fly and
i aint askin why no more
oh no i take it if its mine i dont stay inside the lines
it aint 2009 no more
yeah i know whats behind that door80embed"
