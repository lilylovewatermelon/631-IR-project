well its been building up inside of me
for oh i dont know how long
i dont know why but i keep thinking
somethings bound to go wrong
but she looks in my eyes
and makes me realize

chorus
when she says dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby
everything will turn out alright dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby

verse 2
i guess i shouldve kept my mouth shut
when i started to brag about my car
but i cant back down now because
i pushed the other guys too far
she makes me come alive
and makes me wanna drive

chorus
when she says dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby
everything will turn out alright dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby

she told me baby when you race today
just take along my love with you
and if you knew how much i loved you baby
nothing could go wrong with you
oh what she does to me
when she makes love to me

chorus
and she says dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby
everything will turn out alright dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby
everything will turn out alright dont worry baby
dont worry baby dont worry baby
