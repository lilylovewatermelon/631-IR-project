friday monday comes around

verse 1
shes a girl with the weight of the world on her big brown eyes
shes a girl whos been talking to herself to apologize
shell never do it again she promised
but then she hasnt been all that honest
can she trust herself to be herself
or is she talking to herself again

chorus
hey friday what you gonna do now
when monday comes around
hey friday what you gonna do now
when monday comes around

postchorus
when monday comes around comes around
when monday comes around

verse 2
monday comes wondering
where do you run to find a second start
where do you go when youre broke and alone
and friday falls apart
all these questions are leaving her shaking
can you be two girls in one
can your heart bend this much without breaking
you know that you know
and you can never have it both ways

hey friday what you gonna do now
when monday comes around
hey friday what you gonna do now
when monday comes around

when monday comes around comes around
when monday comes around come around
when monday comes around

bridge
dont take it easy
dont take it easy
who says everybodys giving and taking giving and taking
everybodys taking away

friday monday comes around
friday monday comes around
friday monday comes around
friday monday comes around
friday monday comes around
