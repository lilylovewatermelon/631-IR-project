verse 1
oh long days what i know hard work pays
so the money getting long too
and the kush smell strong too
that’s that good any chick with me she the bomb too
one thing i know is go hard young make fake niggas notice
blowing money ‘cause you dying if you don’t live
that’s how you know i was fly when i wrote this
first class tags or maybe i’m the first ‘cause of my first class swag
used to say that i was trippin’ so a nigga bought expensiveass bags

i don’t wanna wake up from dont wanna wake up from

go hard young go hard
they let you in the game better play your part
go hard young go hard
and if you in the game might as well play smart
‘cause i’ve seen niggas fold like paper

got money minor league turn major
got money white people turn neighbors
need a girl teach her how to roll papers six months three whips all player
run my town like the mayor i run my town bitch i’m like the mayor
