for a long time i was in love
not only in love i was obsessed
with a friendship that no one else could touch
it didnt work out im covered in shells

chorus
and all i wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life
and all i needed was a simple man
so i could be a wife

verse 2
im so ashamed ive been so mean
i dont know how it got to this point
i always was the one with all the love
you came along im hunting you down

chorus
like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
and all i wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life

bridge
if we met tomorrow for the very first time
would it start all over again
would i try to make you mine
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likeverse 4
i always thought id be a mom
sometimes i wish for a mistake
the longer that i wait the more selfish that i get
you seem like youd be a good dad

chorus
now all those simple things
are simply too complicated for my life
howd i get so faithful to my freedom
a selfish kind of life
when all i ever wanted was the simple things
a simple kind of life

outro
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life
a simple kind of life7embed"
