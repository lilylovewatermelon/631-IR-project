girl you melt me like ice in whiskey
with those blue flame looks that you give me
you cant hide whats inside
and its killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

chorus
why should we go round and round the truth like weve been doin
every time we lie girl were losin
so why should we spend saturday night alone
when i can call you on the phone pick you up
make it up as we go along
pull an all nighter chasin that desire
sparks flyin in her eyes like lighters like lighters
get a little higher get a little higher
sippin on fire sippin on fire

verse 2
you act like you dont know what youre missin
every time you end up back with him
cause its safe and youre scared
of everything youre feelin when were burnin the midnight down again

chorus
why should we go round and round the truth like weve been doin
every time we lie girl were losin
so why should we spend saturday night alone
when i can call you on the phone pick you up
make it up as we go along
pull an all nighter chasin that desire
sparks flyin in her eyes like lighters like lighters
get a little higher get a little higher
sippin on fire sippin on fire
you might also likebridge
every goodbye is bittersweet
so why should we fight what we both need

chorus
and why should we go round and round the truth like weve been doin
every time we lie girl were losin
so why should we spend saturday night alone
when i can call you on the phone pick you up
make it up as we go along
pull an all nighter chasin that desire
sparks flyin in her eyes like lighters like lighters
get a little higher get a little higher
sippin on fire sippin on fire

outro
girl you melt me like ice in whiskey
with those blue flame looks that you give me
you cant hide whats inside
and its killin me right now to see you wanna slip off with me15embed"
