why dont you tell me what shes got on me
i find it hard to believe that anyone will love you as great as me
i miss all yo passion wake me out of my sleep
banging on my door at a quarter to three
you play it safe so i guess you go with her
without societys outlook on me bet you choose me first
no im not the type of girl you bring to mom
but weve got a special bond
you aint the type of guy i bring to my dad
but theres nowhere else id rather be
than with you yeah than with you

chorus
you run the streets you gettin cash
you livin life you spend it fast
i say you run the streets you gettin cash
you livin life and you spend it fast
just like me just like me
hey why cant we just be bad together oh yeah

verse 2
tats on my face and you say youre ashamed
but deep down i know you love it you love
the spark that i bring the way that i sing you love it oh
i wear all black and you do the same
you do your drugs and i have my ways
i am a reflection of you
so your playin safe so you go with her
well guess youll be bored for the rest of eternity
i know you love me and you know you do
so thats when you call and tell me its true
