the time has finally come you get a mouth full
you only act on greed and by your actions this is proof
and cant you see the flowers dying all around you
got your hands in the devils pockets got everything to lose

prechorus
and so you lash out to crush the ones below
all the ones that you fear most
and you call this crowd control
well let me break it down for you

chorus
the fire in your veins is just a joke you tell yourself
another way to cut the cost hide your face from all the guilt
and its a shame to have to say you had to kill to gain control
but at least you made some money hey let the good times roll

verse 2
its your dream to be the king of all creation
as far as im concerned youve hung your shadow on the wall
and though your fingers never really pulled the trigger
your hands are just as guilty youre the one who brought the blood

prechorus
and can you lash out to hush the ones who know
cause theyre the ones that you fear most
and its called damage control
well let me break it down for you

the fire in your veins is just a joke you tell yourself
another way to cut the cost hide your face from all the guilt
and its a shame to have to say you had to kill to gain control
but at least you made some money hey let the good times roll

verse 3
oh my the greed has now consumed you
your eyes fade as you fall into the ocean
you move fast to feed your lust for money
you dive down now youre caught in the commotion

verse 4
all this and you traded it for nothing
a cheap lie you put it in your pocket
all this yeah you traded it for nothing
oh my i can see your heart has met its end
