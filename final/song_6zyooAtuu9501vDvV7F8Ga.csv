gary now i know i was wrong
i messed up and now youre gone
gary im sorry i neglected you oh i never expected you
to run away and leave me feeling this empty
your meow right now would sound like music to me
please come home cause i miss you gary

chorus
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home

verse 2
gary cant you see that i was blind
ill do anything to change your mind
more than a pet youre my best friend
too cool to forget come back cause we are family
and forgive me for making you wanna roam
and now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome
somewhere i hope youre reading my latest threeword poem
gary come home

chorus
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home
gary come home
ah gary come home
gary come home
gary wont you come homeyou might also like27embed"
