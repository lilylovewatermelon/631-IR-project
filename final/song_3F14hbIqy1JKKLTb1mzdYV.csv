rahhnnn fuckin brains brawn and brass balls
i cut em off and got em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton johns name on my drag wall
im out the closet ive been lyin my ass off
all this time me and dre been fuckin with hats off
suck it marshall so tell laura and her husband to back off
fore i push this motherfuckin button and blast off
and launch one of these russians and thats all
blow every fuckin thing except afghanistan on the map off

verse 3 eminem
my songs can make you cry take you by surprise
at the same time can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme see what youre seein
is a genius at work which to me isnt work
so its easy to misinterpret it at first ‘cause when i speak
its tongueincheek id yank my fuckin teeth
before id ever bite my tongue id slice my gums
get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ices son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r kelly as soon as bump and grind comes on
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade
standin on ronnies grave screamin at the sky
til clouds gather its clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and thats pretty much the gist of it
parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers
i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither
hook eminem  hailie jade
theres really nothin else to say i i cant explain it
i think my dads gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont you tell em maybe
i think my dads gone crazy
theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dads gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie
i think my dads gone crazy crazy

outro eminem  hailie jade
