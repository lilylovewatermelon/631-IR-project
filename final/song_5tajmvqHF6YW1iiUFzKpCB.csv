before she even falls asleep
i got one foot out the door one foot out the door
i think she said her name but i was wasted
i dont care anymore one foot out the door

pre chorus
night after night day after day
jack and coke smokin on the fire escape
is it too soon or is it too late

chorus
am i crazy to think that i could be in love
when it all ends up it all ends up wasted
id give you my heart but id just fuck it up
and wed end up wed end up wasted

verse 2
trying to numb the pain away
i know how to leave but not to stay
i wonder if i will ever find someone to fill me up inside
someone to kiss my fears away
if i believed in god id pray to god id pray
