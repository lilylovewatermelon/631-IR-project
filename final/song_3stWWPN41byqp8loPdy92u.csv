you always go to the parties
to pluck the feathers off all the birds
on your knees
i would not beg you please
i want your picture but not your words
you know theyâ€™d want it but theres no first
on your own
but you cannot call it your home

instrumental

verse 2
we always rub our hands too much
we know the reasons but such and such
on your own
you will not catch your own bone
we run our fingers together
you know its easy the devils plan
on your own
you cannot call me your own

chorus
jack of all trades
master of none
cry all the time
cause im not having fun

you always want to be forgiven
the devil does what you ask of him
on your knees
you cannot you are not for free17embed"
