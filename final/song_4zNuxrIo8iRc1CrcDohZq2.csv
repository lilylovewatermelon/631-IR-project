he was there when i started in knoxville tennessee
opening for patty loveless november of 93
full of friends mom and uncle butch
and the crowd was really small
hed say i was a scared kid if this bus could talk

verse 1
some nights wed dance with the devil
some nights wed pray to the lord
between vibrant passes and margarita glasses
he was never really bored
we were starry eyed dreamers bouncing off the wall
and all the stories he could tell if this bus could talk

chorus
hed seen pool halls in texas
and every corndog county fair
girls that wed make cry some crowds that didnt care
when bobby rolled us down in bama
he kept rocking through it all
all the stories he could tell
if this bus could talk

verse 2
late night conversations full of drunk philosophy
on politics and religion football and family
the lovers that we missed and the lovers that we lost
all the secrets he could share if this bus could talk
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
hed seen virginia beach caught in a hurricane
heroes i wish i never met but he aint naming names
we learned the code of the road at the grizzly rose
then we had a ball
all the stories he could tell
if this bus could talk

verse 3
many years of summers and i hope it never ends
been down so many highways full of twists and turns and bends
we caught lightning in a bottle somehow we survived it all
all the stories he could tell if this bus could talk

outro
as i leave the stage still high from your applause
hed tell you that i love you
if this bus could talk
if this bus could talk
if this bus could talk
if this bus could talkembed"
