with all the noise above
he tried to call his name
the trial would go on
the day has just begun

chorus
living in an empty world
living in an empty world
living in an empty world
living in an empty world

verse 2
the diamond cuts her eye
the crowd behind went wild
they werent all that proud
by now they hear it loud

chorus
living in an empty world
living in an empty world
living in an empty world
living in an empty world

outro

i was out late last night
empty love
empty love
