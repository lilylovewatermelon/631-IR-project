it was a long long way from here
i was old enough to want it
but younger than i wanted to be
suddenly my mission was clear

so for a while i conducted experiments
and i was amazed by the things i learned
from the fine fine girl with nothing but good intentions
and a bad tendency to get burned

ah all about chemistry
wont you show me everything you know
ah wonder what you do to me ohohohohoh oh

some time later i met a young graduate
when i had nobody to call my own
i told her i was looking for somebody to appreciate
and i just couldnt do it alone

so for awhile we conducted experiments
in an apartment by the river road
and we found out that the two things we put together
had a bad tendency to explode

ah all about chemistry
wont you show me everything youve learned
ill memorize everything you do to me so i can
teach it when it comes my turn

sweet pacific scenes through
the windows of airplanes and hotel rooms

so when i find myself alone and unworthy
i think about all of the things ive learned
from the fine fine women with nothing but good intentions
and a bad tendency to get burned

ah all about chemistry
wont you show me everything you know
ah wonder what you do to me ohohohohoh oh

ah all about chemistry
wont you show me everything youve learned
ill memorize everything you do to me
so i can teach it when it comes my turn

its all about chemistry california waves
its all about chemistry ohohohohoh oh
its all about chemistry sweet pacific scenes
its all about chemistry ohohohohoh oh2embed"
