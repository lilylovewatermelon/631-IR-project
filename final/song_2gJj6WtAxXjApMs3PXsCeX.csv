remember when david dashed a twelvepack
of budweiser heavy for the road
two kids in the back drunk off their ass
screamin in an old bronco

chorus
and i recall what she said
that she wanted me dead
there aint no grave deep enough
remember all the nights we had
you said it aint so bad
just keep those heavy eyes lookin up

verse 2
remember when mary brought her own jane
lucas thought he was gonna die
cause stars started fallin out a night cloud
from a clear midwestern sky

chorus
i recall what she said
screamin that the skys red
its burned into a younger mans mind
remember all the days we had
i say it aint so bad
keep those heavy eyes soft and kind

oh when im old i will recall
all the nights we spent outlaws
its gettin cold but that sun is crestin
and heavy eyes aint born for restin

instrumental break

bridge
whos gonna drive us home the boys and me
our walkin staggered vision blurred
one thing youll come to know the boys back home
live for things like dead mans curve

chorus
i recall what he said
hed rather be gone and dead
than living like those sad folks in town
i cant take this soul with me
if i go im goin quickly
keep those heavy eyes free and proud

postchorus
oh when im old i will recall
all the nights we spent outlaws
its gettin cold but that sun is crestin
and heavy eyes aint born for restin
instrumental break

oh when im old i will recall
all the nights we spent outlaws
its gettin cold but that sun is crestin
and heavy eyes aint born for restinembed"
