if i was your car
id turn you round
if i was your radio
id play our song right now
if i was your memory of me
id keep runnin runnin
til your fingers started thumbin
through your phone
and tell me that youre comin home

chorus
if i was your bartender
id mix em up strong in a tall blender
til the last ones gone
yeah id play every heartbreak song
on the jukebox til your tear drops
they fell on that bar top
keep you drinkin get you thinkin
im right where you need to be
if i was your bartender
id talk you out of leavin me

verse 2
if i was your bible

if i was your bed
