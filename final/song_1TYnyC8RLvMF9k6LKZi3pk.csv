teach me to fall and ill teach you to sing
when life keeps stealing your melody
around your finger ill be a string
i will forget everything i know
about love
i dont know about love
sure feels good at first

verse 2
ill learn to dance if you promise not to laugh
and i end up in a cast
from falling over
and you cant get mad when some girl you think i have
puts a story in your head
when i hardly know her
so about love
i dont know about love
sure feels good at first

chorus 1
ooh every spring theres a honey bee that stings
so things can change
ooh every fire get too close and it reminds you
things can change in love
but it sure feels good at first
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeverse 3
for every heartbreak theres a sermon to be said
and this pastor in my hands preaching to the choir
dont get me wrong cause its too soon to decide
but this aint my first rodeo
when my hearts been roped and tied
in love i dont know about love
but it sure feels good at first

chorus 2
ooh every autumn colors come that youve forgotten
so things can change
ooh every frost some live on and some are lost
so things can change in love
but it sure feels good at first

outro
na nanana nananana nanana
mmmmmmmmm
na nanana nananana nanana
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
but it sure felt good at firstembed"
