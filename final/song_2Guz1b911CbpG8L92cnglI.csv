when i see your smile
tears run down my face
i cant replace
and now that im stronger i have figured out
how this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
and i know ill find deep inside me
i can be the one

chorus
i will never let you fall
ill stand up with you forever
ill be there for you through it all
even if saving you sends me into heaven

postchorus
its okay its okay its okay

verse 2
seasons are changing
and waves are crashing
and stars are falling all for us
days grow longer and nights grow shorter
i can show you ill be the one

chorus
i will never let you fall
ill stand up with you forever
ill be there for you through it all
even if saving you sends me into heaven
