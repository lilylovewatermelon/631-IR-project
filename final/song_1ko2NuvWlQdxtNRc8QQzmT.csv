verse 1 kanye west
if my manager insults me again
i will be assaulting him
after i fuck the manager up
then im gonna shorten the register up
lets go back back to the gap
look at my check—wasnt no scratch
so if i stole wasnt my fault
yeah i stole—never got caught
they take me to the back and pat me
asking me about some khakis
but let some black people walk in
i bet you they show off their token blackie
oh now they love kanye
lets put him all in the front of the store
so im on break
next to the no smoking sign with a blunt in the mall
taking my hits writing my hits
writing my rhymes playing my mind
this fucking job cant help him
so i quit yall welcome
yall dont know my struggle
yall cant match my hustle
you cant catch my hustle
you cant fathom my love dude
lock yourself in a room
doing five beats a day for three summers
thats a different world like cree summers
i deserve to do these numbers
the kid that made that deserves that maybach
so many records in my basement
im just waitin on my spaceship blaow

i member having to take the dollar cab
coming home real late at night
standing on my feet all damn day
tryna make this thing right
and havin one of my coworkers say yo you look just like
this kid i seen in an old busta rhymes video the other night
well easy come easy go how that saying goes
no more broad service cars and them tv shows
that all had got snatched from me ars and they faculties
all turn their back on me and didnt wanna hear a rap from me
so naturally actually had to face things factually
had to be a catastrophe empty fridge is staring back at me
cause nothings there nothings fair
i dont wanna ever go back there
so i wont be taking no days off til my spaceship takes off bow
