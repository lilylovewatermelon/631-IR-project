its times like these wish i had a time machine
so i could see what you did october 13th
at 1015 were you really asleep
were you lyin to me and the family
theres no us in us when im lackin trust
you wanna discuss ugh you disgust me
dont make me cuss you out whyd you let me down
dont say sorry now
and thanks to you i i cant love right
i get nice guys and villainize them
read their texts like theyre havin sex right now
scared ill find out that its true
and if i do then i blame you
for every worst that i assume
when im fortyfive someone calls me their wife
and he fucks our lives in one selfish night
dont think ill find forgiveness as fast as mom did
and god i love you but youre such a dipshit
please fuckin fix this
cause you were all i looked up to
now i cant even look at you

outro
you too
i mean as they say in chicago
he had it cominyou might also like10embed"
