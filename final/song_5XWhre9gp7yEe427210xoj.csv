ive been throwing stones waiting by the river
ive been on my own praying like a sinner
and youve been gone too long
im waiting out the winter
and ive been on my knees praying like
praying like a sinner

verse 1
well you built a city right in me
and brick by brick and piece by piece
and love in both your hands
tried to make an honest man
from when i woke until i went to sleep
you planned my life so carefully
sculpted me like clay i can see you in my face
and i never thought id live this life without your guiding light

chorus
ive been throwing stones waiting by the river
ive been on my own praying like a sinner
and youve been gone too long
im waiting out the winter
and ive been on my knees praying like
praying like a sinner

and i heard the walls are paper thin
from where you are to where i am
but i dont feel a thing
if you all keep pulling strings
send on a down a message please
light a bulb or haunt my dreams
id just like to know that you hear me that youre close
and i never thought id live this life without your guiding light

chorus
ive been throwing stones waiting by the river
ive been on my own praying like a sinner
and youve been gone too long
im waiting out the winter
and ive been on my knees praying like
praying like a sinner

bridge
youve been gone for too long oh oh
youve been gone for too long oh oh

ive been throwing stones waiting by the river
ive been on my own praying like a sinner
and youve been gone too long
