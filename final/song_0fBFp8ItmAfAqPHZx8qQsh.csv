no i dont need your alibi
you say im wrong yeah show ya right
we kiss we hug we fuss and fight
we laugh make up then we go all night
its such a thrill to love you and its real
roller coaster of emotions we feel
its such a thrill to love you and its real
roller coaster of emotions we feel

sometimes i hate you
sometimes you kill
my mood but i still

perfect for each other yeah were both insane

roller coaster of emotions we feel
