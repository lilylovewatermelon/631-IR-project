i feel it in my bones even when im alone
mama said i told you so going down a different road
you call me late at night i pick up every time
wish that i could rewind get some peace of mind

prechorus
shut up dont wanna hear it now im fed up
wish i could say it was enough oh to make me walk away
and im messed up cause every time i start to get up
and now my head feels fucked up and i know it wont change

chorus
the things you do
only make me want to get closer to you
and the things that you say
only make me want to stay

verse 2
cant push me away im not going ill wait
you know this street runs two ways say
so i need to hear your voice
know im standing here by choice
and i cant hear the background noise anyway

prechorus
shut up dont wanna hear it now im fed up
wish i could say it was enough oh to make me walk away
and im messed up cause every time i start to get up
and now my head feels fucked up and i know it wont change
