verse 1 kendrick lamar
i am not for the faint of heart
my genetic build can build multiuniverses the man of god
playin baby shark with my daughter
watchin for sharks outside at the same time
life as a protective father id kill for her
my son enoch is the part two
when i expire my childrenll make higher valleys
in this present moment i saw that through
ask whitney about my lust addiction
text messagin bitches got my thumbs hurt
set precedent for a new sacrilegion
writers block for two years nothin moved me
asked god to speak through me thats what you hearin now
the voice of yours truly
teleport out my own body for comfort
i dont pass judgment past life regressions keep me in question
where did i come from i dont think like i used to
no i dont blink like i used to
awkward stares at everybody see the flesh of man
but still this man compared to nobody
yesterday i prayed to the flowers and trees
gratification to the powers that be
synchronization with my energy chakras the ghost of dr sebi
paid it forward cleaned out my toxins bacteria heavy
sciatica nerve pinch i dont know how to feel
like the first time i fucked a white bitch
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likeverse 2 kendrick lamar
the first time i fucked a white bitch
i was sixteen at the palisades
fumblin my grades i traveled with the team
the apache life centennial was like
when mrs baker screamed at doughboy
mixed that with purple rain
they interchanged the scenes
happy just to be out the hood
with all the wealthy kids
credit cards and family plans
she drove her daddys benz
i found out that he was a sheriff
that was a winwin
because he had locked up uncle perry
she paid her daddys sins
next time i fucked a white bitch
was out in copenhagen
​good kid maad city tour
i flourished on them stages
whitney asked did i have a problem
i said i might be racist
ancestors watchin me fuck was like retaliation

im a killer hes a killer shes a killer bitch
we some killers walkin zombies tryna scratch that itch

verse 3 kendrick lamar
eight billion people on earth silent murderers
nonprofits preachers and church crooks and burglars woo
hollywood corporate in school teachin philosophies
you either gon be dead or in jail killer psychology
silent murderer whats your body count who your sponsorship
objectified so many bitches i killed their confidence what the—
the medias the new religion you killed the consciousness what the fuck
your jealousy is way too pretentious you killed accomplishments what the fuck
niggas killed freedom of speech everyone sensitive what the fuck
if your opinion fuck round and leak might as well send your will what the—
the industry has killed the creators ill be the first to say what the fuck
to each exec im saving your children—we cant negotiate what the—
i caught a couple of bodies myself slid my community
my last christmas toy drive in compton handed out eulogies
not because the rags in the park had red gradient
but because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin
so whats the difference tween your life when hiding motives
more fatalities and reality bring you closure
the noble person that goes to work and pray like they posed to
slaughter people too your murders just a bit slower
chorus kendrick lamar
im a killer hes a killer shes a killer bitch what the fuck
we some killers walkin zombies tryna scratch that itch what the—
germophobic hetero and homophobic
photoshoppin lies and motives
