take my state o mind
fool me with a cheap surprise
gets me every time
please take a second to wash away the pride
dont even leave me with an emptiness inside

i am nothin

under the ocean lies my bitterness
lies my bitterness
sea of desperation leaves no evidence
leaves no evidence
give me the bottle
filled with turpentine
filled with turpentine
take me from this hell i have
and leave this world behind

i am nothin

see me fade away
watch me disappear
lost without a trace
im everything i fear
can anyone find a way
to help me
cause im nothing but a shadow
you might also likei feel so wounded
kick me when im down
i search the dirt below
and look at what i found

i i am nothin

see me fade away
watch me disappear
lost without a trace
im everything i fear
can anyone find a way
to help me
cause im nothin but a shadow
cause im nothin but a shadow
