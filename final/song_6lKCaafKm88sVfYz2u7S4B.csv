verse 1
i hate rich niggas god damn it
cause i aint never had a lot damn it
who you had to kill who you had to rob who you had to fuck
just to make it to the top damn it
or maybe thats daddy money escalator no ladder money
escalade new caddy money
worst fear  goin broke cause im bad with money
crooked smile nigga momma never had the money damn
i aint trippin
nigga jordan i aint pippen yeah
up the steps i aint slippin tears
blood sweat and i aint crippin heres
a song you can sing along wit
when you down on some let you know you aint alone shit
when your momma aint at home cause she got a second job
deliverin pizzas you think she out there gettin robbed
please god watch her i know how niggas do
half cracker but a nigga too
talkin all that shit bout your steppops
how he was a dog now look at you
i aint bad as that nigga plus dawg
im a grown man now i aint mad at that nigga
but if a plane crashed and it only killed his lame ass
id be glad its that nigga nigga
did kay dirty now its back to broke
refund checks used that to float
momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
on crack use that to cope
make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
writin rhymes try and bring back the hope
tried to ride the storm out and crashed the boat
coulda drowned but i grabbed the rope

verse 2
i hate rich niggas god damn it
cause i aint never had a lot damn it
niggas cant front on the flows you got
but ery fuckin verse how much dough you got
homie dont quit now
hear my shit you try switch now
know you felt the shit just now
know you felt the shit just now ha
aint there more to you
dont it ever get borin to you
i realize deep down you a coward gettin high off of power
fuck it more to you saw through you
and it made me ashamed that i played the game
not for mo money like damon wayans
wanted the respect but it came with fame
i just wanted love but this aint the same
i took a train down memory lane and watched lil jermaine
do his thang before he made a name
its like sony signed basquiat he gave it all he got
and now the nigga dont paint the same damn
i guess he cant complain
all the money that be rainin in
spend a hundred thou for the chain again
think of oldschool niggas like dana dane
prolly kill for another claim to fame my brain just sayin
yeah nigga least he aint insane
least he aint insane
you aint crazy mafucker you just fraid of change ayy
thats new
maybe thats true
but listen here i got a bigger fear
one day that i become you when i become lost
and i become heartless
and numb from all the m√©nages
just one bitch dont feel the same no more
and henny dont really kill the pain no more
now im cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
cause i cant maintain no more
tad bit extreme i know
money cant save your soul
prechorus
but there go you
there go you

sellin me dreams and tellin me things you knew
and there go you

sellin me dreams and tellin me things you knew
