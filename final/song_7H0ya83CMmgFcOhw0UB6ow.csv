it was late at night
you held on tight
from an empty seat
a flash of light
it will take a while
to make you smile
somewhere in these eyes
im on your side
you wideeyed girls
you get it right

chorus
fall back into place
fall back into place

verse 2
tender is the night
for a broken heart
who will dry your eyes
when it falls apart
what makes this fragile world go round
were you ever lost
was she ever found
somewhere in these eyes

fall back into place
fall back into place
fall back into place
fall back into place

fall back into place
fall back into place
