look at them boys in the back of that truck
somebody ought to jerk a knot in their butts
out riding around like they own this town
that racket turned all the way up
its too early for school to let out
and the pastors boy just threw a cigarette out
i sure hope there aint beer in them cups
cause our star quarterbacks turning them up

verse 2
them boys dont know one thing about life
true love or trouble struggle or strife
they think its all just fun and games
like laws and rules or balls and chains
treating little girls like hearts dont break
treating old men like hands dont shake
i pray its just a phase theyre going through
yeah but what are we going to do with them boys

verse 3
i heard ol franks grandson got caught
with a case full of beer that smith boy bought
yall didnt hear all of this from me
but i heard they got it with a fake id
them boys

looking back on the times we shared
from rock n roll to these rocking chairs
the same ones our granddads sat in
by this old woodstove in this hardware store
talking the gossip the weather and war
and how much trouble we were in

outro
oh you can bet they said back then
they dont know a thing
about love
about life
