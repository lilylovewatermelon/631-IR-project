dont put me off cause im on fire
and i cant quench my desire

youre not convinced that that is enough

and i deserve the imposition
but you dont even know im alive
and this pounding in my heart just wont die

verse 2
youre always closing your door
well that only makes me want you more
and day and night i cry for your love
youre not convinced that that is enough
to justify my wanting you
now tell me what you want me to do
im not blind and i know
that you want to want me but you cant let go
