youve been checking on my facts
and i admit i have been lax
in doublescreening what i say
it wasnt funny anyway

chorus
i stand corrected
i stand corrected

verse 2
no one cares when you are wrong
but ive been at this far too long
to act like that when we should be
in perfect harmony

chorus
i stand corrected
i oh i stand corrected

bridge
lord knows i havent tried ill take my stand
one last time
forget the protocol ill take your hand
right in mine
