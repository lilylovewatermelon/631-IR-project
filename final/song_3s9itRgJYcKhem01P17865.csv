there’s nothing like summer in the city
someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
there’s trouble in the air you can smell it
and alexander’s by himself i’ll let him tell it
hamilton
i hadn’t slept in a week
i was weak i was awake
you never seen a bastard orphan
more in need of a break
longing for angelica
missing my wife
that’s when miss maria reynolds walked into my life she said

maria
i know you are a man of honor
i’m so sorry to bother you at home
but i don’t know where to go and i came here all alone…

hamilton
she said

maria
my husband’s doin’ me wrong
beatin’ me cheatin’ me mistreatin’ me
suddenly he’s up and gone
i don’t have the means to go on
you might also likehamilton
so i offered her a loan i offered to walk her home she said

maria
you’re too kind sir

hamilton
i gave her thirty bucks that i had socked away
she lived a block away she said

maria
this one’s mine sir

hamilton
then i said “well i should head back home”
she turned red she led me to her bed
let her legs spread and said

maria
stay
hamilton
hey…

maria
hey…
hamilton
that’s when i began to pray
lord show me how to
say no to this
i don’t know how to
say no to this

but my god she looks so helpless
and her body’s saying “hell yes”

maria

hamilton
i wish i could say that was the last time
i said that last time it became a pastime
a month into this endeavor i received a letter
from a mr james reynolds even better it said

james
dear sir i hope this letter finds you in good health
and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
in the pockets of people like me down on their luck
you see that was my wife who you decided to

hamilton
fuuuu—

james
uhoh you made the wrong sucker a cuckold
so time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
and hey you can keep seein’ my whore wife
if the price is right if not i’m telling your wife

hamilton
i hid the letter and i raced to her place
screamed “how could you” in her face
she said

maria
no sir

hamilton
half dressed apologetic a mess she looked
pathetic she cried

maria
please don’t go sir

hamilton
so was your whole story a setup

maria
i don’t know about any letter

hamilton
stop crying
goddamnit get up

maria
i didn’t know any better
hamilton

maria  hamilton
please don’t leave me with him helpless i am helpless—how could i do this
just give him what he wants and you can have me
i don’t want you
whatever you want i don’t want you

maria hamilton  ensemble
if you pay i don’t…

lord show me how to
say no to this say no to this

cause the situation’s helpless helpless
and her body’s screaming “hell yes” whoa
