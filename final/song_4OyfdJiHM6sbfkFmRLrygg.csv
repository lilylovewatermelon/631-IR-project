haha haha haha hahaha
the lives of some men
if walls could talk to spill the lies
wed see the world through devils eyes

interlude

verse 1
i maintain an addiction
been known to take it too high
i got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
and a oneway ticket to fly

chorus
when theres no writing on the wall
i see the lifeless devils start to crawl
and i dont need no lessons
after all
everybodys doin their time

verse 2
caught your eye in the corner
dont you look at me wrong
fucked up and thrown into the gutter
gotta fix what dont belong
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
i see the writing on the wall
i see the lifeless devils start to crawl
and i dont need no lessons
after all
everybodys doin their time

bridge
thats just the price to play so tell me what ya like
got a hand on the kerosene match tonight
right

guitar solo

verse 3
had enough of opinions
i got enough on my mind
sell your soul for approval and a dollar
got a pretty little body to grind

chorus
i see your number on the wall
i see the lifeless devils start to crawl
and i dont need no lessons
watch the fall
you lost my attention
after all
everybodys doin their time
outro
