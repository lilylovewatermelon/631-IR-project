if i go before i say
to everyone in my ballet
let me take this chance
to thank you for the dance
if i run out of songs to sing
to take your mind off everything
just smile sit a while

prechorus
with the sun on your face and remember the place we met
take a breath and soon i bet youll see
without you i would never be me
you are the leaves of my family tree

chorus
sing together
if you knew me from the very start
or we met last week at the grocery mart
just sing together
its the least that i can do
my final gift to you

postchorus
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh
oohoohoohooh ooh

when im past the pearly gate
i will find some real estate
we can settle down
and watch the world go round
well send down all the love we got
let them know we got a spot
for them to be and its all free

prechorus
with the sun on your face and remember the place we met
take a breath and soon i bet youll see
without you i would never be me
you are the leaves of my family tree

chorus
sing together
if you knew me from the very start
or not at all youre still a part
just sing together
its the least that i can do
my final gift to you

postchorus
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh
oohooh oohooh ooh
oohooh oohooh
