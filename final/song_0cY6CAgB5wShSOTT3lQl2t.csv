0cY6CAgB5wShSOTT3lQl2t,You're So Last Summer - Remastered,Taking Back Sunday,0gBSoXYKsE3HHZNbgMPnEg,"4 contributorsaka sole survivor lyricsjessica we used to come out here every summer
and after they died i thought about coming back
because i knew no one would ever find a body out here
i could just disappear
you never told me
well i never did it
so we just dumped a body at your childhood vacation spot
sighs not much of a vacation
two bickering siblings forced to share a queen bed just because its half a block from some water
trish sounds fun
were the only ones who even know simpsons gone
he didnt have any family
sighs well igh does have a type
im sorry about what happened to him
and more than that im pissed
but i cant hunt down igh from a jail cell
i know
and thats exactly where id be if the cops find me with another body
hed understand
it just sucks
jessica we gotta wipe down his car and ditch it
you know its not even registered to him
he probably stole it
simpson was serious about this protection thing
its an arsenal
sighs yeah
he knew what he was facing
hey
no
ill keep em
what i know what were facing too and i need all the defense i can get
well time to go claw some memories out of my brain
how i gotta go through every file you have on igh
its gonna be hard to look at
yeah
well my past is killing people now so not a lot of options
i might have one
does it involve alcohol dr
tiboldt another deep breath
in through the nose  and out through the mouth
 inhales deeply exhales youre feeling more and more at peace with every breath
can i get another pillow you have seven pillows
dr
tiboldt i know this is hard but when you resist suggestion the hypnotic state is difficult to achieve
i just dont have a great track record with shrinks
were not shrinking
were expanding
okay lets return to our breathing
and in and as you exhale i want you to imagine a safe place
somewhere peaceful calming
in your safe place there is a door
picture that door
move toward it
now open that door
open it and move toward your memories
exhales sharply i dont have a safe place
dr
tiboldt patients often choose a stretch of beach
 yeah no
 dr
tiboldt or their childhood home
 jessica uhuh
 all right
where do you go to relax rudys
9th and 45th
solid pours and they got free hot dogs
jess just tell him what you already remembered
she had this memory of a thing a creature with a meat face
it wasnt a memory
meatfaced creatures dont exist
well even if your mind invented it it could help unlock a door
start at the beginning
dr
tiboldt im so sorry
jess you said you were willing to try
to remember yeah
not to work out my crap with some pseudo shrink
you know whatever works for you
just tell me how i can help
go through the rest of your fan mail
maybe whizzer wasnt the only one trying to reach out
 you found her then
 i forgot to call
yeah your followthrough blows
the station said you called in sick
im sorry
griffin did you get it the bloody story
did you get it jess maybe you should go
arent relationships great sirens wailing door opens door closes im aware of the time theyre just gonna have to wait
do you not trust me to find my way to the conference room no
we thought it best to limit todays meeting to name partners only
so we came to you
sighs you look well jeri
how did you find out chao oh doesnt matter
you signed the same contract we did
we are sympathetic but the medical disclosure clause does require that you disclose any diagnosis with potential to affect job performance
scoffs im fine
chao for now
benowitz weve put together a very generous buyout package
yeah
this is about pams lawsuit
isnt it i made it go away
what more do you want a little morality
 oh please
 lets keep this professional okay my name is coming off that door over my dead body
and that is not gonna happen soon no matter how hard you wish for it
you have always been a liability jeri
we just got lucky this time
linda look jeri
i for one am very sorry
i wouldnt wish it on anyone
but we have a fiduciary duty to protect the firm
youll have a standard window in which to negotiate the terms of your severance
there will be no negotiation there will be no severance because im not leaving
sighs please reconsider or well have to force you out
we are so screwed
im evicted says who the super
did you know its illegal to run a commercial business out of a residentialzone property of course i did
 and did you ever get ahold of trish  yeah
is she okay yeah she just spaced and forgot to return some calls
thats all
it seems like theres something going on there like with her
asshole
 what are you gonna do  im gonna handle it
hell never come around if you throw a fist in his face
that has not been my experience
time to update the rã©sumã©
what is this shit  whoa  pa she said shit
 speaking spanish watch your mouth around my kid
oh like his bigoted father is some shining role model youre breaking the law
you were all smiles checking out the neighbor until you saw that i was different
thats called prejudice
youre not a protected class
the people in this building want to raise their families in safety
 im safe as shit
 huh superpowers accidental deaths cops all things i and my tenants want to avoid
cops is that what did it youre what did it
so youre out of here
might want to check with the landlord first because he likes having me around
he says i protect his investment
maybe before bodies started dropping
cause now he agrees with me that you dont belong here
thirty days
sighs you charged off on a dangerous lead without backup
 i was careful
 you were stupid  thats how you get yourself killed  hey back off people are dying
 your words not mine
i dont know what youre into but youre in over your head
that is such sexist bullshit
 you were dodging bombs in damascus
 god damn it i was worried about you
man karma sucks the biggest dick
scoffs  meaning  sergine
your ex i came home after being on assignment for three months and shed moved out
gone
not a word
you said she was unstable
what does that have to do she wasnt unstable
she was just tired of being the worried girl left behind
last night that was me
i really am sorry
 babe are you a target  no
well i dont know
but you could be
listen i this thing us the press is loving it
sighs awardwinning journalist settles for vapid child star
 i wouldnt call tabloids the press
my point is everyone knows i care about you
i think you should stay away until jess and i close this case
 not gonna happen
 well it has to
how about we both stop telling each other what to do you know im gonna go
i need some time
 jeri
 not a good time franklin
their buyout proposal
chao had me draw it up
i didnt have a choice
i dont know whats going on but that medical disclosure clause is bullshit franklin okay
stop
youre sick
dont let them discriminate against you for it
let me do something
let me help you
 you want to help me  we can fight this
do you think were friends  im sorry  do you think because we have shared a table a handful of times in court that you have the right to involve yourself in my life my shit a partner your goddamn boss  i didnt mean  you cannot help me
you cannot do anything but your job
so um exercise some goddamn discretion and bury your head in the sand because thats where it belongs instead of up my ass
youre gonna need people
no one goes through something like this alone
well allow me to be the first to try
sighs jessica there are worse things than death
once youre worm food its over
painless
quiet
while the rest of us are stuck digging holes picking up the pieces and remembering
scoffs or i dont know trying to
panting exclaims grunts groans malcolm jess i got something
sighs wow
youve been working
so have i
what do you want a drumroll you were right
our superintendent has a past
hes done time
jessica felony check forgery
 how did you know he was an excon people dont usually panic at the sight of cops unless theyve ridden in the back of a cruiser
so our landlord randomly replaces alfredo with this guy  whos alfredo  the old super
he was good people
his wife used to make empanadas on sundays
always passed them around the building
i guess not to you
rare teaching moment malcolm
if the old super was such a gem empanadas for days but he still got canned  oscars got something on our landlord
 pay him a visit and find out
and be nice
the nicer the better
eugene can be a dick
sighs rattling jessica dr
leslie hansen worked at metrogeneral in the 90s and then nothing
twenty years of web presence completely wiped out and that takes some doing
sighs go ahead and say it
i told you so
 even i have to admit the hypnoquack doctor made a dent
open the door
 sighs i told you so
how pissed was griffin  not just pissed
worried
 he should be
because im an inexperienced little radio journalist who cant even leap a building because were closing in
and thats when it gets dangerous
i told him to stay away from me until all this is over
i bet a guy who has seen literal war zones took that swimmingly
chuckles yeah
i love him you know
probably means he has a pornography addiction or a secret family in iowa
iowa yeah secret families are always stashed in flyover states
he doesnt
i looked into him
you have often needed protection from your own vagina
you found nothing oh i found some stuff
the dude has lived but he is an actual decent human being
 shit
 yeah
cant let him end up like simpson
 whered you find hansens address  her medical school loans
i tracked her payments back to this building which went up in 1939
no one in new york city gives up a rentcontrolled apartment
ever
jessica yes
knock on door jessica chinese food lock clicks dr
hansen hello maybe she went out for groceries or something
jessica this place is too clean
she could just be a neat person
okay maybe a little ocd
or maybe shes not the sentimental type
jessica im not sentimental but i still have shit
youre right
too clean
shes covering her tracks or someones covering for her
 god damn it
 well track her down
sighs i miss the days when i didnt want to know anything
i blame you for that
 ill take it
 door creaking the apartments been rented
you wouldnt want it anyway
no elevator
when did the tenant move out saw a lady carrying boxes down to the basement last week
but my nephews spoken for this place
leslie hansen she cleaned it out herself how should i know i got enough problems without chatting up my neighbors
lets check the basement
trish thank you
do you smell that its like mold
maybe the toxic kind
its coming from this thing
i thought they stopped using these in the 90s
trish yeah im not sure i want to know whats in that
jessica its not hot but that smell is recent

its a progressive neurodegenerative disease
i know
it gives my partners cause to invoke a medical disclosure clause
im not even showing symptoms
a cramp here or there
clears throat its more annoying than anything
it could take eight years to kill me
or two
no one knows
its ironic isnt it laughs ive spent my whole life amassing this power and control thinking somehow it would protect me
if i believed in god  id say her sense of humor is for shit
 chuckles i i thought about taking the buyout living on an island drinking rum making love to beautiful women nothing but time to contemplate my future
my future is nothing but a goddamn horror show
sighs im alone
chuckles um im estranged from my family
all i have are my clients my firm and the respect of my colleagues
the only thing i will leave behind is my name on that door
