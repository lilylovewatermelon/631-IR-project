aint this what yall need me for
you done pissed me off what is yall leaving for
oh what a white girl with a flow aint been seen before
bow down until your knees get sore uh
treat neimans like a grocery store
and selfridges get the same rapport
ask bey when we off on tour
hoppin out of fly whips screaming this aint yours
how famous can one get fore she get tired
one phone call that make all the money get wired uh
spit fire thatll burn down an empire
twenty deep in the sprinter tryin the benz tires
wave hello when i breeze by ya
make enough in ten months i could live off or retire whoof
but i just won’t quit
tryna figure out which part of this you just don’t get huh

chorus
lord lemme know if you got us
preachin about prophets
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
goddess got it
you might also likeverse 2
same critics wondered if i had it in me
now want me to play friendly
but how the hell you play friendly when the mention of my name could cause a media frenzy
the cameras flash everywhere make it hard to miss me
lately i been crazy tell a psych ward commit me
death to any competition comin up against me
you think it’s anything better then come convince me
until then i’ll be leading the race
so bow down put your knee to your face
while i make wine outta water turn rappers into martyrs
set it off whenever igg in the place uh
young rapper goddess yall a boring read like rapper’s digest
i could never see a fall like i skip through august
i’m thinkin bout now would be the time to start this

chorus
lord lemme know if you got us
preachin about prophets
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
goddess got it
bridge
put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
they wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die
put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
they wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die

chorus
lord lemme know if you got us
preachin about prophets
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
bow down to a goddess
it ain’t no one man can stop us
bow down to a goddess
goddess got it33embed"
