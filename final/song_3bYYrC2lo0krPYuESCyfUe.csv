drink it up dont waste a drop
squeeze every second out of that old clock
kick it back man enjoy the ride
keep living every day like its saturday night

chorus
cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
only so many times you get to feel like this
light it up burn it out thats what lifes all about
man you cant just take a little sip fill your cup drink it up
oh drink it up

verse 2
let it roll let the big wheels turn
sling a little gravel going through those curves
you and me weve gotta soak it in
keep it cranking like this partys gonna never end

chorus
cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
only so many times you get to feel like this
light it up burn it out thats what lifes all about
man you cant just take a little sip fill your cup drink it up
oh drink it up

chorus
cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
only so many times you get to feel like this
light it up burn it out thats what lifes all about
man you cant just take a little sip fill your cup

cause you only get so much lightning in the bottle
only so many times you get to feel like this
