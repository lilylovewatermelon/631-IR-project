verse 2
my city never thought itd make a nigga like me
young lil nigga from the 503
im tom cruise the rap game the couch from oprah
im here for my range boy not them rovers
money make my world go round
money make my heartbeat pounce
ask god for a lot
success aint bout the fame and how much jewels you rock
success is when i can tell my mama to quit her job
still poppin pellegrino cause my mama like my hero
now hoes give me head cause i make banana bread
young black boy mi ah world so rude
give me 40 acres with a moscow mule
my señorita boricua
she smoke a lot of the reefer
i need me commas on commas if rappers want him on feature
im making swiss beats so i beat it like an alicia
money dont make you happy it just makes you wanna get richer

bridge 2
cause when it all boils down
the paper bring me pleasure
theres no satisfaction
theres no satisfaction
theres nothing you can do to give me
what i really need theres no satisfaction
what i really need

chorus
money make the world go round
money turn your best friend down
money turn a good girl out
money make the sun go south
and it make my selfesteem
but it never take my dream life5embed"
