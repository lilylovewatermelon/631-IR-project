hate me with everything
im better off without your animosity
ill even sleep better at night at night
i once believed in you
reminded me of everything you put me through
now everything just feels all right all right

prechorus
i feel so betrayed mistaken

chorus
i create another day
youll be gone tomorrow
lie to me youre faceless

verse 2
youve made me out to be
responsible for your selfinflicted misery
it never felt like this before before
dont be surprised to see
that i have nothing left for you to bleed
when you come crawling back for more for more

lie to me youre faceless

and i create another day
