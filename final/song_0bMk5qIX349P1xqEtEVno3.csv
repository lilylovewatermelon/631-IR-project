party

ive been wasting all my time
and ive been drinkin all that wine
and ive been drinkin all that beer
and ive been sheddin all these tears
i cant go and you cant stay
your not gonna take me out that way

because you cant take me
i said you cant take me
no you cant take me anywhere i dont wanna go

ive been down this road before
and i just can not care no more
i cant see what you can see
im too busy bein me
see i cant go and you cant stay
your not gonna take me out that way

because you cant take me
i said you cant take me
no you cant take me anywhere i dont wanna go
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likei dont need to save no face
and i cant wait to leave this place
ive been fooled by lesser things
and i dont care what tomorrow brings
see i can go and you cant stay
your not gonna take me out that way
because you cant take me
i said you cant take me
no you cant take me anywhere i dont wanna go

no you cant take me anywhere i dont wanna go
