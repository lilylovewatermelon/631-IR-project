when you can look at her picture
and not want to kiss her no more
when you dont feel like youve been hit by a train
at the sound of someone saying her name any more
when you can drive down the road
and not be afraid of whats playing on the radio…

chorus
thats when you know its over
thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
ready for another ride
thats when you know its over

verse 2
when the time of the year
dont stir up the tears any more
when it dont feel like the past is a gun
and theres nowhere to run any more
when it dont take every bone
to not dial her number just leave her alone

chorus
thats when you know its over
thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
ready for another ride
thats when you know its over
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likebridge
when you wouldnt go back even if you could
when hearing shes happy finally feels good

chorus
thats when you know its over
thats when you know youve made it over to the other side
ready for another ride
thats when you know its over
thats when you know its overembed"
