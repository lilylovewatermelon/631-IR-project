2   that oer the channel reard half way at sea
3   the mariner at early morning hails
4   i would recline while fancy should go forth
5   and represent the strange and awful hour
6   of vast concussion when the omnipotent
7   stretchd forth his arm and rent the solid hills
8   bidding the impetuous main flood rush between
9   the rifted shores and from the continent
10   eternally divided this green isle
11   imperial lord of the high southern coast
12   from thy projecting headland i would mark
13   far in the east the shades of night disperse
14   melting and thinned as from the dark blue wave
15   emerging brilliant rays of arrowy light
16   dart from the horizon when the glorious sun
17   just lifts above it his resplendent orb
18   advances now with feathery silver touched
19   the rippling tide of flood glisten the sands
20   while inmates of the chalky clefts that scar
21   thy sides precipitous with shrill harsh cry
22   their white wings glancing in the level beam
23   the terns and gulls and tarrocks seek their food
24   and thy rough hollows echo to the voice
25   of the gray choughs and ever restless daws
26   with clamour not unlike the chiding hounds
27   while the lone shepherd and his baying dog
28   drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock
29   the high meridian of the day is past
30   and ocean now reflecting the calm heaven
31   is of cerulean hue and murmurs low
32   the tide of ebb upon the level sands
33   the sloop her angular canvas shifting still
34   catches the light and variable airs
35   that but a little crisp the summer sea
36   dimpling its tranquil surface

36                                             afar off
37   and just emerging from the arch immense
38   where seem to part the elements a fleet
39   of fishing vessels stretch their lesser sails
40   while more remote and like a dubious spot
41   just hanging in the horizon laden deep
42   the ship of commerce richly freighted makes
43   her slower progress on her distant voyage
44   bound to the orient climates where the sun
45   matures the spice within its odorous shell
46   and rivalling the gray worms filmy toil
47   bursts from its pod the vegetable down
48   which in long turband wreaths from torrid heat
49   defends the brows of asias countless casts
50   there the earth hides within her glowing breast
51   the beamy adamant and the round pearl
52   enchased in rugged covering which the slave
53   with perilous and breathless toil tears off
54   from the rough searock deep beneath the waves
55   these are the toys of nature and her sport
56   of little estimate in reasons eye
57   and they who reason with abhorrence see
58   man for such gaudes and baubles violate
59   the sacred freedom of his fellow man
60   erroneous estimate as heavens pure air
61   fresh as it blows on this aërial height
62   or sound of seas upon the stony strand
63   or inland the gay harmony of birds
64   and winds that wander in the leafy woods
65   are to the unadulterate taste more worth
66   than the elaborate harmony brought out
67   from fretted stop or modulated airs
68   of vocal science—so the brightest gems
69   glancing resplendent on the regal crown
70   or trembling in the high born beautys ear
71   are poor and paltry to the lovely light
72   of the fair star that as the day declines
73   attendant on her queen the crescent moon
74   bathes her bright tresses in the eastern wave
75   for now the sun is verging to the sea
76   and as he westward sinks the floating clouds
77   suspended move upon the evening gale
78   and gathering round his orb as if to shade
79   the insufferable brightness they resign
80   their gauzy whiteness and more warmd assume
81   all hues of purple there transparent gold
82   mingles with ruby tints and sapphire gleams
83   and colours such as nature through her works
84   shews only in the ethereal canopy
85   thither aspiring fancy fondly soars
86   wandering sublime thro visionary vales
87   where bright pavilions rise and trophies fannd
88   by airs celestial and adornd with wreaths
89   of flowers that bloom amid elysian bowers
90   now bright and brighter still the colours glow
91   till half the lustrous orb within the flood
92   seems to retire the flood reflecting still
93   its splendor and in mimic glory drest
94   till the last ray shot upward fires the clouds
95   with blazing crimson then in paler light
96   long lines of tenderer radiance lingering yield
97   to partial darkness and on the opposing side
98   the early moon distinctly rising throws
99   her pearly brilliance on the trembling tide
100   the fishermen who at set seasons pass
101   many a league off at sea their toiling night
102   now hail their comrades from their daily task
103   returning and make ready for their own
104   with the night tide commencing—the night tide
105   bears a dark vessel on whose hull and sails
106   mark her a coaster from the north her keel
107   now ploughs the sand and sidelong now she leans
108   while with loud clamours her athletic crew
109   unload her and resounds the busy hum
110   along the waveworn rocks yet more remote
111   where the rough cliff hangs beetling oer its base
112   all breathes repose the waters rippling sound
113   scarce heard but now and then the seasnipes cry
114   just tells that something living is abroad
115   and sometimes crossing on the moonbright line
116   glimmers the skiff faintly discernd awhile
117   then lost in shadow
117                                             contemplation here
118   high on her throne of rock aloof may sit
119   and bid recording memory unfold
120   her scroll voluminous—bid her retrace
121   the period when from neustrias hostile shore
122   the norman launchd his galleys and the bay
123   oer which that mass of ruin frowns even now
124   in vain and sullen menace then received
125   the new invaders a proud martial race
126   of scandinavia the undaunted sons
127   whom dogon fierabras and humfroi led
128   to conquest while trinacria to their power
129   yielded her wheaten garland and when thou
130   parthenope within thy fertile bay
131   receivd the victors—

131                                             in the mailed ranks
132   of normans landing on the british coast
133   rode taillefer and with astounding voice
134   thunderd the war song daring roland sang
135   first in the fierce contention vainly brave
136   one not inglorious struggle england made—
137   but failing saw the saxon heptarchy
138   finish for ever—then the holy pile
139   yet seen upon the field of conquest rose
140   where to appease heavens wrath for so much blood
141   the conqueror bade unceasing prayers ascend
142   and requiems for the slayers and the slain
143   but let not modern gallia form from hence
144   presumptuous hopes that ever thou again
145   queen of the isles shalt crouch to foreign arms
146   the enervate sons of italy may yield
147   and the iberian all his trophies torn
148   and wrappd in superstitions monkish weed
149   may shelter his abasement and put on
150   degrading fetters never never thou
151   imperial mistress of the obedient sea
152   but thou in thy integrity secure
153   shalt now undaunted meet a world in arms
154   england twas where this promontory rears
155   its rugged brow above the channel wave
156   parting the hostile nations that thy fame
157   thy naval fame was tarnishd at what time
158   thou leagued with the batavian gavest to france
159   one day of triumph—triumph the more loud
160   because even then so rare oh well redeemd
161   since by a series of illustrious men
162   such as no other country ever reard
163   to vindicate her cause it is a list
164   which as fame echoes it blanches the cheek
165   of bold ambition while the despot feels
166   the extorted sceptre tremble in his grasp
167   from even the proudest roll by glory filld
168   how gladly the reflecting mind returns
169   to simple scenes of peace and industry
170   where bosomd in some valley of the hills
171   stands the lone farm its gate with tawny ricks
172   surrounded and with granaries and sheds
173   roofd with green mosses and by elms and ash
174   partially shaded and not far removd
175   the hut of seaflints built the humble home
176   of one who sometimes watches on the heights
177   when hid in the cold mist of passing clouds
178   the flock with dripping fleeces are dispersd
179   oer the wide down then from some ridged point
180   that overlooks the sea his eager eye
181   watches the bark that for his signal waits
182   to land its merchandize—quitting for this
183   clandestine traffic his more honest toil
184   the crook abandoning he braves himself
185   the heaviest snowstorm of decembers night
186   when with conflicting winds the ocean raves
187   and on the tossing boat unfearing mounts
188   to meet the partners of the perilous trade
189   and share their hazard well it were for him
190   if no such commerce of destruction known
191   he were content with what the earth affords
192   to human labour even where she seems
193   reluctant most more happy is the hind
194   who with his own hands rears on some black moor
195   or turbary his independent hut
196   coverd with heather whence the slow white smoke
197   of smouldering peat arises—a few sheep
198   his best possession with his children share
199   the rugged shed when wintry tempests blow
200   but when with springs return the green blades rise
201   amid the russet heath the household live
202   joint tenants of the waste throughout the day
203   and often from her nest among the swamps
204   where the gemmd sundew grows or fringd buckbean
205   they scare the plover that with plaintive cries
206   flutters as sorely wounded down the wind
207   rude and but just removd from savage life
208   is the rough dweller among scenes like these
209   scenes all unlike the poets fabling dreams
210   describing aready—but he is free
211   the dread that follows on illegal acts
212   he never feels and his industrious mate
213   shares in his labour where the brook is traced
214   by crouding osiers and the black coot hides
215   among the plashy reeds her diving brood
216   the matron wades gathering the long green rush
217   that well prepard hereafter lends its light
218   to her poor cottage dark and cheerless else
219   thro the drear hours of winter otherwhile
220   she leads her infant group where charlock grows
221   unprofitably gay or to the fields
222   where congregate the linnet and the finch
223   that on the thistles so profusely spread
224   feast in the desert the poor family
225   early resort extirpating with care
226   these and the gaudier mischief of the ground
227   then flames the high raisd heap seen afar off
228   like hostile warfires flashing to the sky
229   another task is theirs on fields that shew
230   as angry heaven had raind sterility
231   stony and cold and hostile to the plough
232   where clamouring loud the evening curlew runs
233   and drops her spotted eggs among the flints
234   the mother and the children pile the stones
235   in rugged pyramids—and all this toil
236   they patiently encounter well content
237   on their flock bed to slumber undisturbd
238   beneath the smoky roof they call their own
239   oh little knows the sturdy hind who stands
240   gazing with looks where envy and contempt
241   are often strangely mingled on the car
242   where prosperous fortune sits what secret care
243   or sick satiety is often hid
244   beneath the splendid outside he knows not
245   how frequently the child of luxury
246   enjoying nothing flies from place to place
247   in chase of pleasure that eludes his grasp
248   and that content is een less found by him
249   than by the labourer whose pickaxe smooths
250   the road before his chariot and who doffs
251   what was an hat and as the train pass on
252   thinks how one days expenditure like this
253   would cheer him for long months when to his toil
254   the frozen earth closes her marble breast

255   ah who is happy happiness a word
256   that like false fire from marsh effluvia born
257   misleads the wanderer destind to contend
258   in the worlds wilderness with want or woe—
259   yet they are happy who have never askd
260   what good or evil means the boy
261   that on the rivers margin gaily plays
262   has heard that death is there—he knows not death
263   and therefore fears it not and venturing in
264   he gains a bullrush or a minnow—then
265   at certain peril for a worthless prize
266   a crows or ravens nest he climbs the boll
267   of some tall pine and of his prowess proud
268   is for a moment happy are your cares
269   ye who despise him never worse applied
270   the village girl is happy who sets forth
271   to distant fair gay in her sunday suit
272   with cherry colourd knots and flourishd shawl
273   and bonnet newly purchasd so is he
274   her little brother who his mimic drum
275   beats till he drowns her rural lovers oaths
276   of constant faith and still increasing love
277   ah yet a while and half those oaths believd
278   her happiness is vanishd and the boy
279   while yet a stripling finds the sound he lovd
280   has led him on till he has given up
281   his freedom and his happiness together
282   i once was happy when while yet a child
283   i learnd to love these upland solitudes
284   and when elastic as the mountain air
285   to my light spirit care was yet unknown
286   and evil unforeseen—early it came
287   and childhood scarcely passed i was condemned
288   a guiltless exile silently to sigh
289   while memory with faithful pencil drew
290   the contrast and regretting i compard
291   with the polluted smoky atmosphere
292   and dark and stifling streets the southern hills
293   that to the setting sun their graceful heads
294   rearing oerlook the frith where vecta breaks
295   with her white rocks the strong impetuous tide
296   when western winds the vast atlantic urge
297   to thunder on the coast—haunts of my youth
298   scenes of fond daydreams i behold ye yet
299   where twas so pleasant by thy northern slopes
300   to climb the winding sheeppath aided oft
301   by scatterd thorns whose spiny branches bore
302   small woolly tufts spoils of the vagrant lamb
303   there seeking shelter from the noonday sun
304   and pleasant seated on the short soft turf
305   to look beneath upon the hollow way
306   while heavily upward movd the labouring wain
307   and stalking slowly by the sturdy hind
308   to ease his panting team stoppd with a stone
309   the grating wheel

309                                             advancing higher still
310   the prospect widens and the village church
311   but little oer the lowly roofs around
312   rears its gray belfry and its simple vane
313   those lowly roofs of thatch are half conceald
314   by the rude arms of trees lovely in spring
315   when on each bough the rosytincturd bloom
316   sits thick and promises autumnal plenty
317   for even those orchards round the norman farms
318   which as their owners mark the promisd fruit
319   console them for the vineyards of the south
320   surpass not these

320                                             where woods of ash and beech
321   and partial copses fringe the green hill foot
322   the upland shepherd rears his modest home
323   there wanders by a little nameless stream
324   that from the hill wells forth bright now and clear
325   or after rain with chalky mixture gray
326   but still refreshing in its shallow course
327   the cottage garden most for use designd
328   yet not of beauty destitute the vine
329   mantles the little casement yet the briar
330   drops fragrant dew among the july flowers
331   and pansies rayed and freakd and mottled pinks
332   grow among balm and rosemary and rue
333   there honeysuckles flaunt and roses blow
334   almost uncultured some with dark green leaves
335   contrast their flowers of pure unsullied white
336   others like velvet robes of regal state
337   of richest crimson while in thorny moss
338   enshrined and cradled the most lovely wear
339   the hues of youthful beautys glowing cheek—
340   with fond regret i recollect een now
341   in spring and summer what delight i felt
342   among these cottage gardens and how much
343   such artless nosegays knotted with a rush
344   by village housewife or her ruddy maid
345   were welcome to me soon and simply pleasd

346   an early worshipper at natures shrine
347   i loved her rudest scenes—warrens and heaths
348   and yellow commons and birchshaded hollows
349   and hedge rows bordering unfrequented lanes
350   bowered with wild roses and the clasping woodbine
351   where purple tassels of the tangling vetch
352   with bittersweet and bryony inweave
353   and the dew fills the silver bindweeds cups—
354   i loved to trace the brooks whose humid banks
355   nourish the harebell and the freckled pagil
356   and stroll among oershadowing woods of beech
357   lending in summer from the heats of noon
358   a whispering shade while haply there reclines
359   some pensive lover of unculturd flowers
360   who from the tumps with bright green mosses clad
361   plucks the wood sorrel with its light thin leaves
362   heartshaped and triply folded and its root
363   creeping like beaded coral or who there
364   gathers the copses pride anémones
365   with rays like golden studs on ivory laid
366   most delicate but touchd with purple clouds
367   fit crown for aprils fair but changeful brow

368   ah hills so early loved in fancy still
369   i breathe your pure keen air and still behold
370   those widely spreading views mocking alike
371   the poet and the painters utmost art
372   and still observing objects more minute
373   wondering remark the strange and foreign forms
374   of seashells with the pale calcareous soil
375   mingled and seeming of resembling substance
376   tho surely the blue ocean from the heights
377   where the downs westward trend but dimly seen
378   here never rolld its surge does nature then
379   mimic in wanton mood fantastic shapes
380   of bivalves and inwreathed volutes that cling
381   to the dark searock of the watry world
382   or did this range of chalky mountains once
383   form a vast bason where the ocean waves
384   swelld fathomless what time these fossil shells
385   buoyd on their native element were thrown
386   among the imbedding calx when the huge hill
387   its giant bulk heaved and in strange ferment
388   grew up a guardian barrier twixt the sea
389   and the green level of the sylvan weald

390   ah very vain is science proudest boast
391   and but a little light its flame yet lends
392   to its most ardent votaries since from whence
393   these fossil forms are seen is but conjecture
394   food for vague theories or vain dispute
395   while to his daily task the peasant goes
396   unheeding such inquiry with no care
397   but that the kindly change of sun and shower
398   fit for his toil the earth he cultivates
399   as little recks the herdsman of the hill
400   who on some turfy knoll idly reclined
401   watches his wether flock that deep beneath
402   rest the remains of men of whom is left
403   no traces in the records of mankind
404   save what these half obliterated mounds
405   and half filld trenches doubtfully impart
406   to some lone antiquary who on times remote
407   since which two thousand years have rolld away
408   loves to contemplate he perhaps may trace
409   or fancy he can trace the oblong square
410   where the maild legions under claudius reard
411   the rampire or excavated fossé delved
412   what time the huge unwieldy elephant
413   auxiliary reluctant hither led
414   from africs forest glooms and tawny sands
415   first felt the northern blast and his vast frame
416   sunk useless whence in after ages found
417   the wondering hinds on those enormous bones
418   gazd and in giants dwelling on the hills
419   believed and marvelld—
419                                             hither ambition come
420   come and behold the nothingness of all
421   for which you carry thro the oppressed earth
422   war and its train of horrors—see where tread
423   the innumerous hoofs of flocks above the works
424   by which the warrior sought to register
425   his glory and immortalize his name—
426   the pirate dane who from his circular camp
427   bore in destructive robbery fire and sword
428   down thro the vale sleeps unrememberd here
429   and here beneath the green sward rests alike
430   the savage native who his acorn meal
431   shard with the herds that ranged the pathless woods
432   and the centurion who on these wide hills
433   encamping planted the imperial eagle
434   all with the lapse of time have passed away
435   even as the clouds with dark and dragon shapes
436   or like vast promontories crownd with towers
437   cast their broad shadows on the downs then sail
438   far to the northward and their transient gloom
439   is soon forgotten

439                                             but from thoughts like these
440   by human crimes suggested let us turn
441   to where a more attractive study courts
442   the wanderer of the hills while shepherd girls
443   will from among the fescue bring him flowers
444   of wonderous mockery some resembling bees
445   in velvet vest intent on their sweet toil
446   while others mimic flies that lightly sport
447   in the green shade or float along the pool
448   but here seem perchd upon the slender stalk
449   and gathering honey dew while in the breeze
450   that wafts the thistles plumed seed along
451   blue bells wave tremulous the mountain thyme
452   purples the hassock of the heaving mole
453   and the short turf is gay with tormentil
454   and birds foot trefoil and the lesser tribes
455   of hawkweed spangling it with fringed stars—
456   near where a richer tract of culturd land
457   slopes to the south and burnished by the sun
458   bend in the gale of august floods of corn
459   the guardian of the flock with watchful care
460   repels by voice and dog the encroaching sheep—
461   while his boy visits every wired trap
462   that scars the turf and from the pitfalls takes
463   the timid migrants who from distant wilds
464   warrens and stone quarries are destined thus
465   to lose their short existence but unsought
466   by luxury yet the shepherd still protects
467   the social bird who from his native haunts
468   of willowy current or the rushy pool
469   follows the fleecy croud and flirts and skims
470   in fellowship among them

470                                             where the knoll
471   more elevated takes the changeful winds
472   the windmill rears its vanes and thitherward
473   with his white load the master travelling
474   scares the rooks rising slow on whispering wings
475   while oer his head before the summer sun
476   lights up the blue expanse heard more than seen
477   the lark sings matins and above the clouds
478   floating embathes his spotted breast in dew
479   beneath the shadow of a gnarled thorn
480   bent by the sea blast from a seat of turf
481   with fairy nosegays strewn how wide the view
482   till in the distant north it melts away
483   and mingles indiscriminate with clouds
484   but if the eye could reach so far the mart
485   of englands capital its domes and spires
486   might be perceived—yet hence the distant range
487   of kentish hills appear in purple haze
488   and nearer undulate the wooded heights
489   and airy summits that above the mole
490   rise in green beauty and the beacond ridge
491   of blackdown shaggd with heath and swelling rude
492   like a dark island from the vale its brow
493   catching the last rays of the evening sun
494   that gleam between the nearer parks old oaks
495   then lighten up the river and make prominent
496   the portal and the ruind battlements
497   of that dismantled fortress raisd what time
498   the conquerors successors fiercely fought
499   tearing with civil feuds the desolate land
500   but now a tiller of the soil dwells there
501   and of the turrets loopd and rafterd halls
502   has made an humbler homestead—where he sees
503   instead of armed foemen herds that graze
504   along his yellow meadows or his flocks
505   at evening from the upland drivn to fold—

506   in such a castellated mansion once
507   a stranger chose his home and where hard by
508   in rude disorder fallen and hid with brushwood
509   lay fragments gray of towers and buttresses
510   among the ruins often he would muse—
511   his rustic meal soon ended he was wont
512   to wander forth listening the evening sounds
513   of rushing milldam or the distant team
514   or nightjar chasing fernflies the tird hind
515   passd him at nightfall wondering he should sit
516   on the hill top so late they from the coast
517   who sought bye paths with their clandestine load
518   saw with suspicious doubt the lonely man
519   cross on their way but village maidens thought
520   his senses injurd and with pity say
521   that he poor youth must have been crossd in love—
522   for often stretchd upon the mountain turf
523   with folded arms and eyes intently fixd
524   where ancient elms and firs obscured a grange
525   some little space within the vale below
526   they heard him as complaining of his fate
527   and to the murmuring wind of cold neglect
528   and baffled hope he told—the peasant girls
529   these plaintive sounds remember and even now
530   among them may be heard the strangers songs


531   were i a shepherd on the hill
532      and ever as the mists withdrew
533   could see the willows of the rill
534   shading the footway to the mill
535      where once i walkd with you—

536   and as away nights shadows sail
537      and sounds of birds and brooks arise
538   believe that from the woody vale
539   i hear your voice upon the gale
540      in soothing melodies

541   and viewing from the alpine height
542      the prospect dressd in hues of air
543   could say while transient colours bright
544   touchd the fair scene with dewy light
545      tis that her eyes are there

546   i think i could endure my lot
547      and linger on a few short years
548   and then by all but you forgot
549   sleep where the turf that clothes the spot
550      may claim some pitying tears

551   for tis not easy to forget
552      one who thro life has lovd you still
553   and you however late might yet
554   with sighs to memory givn regret
555      the shepherd of the hill

556   yet otherwhile it seemd as if young hope
557   her flattering pencil gave to fancys hand
558   and in his wanderings reard to sooth his soul
559   ideal bowers of pleasure—then of solitude
560   and of his hermit life still more enamourd
561   his home was in the forest and wild fruits
562   and bread sustaind him there in early spring
563   the barkmen found him eer the sun arose
564   there at their daily toil the wedgecutters
565   beheld him thro the distant thicket move
566   the shaggy dog following the truffle hunter
567   barkd at the loiterer and perchance at night
568   belated villagers from fair or wake
569   while the fresh nightwind let the moonbeams in
570   between the swaying boughs just saw him pass
571   and then in silence gliding like a ghost
572   he vanishd lost among the deepening gloom—
573   but near one ancient tree whose wreathed roots
574   formd a rude couch lovesongs and scatterd rhymes
575   unfinishd sentences or half erased
576   and rhapsodies like this were sometimes found—

577   let us to woodland wilds repair
578      while yet the glittering nightdews seem
579   to wait the freshlybreathing air
580      precursive of the morning beam
581   that rising with advancing day
582   scatters the silver drops away

583   an elm uprooted by the storm
584      the trunk with mosses gray and green
585   shall make for us a rustic form
586      where lighter grows the forest scene
587   and far among the bowery shades
588   are ferny lawns and grassy glades


589   retiring may to lovely june
590      her latest garland now resigns
591   the banks with cuckooflowers are strewn
592      the woodwalks blue with columbines
593   and with its reeds the wandering stream
594   reflects the flagflowers golden gleam

595   there feathering down the turf to meet
596      their shadowy arms the beeches spread
597   while high above our sylvan seat
598      lifts the light ash its airy head
599   and later leaved the oaks between
600   extend their bows of vernal green

601   the slender birch its paper rind
602      seems offering to divided love
603   and shuddering even without a wind
604      aspins their paler foliage move
605   as if some spirit of the air
606   breathd a low sigh in passing there

607   the squirrel in his frolic mood
608      will fearless bound among the boughs
609   yaffils laugh loudly thro the wood
610      and murmuring ringdoves tell their vows
611   while we as sweetest woodscents rise
612   listen to woodland melodies

613   and ill contrive a sylvan room
614      against the time of summer heat
615   where leaves inwoven in natures loom
616      shall canopy our green retreat
617   and gales that close the eye of day
618   shall linger eer they die away

619   and when a sear and sallow hue
620      from early frost the bower receives
621   ill dress the sand rock cave for you
622      and strew the floor with heath and leaves
623   that you against the autumnal air
624   may find securer shelter there

625   the nightingale will then have ceasd
626      to sing her moonlight serenade
627   but the gay bird with blushing breast
628      and woodlarks still will haunt the shade
629   and by the borders of the spring
630   reedwrens will yet be carolling

631   the forest hermits lonely cave
632      none but such soothing sounds shall reach
633   or hardly heard the distant wave
634      slow breaking on the stony beach
635   or winds that now sigh soft and low
636   now make wild music as they blow

637   and then before the chilling north
638      the tawny foliage falling light
639   seems as it flits along the earth
640      the footfall of the busy sprite
641   who wrapt in pale autumnal gloom
642   calls up the mistborn mushroom

643   oh could i hear your soft voice there
644      and see you in the forest green
645   all beauteous as you are more fair
646      yould look amid the sylvan scene
647   and in a woodgirls simple guise
648   be still more lovely in mine eyes

649   ye phantoms of unreal delight
650      visions of fond delirium born
651   rise not on my deluded sight
652      then leave me drooping and forlorn
653   to know such bliss can never be
654   unless — loved like me


655   the visionary nursing dreams like these
656   is not indeed unhappy summer woods
657   wave over him and whisper as they wave
658   some future blessings he may yet enjoy
659   and as above him sail the silver clouds
660   he follows them in thought to distant climes
661   where far from the cold policy of this

662   dividing him from her he fondly loves
663   he in some island of the southern sea
664   may haply build his caneconstructed bower
665   beneath the breadfruit or aspiring palm
666   with long green foliage rippling in the gale
667   oh let him cherish his ideal bliss—
668   for what is life when hope has ceasd to strew
669   her fragile flowers along its thorny way
670   and sad and gloomy are his days who lives
671   of hope abandond

671                                             just beneath the rock
672   where beachy overpeers the channel wave
673   within a cavern mined by wintry tides
674   dwelt one who long disgusted with the world
675   and all its ways appeard to suffer life

676   rather than live the soulreviving gale
677   fanning the beanfield or the thymy heath
678   had not for many summers breathed on him
679   and nothing markd to him the seasons change
680   save that more gently rose the placid sea
681   and that the birds which winter on the coast
682   gave place to other migrants save that the fog
683   hovering no more above the beetling cliffs
684   betrayd not then the little careless sheep
685   on the brink grazing while their headlong fall
686   near the lone hermits flintsurrounded home
687   claimd unavailing pity for his heart
688   was feelingly alive to all that breathd
689   and outraged as he was in sanguine youth
690   by human crimes he still acutely felt
691   for human misery
691                                             wandering on the beach
692   he learnd to augur from the clouds of heaven
693   and from the changing colours of the sea
694   and sullen murmurs of the hollow cliffs
695   or the dark porpoises that near the shore
696   gambold and sported on the level brine
697   when tempests were approaching then at night
698   he listend to the wind and as it drove
699   the billows with oerwhelming vehemence
700   he starting from his rugged couch went forth
701   and hazarding a life too valueless
702   he waded thro the waves with plank or pole
703   towards where the mariner in conflict dread
704   was buffeting for life the roaring surge
705   and now just seen now lost in foaming gulphs
706   the dismal gleaming of the clouded moon
707   shewd the dire peril often he had snatchd
708   from the wild billows some unhappy man
709   who livd to bless the hermit of the rocks
710   but if his generous cares were all in vain
711   and with slow swell the tide of morning bore
712   some blue swoln corse to land the pale recluse
713   dug in the chalk a sepulchre—above
714   where the dank seawrack markd the utmost tide
715   and with his prayers performd the obsequies
716   for the poor helpless stranger

716                                             one dark night
717   the equinoctial wind blew south by west
718   fierce on the shore—the bellowing cliffs were shook
719   even to their stony base and fragments fell
720   flashing and thundering on the angry flood
721   at daybreak anxious for the lonely man
722   his cave the mountain shepherds visited
723   tho sand and banks of weeds had choakd their way—
724   he was not in it but his drowned corse
725   by the waves wafted near his former home
726   receivd the rites of burial those who read
727   chiseld within the rock these mournful lines
728   memorials of his sufferings did not grieve
729   that dying in the cause of charity
730   his spirit from its earthly bondage freed
731   had to some better region fled for everembed"
