lay on me lay on me
lay on me lay on me

verse 1
one look at your eyes and i cave in
one taste of the life now i crave it
its not too late to die for a reason
fall down on the sword you were swingin’

prechorus
i wanted to dress a blade up in red with both our of necks
but i wasnt able and i wasnt stable i guess
but nevertheless i’m fuckin depressed i hide it with sex and drink til its fatal
its so fucking painful its a mess

chorus
so give me somethin beautiful
so give mе somethin else
i need anothеr miracle
i really need some help
i need a miracle

verse 2
who’s left when we’re all for the takin
no lives left to bet on obeyin’
what are we callin it and what does it cost
what are we callin it and what does it cost
in over my head when you found me
i love you to death but im drowning
what are we callin’ it and what does it cost
what are we callin it and what does it cost

so give me somethin beautiful
so give me somethin else
i need another miracle
i need some fuckin help i need a miracle

prechorus
so give me somethin beautiful

chorus
so give me somethin beautiful
so give me somethin else
i need another miracle
i need some fuckin help i need a miracle
