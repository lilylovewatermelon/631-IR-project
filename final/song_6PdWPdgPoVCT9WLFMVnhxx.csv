air in my lungs
til the road begins
as the last of the bugs
leave their homes again
and im splitting the road down the middle
for a minute the world seemed so simple

verse 2
feel the rush of my blood
im seventeen again
i am not scared of death
ive got dreams again
its just me and the curve of the valley
and there is meaning on earth i am happy

prechorus
oh ohoh oh oh oh oh

chorus
passed alger brook road im over the bridge
a minute from home but i feel so far from it
the death of my dog the stretch of my skin
its all washin over me im angry again
the things that i lost here the people i knew
they got me surrounded for a mile or two
the cars in reverse im grippin the wheel
im back between villages and everythings stillsee noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeembed"
