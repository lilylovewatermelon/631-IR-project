next stop chicago
its such a long long train ride
its such a long lonely ride back home

verse
now i know only i can stop the rain
uh uh uh uh uh
now i know only i can stop the rain
its not that we gotta do what we do
its what we know
so to me it aint nothin but bein true but
now i know only i can stop the rain
it doesnt have to be the way it is you say it is
just because for the past 20 years every day it is what
now i know only i can stop the rain
i wanna be able to walk out my front door
without worryin about comin to conflict with the law cause
now i know only i can stop the rain
if i follow him theyll follow me
and ill speak life into the words that you can see cause
now i know cmon only i can stop the rain
we get away with it everyday shit
but everyday shit catches up with you and when it does you cant say shit
now i know only i can stop the rain
if i dont you will what i wont you still
what makes us feel like we gots to kill when
now i know only i can stop the rain
how many more lives must we lose
how many more times must we choose to trust these fools
now i know only i can stop the rain
if it aint broke dont fix it i gave it to you straight
dont mix it twist it what up for some slick shit
now i know only i can stop the rain
i dont have to talk to it anymore
i dont have to walk to it anymore im out the door what
now i know only i can stop the rain
i wanna find peace with the lord
i dont wanna find a beast with the sword i cant afford to
now i know only i can stop the rain
when everyday of my life
is just a constant fight between wrong and right
now i know only i can stop the rain
i thank you lord for my life
i thank you lord for keeping it loose when things got tight
now i know only i can stop the rain
only i can stop the rain
only i can stop the pain
now i know only i can stop the rain
only i can stop the rain stop the rain
only i can stop the rain
only i can stop the rain because the rain calls on me
now i know only i can stop the rain
only i can stop the rain
