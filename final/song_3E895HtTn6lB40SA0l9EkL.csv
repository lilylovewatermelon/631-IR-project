now its time to sit back and enjoy creation
see what jah has done
every time she tops me off its celebration yeah
what has life become
and we dont talk too much
could this be a strange new love ive got
plus shes always got that loud pack
inspiration for this soundtrack
every time she throws that ass back all she says is

chorus daniel caesar
take me away
take me away
take me away
take me away

verse 2 daniel caesar
every time i go inside of your protected
place with reverence
im reminded of a time i was neglected
it seems youre heaven sent
she loves to top me off
shes cut from the finest cloth my love
plus we like to take it easy
all she wants to do is please me
every time im on that tv calls me up says
