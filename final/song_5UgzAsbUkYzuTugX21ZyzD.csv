oh wildly coherent in a watery deep
well drop her down to the bottom
well drop her down like shes nothing
and the water is all

verse 2
oh the water is still in a wilder deep
well swim around like two dories

let loose in the bay

prechorus
well miss the eddy
hold on make steady go
there is no plenty
even keel already go

chorus
i cant be here all hours oh such a riot
i cant discern this trouble oh what a riot
i cant be here all hours oh such a riot
i cant describe

chorus
i cant be here all hours oh such a riot
i cant describe this problem oh what a riot
i cant be here all hours oh such a riot
i cant describe this problem
