we both take the hardest punches
and collect black eyes just to prove it
still we pass by just like strangers
and we speak just like the closest enemies

chorus
woah in the shadows of our life
we can fall into the night unscarred
woah in the shadows of our life
we can never let it go this far

verse 2
somehow my words are rendered useless
still i pull my lip down to my chest
just to show you how my jaw is
tired from waiting to say the things that you should hear you should hear

chorus
woah in the shadows of our life
we can fall into the night unscarred
woah in the shadows of our life
we can never let it go this far

verse 3
after all were still the same
these empty promises seem to never change
theres a smile on my face and its 255 am
and this cramp in my wrist puts me back asleep till it all comes around again

with a closed fist
with a closed fist
with a closed fist
with a closed fist

chorus
woah in the shadows of our life
we can fall into the night unscarred
woah in the shadows of our life
we can never let it go this far

chorus
woah in the shadows of our life
we can fall into the night unscarred
woah in the shadows of our life
we can never let it go this farembed"
