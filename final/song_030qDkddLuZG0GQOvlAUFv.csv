some people wish
some people dance
some never take a chance
some people steal
just for the thrill
and some drink to get their fill
but i love you

verse 2
some people preach
some people write
and some choose to just stay quiet
some people teach
some people roam
some would rather be alone
but i love you yeah

verse 3
some people hurt
some people laugh
and some just dont know what they have
but i love you
baby i love you
