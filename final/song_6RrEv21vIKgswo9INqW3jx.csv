now this is a story all about how
these chicks get tricked and dont know how
so id like to take a second and explain to them
how all this craziness evolves out of relationships listen
he never used to hit you he always used to treat you
with some respect and dignity and now he wanna beat you
six months done passed and hes changed
you never would have thought hed be crazy and deranged huh
just the way he approached was so sweet
he let you know you was far away from a late night creep
mister telephone man when he whatnt with you
bobby browny and whitney you found you a new edition
right in the beginning it was grinings from the sit down
til he let you know that it was all on a bitch now
when after you had you a baby he wanna start
arguing his excuse to start sipping the remy mar
tin darkening this relationship
now every lady grab your bics if you relate to this
you need to get up out those drawers
and put on some lip gloss throw on a thong
now make your way to the closet and

chorus krizz kaliko

no time for thinkin of em
verse 3 tech n9ne
feel like i was put here for the female species
hella listening watching whispering offerings no feces
when the back is obese we double back and go deeply
in her life in her mind never hate butll go extra time if need be
easy for me to connect so peep me
in the club i take her some place we can talk discretely
youre creep free definitely that heats me
your bodys wop bobba lu bop so hot baby teach me
how to get up inside it ride it chakras are now ignited
thats a beautiful smile dont hide it
getting tech the n9ne excited
stress free i bet she so nestle
wanna know how wicked the sex be dont test me
drink your drink eat your cherry and tie the stem
this is your world mommy aint said a damn thing about him

chorus krizz kaliko
fuck em girl fuck em

its your time to get out
no time for thinkin of emembed"
