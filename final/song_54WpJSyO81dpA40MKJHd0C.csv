verse 3 blackbear
yeah i got this heartshaped hole inside of me
i try to fill with anything
like taking trips and buying things
burn bridges that once guided me
and i hate the way i watched you leave
my ego got the best of me
i gave you insecurities these tears fall on my bentley seats
and now all i feel is depressed all that i taste is regret
i cannot tell what is real only the pain that i feel
you give me nothing but stress and this echo echo echo echo
you left in my chest
