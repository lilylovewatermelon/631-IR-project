i did my best to make it to 27
open up my eyes and i can see the glory
now im alive and can tell the story

now im a superstar in the making
i aint fucking around and there aint no mistaking
i never ask for something worth the taking
cause im a superstar baby

no cryingass bitching about my wife or girlfriend
cause in my life i cant have either one
no cryingass bitching about my evil parents
they did their best to raise their only son

now im a superstar in the making
i aint fucking around and there aint no mistaking
i never ask for something worth the taking
cause im a superstar baby

im on the rise im feeling fine i see it through
im on the rise
boom here come the real motherfuckers from the south

now im a superstar in the making
i aint fucking around and there aint no mistaking
i never ask for something worth the taking
cause im a superstar babyyou might also likeembed"
