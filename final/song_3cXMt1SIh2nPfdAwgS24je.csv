we had a dog named bocephus living in the front yard
he liked sleeping out on the top of the car
he drank beer out of the mason jar
and hed climb up on everyone in bed
a white frame house a college town
a bunch of people always hanging around
no real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
we went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

chorus
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didnt really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet

verse 2
this old guitar taught me how to score right there on the lambda chi porch
mary ann taught me a little more about wanting what you cant have
sweatshirts and flag football spring breaks down in panama
for a while we had it all we never dreamed it wouldnt last
we went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

chorus
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didnt really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
we all kind of went our separate ways but i swear it seems like yesterday

chorus
we had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor
left over from the night before
where we were going we didnt really care
we had all we ever wanted
in that keg in the closet1embed"
