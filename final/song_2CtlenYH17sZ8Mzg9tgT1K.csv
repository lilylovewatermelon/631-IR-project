hard news taken harder dont look to me
disappointed we dont agree we dont need your praise
dont look my way for help from the beginning you came to me
never asked you to like me
we dont need your praise we wont play your games
look down on me spit in my face
youre nothing to me
not to me

chorus
darkened eyes youll see
there is no hope no savior in me
dont look this way dont breathe this way
dont stare this way anymore
learned from years gone by
no one will care what happens to me
dont look this way dont breathe this way
dont stare this way anymore

verse 2
my presence wont be ignored no not today
dont walk in my direction turn the other way
dont look my way for help from the beginning you came to me
asking questions predetermined answers
you wont find them here we dont want your praise
and i dont want you i wont let you think
compromise is near
cause its not near

darkened eyes youll see
there is no hope no savior in me
dont look this way dont breathe this way
dont stare this way anymore
learned from years gone by
no one will care what happens to me
dont look this way dont breathe this way
dont stare this way anymore

bridge
im alone in here
no more feelings
killed my fears
dont ask
youll never know
youre left behind and ill be exposed

outro
far away you keep on trying
holding me down breaking away
trying to distance my life
not one in the crowd one with the answer
one that could change your mind
but its not true i dont need you
dont waste your time and dont waste mine
im not your friend wont soothe your soul
and in the end youre all dead to me4embed"
