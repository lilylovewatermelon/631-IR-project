i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame
i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame

verse
wont you stop messing round
why you lie to yourself girl
girl you look like a clown
is your dignity left girl
dont act like you didnt know
what i wasnt noticed for
girl dont act like you dont know
that i didnt love her so

chorus
i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame
i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame
i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame
i dont even love you girl
only want you for your touch
and sometimes im so ashamed
baby who am i to blame
