always runnin like im racing world keeps spinnin while im trying to chase it down
always sooner never later and i only know one way to slow it down
i wanna hear you breathin feel your head there on my shoulder
man this whole crazy life is movin way to fast

chorus
i wanna dance real slow
put your arms around me
let me hold you close
girl i want to hear you tell me
dont let go
i love it when we dance real slow

verse 2
we can go out honkytonkin or stay here where no ones watchin me and you
light a candle in the kitchen i can clear a spot out if you want me to
put on a record find a station on the radio
if its too rockin all we gotta do is close our eyes and

chorus
dance real slow
put your arms around me
let me hold you close
girl i want to hear you tell me
dont let go
i love it when we dance real slow
see easton corbin liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likebridge
like were the only people left in the world
there aint nobody here but me and you girl
what you say we give it a whirl

outro
girl i want to hear you tell me
dont let go
i love it when we dance real slowembed"
