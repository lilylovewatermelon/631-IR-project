im so paranoid im all encased and i cant escape
and when i look up mothers looking down
and when i wake up mothers not around

so if you want
you can have everything that ive got
so if you want
you can take it all away from me
away from me
away from me
away from me

nobodys perfect but you just cant see
my lifes a circus that you dont believe
youre sayin something but not coming clean
now when i look up mothers livin shes livin in her dreams

so if you want
you can have everything that ive got
so if you want
you can take it all away from me
away from me
away from me
away from me
you might also likeso if youre unsatisfied
well ill watch you wave goodbye
so if you want
you can take it all away from me

please dont come down and see me this way
please dont come down im too afraid
please dont come down and see me this way
please dont come down well im too afraidembed"
