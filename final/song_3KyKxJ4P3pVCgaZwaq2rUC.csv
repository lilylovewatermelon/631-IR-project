its 5 am my time again
ive soakin up the moon cant sleep
its 5 am my time again
im calling and you know its me
im pushin myself further
im just tryin to feel my heartbeat beat beat
i wrap my hands around your neck
you love it when i always squeeze
its 5 am im high again
and you can see that im in pain ooh ooh
ive fallen into emptiness
i want you cause were both insane
im staring into the abyss
im lookin at myself again
im dozing off to rem
im trying not to lose my faith

chorus
and i love it when you watch me sleep
you spin me round so i can breathe
its only safe for you and me
i know you wont let me od
and if i finally die in peace
just wrap my body in these sheets sheets
and pour out the gasolinе
it dont mean much to me

its 5 am im nihilist
i know therеs nothing after this after this
obsessing over aftermaths
apocalypse and hopelessness hopelessness
the only thing i understand
is zero sum of tenderness tenderness
oh baby please just hold me close
make me believe theres more to live

bridge
around around around around we go
in this game called life we are not free

chorus
and i love it when you watch me sleep
you spin me round so i can breathe
its only safe for you and me dont let me go
i know you wont let me od dont you let me go
and if i finally die in peace oh yeah
just wrap my body in these sheets
and pour out the gasoline
it dont mean much to me43embed"
