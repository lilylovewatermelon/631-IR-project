im always on the road
youre always all alone
and im not always there when im at home
but im ready for a little change
im ready to accept some blame
so lets back up to yesterday

chorus
lets get back in love
back to dreaming of
all those little things we used to do
lets start holding hands
lets start making plans
honey lets get back to me and you

verse 2
its not like it was
when we fell in love
when all we had was enough
well i dont like the blues
i like love thats true
honey lets get back to me and you
