well i went to bed in memphis
and i woke up in hollywood
i got a quarter in my pocket
and id call you if i could
but i dont know why
i gotta fly
i wanna rock and roll this party
i still wanna have some fun
i wanna leave you feeling breathless
show you how the west was won
but i gotta fly
i gotta fly

and im gonna make it all right woo woo
like steve mcqueen
underneath your radar screen
youll never catch me tonight woo woo

verse 4
we got rockstars in the white house
and all our pop stars look like porn
all my heroes hit the highway
cause they dont hang out here no more

bridge
cause you can try me on my cell phone
you can page me all night long
but you wont catch this free bird
ill already be long gone

chorus
like steve mcqueen
all we needs a fast machine
and were gonna make it all right woo woo
like steve mcqueen
underneath your radar screen
youll never catch us tonight woo woo
like steve mcqueen
all we needs a fast machine
and were gonna ride it all night woo woo
like steve mcqueen
underneath your radar screen
youll never catch me tonight woo wooembed"
