got a criminal record i cant cross state lines
first on the bad list and youre last on mine
lookin for a scapegoat long past due
walking down the aisle staring straight at you

chorus
i still hear him screaming where do i hide
and he asks and i say hurry inside

verse
he said she said no she dont
be back before morning you know she wont
i remember that summer like yesterday
and i remember his mother as he was dragged away

chorus
i still hear him screaming where do i hide
and he asks and i say hurry inside
a whole lot of memories yours and not mine
and he asks and i say hurry inside

prechorus
got a criminal record i cant cross state lines
first on the bad list and youre last on mine
lookin for a scapegoat long past due
walking down the aisle staring straight at you

and he asks and i say hurry inside
a whole lot of memories yours and not mine
and he asks and i say hurry inside
