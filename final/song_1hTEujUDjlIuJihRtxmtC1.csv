chorus
all you do is lose you come in last i come in first
all she want me to do is make her laugh and take off her shirt
when i fuck my bitch i dont even make her take off her skirt
cause when we fuck and split yeah she know ima make her cum first
if you aint talkin money lil boy i dont wanna converse
and before i do anything i roll up a blunt and pour some syrup
and when im not high its easy for you to get on my nerves
and if the feds catch me they gon try and put me under the dirt
