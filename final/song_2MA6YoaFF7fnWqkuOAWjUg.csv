driftin
huh huh huh tokyo driftin

verse 1 dave bayley
two things bout the gears you better listen up
chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
suck smoke in his 40 windows up
he rolls like he really doesnt give a
drug lust and two packets in your pocket
disco dust hits your nose like a rocket

bridge dave bayley
doodoodoo doo doodoodoodoodoo
doodoodoo doo doodoodoodoodoo

verse 2 dave bayley

fresh footwork drippin out of you onto the rug
