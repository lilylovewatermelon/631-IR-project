no clouds to hide the sun
waves playing me a symphony upon the sand
as i lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand

sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
your memory my company
something bout this place had a way to make you smile
you always loved the sound of waves
the wind whistling cross my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
that tomorrow you wont be here with me
so i raise it up and toast the day we met
wont forget the way you love me amazing way you love me

chorus
its bittersweet you see
youre not here but i can feel you
every memory is on the tip of my tongue
close my eyes see your face hold on tight to yesterday
and when i wake it was just a dream
its bittersweet

doctor said theres nothing we can do
took my hand said take me home
to the only place half a chance to take the pain away
let me feel alive before i go
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeyou said life is only borrowed
so lets wash away our sorrow
that tomorrow i won’t be here with you
go and live your life with no regrets
and don’t forget how much i love you
i love you

chorus
its bittersweet you see
youre not here but i can feel you
every memory is on the tip of my tongue
close my eyes see your face hold on tight to yesterday
praying when i wake it was just a dream
its bittersweet
i brought you back just like you wanted
so you dont ever have to leave
and when i poured you across the southern sky
i couldnt help but to cry
i know you finally got your wings

bittersweet
oh

the wind whistling across my bottle
still cant blow away the sorrow
that tomorrow you won’t be here with me
so i raise it up and toast the day we met
wont forget the way you love me amazing way you love me
