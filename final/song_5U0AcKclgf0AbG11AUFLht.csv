down by the river i was drawn by your grace
into tempest of oblivion and to the lovers place
i was stucked in a puddle full of tears and unwise dark doings
now i know that weve paid unlike
honey i know hey when we walked arm in arm
i felt like we can throw away the falseness of our past
and i know too its been the hardest days for you
lets throw them out the window thats what those lovers do
