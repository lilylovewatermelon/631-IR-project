you are wrong fucked and overrated
i think im gonna be sick and its your fault
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything
i havent slept since i woke up
and found my whole life was a lie motherfucker
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything

verse 1
shallow skin i can paint with pain
i mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
every day its the same i love you hate
but i guess i dont care anymore
oh fix my problems with the blade
while my eyes turn from blue to gray
god the worst thing happened to me today
but i guess i dont care anymore aah
fuck

chorus
you are wrong fucked and overrated
i think im gonna be sick and its your fault
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything
i havent slept since i woke up
and found my whole life was a lie motherfucker
this is the end of everything
you are the end of everything
