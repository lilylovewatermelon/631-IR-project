the mood is feeling right
ill kiss you on your neck
people will stare but we wont care
were high above the ground
were nowhere to be found
empowered by adrenaline
feel like im born again
again i am repeating myself
and i know it is time for you
to sit and pretend

damn regret
ill try to forget
dont worry about me
cause ill be fine
cast my line
to see whats behind
did you think youd persuade me to let you go

im wishing you were here
my weakness is my fear
alone i am myself
no reason left for me to care
distracted by the sound
i hear footsteps all around
empowered by adrenaline
feel like im born again
again i am repeating myself
and i know it is time for you
to sit and pretend
you might also likedamn regret
ill try to forget
dont worry about me
cause ill be fine
cast my line
to see whats behind
did you think youd persuade me to let you go

youre the only one i turn to
when i feel like no ones there
and when im lonely in my darkest hour
you give me the power
to sit and pretend

damn regret
ill try to forget
dont worry about me
cause im real fine
cast my line
to see whats behind
did you think youd persuaded me to let you go

did you think id forget
did you think id surrender myself to persuade you to let me go

did you think id forget
did you think id surrender myself to persuade you to let me goembed"
