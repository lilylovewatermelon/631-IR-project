20 years of schooling
i just never learned the math
that one and one dont equal two
they often equal half
i have tried to live the high life
the best that i know how
and i bought my share of debonair
and parlayed it on the crowd

chorus
i do believe that theres no more tricks up my sleeve
the good old days have past and the good times after that
and slowly ive become undone
a stranger with a stranger heart

verse 2
well i plan to hit the bottom
the bottle then the top
and i pray that something quits me
before i gotta stop
because the masquerade is over
but i was barely there
the mask come off the gilded cloth
yet im just barely here

oh and i
i do believe that theres no more tricks up my sleeve
the good old days have past and the good times after that
and slowly ive become undone
a stranger with a stranger heartembed"
