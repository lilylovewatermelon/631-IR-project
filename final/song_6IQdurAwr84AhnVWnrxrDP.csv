wallow in the winter of it
discover what you truly covet
underneath and far above it
you slither in all kinds of shit
how could you forget about it
did you think you could minimize
this is the age of consent
youll get a day in the sun before i kill your fucking lights
burn up in your atmosphere
burn up in your utmost fear
desecrate your temples
only hell and hate remain
dont look for crows to scatter
prepare for judgment day

refrain
we are kill gods
yeah

verse 2
the kings are falling down
can i find a way to get there
bury your head in the ground
will you falsify for your fair share
when its done its done plus negative one
its everybodys guess but the apathy won
will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion
or will you settle for oblivion
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeyeah

refrain
we are kill gods

chorus
we we make this world worth saving
are are you prepared to believe
kill kill everything that kills you
gods live long and die for me

bridge
rape crutch and sick in the middle of evidence bag
thatll never obey
all these years spent hiding all the bodies
i can never be sure but i remember the graves

refrain
we are kill gods

chorus
we we make this world worth saving
are are you prepared to believe
kill kill everything that kills you
gods live long and die for me
outro
live long and die for me
live long and die for me19embed"
