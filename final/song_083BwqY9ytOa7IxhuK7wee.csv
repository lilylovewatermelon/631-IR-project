might not make it this time
is what not to say at this time
sometimes the truth aint what you need to hear
and you tell them they alright knowing they need a cure
how imma believe in paradise if i dont see the sand
only palm trees i got is this weed off in my hand
around the same time my mom said sean you need a plan
miss freemans son across the street got shot now she need a hand
traumatized god oh whys his momma cry
now i gotta look up up in his momma eyes gotta tell this momma lies
like its gonna be alright knowing it aint alright
and i know its so much pain and theres probably more on the way

verse 2
you know i love you momma like she mine
whether we together or we trying
we fuck three times we smoke tree times
we climb i left came back in town it wasnt in time
the cancer done came it just hit its prime
it came from the breast just spread to the spine
it might make her blind she stare at the blinds
this cant be my mom
got me thinking whats a girl to do a girl to do
when her worlds a pool
and she comes up for air and its walls of flames
and all the stress is all propane
shes burned again
hoping i could make her smile
take cancer and david blaine it out
poof disappear god make an out

hook james fauntleroy and big sean
now when the worlds ablaze the stars will fall
the lights go off
say its going to be alright
its going to be alright
cause when the worlds ablaze the stars will fall
the lights go off
say its going to be alright
its going to be alright
posthook james fauntleroy  big sean
just tell me itll be tell me itll be
tell me itll be tell me itll be
tell me itll be tell me itll be
tell me itll be tell me itll be
