you gotta dodge the pots an pans on the floor when it rains
theres a tenpoint buck on my livin room wall
a squirrel and two ducks are hangin in the hall
that hole in my yard is a barbecue pit
a couple times a year well throw a hog in it
theres a fourwheel drive parked in my driveway
im a proud and active member of the nra

hey im country i was born and raised in it
im country thats my kind of livin
white beans collard greens sweet tea chicken and dumplins
well i get up every mornin when the rooster crows
i stay out some nights until the cows come home
im dogrunnin deerhuntin fishcatchin cowtippin
haybalin peapickin country

well theres my mama in the rockin chair by my screen door
the red white and blue hangs off of my front porch
theres my darlin in the garden pickin black eyed peas
kids are bouncin up and down on the trampoline
my truck cost less than my champion coon dog
my neck is painted red by the grace of god
my kids say please sir thank you and maam
i aint what i aint but i am what i am
