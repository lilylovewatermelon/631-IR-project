verse 1
yes seven cars eight cribs and aint a damn thing changed
im still pumpin ten kickers still grippin the grain
still candy in the paint still ridin them things
and most my folks would say im happy but i still feel pain
until i jump in my ride thats my only escape
me and my automobiles got these neighbors screaming give me a break
its a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
dont be mad cause i cant hold my five hundred horses
lamborghinis and porsches ferraris and vipers
ima wipe the seats with your drool then rub the hood with a diaper
television on the gas tank the fuel make the ass stink
i mean to be rude my bass tubes are in a glass tank
go strap your seatbelts on go put your money up
go put your life on the line go put your honey up
go spread the word run and tell all the boys
its time to play or better yet its time to bring out them toys

verse 2
yo one of my ways of releasin tension while im releasin some steam
even if i just put a fresh coat of wax on im makin sure the slippers is clean
the twentysixes is mean shut down the block you could picture the fiends
my system supreme you could feel the knock just picture the scene
the chickens just scream whole crew ballin they sick of my team
we gettin the cream im through hollerin im livin my dream
im black with a scheme wont stop until that fat lady sings
and yeah its actual and factual what my faculty brings
a car show for wherever we slide and wherever we glide
you can keep your rules and regulations man cause we dont abide
and we lookin alive mercedes benz six or the five
in a beamer lexus or ac we dont know how to act when we drive
and i fiend for the ride i lay back and lean to the side
onlookers and turnin heads is all thats seen through his eyes
im breezin on by and no doubt its easy to fly
but its even better when you slow down or ease to the side
and go
