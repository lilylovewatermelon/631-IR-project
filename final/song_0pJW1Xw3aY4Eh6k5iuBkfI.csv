somewhere in germany but i cant place it
man i hate this part of texas
close my eyes fantasize
three clicks and im home
when i get back ill lay around
then ill get up and lay back down
romanticize a quiet life
theres no place like my room

chorus
but you had to go i know i know i know
like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
not even the burnouts are out here anymore
and you had to go i know i know i know

verse 2
out in the park we watch the sunset
talkin on a rusty swing set
after a while you went quiet
and i got mean
im always pushin you away from me
but you come back with gravity
and when i call you come home
a bird in your teeth

so i gotta go i know i know i know
when the sirens sound youll hide under the floor
but im not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
im gonna chase it i know i know i know
i gotta go now i know i know i know

verse 3
drivin out into the sun
let the ultraviolet cover me up
went looking for a creation myth
ended up with a pair of cracked lips
windows down scream along
to some america first rapcountry song
a slaughterhouse an outlet mall
slot machines fear of god
windows down heater on
big bolt of lightning hanging low
over the coast everyones convinced
its a government drone or an alien spaceship
either way were not alone
ill find a new place to be from
a haunted house with a picket fence
to float around and ghost my friends
no im not afraid to disappear
the billboard said the end is near
i turned around there was nothing there
yeah i guess the end is here
outro
the end is here
the end is here
the end is here
the end is48embed"
