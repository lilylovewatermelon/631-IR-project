the devils going to make me a free man
the devils going to set me free
oh the devils going to make me a free man
the devils going to set me free

verse 1
i went down deep texas mississippi state
hoping things might go my way
for every hardearned dollar i make
there stands a white man just to take it away
some might say i talk loud see if i care
unlike them dont walk away from my fear
ive busted bones broken stones looked the devil in the eye
i hope hes going to break these chains oh yeah

chorus
the devils going to make me a free man
the devils going to set me free
the devils going to make me a free man
the devils going to set me free

yeah set me free

verse 2
another hard day no water no rest
i saw my chance so i got him at last
i took his sixshooter put two in his chest
hell never say a word no more
oh hell never say a word no more
the devil got him good for sure
