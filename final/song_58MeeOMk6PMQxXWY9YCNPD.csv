12 12 yes
yo its king geedorah combined with the forces of nine ether
blowing woofers and tweeters shaking syllable meters
disasters cataclysmic mystic natural
its about time we hit yall with some substance thats actual
i got a gift called hiphop prophecy
since 2003 ends the reign of the jiggy mc
no more roaming on this planet like scavengers
scientists broke the code of the gregorian calendar
defying laws of space and time
trying to trace my lines hold up respect the architect
digital roland my whole crew roll with vs
type to master this whole universe in three steps
we stretch across the equator with something major
universal rhyme tones tamper with ya time zone
minds blown by the millions just for the feeling
hiphop it just dont stop until i make a killing
nah im kidding but for real
the world aint the same no more
take your life to next level or remain no more
take your life to next level or remain no more
word up word up

verse 2 id 4 winds
well im colliding with the mind of a
survivor surviving uncover the time brother
the high volume wide column height slalom
preferred jog on the side
dodgin mirages conquer the vibe hunger lurks
nine to five work saga god bless the life
father trife travel to light
balance the globe off life vocal pimpin its throat
so you know how it go down yo
struggle in the ghetto yo
metal throat settle the dough live showbiz
the cannonball weapon man at arms four section
super intelligence balance benevolent stinging nettle medicine
crouch tiger dragon craftmatic
watch ya back if catch this passes through the atlas
first class diplomatic status stagma flag
then overstanding the plan
bar scan identify camera shots
streets watch timex clocks
punch lunch on the dot five minutes to rock
so we blew block crews its old news how we do

verse 3 empress stahhr
imma drop one rhyme for every time i cross the thin line
between yours and mine see its part of my design
shifting paradigm yin and yang combined
must be out ya mind thinking stahhr would never shine
props due focused with a hawks eye view uh
im all that a plantain and some ital stew
gettin spinach british atl to venice
even abercrombie figures open off of this verb elixir
magnetic attraction raw as millie jackson
straight openin the captions here comes the hicks and braxton
lyrical contraction delivery reaction
it started with a passion thats just the way it happened
born with umbilical cords strapped to korgs
wonâ€™t drop a kurzweil hustling zip disk files
sharper than needles found no ivs for the feeble
yall fiending for the sequel and the beats not even eqd

we have a snake to catch10embed"
