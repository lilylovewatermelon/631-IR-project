i got that real good feel good stuff
up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
rollin on 35s pretty girl by my side
you got that sun tan skirt and boots
waiting on you to look my way and scoot
your little hot self over here
girl hand me another beer yeah

chorus
all them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
but you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
out where the corn rows grow row row my boat
floatin down the flint river catch us up a little catfish dinner
going to sound like a winner winner when i lay you down and love you right
yeah thats my kind of night

verse 2
might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
put in my countryrock hiphop mixtape
little conway a little tpain might just make it rain
you can hang your tshirt on a limb
hit that bank and we can ease on in
soak us up a little moonlight
you know i know what you like yeah
