rainy days i wish they would go away
rainy days i hope the sun will come out tomorrow
i dont want to drown in my sorrows

verse 1
i cant see the sun all i see is nimbus
all i feel is rain came to pay me a visit
im not too fond of this business
god you gon ahead just end it
it dont feel good to be in it
seconds feel like minutes

now its an overcast shades of grey
singing in the rain you can say im under the weather
if asked how im doing my reply ive been better uh uh

dont come back another day
to rain on my parade i dont want any delays to what i pray no shade
went from sonday to mundane
trying not to complain
what i feel so constrained
i need the sun please come again
this rain making me tired
no longer wanna try
its coming down real hard so ill just stay inside cause of
