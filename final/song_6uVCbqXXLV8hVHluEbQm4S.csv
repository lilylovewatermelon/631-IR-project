i found a box of memories
read a letter dropped a tear where you signed your name
and turning the page smearing the ink and the love always
girl i always start this way
then i end up in a bottle screaming out your name
and punching the walls carrying on like ive gone insane
and in the mirror i can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse
and watched an angel crying tears packing all of her things as she walked out the door

chorus
cause there aren’t nothing like a memory
when it’s coming on strong like a hurricane
how can love like that just up and walk away
it’s killing me baby
it’s got me pouring up another drink
bourbons hitting me hard like a freight train
with my back against a wall or on my knees
when the worst of your memory gets the best of me

verse 2
well i remember it all too well
riding 441 down to milledgeville
crossing the bridge as the sun set on lake sinclair
i couldn’t wait to see your smile but all i saw was tears in your pretty eyes
and that said it all it was all downhill from there
and i remember you saying baby please don’t give up on me
aw but baby this stubborn man is going to lie in the bed he made

cause there aren’t nothing like a memory
when it’s coming on strong like a hurricane
how can love like that just up and walk away
it’s killing me baby
it’s got me pouring up another drink
bourbons hitting me hard like a freight train
with my back against a wall or on my knees
when the worst of your memory gets the best of me

cause there aren’t nothing like a memory
when it’s coming on strong like a hurricane
how can love like that just up and walk away
it’s killing me baby
it’s got me pouring up another drink
bourbons hitting me hard like a freight train
with my back against a wall or on my knees
when the worst of your memory gets the best of me
