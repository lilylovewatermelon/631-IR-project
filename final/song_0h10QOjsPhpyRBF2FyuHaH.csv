i took that drip all the way cross the border
that two door maybach shit that came with some stars
i stood on this shit i dont get an award
all the new whips comin with a push start
i dont fear shit but i rock fear of god
took the spaceship and i landed on mars ah

verse 1
oh wheezy the wave need a board yeah
you rich when you make it on forbes yeah
we winnin stop checkin the score yeah
we can live with no warning
spur of the moment
but its war if you want it
get too much of this money buyin too many guns they treat me like a god
too many keys to these exotic cars
too many freaks i been fuckin a foreign
if you niggas fly then i must be airborne
wont pay you no mind and they gon pay me more
hopped in the coupe let the tesla charge
i keep the strap cause i really be knownin
i cant imagine my family poor
but i can see my mama in dior
we walk inside and they closin the store
you niggas aint drippin like gunna the boy
geekin up and its already a sport
jeep and its clanging the engine it roaring
fiending so much i dont know what to pour
in middle school when i jumped off the porch
good in the hood had to dodge all the narcs
i made it out gotta live with some scars
protectin your family you gotta go hard
the way my drip set that shit come with a scar
you might also likechorus
i took that drip all the way cross the border
that two door maybach shouldve came with some stars
i stood on this shit i dont get an award
all the new whips comin with a push start
i dont fear shit but i rock fear of god
took the spaceship and i landed on mars ah

verse 2
wheezy wave i got a board
balmain jeans cut like a sword
im drippin sauce like its sore
im one of the owners
car not a loaner
i want carats and pointers
i really fuck with lil shawty i pay for whatever she order
my brothers get jammed we cash out on a lawyer
gunna always have your back like a spoiler
some happen i gotta look out for your daughter
you cappin im rappin my shit you ignorin
saving the profit our business is growin
they felt sunny days and they wish for a storm
fly in the sky young nigga airborne
wiring account money come in all sorts
i really trapped out that honda accord
my chopper my pillow when im in the war
blue hundreds my reason lil nigga whats yours
she tell me she cummin im strokin it more
thinkin that time we go big like the hulk
feel me you thought i wouldnt make it at all
get rich and i still gotta duck all the law
shut the fuck up i dont need you to talk
i ran up the millions just watching you walk
you never gon win when you droppin the salt
chorus
i took that drip all the way cross the border
that two door maybach shouldve came with some stars
i stood on this shit i dont get an award
all the new whips comin with a push start
i dont fear shit but i rock fear of god
took the spaceship and i landed on mars ah2embed"
