yeah look

verse 1 eminem
if i were to rap about the crap thats out
thats the route you probably want me to take
‘cause youre just dyin to know what i think
and my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin about paul wall
youd probably crap in your pants ‘cause im white and hes white
so hes like my competition i mean right
nope paul wall is dope and so is bubba
so bububububububububut i dont compete with nobody
i just go hard do the ropeadope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometimes i play possum like im asleep its awesome
im like a sleepin giant and when i awake im like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
and sink my teeth in em and fill em
full of poison and make a noise like a snake before i kill em
and let em know that i just dont feel em
and smack em with the backward e the eminem emblem
i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
tell him why look him dead in the eye then waste him
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it gggoes
onetwothree chkchk onetwothree
chkchk onetwothree that aint the hook now follow me
theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me
everybody bores me theyre just so corny
so at night before i sleep i look in the mirror
the mirror grows lips and it whispers come nearer

ima get dre on the phone ill just call the doctor

i dont know it just seems like ever since you got off your
drugs you became a lot softer
but dre all shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
well just think about it slim im here

okay im still alive — so am i too
you cant kill a spirit even if you tried to
haha you sold your soul to me need i remind you
you remember that night you prayed to god
youd give anything to get a record deal well dre signed you
this is what you wanted your whole life marshall right ooh
look at this house look at these cars theyre so nice woo
oh but you didnt know fame has a price too
that you just now seeing the downside to
lose your best friend from high school your wife too
aint even sure if your kids like you
come off tour cant even sleep at night without nyquil
become a valium addict start a rehab cycle
but together we can break the cycle
marshall… — what — no ones gonna love you like i do
