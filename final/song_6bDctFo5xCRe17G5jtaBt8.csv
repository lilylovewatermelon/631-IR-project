by now
all the crowd’s arrived
in the front row
pairs of surly eyes
i can’t understand
trying to surmise
are they mad at me
what does this imply
now i’m panicking
dipping from the scene
driving lyndale ave
lost in glossy sheen
of the streetlights
with the slowmo bleed
it’s irrational
but it seems so real to me

verse 2 jeremiah jae
night still young still buzzing from the last one
shots fill the glass keep it coming down the hatch
‘till the bottom of the bottle the light’s fading black
let’s forget about tomorrow get lost in the acts
and the stage play out bounce off the crowd and react
but with positive come negative charge laws attract
i feel they energy feel like they talking to me without speaking
hear ‘em breathing eyes reading suddenly my mind speeding
what is this something in the air got me feeling like
dipping out in the ride checking the side lights
we just tryna get you that vibe so why you wanna jive
we could keep the moment alive but catch me outside
the one another one trying to get your mind right
but the cold still flooded now i’m trying to break the ice
with the device i’m on a mission to flip it and get your soul lifted
on the way up until we driftingyou might also likeembed"
