counting all different ideas drifting away
past and present they dont matter now the futures sorted out
watch her moving in elliptical patterns
think its not what you say what you say is way too complicated
for a minute thought i couldnt tell how to fall out

chorus
its twenty seconds til the last call
youre going hey hey hey hey hey hey
lie down you know its easy
like we did it over summer long
and ill be anything you ask and more
going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
its not a miracle we needed
and no i wouldnt let you think so
fold it fold it fold it fold it

verse 2
girlfriend oh your girlfriend is drifting away
past and present 18551901
watch them built up a material tower
think its not going to stay anyway think its overrated
for a minute thought i couldnt tell how to fall out

chorus
its twenty seconds til the last call
youre going hey hey hey hey hey hey
lie down you know its easy
like we did it over summer long
and ill be anything you ask and more
going hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
its not a miracle we needed
no i wouldnt let you think so
fold it fold it fold it fold it
