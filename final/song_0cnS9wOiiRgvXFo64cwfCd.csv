storms never last do they baby
bad times will pass with the winds
your hand in mine steals the thunder
you make the sun want to shine

oh i followed you down so many roads baby
i picked wild flowers and sung you soft sweet songs
and every road we took god knows our search was for the truth
and the storm brewin now wont be the last

storms never last do they jessie
bad times will pass with the winds
your hand in mine steals the thunder
you make the sun want to shine

storms never last do they jessie
bad times will pass with the winds
your hand in mine steals the thunder
you make the sun want to shine
