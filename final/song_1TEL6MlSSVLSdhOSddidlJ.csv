if you take too long to hit me back
i cant promise you how i’ll react
but all i can say is at least ill wait for you
lately ive been on a roller coaster
tryna get a hold of my emotions
but all that i know is i need you close

prechorus
i’ma scream and shout for what i love
passionate but i dont give no fucks
i admit that im a lil messed up
but i can hide it when im all dressed up
im obsessive and i love too hard
good at overthinking with my heart
how you even think it got this far this far

chorus
and i can be needy way too damn needy
i can be needy tell me how good it feels to be needed
i can be needy so hard to please me
i know it feels so good to be needed

verse 2
sorry if im up and down a lot yeah
sorry that i think im not enough
and sorry if i say sorry way too much
you can go ahead and call me selfish selfish
but after all this damage i can’t help it help it
but what you can trust is i need your touch
