this is the end
hold your breath and count to ten
feel the earth move and then
hear my heart burst again
for this is the end
ive drowned and dreamt this moment
so overdue i owe them
swept away im stolen

chorus
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
face it all together
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
face it all together at skyfall
at skyfall

verse 2
skyfall is where we start
a thousand miles and poles apart
where worlds collide and days are dark
you may have my number you can take my name
but youll never have my heart
see adele liveget tickets as low as 151you might also likechorus
let the sky fall let the sky fall
when it crumbles when it crumbles
we will stand tall we will stand tall
face it all together
let the sky fall let the sky fall
when it crumbles when it crumbles
we will stand tall we will stand tall
face it all together at skyfall

postchorus
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall

bridge
where you go i go
what you see i see
i know id never be me without the security
of your loving arms keeping me from harm
put your hand in my hand and well stand

chorus
let the sky fall let the sky fall
when it crumbles when it crumbles
we will stand tall we will stand tall
face it all together
let the sky fall let the sky fall
when it crumbles when it crumbles
we will stand tall we will stand tall
face it all together at skyfall
outro
let the sky fall
we will stand tall
at skyfall
