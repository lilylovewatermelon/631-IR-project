on our knees we pray as we waste away
and we dig our grave dead on arrival

verse 1 joyner lucas
i close my eyes and contemplate on why i chose to be great
i find myself tryna escape from where im supposed to be safe
or maybe i should pray like im supposed to be saved
sometimes i feel like getting even but i chose to behave
im mentally locked in a prison and i need bail
but the internet will kill me quicker than the streets will
and if that shit doesnt kill me then the police will
or maybe all the refills or the e pills or the lean will
i wish i was more flourished i wish i had more courage
i feel like theres more purpose and maybe its all worth it
i wanna keep on learning but i couldnt be more nervous when i keep looking for answers
and i gotta keep on searching the tables keep on turning
tryna call up to jesus but the phone keep on ringing
i think i need more service the calls seem more urgent
and all i see is more murders the soldiers keep on serving
i wonder if its all worth it i wonder

chorus brian burkheiser with eric vanlerberghe
on our knees we pray as we waste away
and we dig our grave dead on arrival
in this mess we made fill our lungs with hate
just to numb the pain dead on arrival
dead on arrival
dead on arrival

i cant breathe
got my head on the guillotine
slipknot around my neck come and take a seat
watch em bury me down til im six feet deep in the underground
dead is the land of the free
dont give just take every time you need
dont give just take though its killing me
dont give just take every time you need
dont give just take

chorus brian burkheiser with eric vanlerberghe

dead on arrival
dead on arrival
i cant breathe
