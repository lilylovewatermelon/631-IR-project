to why youre so blind
i covered your back again
and you better cover mine

if i turned and walked away
would you stick your knives in me
how much longer till you break
until i walk away walk away from you

give me one good reason
to why youre so unkind
you know i believe believe its tru
you know i believed in you
oh

if i turned and walked away
would you stick your knives in me
how much longer till you break
until i walk away walk away from you
walk away

if i turned and walked away
would you stick your knives in me
how much longer till you break
until i walk away from you

how much longer till you break
until i walk away
