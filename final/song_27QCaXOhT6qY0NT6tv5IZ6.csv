woke up this morning and it seemed to me
that every night turns out to be
a little bit more like bukowski
and yeah i know hes a pretty good read
but god whod wanna be
god whod wanna be such an asshole
god whod wanna be
god whod wanna be such an asshole

verse 2
well we sat on the edge of the river
the crowd screamed sacrifice the liver
if god takes life hes an indian giver
so tell me now why youll tell me never
who would wanna be
who would wanna be such a control freak
well who would wanna be
who would wanna be such a control freak

bridge 1
well see what you want to see
you should see it all
well take what you want from me
you deserve it all
nine times out of ten
our hearts just get dissolved
well i want a better place
or just a better way to fall
but one time out of ten
everything goes perfect for us all
well i want a better place
or just a better way to fall
here we go
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likeverse 3
if god controls the land and disease
and keeps a watchful eye on me
if hes really so damn mighty
well my problem is i cant see
well who would wanna be
who would wanna be such a control freak
well who would wanna be
who would wanna be such a control freak

bridge 2
evil home stereo
what good songs do you know
evil me oh yeah i know
what good curves can you throw

verse 4
well all that icing and all that cake
i cant make it to your wedding
but im sure ill be at your wake
you were talk talk talk talkin in circles that day
when you get to the point
make sure that im still awake okay

verse 5
i went to bed and didnt see
why every day turns out to be
a little bit more like bukowski
and yeah i know hes a pretty good read
but god whod wanna be
god whod wanna be such an asshole
