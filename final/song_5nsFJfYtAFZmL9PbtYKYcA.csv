she was gone before the morning came
down the fire escape
she went wild and wild
in my heart a burning flame
i thought it couldnt change
her mind and mine

prechorus
love was such a scary thing
you didnt want to fall
i didnt want you at all
now im waiting by a cold window
til the sun is gone

chorus
oh my my my oh my my my
now dont think twice
hold me up until you see the darkness
that i couldnt find lying by your side
hold me up until you see the light

postchorus
ohohoh ohohoh
ohohoh ohoohooh
oohooh oohooh

onwards we fumbled in the strangest way
but still were losing space
were tonguetied tonguetied
and both our shadows spun around the room
then into one from two we collide collide

prechorus
love was such a scary thing
you didnt want to fall
i didnt want you at all
now im waiting by a cold window
til the sun is gone

chorus
oh my my my oh my my my
now dont think twice
hold me up until you see the darkness
that i couldnt find lying by your side
hold me up until you see the light

postchorus
