what is a nightmare
the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare

verse 1
i used to think i had bad luck but i wasnt superstitious
til one day i grew suspicious
when i stepped on a crack on aunt ednas stoop
and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start anew but ditchin
missouri for michigan didnt work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan
from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i cant do this again
mom please stick to a decision
discipline last thing i wanna do is listen
shes like lex luthor bitchin’ her rules are kryptonite
so the walls i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into em runnin through the kitchen
pretendin to be blind superman cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion

interlude
i remember it clearly even today
you might also likeverse 2
move back to michigan again to live with my grandma nan
always itchin for somethin to do was flippin
through the radio stations one day
and discovered this dj who was mixin
i say it to this day if you aint listened to the wizard
you aint have a fuckin clue what you was missin
id zone out with my headphones
all i remember doings wishin for shoes
fuck them stupid pumas bitch
its all about them new edition troops
you get them ll cool j coolin system
made that final manoeuvre to 8 mile and hoover
and somehow i saw my future is in this
thats how i knew my mission
little boom box boomin spittin
practicin numerous writtens
when id sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit
couldnt wait to play him my new shit
hed go cuckoo ballistic go through the roof for his shit
its like we knew the instant
we touched a mic that both of us two existed
to do this shit never quit too persistent

interlude
carved an underground empire
verse 3
started a group of misfits proof had a proposition
if we all band together there aint no stoppin this shit
come up with aliases bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin
theyd take your spot if someone got to rippin
you and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once it aint knockin again
it tried dingdong ditchin shit i fuckin got that bitch in
a headlock cut off its oxygen slim
is not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind
now i got a pot to piss in
spot in that top position koppin over the opposition
lookin like a dog thats pissin leg up on the competition
promisin complete dominance sugar ray robinson
im in a league muhammads in
alis my colleague bombin em
probably end up on top of em
stompin em like ndamukong
im russian like a ukrainian ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme i spit in a rhymes face
so name the time place
to battle bitch im still in that mind state
dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies maybe my way that i use words
is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts – shit no wonder youre sore losers
now wheres your poo birds
ooh no more trippin in bird shit
songs of selfempowerment surgin
words of encouragement but discouragin
the rappers the rap games god
but the names not james todd im just a wordsmith
so let these words lift
cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells
since yours aint workin out each verse is
more merciless than the first is
and you aint got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
to get served bloodthirst revenge of the nerds chka
interlude
know too that youll not escape my vengeance

verse 4
but the dumpy kid with them ears like dumbos gone
word to uncle ron im turnin into a nonhumble don
you blonde dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so start the show but i need a drum roll fore i go on
better back away from the front row get launched
show you im bigger than dikembe mutumbo
on the fuckin jumbotron
im a juggernaut you do not wanna rumble you bomboclaats
ill leave you stretched out like a fuckin yawn
so mow the fuckin lawn your asses are blades of grass
and im fuckin up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres an eighth of that
was just to make a path
and take it straight to your favorite rapper
oh look my notebook looks smokecooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
charred debris floatin like oakwood
was burnin return of the no good and i wont quit

interlude
and the next thing i know
something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a blamed

chorus
and i dont quit wont change
its like a groundhogs day
so crowd around yall cause you mayay
see if i popped your head

bridge
im a monster mutt
ima turn into a monster
im a monster mutt
with my dick in your mouth all day hah

outro
im not so sure i want to know from whence it came
but the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed
there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing75embed"
