i am insensitive i have a tendency to
pay more attention to the things that i need
sometimes i drink too much sometimes i test your trust
sometimes i dont know why youre staying with me

chorus
im hard to love hard to love  no i dont make it easy
well i couldnt do it if i stood where you stood
im hard to love hard to love and you say that you need me
i dont deserve it but i love that you love me good

verse 2
i am a short fuse i am a wrecking ball
crashing into your heart like i do
youre like a sunday morning full of grace and full of jesus
i wish that i could be more like you

chorus
im hard to love hard to love no i dont make it easy
well i couldnt do it if i stood where you stood
im hard to love hard to love and you say that you need me
i dont deserve it but i love that you love me good
love me good
