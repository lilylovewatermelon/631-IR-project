rocky burned up the movie screen
when i was turning seventeen
tiedyed shirts and levi jeans
looking cool at the dairy queen
trying to impress a young woman in her sunday dress

chorus
that was 1976 didnt know who i was yet
a pretty little blondehaired girl
stole my heart and changed my world
two kids and a moonlite sky
a little love on a friday night
built a fire that just wont quit
and that was 1976

verse 2
my highschool days are packed away
set my sights on a bigger stage
jimmy carter moved to dc
a georgia boy just like me
life seemed easy nothing much that we needed

chorus
that was 1976 didnt know who i was yet
a pretty little blondehaired girl
stole my heart and changed my world
two kids and a moonlite sky
a little love on a friday night
built a fire that just wont quit
and that was 1976
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
eighttrack tapes were still in style
and elvis was still alive
wonder woman sure looked fine
bionic man was still prime time
and that girl i liked
we kept on trying till we got it right

chorus
that was 1976 didnt know who i was yet
a pretty little blondehaired girl
stole my heart and changed my world
two kids and a moonlite sky
a little love on a friday night
built a fire that just wont quit
and that was 1976

outro
yeah that was 1976 didnt know who we were yet
built a fire that just wont quit
that was 1976
we built a fire that just wont quit
that was 1976embed"
