honey you think hes got an attitude
so you treat him just a little too rude
buddy you think shes a little too cold
so you act like a two year old

chorus kenny chesney
dont it make you feel low joe
dont it make you feel mean jean
dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself
dont it make you feel small yall

verse 2 kenny chesney
boy you say something bad about her brother
girl you say something mean about his mother
tempers flare and insults fly
and youre both wanting to die

chorus kenny chesney
dont you feel like a jerk kirk
dont you feel like a ninny jenny
dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself
dont it make you feel small yall

verse 3 george jones
lady you say you dont love him no more
and mister you kicked down the bedroom door
she calls you names you never heard before
and now its a full scale war

mentally ill bill
dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself

verse 4 kenny chesney  george jones
six oclock eight oclock nine oclock ten
the neighbors all know that youre at it again
and two little kids just a few feet away
hear every word you say

chorus kenny chesney  george jones
dont it make you feel bad dad
dont it make you feel wrong mom
dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself
dont it make you feel small yall
dont it make you feel ashamed of yourself
dont it make you feel small yall

with a pickle in the middle
and a mustard on topembed"
