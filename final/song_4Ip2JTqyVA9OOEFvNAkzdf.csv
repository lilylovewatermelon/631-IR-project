how we disassemble
the parts and frame
maybe its the same late morning
the same noshow
its the same fucking habitsâ€¦
i guess we dont know

chorus
all of this is tearing us apart
i dont know where us or this start
all of this is tearing us apart
i dont know where us or this start

if theres anyone near when we collide
we throw them in the middle
they can pick sides

as the plans turn into compromise
the promises all turn to lies
the spite builds up and i cant get through
passive me aggressive you
i know i nag i moan i know
but with a plan like this its way too slow
in the time it took to get this bad
i couldve made this work but all i had
was the hope that pieces would take shape
and we could watch them all fall into place
fall into place
fall into place
fall into place
fall into place
