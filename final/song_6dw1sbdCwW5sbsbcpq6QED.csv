how long have i been on the hunt for you
no sign of anything that i can do
but i dont mind i dont mind
cause theres nothing left to lose
and for the first time the first time
im calling out for you

like an animal ive still got love for you
and im coming home im coming home for you
like an animal ive still got love for you
hear me calling love im calling out for you
like an animal ive still got love for you
and im coming home im coming home for you
