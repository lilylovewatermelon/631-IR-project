things take a turn for the worse
send him back where he came from
we got shots fired down the street

interlude doom
badiyahhhh
alright steady
badiyah badiyah
absolute power corrupts absolutely
if they get the villain surrounded then ahem

verse mf doom
good to the last drop niglets
hood til the blast pop them bigotass piglets
go for the bosses dicks or higher
beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
get at the sarge he give the orders
the rest of them punksll quit the force or get slaughtered
use stealth play alleys jet
wed rather not alert them nosy federales yet
keep the local random cases in each state
escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
you on call keep your nikes on tight no white
anybody tell get lighted on sight
the ringers on a needtoknow basis
no persons places things and no faces
get bagged youre on your own acted alone
back home your famll be provided for while youre gone
its a price on all snitches
if you nice bring back eyes fingers toes and pictures
send copies to those who singin the blues
mothers and fathers whos unjustly accused
our species is in danger
wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
thatll let them fools know
and send them a message let them pows go
absolute power corrupts absolutely
now you have your orders do your duty
a new way to let the shots spray
a few drops a day double espresso da latte
no smell nor taste hardly traceable
wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
learn em a lesson for givin bros mad stresses
a long list of cos names and addresses
a fake judge with many years on the bench
that sent some good cats to the chair was aired in a trench
they say her tongue was teared out smeared and drenched
the whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
and she was tortured some say postmortem
the suspect took his own life before they caught him
its real spooky like a real trife movie
remember the part when terminator killed tookie
absolute power corrupts absolutely
if they get the villain surrounded son then shit
shed blood somell be shooken
just look with they head in the mud red flood villain

one of the things we ran into the unknown
we we couldnt get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
and once we did finally pull the door and breach the interior door
theres a man trapped inside of it
basically that man trap is a cage
fore we run in were stuck in there and they can shoot us
while were just were stuck in a cage16embed"
