its your chance take her hand to the floor
fellas just the moment youve been waiting for
girl if you see something you like then let them know
ladies i know youâ€™re ready
because you only got one chance yeah yeah
for your first dance you never forget about your first dance
so take advantage of the slow jam
tell them jb yeah man

verse 1 justin bieber
when i close my eyes i see me and you at the prom
weve both been waiting so long for this day to come
now that its here lets make it special
i cant deny theres so many thoughts in my mind
the djs playing my favorite song aint no chaperones
this could be the night of your dreams

chorus justin bieber

bridge justin bieber
everybody says that we look cute together
lets make this a night the two of us remember
no teachers around to see us dancing close
im telling you our parents will never know
before the lights go up and the music turns off
nows the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
your glass slippers in my hand right here
well make it before the clock strikes nine
chorus justin bieber

girl i promise ill be gentle
i know we got to do it slowly
if you give give the first dance to me
im gon cherish every moment
cause it only happens once once in a lifetime
