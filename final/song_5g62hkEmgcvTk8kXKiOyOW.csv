blistered skin turning red
i cant complain
its something to do
cloud my mind and erase you

chorus
since youre gone
all is wrong
nothing seems the same down here
and if youre gone
and im alone
whose heart will i scar now dear

fall in fall out
break free break down

feel my legs pushing through
this world i built around you
i know the blame
is not upon you
i know these heartless things i choose

chorus

fall in fall out
break free break down
one look and i die
one kiss goodbye
you might also likedrag this frown from my face
force a smile to take its place
i can pretend that im not confused
and i dont need the likes of you

fall in fall out
break free break down
one look and i die
one kiss goodbyeembed"
