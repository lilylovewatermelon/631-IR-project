everythings so blurry and everyones so fake
and everybodys empty and everything is so messed up
preoccupied without you i cannot live at all
my whole world surrounds you i stumble then i crawl

verse 2
you could be my someone you could be my scene
you know that ill protect you from all of the obscene
i wonder what youre doing imagine where you are
theres oceans in between us but thats not very far

chorus
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face

verse 3
everyone is changing theres no one left thats real
so make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
cause i am lost without you i cannot live at all
my whole world surrounds you i stumble then i crawl

and you could be my someone you could be my scene
you know that i will save you from all of the unclean
i wonder what youre doing i wonder where you are
theres oceans in between us but thats not very far

chorus
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me
can you take it all away

well you shoved it in my face
this pain you gave to me

bridge
nonobody told me what you thought
nobody told me what to say
everyone showed you where to turn
told you when to run away
nobody told you where to hide
nobody told you what to say
everyone showed you where to turn
showed you when to run away
chorus
can you take it all away
can you take it all away
well you shoved it in my face
