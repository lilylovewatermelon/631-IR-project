i told you love if you could see it through my eyes
youd understand my fear of everything in sight
i know id quickly sell my heart for some advice
on how to ease a troubled mind
my brains a dog asleep that i cannot let lie
cloudy head though i cant find a single silver lining
guess there is no hope for me in sight
to ease this troubled mind

chorus
i worry for the sun yes i worry for the snow
i worry ill die young while i worry ill grow old
oh i worry for the time i spent worrying alone
it makes me sad
it takes me back
i break in half
ahooh i break in half

verse 2
i took a bus out to the city where you live
eavesdropped on strangers conversations with their kids
in hopes that maybe theyd say something relevant
to ease my worried head
well every mile that passed just amplified my fear
i started counting all the times i saw you last year
and suddenly it all became so clear
it was sadly making sense

i worry for the sun yes i worry for the snow
i worry ill die young while i worry ill grow old
oh i worry for the time i spent worrying alone
it makes me sad
it takes me back
i break in half
ahooh i break in half
i worry for the sun yes i worry for the snow
i worry ill die young while i worry ill grow old
i worry for the time i spent worrying alone
it makes me sad
it takes me back
i break in half
ahooh i break in half

outro
i told you love if you could see it through my eyes
youd understand my fear of everything in sight
i know id quickly sell my heart for some advice
on how to ease a troubled mindembed"
