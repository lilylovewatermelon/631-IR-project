met a girl at seventeen
thought she meant the world to me
so i gave her everything
she turned out to be a cheat
said shed been thinking for a long time
and she found somebody new
ive been thinking that this whole time
girl i never thought youd stay thats okay
i hope he takes your filthy heart and then he throws you away someday
before you go theres one thing you oughta know
