verse 1
i grew up in a small place had to drive an hour just to see a movie
im a simple person city life just doesnt move me
id rather be home with my grandparents and playing euchre
didnt wanna leave but this dreams calling i had to do it
i left my girl there wish i wouldve done it different
she was right when she told me that i dont ever listen
i told her i would change a million times and never did it
apologies dont mean a thing if you dont ever fix it
i love what i do but its not what i expected
this industry is not your friend well thats my perspective
sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
but those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
some people say nobodys perfect but expect perfection
how you supposed to find the answer if you dont ask the question
sometimes i look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
when i go home and turn the music off what am i left with

see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeverse 2
we used to be close but as time passed we became disconnected
you never felt love and i always felt disrespected
your family thought i was a joke i was always defensive
they just wanted what was best for you i just couldnt accept it
and hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
but i was immature i guess i had to learn some lessons
we grew apart and our lives went in different directions
and theres a lot of responsibilities that i neglected
i had a lot that was bottled inside couldnt express it
and this pain wont leave i can feel the depression
its taking over my body feels like im always stressing
doctor told me i should sleep but im always restless
i lay awake at night and think my thoughts are relentless
i need a moment to breathe i need a moment to vent this
i seem to be the only person that i play pretend with
and when i turn the music off what am i really left with huh
