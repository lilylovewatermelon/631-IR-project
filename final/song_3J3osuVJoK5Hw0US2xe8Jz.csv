soaring through the clouds together
we can travel on forever
through the sky you and i
back to earth again
and were in a mind machine

prechorus livio
i see the things i want to see
i can be all the things i want to be
is it real or just a dream

chorus sarah
come fly with me
come ride with me
were in a mind machine
together we can touch the sky
you and i
were in a mind machine
come on and fly with me
come ride with me
were in a mind machine
take my hand youll understand
the wonders i have seen
in my mind machine

onward through the atmosphere
everything is crystal clear
finally we can see
the world as it should be
and were in a mind machine

prechorus livio
i see the things i want to see
i can be all the things i want to be
is it real or just a dream

break joey
come on fly with me
come on fly the sky

chorus tracey
come on and fly with me
come fly with me
come ride with me
were in a mind machine
take my hand youll understand
the wonders i have seen
in my mind machine
the wonders i have seen
my mind machine
come on and fly with me
outro joey
come on fly with meembed"
