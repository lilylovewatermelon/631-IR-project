i once though of love as a prison
a place i didnt want to be
so long ago i made a decision
to be footloose and fancyfree
but you came and i was so tempted
to gamble on love just one time
i never thought that i would get caught
it seemed like a perfect crime

chorus
baby you left me defenseless
but ive only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
im guilty of love in the first degree

verse 2
i thought it would be so simple
like a thousand times before
id take what i wanted and just walk away
but i never made it to the door
now babe im not begging for mercy
go ahead and throw the book at me
if loving yous a crime
i know that im as guilty as a man can be

baby you left me defenseless
but ive only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
im guilty of love in the first degree
baby you left me defenseless
but ive only got one plea
lock me away inside of your love
and throw away the key
im guilty of love in the first degree

outro
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degree
love in the first degreeembed"
