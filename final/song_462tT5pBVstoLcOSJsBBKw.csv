it aint complicated
well ive grown to hate it
i never liked the taste of crow
but baby i ate it

verse 2
they tried to warn me
they said that you were ornery
so dont bring me those big brown eyes
and tell me that youre sorry

prechorus
well you might as well throw gasoline
on a fire
the way you lie

chorus
you lie like a priceless persian rug
on a rich mans floor
well you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
on my porch
the way you lie like a penny in the parking lot
at the grocery store
it just comes way too natural to you
the way you lie

that aint my perfume
i bet she had a curfew
you told me you were out with the boys
and baby i believed you

verse 4
so why you lookin so nervous
you know youre gonna deserve this
i oughta kill you right now
and do the whole wide world a service

prechorus
well my daddys gonna straighten you out
like a piece of wire
like a piece of wire
the way you lie

chorus
you lie like the man with the slick back hair
who sold me that ford
well you lie like the pine tree in the back yard
after last months storm
well you lie like a penny in the parking lot
at the grocery store
it just comes way too natural to you
the way you lie
bridge
well ill tell you what im gonna do
im gonna drive
to the big ol muddy river
im gonna park my car in the middle of the milelong
bridge
and then im not gonna cryy
well maybe just a little
then im gonna slip off the ring
that you put on my finger
give it a big ol fling
and watch it sink
down down down
and there its gonna lie
until the lord comes back around

chorus
because you lie like a priceless persian rug
on a rich mans floor
you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
on my porch
well you lie like a penny in the parking lot
at the grocery store
it just comes so dang natural to you
the way you lie
the way you lie
outro
well its what you do
its who you are2embed"
