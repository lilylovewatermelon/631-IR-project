one two three

verse 1
my blue bucket of gold
friend why dont you love me
once the myth has been told
the lens deforms it as lightning

chorus
raise your right hand
tell me you want me in your life
or raise your red flag
just when i want you in my life
ooh ooh

verse 2
search for things to extol
friend the fables delight me
my blue bucket of gold
lord touch me with lightning

chorus
raise your right hand
tell me you want me in your life
or raise your red flag
just when i want you in my life
ooh ooh
ooh oohyou might also like12embed"
