ive been up at this all night long
ive been drowning in my sleep
ive prayed for your safe place
and its time for us to leave

verse 1 spencer chamberlain
time is running its running on empty
and the gas is running out
ive decided that tonight is the night that i let love aside
full speed ahead this seems to be the place
ive seen this once before
planned perfection sought in my dreams
hoping this would take you home

chorus aaron gillespie
my knuckles have turned to white
theres no turning back tonight
kiss me one last time

verse 2 spencer chamberlain
around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow
the people will all gather
to remember such a day where the flames grew as high as trees
and the world it stopped it stopped for you and me

kiss me one last time shut your eyes
my knuckles have turned to white
theres no turning back tonight so hold on tight

postchorus spencer chamberlain
i will now bring new meaning to the word alone
endless nights of dreaming of life
and the days we should have spent here

bridge spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
glass shatters and comes to a halt i thought wed be there by now
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
i thought it would be so much quicker than this
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
pain has never been so brilliant i made sure you were buckled in
drowning in my sleep im drowning in my sleep
now you can walk hand in hand hand in hand with him

chorus spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
my knuckles have turned to white
theres no turning back tonight
kiss me one last time shut your eyes
my knuckles have turned to white
theres no turning back tonight so hold on tight
kiss me one last time shut yourembed"
