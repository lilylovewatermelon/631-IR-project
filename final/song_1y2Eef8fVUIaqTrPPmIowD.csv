theres god
theres god
theres god

verse 1
theres god
can i feed you again
will i have to stay dumb
you can feel and it begins
but i know inside this heart attack
i can see through your eyes
im terrified of everything
but its no real surprise
because the parasites are dancing closer
all this sacrilegion warns in posters
can you handle it

verse 2
in the dark
why i think im alone
i sweat through my visions
im going too cold
today is a tragedy
in the mouth of the mad
but that doesnt matter now
ive come home relaxed
im curled up in a ball and shaking
im hiding from the hell im making
i cant believe the chance im taking
is there any other way is there any other way

the burden
the burden

brige
you cant save me
there is nothing more to give
i am changing
almost like i never lived
be my witness
just dont leave me in suspense
keep this prove it
tell them all the consequences

chorus
the burden
have you ever been burdened before
the burden
was there anything you wanted more

bridge
you cant save me
there is nothing more to give
i am changing
almost like i never lived
be my witness
just dont leave me in suspense
keep this prove it
tell them all the consequences
outro
our same plea
by now you know that looks are deceiving
im covered in a rash and receding
is there any other way is there any other way
for gods sakes weve suffered this pain is now our lives
for gods sakes weve suffered enough
for gods sakes weve suffered this pain is now our lives
for gods sakes weve suffered enough
for gods sakes weve suffered this pain is now our lives
for gods sakes weve suffered enough
for gods sakes weve suffered this pain is now our lives
for gods sakes weve suffered enough enough enough enough4embed"
