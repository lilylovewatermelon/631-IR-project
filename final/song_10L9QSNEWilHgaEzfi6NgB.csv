i fell down again
but i cant complain
another false step
could drive me insane
i only got myself here to blame
so i shake off defeat and i start again
oh no i said
i wanna go back
but i cant win the shit
and im gonna stay on track
yeah make a deal like that
i keep my head up
but i never react

verse 2 tom delonge
i wrote it down at least a month ago
16 chapters of one thing youve blown
the best thing yet to help you
through and through that she was
i feel her more than you
dont leave
dont leave her

verse 3 tim armstrong
yeah
i get up just to get knocked back down
i sit up just to get knocked all around
i wanna say something but youre out of town
i dont wanna have another short down
say stand up hey yo lets make it clear
follow you home no you were not there
you saw me coming jump you disappear
home alone every night seems so clear
you think you see me here all alone
got my crew coming now one by one
two by two three by three
four by four lets do some more

call me back when word is that shes gone
catlike thief she stole air from my lungs
leave me standing on this lonely grave
i dug it out in case she turns away

outro tom delonge  tim armstrong

dont leave dont leave dont leave her
dont leave dont leave dont leave her
dont leave her
dont leave dont leave dont leave her

you think you see me here all alone
got my crew coming now one by one
