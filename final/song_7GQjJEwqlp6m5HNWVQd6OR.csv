i was sitting there selling turnips on a flatbed truck
crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
she had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
she had hollywood written on her license plate
she was lost and looking for the interstate
needing directions and i was the man for the job

chorus
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
theres a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate
but a right will bring you right back here to me

verse 2
i was sitting there thinking about her pretty face
kicking myself for not catching her name
i threw my hat and thought you fool it could have been love
i knew my old ford couldnt run her down
she probably didnt like me anyhow
so i watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

chorus
i told her way up yonder past the caution light
theres a little country store with an old coke sign
you got to stop in and ask miss bell for some of her sweet tea
then a left will take you to the interstate
but a right will bring you right back here to me
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also like
bridge
is this georgia heat playing tricks on me
or am i really seeing what i think i see
the woman of my dreams coming back to me

instrumental break

chorus
she went way up yonder past the caution light
dont know why but something felt right
when she stopped in and asked miss bell
for some of her sweet tea
mama gave her a big old glass
and sent her right back here to me

outro
thank god for good directions and turnip greens6embed"
