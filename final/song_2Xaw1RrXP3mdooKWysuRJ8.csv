ever since i could remember
everything inside of me
just wanted to fit in oh oh oh
i was never one for pretenders
everything i tried to be
just wouldnt settle in oh oh oh

prechorus
if i told you what i was
would you turn your back on me
and if i seemed dangerous
would you be scared
i get the feeling just because
everything i touch isnt dark enough
that this problem lies in me

chorus
im only a man with a candle to guide me
im taking a stand to escape whats inside me
a monster a monster
ive turned into a monster
a monster a monster
and it keeps getting stronger

verse 2
can i clear my conscience
if im different from the rest
do i have to run and hide oh oh oh
i never said that i want this
this burden came to me
and its made its home inside oh oh oh
