to this industry  and lets talk

about how all of us  not one of us 

but all of us will profit ive been doing

theater work in san francisco and san diego

for as long as youve been doing stag

and hardcore jack

jack

i know youre history floyd

colonel

no ones doubting your history

or your credentials floyd

floyd

then why the resistance i mean

this industry is going to be turned

upside down soon enough 

jack

then why help it

floyd

why not be prepared the money comes

from the colonel the talent comes from

you jack ive got a connection to the

equipment and the mail order distribution

not to mention those kids i got out there

who are hotfuckaction to the max

this is the future video tape tells the truth

jack

i have a stable of actors and actresses

theyre professionals theyre not

a bunch of fucking amateurs theyre

proven box office and they get people

in theaters where films should be seen

and they know how to fuck well 

floyd

thats right jack and by that

same token youre the one with the

power here the video revolution

is upon us  and our role is critical

we have an obligation to use our resources

and talent to help make it fly 

jack

you come in here at my party tell me about

this and that  tell me about the future

tell me about  video and amateurs and

all that  well lemme tell you something now

i will not shoot films on video and no

i will not loan out my actors who are

under contract to me period

floyd

wait a minute jack im not a complicated man

i like cinema in particular i like to

see fucking on film i dont want to win

an oscar and i dont want to reinvent the

wheel  i enjoy simple pleasures like butter

in my ass and lollipops in my mouth

thats me  call me crazy call me a pervert

but this is something i enjoy one other

small thing i want to do in this life is make

a dollar and a cent in this business  im not

trying to hurt you im trying to help you stay

one step ahead of the game 

jack

were repeating ourselves now floyd

colonel

jack i think this is about cost and future 

jack

the future is as bright as we make it 

it shouldnt be sacrificed for a few dollars

that can be saved shooting on video tape 

if it looks like shit and sounds like shit

it probably is shit 

floyd

i think youre one gin past this conversation 

jack

no    no im crystal clear here

colonel

jack please understand that this is

not an argument    this is a fact of 

jack

   what    

colonel

this is not an argument but a 

jack

what are you saying

colonel

what do you mean jack cmon 

jack

are you telling me that youre

working with this shit

colonel

i think that there is a serious case

to be made for the price and the gamble

on the whole idea of a home video market 

jack two three years from now everyones

gonna be able to walk into their local

supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette 

jack

true film fans wont watch that shit

it doesnt look good and more importantly

it doesnt make sex look sexy

colonel

it doesnt have to look good jack

film is just too damn expensive

the theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors

jack

i havent heard that

floyd

its true

weve got ten minutes until the new

year and i dont want it to start like this
