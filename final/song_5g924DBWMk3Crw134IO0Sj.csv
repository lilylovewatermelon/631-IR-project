suicide
dont give a fuck about this
my life or any other
just go away and let me hang
impossible to forgive forget it murderer
im in control
living a lie
make you pay at all cost for this
love sick
bullshit
bring it
decisions making themselves
i dont need you
thorns in my side
so i die

chorus
no one
no one could ever understand
my lifes exhausted
no one
no one could ever understand
this life imn

verse 2
determined
to bring you all down with me
break you
beat down
no more fucking empathy
from me for you
fed up
ive had enough
duality
my war
existence
instigated controversy
lay down
sell out
so wrong
drag the blade and go away
i stand cold cruel and lost
take me im ready

no one
no one could ever understand
my lifes exhausted
no one
no one could ever understand
pressure constricting
so hard
like a stone
fight hard
break bones break
no one
no one could ever understand
this life imn

verse 3
your pressure
my time
eroding
my life
fight for your honesty
fight for integrity

all work and no play
all work and no play
all work and no play makes me
all work and no play
all work and no play makes me
sick
i want to eat a bullet
carve myself
beat my face
catatonic
dig my brain
no pain suffocate
stomach aches
dont give a fuck
im out im done
fuck this shit
youve dug the hole
im lying in

no one could ever understand
no one could ever understand
fight for your honesty
fight for integrity

chorus
no one
no one could ever understand
my lifes exhausted
no one
no one could ever understand
pressure constricting
so hard
like a stone
fight hard
break bones break
no one
no one could ever understand
this life imn
outro
my world
my rules
my noose
my world
