roll into town step off the bus
shake off the where you came from dust
grab your guitar walk down the street
sign says nashville tennessee

prechorus 1
but i have found

chorus
its a crazy town full of neon dreams
everybody plays everybody sings
hollywood with a touch of twang
to be a star you got to bangbangbang
bend those strings til the hank comes out
make all the drunk girls scream and shout
we love it we hate it were all just tryin to make it
in this crazy town

verse 2
you pay your dues and you play for free
and you pray for a honky tonk destiny
you cut your teeth in the smokey bars
and live off the tips from a pickle jar

prechorus 2
til you find a cool new sound
and you smile when the record man shoots you down

its a crazy town full of neon dreams
everybody plays everybody sings
hollywood with a touch of twang
to be a star you got to bangbangbang
bend those strings til the hank comes out
make all the drunk girls scream and shout
we love it we hate it were all just tryin to make it
in this crazy town

one year they repossess your truck
and the next you make a couple million bucks

chorus
its a crazy town full of neon dreams
everybody plays everybody sings
hollywood with a touch of twang
to be a star you got to bangbangbang
bend those strings til the hank comes out
make all the drunk girls scream and shout
we love it we hate it were all just tryin to make it
we love it we hate it we all came here to make it
in this crazy town
