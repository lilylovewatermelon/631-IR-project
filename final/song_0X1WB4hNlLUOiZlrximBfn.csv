well ive been searching for something true
my heart says it must be you
id love to fall and see it through
but only if you told me to
well id run through the desert id walk through the rain
get you into trouble and take all the blame
id paint you a picture write you a song
and id do it all over if i did it all wrong

chorus
i dont wanna steal you away
or make you change the things that you believe
i just wanna drink from the words you say
and be everything you need
yeah i could be so good at loving you
but only if you told me to

verse 2
ive seen a lot of good love go to waste
and i dont wanna look back on these days
knowing all the things youd never know
if i never said a word and let you go

chorus
i dont wanna steal you away
or make you change the things that you believe
i just wanna drink from the words you say
and be everything you need
yeah i could be so good at loving you
but only if you told me to
