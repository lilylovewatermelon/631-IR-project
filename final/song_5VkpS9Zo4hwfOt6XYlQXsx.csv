when the end is getting closer
and the earth has burned the sky
now repent cause its all over
just let me die

verse 1 johnny 3 tears
heres the massacre a mausoleum fit for me
lived a hundred years a hundred years i didnt see
gave all my hope away isnt any left for me
bombs are splitting atoms what can the future bring
we can fill a million choirs and wait till children sing
we can walk a million miles and end up in the sea
and our lungs just keep filling and lying when we breathe
the worlds filled with liars liars like me
and i look at my child its finite this feeling
eyes blue like the sky i see all of this meaning
i reach up to god and i ask if im dreaming
so sorry i dont have those things that you needing
darling a kiss kiss me im leaving

chorus danny
when the end is getting closer
and the earth has burned the sky
now repent cause its all over
just let me die
as my body lies here broken
and im carried to the light
now my heart is finally open
just let me die

everybody says greetings and goodbyes
everybody pays no one knows the price
we know the price of sin the sin of sacrifice
i know ill sin again but who can save me twice
how much can we ask youll get the answer first
how much can we kneel with the air that chills the earth
the air keeps getting colder my knees keep hitting dirt
the innocent can cry without the guilty getting hurt
you ask who you love and you dont know no do you
the spirit of god just passes right through you
you gave away heaven handed right to you
and i can see it all tell me is it true
kiss me my darling darling i need you

bridge danny with johnny 3 tears
where do we go we go oh
lord i dont know where we go we go no
where do we go we go oh
lord i dont know where we go we go no
lord i dont know

chorus danny
when the end is getting closer
and the earth has burned the sky
now repent cause its all over
just let me die
as my body lies here broken
and im carried to the light
now my heart is finally open
just let me die9embed"
