uh my minds filled with minefields
the ashes fall the wine spills
the world stops drops and rolls
its judgement day or a fire drill
yeah i pour out my heart have a drink
they say the drunk never lie they aint never lyin yeah
my country tis of thee
sweet land of kill em all and let em die

chorus
god bless amerika
this ole godless amerika
i heard tomorrow aint promised today
the end of time is like a hour away damn

verse 2
militaryminded lost and cant find it
the stars on the flag are never shinin
uh i saw a butterfly in hell today
will i die or go to jail today
cause i live by the sword and die by the sword
heard police was lookin for me ima hide by a broad
shootin stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
im wired out the socket but still shockin
everybody wanna tell me what i need
you can play a role in my life but not the lead
if theres food for thought then im guilty of greed
mama said take what you want – i took heed yeah
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likerefrain
now let it breathe yeah

verse 3
back to life back to reality
been eatinmy girl and shes so sweet got cavities
granted we do it for vanity not humanity
but whats appealin to me is under banana trees
love i go so hard i tried to pay homage but i was overcharged
aint that a bitch im just a nut tryna bust a nut in a nut shell
used to say fuck the police now i say fuck jail
same shit different air freshener
i dont play boy i aint hugh hefner
tryna be a step ahead but a few feet behind
two fingers to my head pop peace of mind
i be in the cloud cloud number nine
and i just fucked the clock and let it come with time
its a cold world i put on a mink
theres a chain of commands im the missin link

chorus
god bless amerika
this ole godless amerika
i heard tomorrow aint promised today
and im smokinon them flowers catch the bouquet
outro
here we live by the sword and die by the sword
heard police was lookin for me ima hide by a broad
shootin stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
im wired out the socket but still shockin
everybody wanna tell me what i need
you can play a role in my life but not the lead
i saw a butterfly in hell today
will i die or go to jail today62embed"
