you are the way you are
doesnt take a genius to realise
that sometimes life is hard
its gonna take time
but youll just have to wait
youre gonna be fine
but in the meantime

come over here lady
let me wipe your tears away
come a little nearer baby
cause youll heal over
heal over
heal over someday

and i dont wanna hear you tell yourself
that these feelings are in the past
you know it doesnt mean theyre off the shelf
because pains built to last
everybody sails alone
but we can travel side by side
even if you fail
you know that no one really minds

come over here lady
let me wipe your tears away
come a little nearer baby
cause youll heal over
heal over
heal over someday
you might also likedont hold on but dont let go
i know its so hard
youve got to try to trust yourself
i know its so hard so hard

come over here lady
let me wipe your tears away
come a little nearer baby
cause youll heal over
heal over
heal over someday

yeah youre gonna heal over3embed"
