aint the pictures enough why do you go through so much
to get the stories you need so you can bury me
youve got the people confused you tell the stories you choose
you try to get me to lose the man i really am
you keep on stalkin me invading my privacy
wont you just let me be
cause your cameras cant control the minds of those who know
that youll even sell your soul just to get your story sold

chorus
i need my privacy yeah yeah
i need my privacy yeah yeah
so paparazzi yeah yeah get away from me
just get away from me yeah yeah

verse 2
some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die
to get a message across that yet you havent heard
my friend was chased and confused like many others i knew
but on that cold winter night my pride was snatched away
she get no second chance shes ridiculed and harassed
