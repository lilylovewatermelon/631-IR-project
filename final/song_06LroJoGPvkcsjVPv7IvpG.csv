anybody else find themselves
in a shoulda done this shoulda done that
try to do the best you can
cause you wanna be good but you love to be bad
your stress relief comes with the need
to kick the work weeks ass
if youre feelin this then catch a buzz
and go on and raise your glass

chorus
theres always one more beer you gotta drink
one more girl you gotta meet
one more song on the jukebox
spendin my money like it dont stop
could blame it all on my roots
my honkytonk attitude
im feelin this temptation in my current situation
but mornings gonna come gonna be early
gotta go to work gonna get dirty
shoulda stayed in instead i went out
but i oughta know that by now

verse 2
