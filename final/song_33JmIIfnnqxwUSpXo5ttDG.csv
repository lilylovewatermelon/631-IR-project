speak of the devil look who just walked into the room
the guilted and faded notion of someone i once knew
all the perfect moments are wrong
all the precious pieces are gone
everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us

chorus
did you hide yourself away
i cant see you anymore
did you eclipse another day
i used to wake up to the color of your soul
did you hide yourself away
are you living through the ghost
did you finally find a place above the shadows
so the world will never know
the world will never know you like i do

verse 2
so many silent sorrows youll never hear from again
and now that you lost tomorrow is yesterday still a friend
all the bridges we built were burned
not a single lesson was learned
everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us

chorus
did you hide yourself away
i cant see you anymore
did you eclipse another day
i used to wake up to the color of your soul
did you hide yourself away
are you living through the ghost
did you finally find a place above the shadows
so the world will never know
the world will never know you like i do
