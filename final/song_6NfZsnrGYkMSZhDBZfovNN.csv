i dont even like you
whyd you want to go and make me feel this way what

i can feel you watchin
even when youre nowhere to be seen
i can feel you touchin
even when youre far away from me

chorus calum michael all
tell me where youre hidin your voodoo doll
cause i cant control myself oh

but im trapped under your spell trapped under your spell
and it hurts in my head and my heart and my chest
and im having trouble catching my breath
