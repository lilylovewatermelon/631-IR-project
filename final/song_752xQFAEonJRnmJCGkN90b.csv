hey boys come on in
ha ha ha
yeah

verse 1
if the neighbors down the road call up and say the musics cranked a little loud
if the tin roofs arocking just apologize and invite em all down
if your front yards full of park cars and they can hear you clear to town
it might seem a little rowdy but thats our kind of crowd

chorus
and there aint no law against that
yeah it is what it is out here where were at
might bend a few rules might tip a few back
and there aint no law against that

verse 2
you might wanna get up on the back porch and sit in with the band
you might wanna kick back in a lawn chair you might wanna dance
you might wanna stay out all night howling at the moon
come dragging in at sunrise sleep it off till noon

chorus
and there aint no law against that
yeah it is what it is out here where were at
might bend a few rules might tip a few back
and there aint no law against that
you might also likebridge
if having this much funs a crime were guilty as can be
theyd have to put us all in jail and throw away the key

chorus
and there aint no law against that
yeah it is what it is out here where were at
