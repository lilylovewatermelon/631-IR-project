57OA7dHitTUFQ6wCtxFbBf,New Kid in Town - 2013 Remaster,Eagles,5J0VCIp4TTsZBKOqWdbBSa,"2 contributorstrimalchio from chicago flashing lights and the great kanye in west egg excerpt lyricsthere is an axiom that says all books are about other books this proposition is supported by the fact that the archetypes found in the earliest of recorded literature continue to reappear in contemporary literature following the supposition that music lyrics when read through a literary lens also fall into the contemporary literature categories it is safe to posit that many of the archetypes of classical literature appear in contemporary music further it can be assumed that there exist many songs as there exist many poems and other artworks in other forms about classical literature intentionally or otherwise that can be used as a tool to make the canonized works more accessible to many students if we open our eyes to the existent possibilities the popularity and cooptation in many instances of hiphop culture in pop culture places rap music lyrics at the forefront of youthful preoccupation the storied career of kanye west places him in great company with moguls such as jayz and sean combs not only as a hiphop tastemaker but also as a cultural icon with the ability to affect other areas of art and everyday living west has been responsible almost singlehandedly the cultural movements progressions even in hiphop and popular culture over the span of his career arguably one of the more controversial popular culture icons kanye wests life and career can provide interesting background and analysis for comparison and contrasting to one of literatures most famous characters jay gatsby

as gatsbys quest for daisy represents the american dream so can kanye wests quest personal and professional be similarly viewed wests fascinating life story highlighted by his debut album college dropout is phenomenal and set his trajectory to the highest of heights ultimately garnering 10 grammy nominations and winning the best rap album grammy for jesus walks jay gatsby usually fascinates students even if they dont particularly enjoy or understand f scott fitzgeralds novel the great gatsby is probably one of my favorite works to teach because of the time periodthe flourishing of the arts the jazz age and the harlem renaissancethe roaring twenties the great depression plays a part in my love of the era as well but only to symbolize that all good things come to an end so to speak as did the run of jay gatsby and those of his ilk the version of the great gatsby taught at my high school the authorized text has a preface written by matthew j bruccoli 1992 that states regarding the great gatsby being the great american novelif this phrase means anything it means that the novel is the great work of fiction with defining american thematic qualities and that james gatzjay gatsby is the great american character he believes in the american dream of success the orgastic future he fulfills it he confuses it with dais he is betrayed by it the appellation great as applied to gatsby reverberates with irony he is truly great by virtue of his capacity to commit himself to his aspirations xii agree that jay gatsby has come to symbolize the great american character much more than i believe the great gatsby to be the great american novel but my arrival at this opinion of gatsby has come slowly unfolding as a great narrative itself told by a narrator with a bit of distance from its central subject yet close enough to be privy to details so intimate as to captivate a reader bruccoli 1992 refers to nick carraway as the partially involved narrator xii i would say such a storyteller narrates this tale

much as some people fall in love with the grand concepts of idealism and romanticism fueling their love for literature i am simply in love with the hiphop love story which fuels nay love for music its become an archetype of its own a kid somewhere in the world hears something said in between a kick and a snare drum that evokes a visceral feeling and at that moment is struck by herhip hop in its essence and real as described by common sense in 94 common 1994 every person who professes a love for hiphop knows the moment and can recall in vivid detail their first meeting courtship love affair and heartbreaks due to the relationship i compare the love for literature and music because one of nay primary methods of teaching literature has been not only through nay love for music particularly rap lyrics but also through ideas expressions themes concepts and characters in hiphop culture in book of rhymes the poetics of hip hop adam bradley 2009 makes the case for raps
literary meritsbetween the street life and the good life is a broad expanse of human experience rap has its screenwriters making hollywood blockbusters in rhyme with sharp cuts vivid characters and intricate plotlines it has its investigative reporters and conspiracy theorists its biographers and memoirists its true crime authors and its mystery writers it even has its comics and its sportswriters its childrens authors and its spiritualists it is high concept and low brow it has literary hacks and bona fide masters it has all of these and more extending an oral tradition as fundamental to human experience as ancient and as essential as most anything we have 158even before i had words to clarify this notion of rap as literature much of my academic education had been informed by it i would read a piece of literature and automatically make a connection to it somewhere in the realm of hiphop culture bradley 2009 goes a step further to clarify to tell a familiar narrative in a new way is the motivating impulse behind a lot of rap storytelling 159 as a reader of literature i always found myself discovering the familiar narrative while listening to the new way its being told through hiphop with the great gatsby being taught in high schools across the world and the renewed interest in f scott fitzgerald and his novel because of baz luhrmanns 2013 movie adaptation arguably a hollywood blockbuster ive come to see more and more jay gatsbys life as a possible parallel to kanye wests

i will venture to say that my students interest in kanye west is much like their interest in jay gatsbyeven if they dont particularly enjoy or understand his musical or lyrical intentions they are interested in him as a person as a character in the world of pop culture i will also state that kanye west as an artist has at some point or another in his storied career worn all of the writerly hats adam bradley describes he has been the screenwriter his 2010 song runaway became a short film collaboration with hype williams the investigative reporter and conspiracy theorist the 2005 song diamonds from sierra leone among others the biographer and memoirist the 2007 song big brother a tribute to jayz and his debut single through the wire respectively true crime author and mystery author the 2011 collaboration with jayz murder to excellence and the 2007 song homecoming respectively comic much of his lyrical content depends on witty comedic elements and sportswriter the 2007 collaboration with lil wayne barry bonds and his lyrical and musical content ranges from low brow to high brow all of which can be argued to be very intentional on the part of the artist

by way of analogy this is where i begin my the great gatsby lessons with my high school studentswith kanye west not only kanye but also the world in which he operates that has heralded and hated him admired and despised him created and destroyed him of course i would not just give the students kanye and hiphoppop culture as a backdrop and set them loose theres historical precedent for this comparison that the students should know about along with abundant information on the jazz age i present langston hughess 1926 essay the negro artist and the racial mountain hughes writes of the plight ofnegro artists creating in america in the 1920sthe harlem renaissance and some artists aspirations to create art that is somehow not representative of their race or culture for instance a poetnot a negro poet 1 this essay begins a discussion about the responsibility of artists regarding their lives and their art i ask can an artist simply be an artist without any consciousness of race andor culture and if so are his message and meaning likely to be misinterpreted or misjudged because of the titles we as students teachers appreciators consumers and critics place on the artist whether its africanamerican female young old this always leads to an interesting discussion especially because of the correlation to the same questions being asked about current trends and artists in pop culture hughes 1926 sums up his perspective in the closing of his essaywe younger negro artists who create now intend to express our individual darkskinned selves without fear or shame if white people are pleased we are glad if they are not it doesnt matter we know we are beautiful and ugly too the tomtom cries and the tomtom laughs if colored people are pleased we are glad if they are not their displeasure doesnt matter either we build our temples for tomorrow strong as we know how and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves 1of course this is only one of many perspectives on the obligation of artists specifically negro artists but raises the question of keeping it real so to speak and also makes for a perfect connection to the conversation about hiphop culture pop culture and the responsibility of popular artists to be good representatives of what it means to be black in america it opens up conversations about mainstream v underground the business of music or art in general and artistic integrity

after a bit of conversation about the era in which the work was created i like to discuss the author of the work to see if the students can gain any valuable information about the work from the life of the person who created it in his gatsby introduction bruccoli 1992 recalls an f scott fitzgerald quote from 1922 before the great gatsby was written in which he declares i want to write something newsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple  intricately patterned vii similarly kanye west in an interview with the new york timess jon caramanica 2013 preceding the release of his album yeezus heralds it as a project on which kanye strives for aspirational minimalism stating i want to break glass ceilings np mr wests previous solo album is interestingly in this context titled my beautiful dark twisted fantasy 2010 no author no artist is so independent of his work that his craft his brushstrokes his personality some degree of his being is not recognizable in the stories he tells as fitzgerald wrote gatsby kanye writes kanye it is a wellknown fact that much of what fitzgerald wrote was inspired by people hed known or knew as is the case with his wife zelda and the pages of her diary that inspired some of his stories as much as they write about the worlds in which they live both write about themselves my comparison of kanye west as a personalitya characterpresented in his music and to the music and pop cultureconsuming public to jay gatsby therefore also operates as a comparison of kanye west as an author and architect to f scott fitzgerald as well both men to varying degrees of achievement create great american success stories just as kanye wests life follows the archetype embodied by fitzgeralds jay gatsby

with the groundwork laid the discussion of the archetypes can commence its at this point that i digress a bit but only to help illustrate my greater point i start as one should at the beginning of the novel

in my younger and more vulnerable years begins the narrator in the opening lines of the great gatsby my father gave me some advice that ive been turning over in my mind ever since

whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had

in the version of the story im always the nick carraway character reserving my judgment allowing my audiencemy studentsto come to their own conclusions i merely state the facts for them

i met kanye west in 1999 we both performed at a music festival at columbia college in chicago and i had just killed what was one of the biggest shows of my short professional rap career the year leading up to that show 17 had struggled i had given up an academic scholarship dropped out of college lived in my car and wrote songs i felt represented a struggle that needed to be shared with the masses

i walked offstage proud through the crowd of aspiring rappers and irb singers and greeted him with a compliment as i assumed many people had in the past and im certain did in the future

a simple that was dope he returned the compliment
i told him my name and as he made a start to tell me who he was i interjected oh yeah i know who you are you did the tracks on the infamous syndicate album dope album

i even quoted a few lines fiom what you do to me to prove i actually was a fan i gave him a copy of my demo and we exchanged information there was a fbllowup call the next dayhe liked two tracks there were 17 on the tape and even offered production for an exceptionally reasonable price i thanked him for the feedback and the offer of a businesslike relationship i passed on the beats i prided myself on the fact that i had relationships with producers who worked pro bono because they liked the rhymes i wrote to their music and i was the epitome of a struggling artist so i didnt have the money even if i wanted to purchase tracks but i was on my way to stardom and figured our paths would cross again somewhere beyond the atmosphere my assuredness was only secured by the fact that i had met himone of my heroesÿon an even playing field we were doing the same thing we performed on the same stage

the next year i would release my album do more shows and eventually lose all of that optimistic ambition about nwmyrap career in that same year kanye west would go on to become kanye west tapperproducer extraordinaire hiphoppop culture icon when his debut album the college dropout dropped in 2004 i was fresh out of school having finished my bachelors degree in english education and creative writing i was right back where i started i thought in those classrooms that helped shape my rap dreams the same city that fueled those hiphop ambitions i became an english teacher because rap didnt work out i dont think it was because im not skilled at it i just dont think i could commit fully to the idea of venturing outso far with no guarantees and no backup plan

i would continue to write and rap releasing several music projects a multimedia novel and a collection of poetry stories and essays i would eventually come to understand that mr west and i were and possibly still are flipsides to the same coin hiphop never stopped being my outlet and i would argue having the experiences that led to my reentry to academia and my career as an educator made me more studious more industrious and more driven to make it i felt his debut album lampooned what i was doing and felt it was not only a slight on me and people like me but also a dangerous message to anyone who listened and thought it might be just that easy to become a celebrity overnight

ive made it my duty to follow wests career if for no other reason than to remain aware of how he attempts to move hiphop culture forward to see what possibly could have been i am aware of the fact that his career and mine are different roads traveled from that fateful for are meeting in 1999 i am also aware of the fact that it has made all the difference in the world that the road he is traveling has informed mine and in maw ways mine his i set out to prove despite his lampooning a man could graduate from college love hip
hop produce create excel and be fulfilled i imagine that he has spent his career answering to fans like me the ones who know about the infamous syndicate work and the bad boy workthe people who were and still are fans and want to know whats next

not only do i continue writing verses and songs i have found a bit of contentment in writing about hiphop in that way i like to fancy myself nick carraway carraway moves from the midwest to new york to learn the bond business i wanted to learn the business of hiphop nick meets jay gatsby the epitome of the american dream successful flashy host of the best parties in my imagination jay gatsby is kanye west west has not been able to find peace in the limelight rather it seems the more attention he receives the more he balks at the very idea of fame it could be argued that kanye west much like f scott fitzgeralds titular character is somehow standing in a vast wildernessperhaps pop culturethe darkness that is the current state of hiphop music and culturelooking out over the ocean at the everelusive flashing lights its my job to narrate the story and try my best not to judge simply state facts as i know them to be

interestingly enough the kanye comparison works in this archetypical fashion and brings many parallels with it reality television has given kim kardashian a platform to flaunt the excesses of celebrity for the sake of celebrity she is one of the highest earning reality television stars and is involved in many business ventures as a result of her reality television famequite an ascension from being the daughter of o j simpsons defense attorney and stepdaughter of an american olympic gold medalist if kanye is gatsby then one could easily make a very basic case for kim kardashian being daisy buchanan the selfabsorbed party girlflapper from old money with whom gatsby becomes enamored and who sets him on course to create a fantasy in which she can live and he can have her to himself forever reliving those wonderful moments they shared in their youth her ex husband kris humphries would perhaps be tom buchanan daisys husband who represents old money as well and is a former athlete tom could very easily be paralleled to reggie bush as well and perhaps more appropriately so since kanyes former friend and collaborator consequence 2013 revealed with jen the pen bayer the mother of his child in a january 21 2013 interview on new yorks power 1051 breakfast club show that hed facilitated meetings between kim and kanye while she was dating the nfl star consequence then would understand nick carraways discomfort when asked to do the very same for gatsby and daisy in chapter 4 of the novel which he eventually does in chapter 5 this is a pivotal moment for gatsby because it seems it is the realization of his dream to have daisy his lifes work is complete because he has obtained what it is that he has worked so hard to get whether its genuinely the love of his life or if she is a symbol of status gatsby has daisy and the charade it seems is over he has proven himself perhaps only to himself gatsby calls off his lavish parties preoccupied with his new life with daisy and nick during a visit to the buchanan home where gatsby and jordan baker are also present becomes acutely aware of daisys disinterest in her and toms young child this is the point at which the reader comes to learn the defining aspects and true nature of all the principal characters in the novel this is also the beginning of gatsbys great fall at this point the comparison of gatsby to kanye becomes more the work of the student than anything leaving room for contrast and speculation regarding mr wests ultimate fate or whether his life can be seen as wholly comparable to that of gatsby nick ultimately becomes aware that the buchanans are careless people who recklessly go through life doing whatever they please only to retreat behind their money when anything goes awry whatever your opinion of the world and the people who occupy the world in which kanye west lives there exists a viable correlation and if not at least room for a meaningful discussion on the topic

as previously stated i find great interest in the hiphop love story hip hop in its essence and realand how this love sets many artists on the same course as gatsby after he met daisy in 1917 and like gatsby with daisy the artist finds her excitingly desirable perhaps because the meeting is a colossal accident but he still takes what he can get ravenously and unscrupulously and ultimately after having her finds that he has committed himself to the following of a grail feeling married to her 155157 the artist finds that he is in love with her and will do most anything to havc her the way that he had her when they first met common is disillusioned and despises that he sees her comnercialized used and abused and vows to take her back much as gatsby aims to take daisy back from tom whereas in gatsbys case it excited him too that many men had already loved daisyit increased her value in his eyes common feels a bit different 156 common is obviously displeased with her dalliances with other artists because he wants her all to himsel£

kanye west on his 2008 album graduation pays homage to commons i used to love her with homecoming an ode to a girl he met when he was three years old named wendy his lyrics formulate a wellhidden conceit much like commons only to reveal that instead of being a story about hip hop this is homage to chitown hip hop by connecting the past to the present
creates for future artists a story that merits repeating remixing and retelling if the axiom is true and all books are indeed about other books perhaps all songs are about other songs or more fittingly all lyrics are about other lyrics and maybe then the journey of kanyes to reclaim a lost love has much less to do with kim kardashian as an emblematic status symbol or a reminder of the promise of times past like daisya and snore to do with hip hop in its essence and real and perhaps that aspirational sparseness that he is now testing out is his telling us as the passage in the great gatsby in which gatsby says to nick who cautions him not to get his hopes up about daisy because their past cant be repeated cant repeat the past he cried incredulously why of course you can 116 kanye constantly speaks about his duty as an artist to aspire to purity this it seems is the true essence of art for him and is perhaps what drives him to not only be a fascinating cultural figure but also solidifies his comparison to jay gatsbythe reaching out toward the metaphorical green light at the end of the buchanans dock the willingness to risk all of his successes and accomplishments to push forward and to push back the need to say and do what he feels needs to be said and done to maintain that purity the essence of what he sees as her in a rolling stone 2010 interview about my beautiful dark twisted fantasy he statesi forget the word but theres sic people throughout history that sic their responsibility is to be conveyors of truth on to next generations theres a word far that type of person and i feel like im that type of person that sic has to carry on the truth and tell the story not his story tell the story where its like raphaels painting jesus wish knowing the pope would have his head but he died before the pope got the piece but as a sic artist he said yo i need to express this our ill die ill die inside this is what i saw this is what i want to paint as a sic artist i feel like artists take their lives to serious or not serious enough where you know who would really put their life on the line for what they really really believe in who would make a sacrificekanye goes on in the interview to explain that he believes many of his contemporaries to be scared saying they run away from popular culture and because of this he sees them as falling short of the greatness of rock n roll video interview1° from his humble anonymous beginnings in the world of hiphop produchlg music he was barely credited for doing to his production work on one of the defining albums in hiphop history jayzs blueprint kanye west has aspired to see hiphop created and performed in its purest essence in an interview about his debut album the college dropout with associated press writer nekesa mumbi moody 2004 west states that his hiphop aspirations started early first convincing his mother to loan him money to buy his first keyboard believing so much in himself and his musical potential that he says i thought i was going get sig toned back when i was 13 years old and come out with a record and take kris kross out 1

that moment created by kanyc west in 2004 when he experienced her the essence of hiphop and brought the world his view of what hiphop could bethe college dropout created a moment hes been striving to recreate since as gatsby did all he could throwing his lavish weekly parties and befriending her cousin nick to create the circumstance in which he could again have a chance encounter with daisy feeling married in those moments to their respective dreams both set on a course fprward by going backward propelled toward an ideal future by a perfect moment from their pasts nick narrates to readers at the close of the novel gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us 189 to gatsby the green light is a sym bol of daisy of old money perhaps of wealth in general of simpler times of happinessall ideas associated with the american dream as kanye west has written and recorded songs such as all of the lights flashing lights and street lights on topics that could easily be aligned with the ideals of life liberty and the pursuit of happinessthe good life to use his own words but also being sure to shine as much light on the bad as the good embracing langston hughess challenge expressing his individual dark skinned self without fear or shame baring his soul for the sake of artthe dream of any artist 1 gatsbys fate is sealed as he is consumed by the world he creates and in which he participates its not the implied illegal activities in which he is rumored to be involved but the fantasy he creates of picking up from that moment they met and continuing his life with daisy reporter chris campion 2011 asks kanye if he feels as though the success of his debut album is because he brought something different back to hip hop 1 kanye replies well i dont know how you can bring something different back you can either bring something thats done back or else bring something different 1 the brand of different created by kanye with her has been his aspiration since the college dropout to what levels of success he has achieved it is debatable he has not met gatsbys fate though some fans and critics believe the old kanye to be no more to date kanyes is a happier tale than gatsbys hes both got his dream girl in kim kardashian and hes doing his dream job receiving much critical acclaim for his latest musical contribution yeezus he goes on to tell campion i guess im bringing something different hip hop is fixated on fantasy 1 unlike gatsby kanyes fantasy has worked out and he has found a way to successfully live in it

as for nay part as the partially involved narrator i as nick am inclined to reserve all judgments 5 maybe in the end we will all come to see kanye in the same light nick saw gatsbywho represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperamentit was his extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find againkanye may very well be hiphops gatsby representing everything i loathe about the culture while simultaneously embodying ever thing that is beautiful about it as well because the recognition of those loathsome attributes are simply a reflectiona yin to a yangof what is beautiful perhaps kanyes life as gatsbys could likewise easily be described is evolving into a beautiful dark twisted fantasy into which his sensitivity provides an outlook we consumers mere outsiders peeking in at or through only register through the binary of genius or crazy creative temperament is what we tend to call it because we haveeven if he hasnt and has no reason togiven up hope and rather than recognize it as the extraordinary gift it is we mistakenly overlook it in search of something else we look for another angle a controversy a quarrel a personality flaw or something even less significant when we could simply try to view kanye as nick saw gatsby

eventually we may come to say nokanye turned out all right in the end it was what preyed on kanye what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out our interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men 7 and we will realize that he was worth the whole damn bunch put together nicks words to gatsby at the end of their last meeting letting gatsby know that nick sees him for who he is a great man who believes in his dream and is willing to sacrifice everything in his quest to reach ityou might also likeembed"
