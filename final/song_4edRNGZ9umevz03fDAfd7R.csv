hold me in your arms
just see how it feels
dont make me wait forever
just because you know i will
dont leave me hanging wishing waiting
hoping that youll call
darling hold me in your arms and let me fall

verse 1
youve got reservations
well darling so do i

i swear you wont regret it
if you agree to go
just do me one small favor
before you tell me no

chorus
hold me in your arms
just see how it feels
dont make me wait forever
just because you know i will
dont leave me hanging wishing waiting
hoping that youll call
darling hold me in your arms and let me fall

when you go out shopping
you try on brand new clothes
to see if something fits or not
theres just one way to know
why is it any different
when someone asks you out
you might as well just try me on
before you turn me down

chorus
hold me in your arms
just see how it feels
dont make me wait forever
just because you know i will
dont leave me hanging wishing waiting
hoping that youll call
darling hold me in your arms and let me fall
