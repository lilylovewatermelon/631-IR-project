it looks like you might fall
its so far down
or maybe you were thinkin about jumpin

now you could have it all
if you learned a little patience
for though i cannot fly
im not content to crawl

so give me a little credit
have in me a little faith
i wanna be with you forever
if tomorrows not too late

but its always too late
when you got nothing to you say
you should never let the sun set on tomorrow
before the sun rises today

if i am another waste of everythin
you dreamed of i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you
as you suffer i will let you down

so youre walkin on the edge
and you wait your turn to fall
but youre so far gone
that you dont see the hands upheld to catch you
you might also likeand you could find the fault
in the heart that youve been handed
for though you cannot fly
youre not content to crawl

and its always too late
when you got nothin so you say
but we should never let the sun set on tomorrow
before the sun rises

if i am another waste of everythin
you hoped for i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you
as you suffer i will let you down

so youre standin on the ledge
it looks like you might fall

if i am another waste of everythin
you dreamed of i will let you down
if i am only here to watch you
as you suffer i will let you down

the answers we find
are never what we had in mind
so we make it up
as we go along
you dont talk of dreams
when i wont mention tomorrow
and we wont make
those promises we cant keep

i will never leave you
i will not let you down
i will never leave you
i will not let you downembed"
