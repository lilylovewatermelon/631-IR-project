you roll like thunder when you come crashin in
town aint been the same since you left with all your friends
you roll like thunder when you come crashing in
regattas in the wind thats why youre visiting

prechorus
you act like fucking mr brightside when youre with all your friends
but i know what youre like when the party ends

chorus
just do it
just do it dont wait
just do it
just do it dont wait

verse 2
you roll like thunder pourin all your drinks
the partys lit and you my friend halfcut when it begins
you roll like thunder youre tryna catch that wind
that lightning in the bottle that moonbeam in your hand

prechorus
and you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
but youre not satisfied at the rainbows end
