the love that me and you shared expired
so there will be no renewing our contracts
and i aint got nothing since ive been hired
so i cant take you back
i done gave you love and got no commission
so give me one reason why i should stay here
i thought compared to all the other guys you were different
but i cried the same old tears
i cant take it i cant do it no

chorus
this is my two week notice
i resign my position because
you aint treating me right
i been working on the job
just busting my ass
pleasing you everyday and night
i get no raises or no benefits
to stay with this establishment
im gone this is my two week notice

verse 2
id be a fool if i took you back boy
even though i love you i cant be that dumb
cause i can do bad all by myself
i dont need no help
the days over and done
its just a matter of if i leave you now
maybe you will recognize the good you have
aint it a shame that you took advantage of me
and you should not be mad
i dont want the job no more
she can have it
