ive been laughin with the tv talkin to the walls
dancin with the whiskey til we cant stand up at all
singin to the radio and sleepin with my dog
ive been cussin at these pictures least the ones of you
most times they dont say nothin but sometimes they do
and i catch em lookin back at me the way you used to

chorus
i might sound crazy
but you know ive always been
and at least i aint lonely
except every now and then
aint nothin here can hold me
like only you can
if you aint comin back baby
im thinkin maybe i could use some
new friends

verse 2
ive been waitin on the sunshine listеnin to the rain
starin out the window like thе view is gonna change
chasin my own shadow like its tryin to get away

chorus
i might sound crazy
but you know ive always been
and at least i aint lonely
except every now and then
aint nothin here can hold me
like only you can
if you aint comin back baby
im thinkin maybe i could use some
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likebridge
new friends i can run with
maybe have a little fun with
and i dont even care what we do
just dont tell em all id trade em all for you

chorus
i might sound crazy
but you know ive always been
and at least i aint lonely
except every now and then
aint nothin here can hold me
like only you can
if you aint comin back baby
im thinkin maybe i could use some
new friends
