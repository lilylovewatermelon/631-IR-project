oh youre back to me and the hunger returns
i told myself i was done for good
all the memories of all the pictures burned
i see them dancing my heart begins to pound

verse 1 danny worsnop
i didnt make a sound they didnt see me coming
the lights are left on the curtains left wide

prechorus danny worsnop  shawn milke
one scream its over
i lay them side by side side by side holding each other

chorus shawn milke
ill be there in the morning with a smile on my face
ill be there in the morning to start it all again

postchorus danny worsnop
boy you caught me red handed
youve got no fucking clue what you just got yourself into

verse 2 danny worsnop
panic runs down your leg seeing me kill again
you just got yourself caught and you dont even know it
on the drive you get the rush and pull the gun on me
we make the stop its time to be set free

oh the bullets gone
i take this spade i slit your throat
you fall into your grave i cover up my tracks im done
i wont kill again i said thats it im done

chorus shawn milke
ill be there in the morning with a smile on my face
ill be there in the morning to start it all again

outro danny worsnop
no shes daddys little girl she wasnt meant to be another me
but its the scissors to my throat to my fucking throat
no shes daddys little girl she wasnt meant to be another me
but its the scissors to my throat to my fucking throat
