she sits up high surrounded by the sun
one million branches and she loves everyone
mom and dad did you search for me
ive been up here so long im going crazy

chorus vic fuentes
and as the sun went down
we ended up on the ground
i heard the train shake the windows
you screamed over the sound
and as we own this night
i put your body to the test with mine
this love was out of control
three two one where did it go oh

verse 2 vic fuentes
now dont be crazy yes now of course you can stay here
been in a touring band for going on ten years
big deal she said i guess youre official oh
i only said it cause i know what its like to feel burned out
it gets you down weve all been there sometimes
but tonight ill make you feel beautiful once again

chorus
and as the sun went down
we ended up on the ground
i heard the train shake the windows
you screamed over the sound
and as we own this night
i put your body to the test with mine
this love was out of control
three two one where did it go

if i were you id put that away
see youre just wasted and thinking bout the past again
darling youll be okay
and she said
if you were me youd do the same
cause i cant take any more
ill draw the shades and close the door
everythings not alright and i would rather

chorus vic fuentes
and as the sun went down
we ended up on the ground
i heard the train shake the windows
you screamed over the sound
and as we own this night
i put your body to the test with mine
this love was out of control
