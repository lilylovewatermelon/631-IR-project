blood still stains when the sheets are washed
sex dont sleep when the lights are off
kids are still depressed when you dress them up
and syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
hes still dead when youre done with the bottle
of course its a corpse that you keep in the cradle
kids are still depressed when you dress them up
syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

verse 1
blood money blood money
how did you afford this ring that i love honey
just another shift at the drug company
he doesnt think im that fucking dumb does he

prechorus 1
it doesnt matter what you pull up to your home
we know what goes on inside
you call that ass your own we call that silicone
silly girl with silly boys

chorus
blood still stains when the sheets are washed
sex dont sleep when the lights are off
kids are still depressed when you dress them up
and syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
hes still dead when youre done with the bottle
of course its a corpse that you keep in the cradle
kids are still depressed when you dress them up
syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

prechorus 2
you got weights in your pockets when you go to the doctors
your favorite candys cotton thats why all your teeth are rotten
silly girls with silly boys
