can you hear the sound of the static noise
blastin out in stereo
cater to the class and the paranoid
music to my nervous system
advertisin love and religion
murder on the airwaves
slogans on the brink of corruption

prechorus
visions of blasphemy war and peace
ohoh screamin at you

chorus
i cant see a thing in the video
i cant hear a sound on the radio
in stereo in the static age

verse 2
billboard on the rise in the dawns landscape
workin your insanity
tragic Ã  la madness and concrete
coca cola execution
conscience on a cross and your hearts in a vice
squeezin out your state of mind
are what you own that you cannot buy
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeprechorus
what a fuckin tragedy strategy
ohoh screamin at you

chorus
i cant see a thing in the video
i cant hear a sound on the radio
in stereo in the static age
i cant see a thing in the video
i cant hear a sound on the radio
in stereo in the static age

bridge
hey hey its the static age
well this is how the west was won
hey hey its the static age millennium

guitar solo

verse 3
all i wanna know is a goddamned thing
not whats in the medicine
all i wanna do is i want to breathe
batteries are not included
whats the latest way that a man can die
screamin hallelujah hallelujah
singin out the dawns early light
prechorus
the silence of the rotten forgotten
ohoh screamin at you

chorus
i cant see a thing in the video
i cant hear a sound on the radio
in stereo in the static age
i cant see a thing in the video
i cant hear a sound on the radio
in stereo in the static age
i cant see a thing in the video woahoh
i cant hear a sound on the radio woahoh
in stereo in the static age
i cant see a thing in the video woahoh
i cant hear a sound on the radio woahoh
in stereo in the static age
