i met you on the sidewalk
i hoped you were the way you were before
dont give into the small talk
dont give up on the things that we adore
oh yes you know i like that
i like it like the way we were before
still got some things to work at
these days just walking around heres such a chore

chorus
we both need it all the more
just the way we were before
we both need it all the more
just the way we were before

verse 2 madeline follin brian oblivion
im pleased to see that old walk
skipping all the cracks on the concrete
these days youre walking real tall
or tall as someone like youve ever seen

ive been around a few blocks
i chased away the cobwebs in the street
i wound up all the old clocks
so we can say we never skipped a beat

we both need it all the more
just the way we were before
we both need it all the more
just the way we were before

refrain
cause we like that
just like the way we were before
its all mixed up
but thats just what we had in store

outro
you cant fix that
you cant fix that
you cant fix that
you cant fix that2embed"
