i lost myself in fear of losing you
i wish i didnt do but i did
i lost my own my own identity
forgot that you picked me for me

prechorus 1
but now i dont negotiate with insecurities
they always seem to get the best of me
i found i had to love myself the way i wanted you to
love me

chorus
no more secondguessing
no theres no more questioning
ill be the one defining who im gonna be
no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
im gonna love myself the way i want you to love me

verse 2
sometimes i wish my skin was a costume
that i could just unzip and strip
but who i am is who im meant to be
and its who you are in love in love with

so now i dont negotiate with insecurities
theyre going to have to take a back seat

love me

chorus
no more secondguessing
no theres no more questioning

no concealing feelings
or changing seasonally
im gonna love myself the way i want you to love me

no more standing in my own way lets go deeper lets get closer
no more standing in my own way the way i want you to love me
no more standing in my own way lets go deeper lets get closer
no more standing in my own way the way i want you to love me
