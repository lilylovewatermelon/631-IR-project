born with no soul lack of control
cut from the mold of the antisocial
plug them in and turn em on
process the data make yourself the bomb

verse 1
what is your target
what is your reason
do you have emotions is your heart freezing
seizing this opportunity to speak
you didnt say nothin but turn your fucking cheek

dead cell
dead cell

verse 2
sick in the head livin but dead hear what i said
learn a lesson from the almighty dread
jah mighty warrior nothings scarier
kids are getting sick like malaria
situation gets hairier im throwing up all types of barriers im telling ya
the kids are getting singled out
let me hear the dead cells shout

verse 3
stop pointing fingers cause we all are guilty
of clean cut lies and truth thats filthy
believe what is the root of the word
out comes lies when its cut into thirds
i dont believe what my eyes behold no
i dont believe what my ears are told no
seizing this opportunity to speak
im saying something dont turn your fucking cheek
