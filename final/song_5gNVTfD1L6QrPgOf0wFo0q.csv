the amount of pills im taking
counteracts the booze im drinking
and this vanity im breaking
lets me live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay
with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in
well ill choose the life ive taken
never mind the friends im making
and the beauty that im faking
lets me live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay
with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in

prechorus
and you can cry all you want to
i dont care how much youll invest yourself in me
were not working out
were not working out

chorus
and you cant touch my brother
and you cant keep my friends
and were not working out
were not working out
this time i mean it
never mind the times ive seen it

well i hope im not mistaken
by the news i heard from waking
and its hard to say im shaken
by the choices that i make
and well i find it hard to stay
with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in
well ill choose the life ive taken
never mind the friends im making
and i get a little shaken
cause i live my life like this
and well i find it hard to stay
with the words you say
oh baby let me in
oh baby let me in

prechorus
and you can cry all you want to
i dont care how much youll invest yourself in me

this time i mean it
never mind the times ive seen it
