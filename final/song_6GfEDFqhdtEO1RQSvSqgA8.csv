i must be honest with you babe just gotta be honest babe
i love to watch the faces that you make
when we make love ooh wee
but when im behind you holding your hips
and you close your eyes and bite your lips
i cant see you so might i suggest a change
now mama please dont think me strange for what im about to say please dont think me strange
if you know anything bout me by now
you know im a freak just follow my lead

watching ourselves make love
