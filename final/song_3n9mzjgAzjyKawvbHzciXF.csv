find myself at your door
just like all those times before
i’m not sure how i got there
all roads they lead me here
i imagine you are home
in your room all alone
and you open your eyes into mine
and everything feels better

prechorus both
and right before your eyes
im breaking no past
no reasons why
just you and me

chorus both
this is the last time im asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time im asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

verse 2 taylor swift
you find yourself at my door
and just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better
