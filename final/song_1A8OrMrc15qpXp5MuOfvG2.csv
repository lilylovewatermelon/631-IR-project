int pastels restaurant night

an insanely expensive restaurant on the upper east side
the decor is a mixture of chichi and rustic with swagged
silk curtains handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths
decorated with arrangements of moss twigs and hideous
exotic flowers the clientele is young wealthy and
confident dressed in the height of lateeighties style
pouffy lacroix dresses slinky alaïa armani power suits

closeup on a waiter reading out the specials

waiter

caesar salad for entrées tonight i have a swordfish
meatloaf with onion marmalade a rareroasted partridge
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale
huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen
table cloths each of the entrees is a rectangle about four
inches square and look exactly alike

closeup on various diners as we hear fragments of
conversation is that charlie sheen over there excuse
me i ordered cactus pear sorbet

waiter
and grilled freerange rabbit with herbed french fries our
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth

closeup on porcelain plates containing elaborate
perpendicular desserts descending on another table

patrick bateman timothy price craig mcdermott and david
van patten are at a table set for four they are all wearing
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slickedback
hair van patten wears hornrimmed glasses

the camera moves in on bateman as his narration begins

bateman vo
were sitting in pastels this nouvelle northern california
place on the upper east side
the waiter sets down plates containing tiny elaborately
decorated starters as he does so we hear batemans
description of each of the men at the table

bateman vo
youll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in
a remarkably similar fashion but there are subtle differences
between us mcdermott is the biggest asshole van
patten is the yes man price is the most wired im the
best looking we all have light tans right now im in a
bad mood because this is not a good table and van patten
keeps asking dumb obvious questions about how to dress

van patten
what are the rules for a sweater vest

mcdermott
what do you mean

price
yes clarify

mcdermott
well is it strictly informal

bateman
or can it be worn with a suit
mcdermott
smiling
exactly

bateman
with discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or
charcoal gray vest a plaid suit would cal i for a bolder
vest

mcdermott
but avoid matching the vests pattern with your socks or
tie wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look
too studied

van patten
you think so

price
youll look like you consciously worked for the look

van patten
good point excuse me gentlemen

van patten leaves the table as he does so a busboy
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates

bateman
van patten looks puffy has he stopped working out

price
it looks that way doesnt it

mcdermott
staring at retreating waiter
did he just take our plates away

price
he took them away because the portions are so small he
probably thought we were finished god i hate this place
this is a chicks restaurant why arent we at dorsia

mcdermott
because bateman wont give the maitre d head
he guffaws

bateman throws a swizzle stick at him

mcdermott scans the room settling on a handsome young man
with slickedback hair and hornrimmed glasses

mcdermott

mcdermott

price

bateman

room over there

he points to another handsome young man with slickedback
hair and hornrimmed glasses

mcdermott
who is he with

price
distracted by the waitresss
cleavage as she bends over to
uncork a bottle of wine – the
waitress glares at him
some weasel from kicker peabody

van patten returns

van patten

mcdermott

ext tunnel nightclub  night

the limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the tunnel
mcdermott holds the door open for a passing homeless man
who looks confused

mcdermott

the man stumbles away the club doorman seeing the limousine
unhooks the
velvet rope and welcomes them inside

int ladies room tunnel  night

brilliant white light a bemused elderly female attendant in a
blackandwhite maids uniform trying to give out paper towels
music thuds through an open doorway trashedlooking girls
stare into mirrors repairing their eye makeup or sit on the
counter chatting to friends there are almost as many men as
women in the room couples stand in line twitching as they
wait to do coke as soon as one bathroom door opens a couple
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes
past them and slams the door

price
theres this theory out now that if you can catch the
aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected
then you can also catch anythingalzheimers muscular
dystrophy hemophilia leukemia diabetes dyslexia for
christs sakeyou can get dyslexia from pussy

bateman

virus

bateman opens a tiny packet of coke

the corner of his amex card in the packet and takes a snort

bateman

they both dig their platinum amex cards into the envelope
of white powder shoveling it up their noses then sticking
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into
their gums

int nightclub  night

bateman saunters toward the bar as pump up the volume
plays in the background

bateman to bargirl two stoli on the rocks

he hands her two drink tickets

bargirl

a cash bar thatll be twentyfive dollars

bateman pulls out an expensivelooking wallet and hands her
a 50

she turns her back and searches the cash register for
change

bateman you are a fucking ugly bitch i want to stab to
death and then play around with your blood

the music muffles his voice she turns around he is
smiling at her she gives him his change impassively

int batemans apartment morning

tableaux of batemans apartment in the early morning light
a huge white living room with floortoceiling windows
looking out over manhattan decorated in expensive minimalist
high style bleached oak floors a huge white sofa a large
baselitz painting hung upside down and much expensive
electronic equipment the room is impeccably neat and oddly
impersonal  as if it had sprung straight from the pages of
a design magazine

bateman v0
my name is patrick bateman i am
twentysix years old i live in the american garden
buildings on west eightyfirst street on the eleventh
floor tom cruise lives in the penthouse

bateman walks into his bathroom urinates while trying to
see his reflection in a poster for les miserables above his
toilet

bateman
v0 i believe in taking care of myself in a
balanced diet in a rigorous exercise routine in the
morning if my face is a little puffy ill put on an ice
pack while doing my stomach crunches i can do a thousand
now

bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face

bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living
room wearing the ice pack

cut to

a mirrorlined bathroom bateman is luxuriating in the
shower steam scrubbing his body admiring his muscles

bateman vo
after i remove the icepack i use a deep
porecleanser lotion in the shower i use a
wateractivated gel cleanser then a honeyalmond body
scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub

bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a
gel facial masque

bateman vo
then i apply an herb mint facial masque which
i leave on for ten minutes while i prepare the rest of my
routine

bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet which is
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products he
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes laying them in
readiness on the marble counter

bateman vo
i always use an aftershave lotion with little
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes
you look older then moisturizer then an antiaging eye
balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion

bateman stares into the mirror the masque has dried
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been
wrapped in plastic he begins slowly peeling the gel masque
off his face

bateman vo
there is an idea of a patrick bateman some
kind of abstraction hut there is no real me only an
entity something illusory and though i can hide my cold
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably
comparable i simply am not there

int bateman bedroom  morning

another huge white room equally minimal a futon rumpled
white sheets a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb and a large
expensive painting eric fischl or david salle chosen by
batemans interior decorator

dressed in silk boxer shorts bateman stands in front of a
huge walkin closet filled with rows of expensive shirts
shoes and designer suits organized according to color and
tone

bateman vo
it is hard for me to make sense on any given
level my self is fabricated an aberration my personality
is sketchy and unformed my heartlessness goes deep and is
persistent

fully dressed in armani bateman stands in front of a
fulllength mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom
adjusting his cufflinks

bateman v0
my conscience my pity my hopes disappeared
a long time ago if they ever did exist

he gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees
he gives his reflection a smile

int offices of pierce  pierce  day

as bateman walks down the corridor he passes another man who
looks just like him

of the room and starts watching jeopardy

the taxi bumps to a halt

int espace restaurant night

a cavernous garage harshly spotlit decorated in
selfconscious brutalist chic iron girders walls of waxed
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes a huge schnabel
smashedplate painting on one wall the tables and chairs are
made of extremely uncomfortable
bolted steel

bateman vo
im on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at espace
since im positive we wont have a decent table but we do
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave

tm price and two downtown types stash and vanden are
already seated vanden is about twenty pretty and sullen
with green streaks in her black hair stash is pale with
ragged black hair and bad skin

they are all trying to read large stainless steel menus
that look like minimalist art

price
the menus in braille

he gets up to greet them giving evelyn a suspiciously long
kiss

price
i have to talk to you

he drags her away half giggling and protesting

evelyn
over her shoulder
pat this is my cousin vanden
and her boyfriend stash hes an artist

bateman
after smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and
checking his hair
hi pat bateman

vanden takes his hand reluctantly says nothing

bateman
let me guessyou live in the east village

pause

stash
soho

courtney rawlinson and luis carruthers arrive at the table
courtney is blonde classically beautiful and from
precisely the same social background as evelyn but she is
considerably more fragile and neurotic luis is
halfenglish halfargentinean slightly overweight a
rarity in this crowd puppyish and eager to please he
wears the same type of designer clothes as price and
bateman but with foppish tendencies velvet jackets
bowties boldly patterned vests

they exchange air kisses as soon as luis turns his back
bateman sneaks a kiss on courtneys neck

courtney
whispering
stop it

stash and vanden watch them in silence

later

price is whispering in evelyns ear everyone else is
quietly eating except bateman who is drinking and watching
evelyn and price

bateman vo
i am fairly sure that timothy and evelyn
are having an affair timothy is the only interesting
person i know courtney is almost perfect looking she s
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs tonight
i believe its xanax more disturbing than her drug use
though is the fact that shes engaged to luis carruthers
the biggest dufus in the business

courtney rouses herself from her drug haze

courtney
tell me stashdo you think soho is
becoming tocommercial

carruthers
yes i read that

price
oh who gives a rats ass

vanden
hey that affects us

price
wired on coke
oh ho ho that affects us what
about the massacres in sri lanka honey doesnt that
affect us too i mean dont you know anything about sri
lanka about how the sikhs are killing like tons of
israelis there doesnt that affect us

bateman
oh come on price there are a lot more important
problems than sri lanka to worry about sure our foreign
policy is important but there are more pressing problems
at hand

price
like what

bateman
well we have to end apartheid for one and slow
down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world
hunger but we cant ignore our social needs either we
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system we
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
also promoting equal rights for women but change the
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still
somehow maintain womens freedom of choice

the table stares at bateman uncomfortably

bateman
we also have to control the influx of illegal
immigrants we have to encourage a return to traditional
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on tv in
movies in pop music everywhere most importantly we have
to promote general social concern and less materialism in
young people

price chokes on his drink everyone is silent and
mystified

carruthers
patrick how thoughtprovoking

int evelyns bedroom  later the same evening

home shopping channel with the remote in her hand finally
he straddles her penis close to her face she tries to
look around him at the tv then takes notice

evelyn

oh christ this really isnt worth it and see
courtney its there for what huh tell us
he slaps her again lightly
why is it pulled down half an inch
so it can catch the force of the ejaculate

courtney
choking crying
well its not a turnon for me
i have a promotion coming to me i dont want to get aids

bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom

bateman
see happy you dumb bitch are you happy you dumb bitch

courtney
oh god just get it over with

he fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and
falls down next to her they lie side by side with their
bodies not touching eyes open staring at the
ceiling

int conference room pierce  pierce  day

bateman and luis carruthers are seated at a long table in
the conference room at pierce  pierce which looks out onto
a spectacular view of manhattan

carruthers

dorsia how impressive how on earth did you get a
reservation there

bateman

carruthers

valentino couture

bateman
uh huh

carruthers
reaching out to touch it
it looks so soft

bateman
catching luis hand
your compliment was sufficient luis

carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague
on his leftpaul owen enters carrying the wall st journal
under his arm he is handsome supremely confident and
selfsatisfied he sees himself as a leader among men

owen
to bateman
hello halberstam nice tie how the hell are you

bateman
ive been great and you

their conversation fades down as we hear batemans
thoughts

bateman vo
owen has mistaken me for this dickhead marcus halberstam
it seems logical because marcus also works at pp and in
fact does the same exact thing i do and he also has a
penchant for valentino suits and oliver peoples glasses
marcus and i even go to the same barber although i have
a slightly better haircut

during this voiceover the camera wanders over to marcus
halberstam who is conferring with a colleague in the
opposite corner of the room he bears a
superficial resemblance to bateman

owen
hows the ransom account going marcus

bateman
nervous
itsitsall right

owen
really thats interesting
he stares at bateman smiling
not great

bateman
oh well you know

owen

closeup on batemans face cold with hatred

price

mcdermott whispering

bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card

price
suddenly enthused

mcdermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully

mcdermott

van patten

bateman

silian rail

mcdermott

van patten

he pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the
table

van patten

price

bateman clenches his fists beneath the table trying to
control his anxiety

van patten
eggshell with romalian type
turning to bateman

bateman
barely able to breath his voice a croak
nice

price
holding the card up to the light
jesus this is really super howd a nitwit like you get so
tasteful

bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at
mcdermotts

bateman vo

price

he holds up his own card

price
raised lettering pale nimbus white

bateman
choking with anxiety
impressive very nice lets see paul owens card

price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it
up for their inspection paul owen pierce  pierce
mergers and acquisitions bateman swallows speechless
the sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint
heartbeat as bateman stares at the magnificent card

bateman vo
look at that subtle offwhite coloring the tasteful thickness
of it oh my god it even has a watermark

his hand shaking bateman lifts up the card and stares at it
until it fills the screen

he lets it fall the sound returns to normal

carruthers is something wrong patrickyoure sweating

ext street evening

the financial district the streets are eerily deserted

bateman stands at an atm enjoying the reassuring sound of
500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine as he turns
to leave he notices someone across the street

grate surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart a
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart i am

polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants

a serrated edge he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to
protect it

bateman

homeless mans pov as bateman lunges at him with the knife

extreme wide shot of the street batemans shadowed figure
is hunched over the homeless man stabbing him in the stomach
the dog barks wildly and bateman stomps on it until it is
silent

low angle shot of bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground

bateman
theres a quarter go buy some gum

bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of wall street
cars drift past their headlights momentarily illuminating the
body left twitching on the ground

int beauty salon  day

womans hands rub cream into his face

facialist

fine so smooth

his eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he
closes them again

bateman vo

skin hairbut not a single clear identifiable emotion except
for greed und disgust something horrible is happening inside
me and i dont know why

bateman sitting in a chair looking down at the
manicurist who is giving him a pedicure she is cutting his
nails with tiny sharp scissors he stares at them longingly

bateman vo

on the verge of frenzy

bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning
bed wearing goggles

bateman vo

int texarkana restaurant  night

an insanely expensive nouvelle texmex restaurant with an
ironic southwestern decor santa fe colors navajo blankets
naive cowboy art rawhide banquettes

bateman bursts in the door late and approaches the maitre d

bateman
marcus halberstam for two at eight

maitre d

paul owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of
rams horns he is arguing with the waiter

owen

another pause

bateman

bateman
come on you dumb son of a bitch
helping him into his jacket
ive got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a
bottle of absolut waiting for us

int batemans apartment  night
the living room floor has been meticulously covered with
newspaper

owen is slumped drunkenly in a white eames chair a glass
in his hand bateman is looking through his cds

bateman
you like huey lewis and the news

owen
theyre okay
bateman
their early work was a little too new wave for my
taste but then sports came out in 1983 i think they really
came into their own commercially and artistically

bateman walks to his bathroom taking a large ax out of the
shower he takes two valium

bateman
said partly from the bathroom
the whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost
bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall
he walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat watching owen
from behind ail the time

bateman
hes been compared to elvis costello but i think
huey has a more bitter cynical sense of humor

owen is absentmindedly leafing through the barneys
catalogue

owen
hey halberstam

bateman
yes owen

owen
why are there copies of the style section all over
the place do you have a dog a chow or something

bateman
no owen

owen
confused
is that a raincoat

bateman
yes it is

bateman moves to the cd player he takes a cd out of its
case and slides it in the machine

bateman
in 1987 huey released this fore their most
accomplished album i think i heir undisputed masterpiece is
hip to be square a song so catchy that most people probably
dont listen to the lyrics but they should because its not
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of
trends its al a personal statement about the band itself

bateman puts on hip to be square

bateman crosses the room and picks up the ax

we follow bateman from behind as he walks up to owen the
ax raised over his head

bateman
hey paul

as owen turns around from owens pov we see bateman swing
the ax toward his face

blood sprays onto the white raincoat

from behind owen we see bateman as he yanks the ax out

owen drops to the floor his body falls out of the frame
we stay on his legs twitching mechanically

blood pulses onto the newspapercovered floor

bateman
raising the ax and screaming
try getting a reservation at dorsia now you fucking
stupid bastard

low angle on bateman as he beats owen with the back of the
ax

offscreen the sound of the ax hitting owen

bateman
panting
fucking bastard

bateman takes his raincoat off still panting he folds the
coat carefully in half bloody side in and drapes it neatly
over the back of a chair

he sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene he
checks his rolex and lights a cigar

offscreen paul owens last faint sighs are heard

int lobby  night

bateman drags a large bloodsoaked sleeping bag through the lobby
past the bored doorman who looks up from the post for a moment

ext street  night

bateman is trying to hail a cab owens body is at his
feet luis carruthers and a japanese girl walk up to him

carruthers
patrick is that you

bateman
no luis its not me youre mistaken

carruthers

owens body into the backseat

bateman gets into the cab

carruthers

bateman

int batemans hells kitchen apartment  night

a bare room lit by one light bulb the walls are blank
except for a les miserables poster there is one ratty chair

bateman pours lime over paul owens body which is lying in
a bathtub he plays huey lewis smokes a cigar watches the
body dissolve

int paul owens apartment  night

bateman is letting himself into the apartment it is very
similar to batemans but even more minimalist the walls
are whitepigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting
on the wall one wall is covered in a trendy largescale
scientific drawing above a long black leather couch

bateman
where to send the bastard dallas pans

he throws some clothes into a suitcase randomly grabbing
toiletries and shoving them in

bateman
singapore london ill send the asshole to london

he puts some music on to help muffle his voice then leans
over the answering machine

he does a passable imitation of owens speech

bateman
hi this is paul ive been called away to london
for a few days meredith ill call you when i get back
hasta la vista baby

int batemans office  morning

bateman is sitting at his desk with the latest copy of
sports illustrated in front of him and his walkman playing

bateman
now john youve got to wear clothes in proportion
to your physique there are definite dos and donts good
buddy of wearing a boldstriped shirt a holdstriped shirt
calls for solidcolored or discreetly patterned suits and ties

the door to the office opens and he waves in detective donald
kimball kimball is surprisingly young  about batemans age 
and goodlooking dressed in a crumpled linen armani suit of
the type bateman and his friends might wear

kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a
selfassurance that makes bateman so nervous he forgets to
carry on with his fake conversation kimball looks up at
him curiously noticing the silence

bateman
realizing that kimball is staring at him
right and yesalways tip the stylist fifteen percent

bateman shrugs at the detective rolling his eyes in
exasperation

kimball nods understandingly

bateman
listen john ive got to go t boone pickens just

kimball stares at the three open copies of sports
illustrated and the sony walkman lying on batemans desk
bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines
into the top drawer along with the walkman which is
still running

bateman
forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed

actually thats none of your business christie
hut i can assure you it certainly wasnt cheap

bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and sabrina takes a
pack of cigarettes out of her purse
bateman returns carrying a tray of chocolates

bateman
no no smoking not in here

he walks over to christie

bateman
varda truffle

christie stares at the plate and shakes her head sabrina
takes one

bateman
i dont want you to get drunk but thats a very
fine chardonnay youre not drinking

bateman goes over to his cds and scans his vast collection
he takes one out and examines it

bateman
do you like phil collins ive been a big genesis
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album duke before
that i really didnt understand any of their work it was too
artsy too intellectual it was on duke where phil collins
presence became more apparent he puts aside the cd and takes out
another one

bateman
i think invisible touch is the groups undisputed
masterpiece

he puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him
into the bedroom

bateman
its an epic meditation on intangibility at the
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
three albums christie take off the robe

bateman puts out a lace teddy he motions to christie to
put it on

bateman
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks
collins and rutherford you can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument sabrina remove your dress

bateman starts to undress

bateman
in terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
songwriting this album hits a new peak of professionalism
sabrina why dont you dance a little

sabrina dances awkwardly christie sits on the bed

bateman
take the lyrics to land of confusion in this
song phil collins addresses the problem of abusive political
authority

bateman knots a silk scarf around christies neck  rather
menacingly  then helps her into some suede gloves

bateman
in too deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about
monogamy and commitment the song is extremely uplifting
their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything
ive heard in rock

he turns on the video camera

bateman
christie get down on your knees so sabrina can see your
asshole

bateman looks through the viewfinder

bateman
phill collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way especially
songs like in the air tonight and against
all odds sabrina dont just stare at it eat it

he walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in
the cd

bateman
but i also think that phill collins works better
within the confines of the group than as a solo artistand
i stress the word artist this is sussudio a great
great song a personal favorite

sex montage cut to sussudio we see this in wide shot or
through the lens of the video camera

cut to

bateman asleep in his bed with christie and sabrina
on either side of him sabrina accidentally touches his
wrist batemans eyes open

bateman
dont touch the rolex

bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire

he opens the drawer in which are a nail gun a coat hanger
a rusty butter knife and a halfsmoked cigar he turns
around to see christie and sabrina both starting to get up
and get dressed he takes the coat hanger

bateman
were not through yet

cut to

bateman ushering them out the door impatiently they
are both sobbing badly bruised and bleeding bateman has a
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder in the
bg phil collins in the air tonight is playing

int yale club – day

mcdermott van patten and bateman are
having drinks price walks by with a gorgeous girl and
gives them the finger

bateman
what an asshole

mcdermott
why is laurie kennedy dating price hes a
fucking drug addict no selfcontrol

van patten
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody what do
you think bateman

bateman
i know her i knew her

mcdermott
why do you say it like that why does he say it
like that

van patten
because he dated her

bateman
how did you guess

van patten
girls dig bateman hes cq youre total cq
bateman

bateman
thanks guy butshes got a lousy
personality

mcdermott
so what its all looks laurie kennedy is a
babe dont even pretend you were interested for any other
reason

van patten
if they have a good personality then something
is very wrong

mcdermott
if they have a good personality and they are not
great lookingwho fucking cares

bateman
well lets just say hypothetically okay what if
they have a good personality
he smiles giving up
i know i know

all in unison
there are no girls with good personalities
they laugh and highfive each other

van patten
a good personality consists of a chick with a
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth
shut

mcdermott
listen the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even
talentedthough god knows what the fuck that meansare ugly
chicks

van patten
absolutely

mcdermott
and this is because they have to make up for how
fucking unattractive they are

pause

bateman
do you know what ed gein said about women

van patten
ed gein maitre d at canal bar

bateman
no serial killer wisconsin in the fifties he was
an interesting guy

mcdermott

bateman
he said when i see a pretty girl walking down the
street i think two things one part of me wants to take her
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat
her right

pauses finishes his drink

mcdermott
what does the other part of him think

bateman
what her head would look like on a stick

mcdermott and van patten look at each other and then back
at bateman bateman starts to laugh and the other two uneasily
join in

luis carruthers walks up to the table

carruthers
shyly
hi guys i wanna get your opinion on something

mcdermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table

mcdermott if its about the bowtie youre wearing you
know how we feel about it luis laughs goodnaturedly

carruthers
yes i do no its my business cardi decided to
get a new one too

he pulls out something incredibly tasteful everyone
compliments luis except bateman the sound drops and all we hear
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously
luis plucks it from his hand and walks away pleased with
himself

van patten
listen what about dinner

bateman
suddenly angry
is that all you ever have to contribute van patten what about
fucking dinner

mcdermott
ah cheer up bateman

whats the matter no shiatsu this morning

bateman
watching luis going into the mens room

mcdermott

patten grabs a waiter

van patten

int mens room  day

bateman pulls on his gloves as he
enters the mens room carruthers is standing in a stall with his
back to bateman the sound of his urinating is heard until bateman
approaches then abruptly stops slowly bateman brings his hands
up over the collar of carruthers cashmere jacket circling his
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet all we can hear
is the sound of batemans heavy breathing slowly he starts to
squeeze almost in slow motion carruthers turns around

carruthers looks down at batemans wrists as if lost in
thought then he lowers his head and kisses batemans
wrist he looks back at bateman with a shy lovestruck
expression then reaches up and tenderly touches the side
of his face

carruthers
god patrick why here

he strokes batemans hair

carruthers
ive seen you looking at me ive noticed your hot body

carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but bateman backs
away he drops his hands from carruthers neck carruthers
immediately takes them and places them back bateman drops
them again

carruthers
dont be shy

bateman takes a deep breath closes his eyes and tries to lift
his hands again but abandons the attempt

carruthers
you dont know how long ive wanted it ever since that christmas
party at arizona 206 you know the one you were wearing that
redstriped paisley armani tie

bateman looks down and sees that carruthers pants are
still unzipped he moves past him out of the stall and
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he
realizes he still has his gloves on carruthers comes up
behind him

carruthers
i want you i want youtoo

bateman storms out of the mens room bumping into a waiter
and several customers and cursing noticing the maitre d
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely
bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at
them carruthers walks up behind him

bateman

are you telling me youve never gotten it on with a girl

elizabeth
no im not a lesbian why do you think id be into that

bateman
well you went to sarah lawrence for one thing

elizabeth
those are sarah lawrence guys patrick youre making me
feel weird

later

elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making
out with christie bateman holds up a whitney houston cd
showing them the picture of whitney on the cover

bateman
did you know that whitney houstons debut lp
called simply whitney houston had four numberone singles
on it did you know that christie whitneys voice leaps
across so many boundaries and is so versatilethough shes
mainly a jazz singerthat its hard to take in the album
on a first listening

elizabeth
you actually listen to whitney houston you
actually have a whitney houston cd more than one

she giggles rolling off the sofa onto the floor

bateman
ignoring her
its hard to choose a favorite track
among so many great ones but the greatest love of all
is one of the best most powerful songs ever written about
selfpreservation and dignity its universal message
crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope
that its not too late to better ourselves to act kinder
since elizabeth its impossible in the world we live in
to empathize with others we can always empathize with
ourselves

as he speaks he opens the case and carefully places the cd
in the player admiring its pristine silver surface and
watches it slide into the machine

bateman
its an important message crucial really and its
beautifully stated on the album

int bedroom  later

an outoffocus home video shot of elizabeth christie and
bateman in the throes of sex in the master bedroom

cut back to wide shot of the bedroom partially blocked by
the video camera in the foreground their bodies are an
incoherent tangle of arms and legs the only sounds are
moans heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against
flesh close on christies head and shoulders her eyes are
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional
performance turning her head every so often to check the
progress of her partners

offscreen we hear elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure
moaning loudly her voice gets louder and louder and then
shifts to actual pain

bateman rises up off the bed suddenly appearing behind
christie there is blood on his face

christie turns her head and sees him she screams and leaps
off the bed running out of the room she slams the
mirrored door behind her and as it swings shut for a split
second we see elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed

we follow christie out of the room panicking screaming

christie runs down a darkened hallway frantically opening
doors looking for an escape

she hears the sound of a chainsaw coming from the bedroom

she opens a closet the closet lights up as she opens the
door and sees two dead women hanging inside she screams
then claps a hand over her mouth she stops and listens the
distant sound of the chainsaw

she backs away slowly into another dark room lit only by
the light from a television set through the darkness she
sees a head on the top of the tv and starts to whimper

she runs toward the nearest door finding herself in the
main hallway she begins to jog toward the front door then
runs

bateman appears from nowhere holding the chainsaw
spattered with blood

christie screams and changes direction bateman leaps at
her bellowing

they run through the bedroom and into the bathroom
christie trips over elizabeths body which is half in the
bathtub

both are slipping on the floor which is slick with blood

christie falls tries to get up bateman grabs her leg he
tries to bite it

she kicks him in the face and gets up running toward the
front door

he runs after her

bateman
not the face you bitch not the fucking face you
piece of bitch trash

christie screaming makes it out the front door

bateman runs after her

she runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors

she moves to the elevator pounding hysterically on the
buttons she sees the stairwell and runs for it

bateman sees this and runs after her revving the chainsaw

she runs down the stairs bateman two flights behind her
he stops leans over the railing to look at her then aims
the chainsaw at her and drops it

christie screams offscreen then is suddenly silent

from batemans pov we see christies body sprawled facedown
at the bottom of the stairwell the chainsaw sticks out of
her back like a sword

int crayons  early evening

an insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif paper
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing lots of primary
colors and a goldfish bowl on each table

bateman is at a table with evelyn they are both drawing on
the tablecloth bateman is drawing christie with the
chainsaw in her back

evelyn

bateman

evelyn waves to a couple across the room

evelyn
distracted

bateman
speaking very carefully measuring each word
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale
cannot be um corrected but i have no other way to fulfill
my needs

the woman across the room holds up her hand displaying a
new bracelet evelyn smiles and nods approvingly

bateman
we need to talk

evelyn

about

bateman

evelyn
motioning to the waiter for water

bateman

evelyn

friends i dont think it would work
reaching over to dab his face with a napkin
you have a little something on your upper lip

bateman
brushing her hand away
i know that your friends are my friends ive thought about
that you can have them

evelyn stares at him suspicious and bewildered a
realization dawning

evelyn

bateman

evelyn
but what about the past our past

bateman
we never really shared one

evelyn

bateman
imin touch with humanity evelyn im sorry
he pauses as if searching for the right words
youre just not terribly important to me

evelyn begins to cry

evelyn
no no no

bateman
i know my behavior iserratic sometimes

she reaches desperately across the table and takes his
hand bateman pulls his hand away

evelyn
sobbing
what do you want me to do what is it you want

the occupants of nearby tables begin to stare bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed

bateman
looking uncomfortably around the room
if you really want to do something for me you can stop making
this scene right now

evelyn
oh god i cant believe this

bateman
im leaving now ive assessed the situation and im going

evelyn makes an effort to compose herself she blots the
tears so they will not affect her makeup

evelyn
surprisingly calm
where are you going

bateman
im just leaving

evelyn
but where

bateman
i have to return some videotapes

he rushes out of the room

ext tribeca street  evening

bateman wanders into misty tribeca streets sees a stray cat

bateman
here kitty kitty

the small mangy cat rubs against him he picks it up and
walks toward an atm holding the cat he puts his card in
the machine the screen reads feed me a stray cat
bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the
deposit slot with some difficulty the kitten squeals he
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the
kitten he doesnt notice the woman waiting behind him

woman
oh my god stop that what are you doing

bateman wheels around and shoots her she falls screaming
to the floor

responding to the gunshot a police car siren wails in the
distance bateman breaks into a run the police car
screeches after him

cop car os
halt stop put down your weapon

bateman ducks down an alley

ext alley  night

a cop rushes toward him seemingly from
out of nowhere and tackles him trying to get the gun away
from him

bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of
them have their hands on the gun then shoots him again he
reloads the gun the sound of more cop cars arriving

he runs out of the alley

ext street  night

as he reaches the street he finds a phalanx of police cars
approaching

cop car
halt put down your weapon

the cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air
bateman shoots at them the police return fire

bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly a bullet hits the gas tank of one of the
police cars it catches fire and explodes the flames light
up the scene illuminating the bodies of policemen both living
and dead

new angle bateman flees from the scene the camera follows
him as he runs along a row of porsches trying to open each
one setting off a cacophony of car alarms
the sound of police sirens draws near

new angle he runs panting until he ends up in front of a
tail brilliantly lit office building as he approaches
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor

int office building  night

he rushes into the lobby running for the elevator

night watchman
burning the midnight oil mr smith you
forgot to sign in

bateman wheels around and shoots him he runs toward the
revolving doors as he swings around in the doors he
notices a janitor who has witnessed the shooting he
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor

new angle

he runs out of the building and across the
street to an identical office building the one that houses
pierce  pierce

int pierce  pierce lobby  night

bateman nods at the pierce  pierce night watchman and signs
in he breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close
behind him

int batemans office  night

bateman stands looking out
through the floorlength windows at a panoramic night view
of the city and the river

below him he sees a swat team swarming over the roof of the
opposite building there are ambulances standing by flares
everywhere distant sirens

suddenly the sound of a helicopter draws near frightened
he drops to the floor behind his desk

helicopter searchlights scan the building illuminating
batemans office for a few moments with a blaze of light

he is crouched in one corner halfsobbing talking into
the phone as the searchlight keeps circling

bateman

bateman hangs up the phone the helicopter searchlight
circles back briefly illuminating the room the camera rises
up over bateman huddled in the corner staring blankly at the
sky

the conversation breaks up as van patten takes out his phone

van patten
whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers i need a scotch

the sounds of the bar fade down the following voiceover runs
over images of bateman and his friends ordering drinks talking
on portable phones talking laughing  combined with images of
other very similar young men at other tables drinking talking
on portable phones talking laughing

bateman vo
there are no more barriers to cross all i have in common with
the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil
all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward
it i have now surpassed

int batemans office  day

jean is alone in batemans office looking through his diary
we see the pages that she is looking at they are filled with
doodles of mutilated women and their namesjean looks lost
and frightened and begins to cry

bateman vo
my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better
world for anyone i fact i want my pain to be inflicted on
others i want no escape

int harrys bar  early evening
as the film ends the camera moves close on bateman he is
leaning back in his leather armchair drinking a double scotch
his eyes blank

bateman vo
but even after admitting this there is no catharsis i gain no
deeper knowledge about myself no new knowledge can be extracted
from my telling there has been no reason for me to tell you any
of this this confession has meant nothing

the camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him
this is not an exit
