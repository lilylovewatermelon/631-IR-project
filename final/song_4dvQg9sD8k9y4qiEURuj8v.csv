verse 1 beyoncé
ooh i put it right there made it easy for you to get to
now you wanna act like ya dont know what to do
after i had done everything that you asked me
grabbed you grind you liked you tried you
move so fast baby now i cant find you

ooh two things i dont like when i tryin to get my groove
is a partner that meets me only halfway and just cant prove
take me out so deep when you know you cant swim
need a lifeguard and i need protection
to put it on me deep in the right direction
do you understand the facts that im tryin to give to you
you movin so slow like you just dont have a clue
didnt mama teach you to give affection
i know the difference from a man and an adolescent
it aint you boo so get to steppin
