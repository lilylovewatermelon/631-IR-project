somewhere far away from here
i saw stars stars that i could reach yeah
it was a midnight a silent twilight
we fell down beyond the ocean beach yeah

verse 1
id assemble all the sand that cover wedding beaches
to build a castle so your mom would have a place to stay
behind the water slide and down the hill where heaven reaches
land and time is left to float away yeah
so rest assured i have a key to every opening
to every wishing well thats deep enough to drink drink
i want to show you just how fascinating kissing is
when earth collides with all the space between yeah

chorus
im reaching farther than i ever have before
leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
i may be some sort of crazy we may be some sort of crazy
but i swear on everything i have and more

verse 2
so never look behind you spooky people bring you down
the world is ending theres a party by the bay
ill wear my suit and tie when i am i am toasting to
the way you put that smile upon my face yeah
fill up the air balloon and ride with me
yeah hell is jealous of the rain rain
make love like time and space is ending while befriending fates
alluring way of putting us to shame

im reaching farther than i ever have before
leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
i may be some sort of crazy we may be some sort of crazy
but i swear on everything i have and more

bridge
you make the sound of pulling heaven down
you brought the rains romantic pour
you make the sound you make the sound
of pulling heaven down

chorus x2
im reaching farther than i ever have before
tired of wasting time
leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
tired of wasting time
i may be some sort of crazy we may be some sort of crazy
but i swear on everything i have and more
go go go goembed"
