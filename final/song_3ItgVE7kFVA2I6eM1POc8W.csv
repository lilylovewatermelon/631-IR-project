roll me on your frozen fields
break my bones to watch them heal
drowned me in your thirsty veins
where ill watch and ill wait
and pray for the rain

curl like smoke and breathe again
down your throat inside your ribs
through your spine and every nerve
where i watch and i wait
and yield to the hurt

chorus
and if you dont believe the sun will rise
stand alone and greet the coming night
in the last remaining light

verse 2
the seven moons and the seven suns
heaven waits for those who run
down your winter and underneath your waves
where you watch and you wait
and pray for the day

chorus
and if you dont believe the sun will rise
stand alone and greet the coming night
in the last remaining light
you might also likechorus
and if you dont believe the sun will rise
stand alone and greet the coming night
in the last remaining light
