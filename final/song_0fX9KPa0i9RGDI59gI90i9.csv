she seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
so fragile yet so devious she continues to see
climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
enter the night that she came home forever

prechorus
oh shes the only one that makes me sad

verse 2
she is everything and more the solemn hypnotic
my dahlia bathed in possession huh she is home to me
i get nervous perverse when i see her its worse
but the stress is astounding
its now or never shes comin home forever

prechorus
oh shes the only one that makes me sad
what am i doing here
shes my imagination come alive
what am i doing what am i doing here
shes my imagination come alive
my imagination come alive come alive

verse 3
hard to say what caught my attention
fixed and crazy aphid attraction
carve my name in my face carve my name to recognize
such a pheromone cult terrorize to terrorize

verse 4
oh im a slave and i am a master
no restraints and unchecked collectors
i exist through my need i exist to selfoblige
she is something in me i despise that i despise
chorus

i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
i wont let this build up inside of me
