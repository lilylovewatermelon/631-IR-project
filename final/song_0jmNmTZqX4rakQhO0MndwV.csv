his old man was a rebel yeller
bad boy to the bone hed say
can’t trust a colored feller
hed judge em by the tone of their skin

verse 2
he was raised to think like his dad
narrow minded full of hate
on the road to no where fast
til the grace of god got in the way

verse 3
then he saw the light and hit he’s knees
and cried and said a prayer
rose up a brand new man
left the old one right there

chorus
here’s to the strong
thanks to the brave
don’t give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change

she was born with her mothers habit
guess you could say its in her blood
she hates it that she’s got to have it
she fills a glass up

verse 5
shed love to kill that bottle
but all she could think about is a
a better life a second chance
and everyone she’s letting down
she throws that bottle down

chorus
here’s to the strong
thanks to the brave
don’t give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change

break
thank god for those who make it
let them be the light
some people change

chorus
here’s to the strong
thanks to the brave
don’t give up hope
some people change
against all odds
against the grain
love finds a way
some people change

some people change
