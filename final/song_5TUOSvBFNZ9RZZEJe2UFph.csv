verse 3 rick ross
before the block got whipped
and they pistol got ripped
before you got any chips
you got permission from the boss
on a mission for the charts outsmart my competition
composition so sharp so dark so vivid
26s on the old school
pro tools session
got the old school hos
actin brand new sweatin
brand new tennis chain fancy pockets on my jeans
headed for the walk dude fore they win him on the stage
two a day super pay
stupid brain from a model
triple c a hundred deep
and everybody got a bottle
got a bottle full of purp
full of work no leachin
blew 50 last weekend if you lookin for a reason
im the boss
chorus dre

keep gettin paid boss
