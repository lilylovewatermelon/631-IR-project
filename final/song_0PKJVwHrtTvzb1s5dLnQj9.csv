pillmatic
three xanees down
im pounding honey grounds
im pillmatic
the oxycontin got my stomach rotting
pillmatic
i swear to god im not an addict
but im still at it dag nabbit im pillmatic

verse 1
thinking back on when it all started
i found pink hearts in mommys little pocket book
and took em
popping when she wasnt looking
i guess it runs in the family
im liable to eat any pill you randomly hand me
save the greenery
im looking for them labels reading
may cause drowsiness be careful when operating machinery
beautiful pharmaceuticals
residue in my cuticles
sniffing them when its suitable
wishing they made em chewable

verse 2
catch me in the source with five pills next to my name
like fuck five mics i want five vic fame
if killing pain is the name of the game
then im your number one draft pick
dash quick to the closest medicine cabinet
kill the whole bottle
never played the role model position
im just living
so take 2 of these and call me in the morning
ima take 4 and finish this 40 cuz lifes boring
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likehook

verse 3
keep the hydro unless its codone behind it
never have to roam far from home to find it
writing fake scripts like my doctor signed it
till i spelled his last name wrong
this aint a song for the kids like the last album
put em to bed go ahead and turn the valium up
a couple meds to ease the pain of the papercuts
the doctor says slow down maybe later buts
40 milligrams a 40 and im faded
this world is crazy so i stay medicated
percaset adavan and colonapen
when my social lights are out
they turn them on again
i need em till im bored again
oxycontin on juice on gin
equals projectile wild style burner on a porcelain
