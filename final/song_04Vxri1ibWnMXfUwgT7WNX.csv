once upon a year gone by
she saw herself give in
every time she closed her eyes
she saw what could have been
well nothing hurts and nothing bleeds
when covers tucked in tight
funny when the bottom drops
how she forgets to fight
to fight

hook
and its one more day in paradise
one more day in paradise

verse 2
as darkness quickly steals the light
that shined within her eyes
she slowly swallows all her fear
and soothes her mind with lies
well all she wants and all she needs
are reasons to survive
a day in which the sun will take her artificial light
her light

hook
and its one more day in paradise
one more day in paradise
its one more day in paradise
one last chance to feel alright
alright

dont pretend to hold it in just let it out
dont pretend to hold it in just push it out
dont you try to hold it in just let it out
dont you try to hold it in hold it in

hook
one more day in paradise
one more day in paradise
its one more day in paradise
one last chance to feel alright

outro
once upon a year gone by
she saw herself give in
every time she closed her eyes
she saw what could have beenembed"
