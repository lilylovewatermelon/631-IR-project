on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain

chorus
so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

verse 2
to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
its shame and reproach gladly bear
then hell call me some day to my home far away
where his glory forever ill share

chorus
and ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
and i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown

outro
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crownsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
