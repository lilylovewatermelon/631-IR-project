babys born on a bathroom floor
her mother prays that itll never cry
but nothings wrong youve got your prom dress on
when they ask youll say it isnt mine
you know theyre gonna know you lied

why the hell dont you throw yourself away
you know theyre gonna burn it down

you notice how god aint even helping you out
wash my hands of this
you notice how god aint even helping you
why the hell dont you throw yourself away
you know theyre gonna burn it down

verse 2
so keep the way youre feeling anonymous
and hide it all until the day you die
your secrets safe at least you thought it was
you can only keep it for a little while
and now youre terrified

damn you for thinking we would never know
and damn you for thinking we would never mind
