chorus
wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
i dont need no new people they gon tear me apart
you cant shine with me now you left me stuck in the dark
strictly business nowadays i got no time for your heart
wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
i dont need no new people they gon tear me apart
you cant shine with me now you left me stuck in the dark
strictly business nowadays i got no time for your heart

verse 1
runnin bands up with my bros we be gettin the dough
i aint worried bout these hoes keep my head on my goals
we was ridin down the street makin plays at the post
i cant even sit and count all the grams that i sold
young nigga made a way now they hate that we win
try to stop me i aint cocky you aint boxin me in
i got bitches say they love me and they still got a man
i stay focused never fold this shit a part of my plan

chorus
i wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
i dont need no new people they gon tear me apart
you cant shine with me now you left me stuck in the dark
strictly business nowadays i got no time for your heart
wanna make it with the people that was there from the start
i dont need no new people they gon tear me apart
you cant shine with me now you left me stuck in the dark
strictly business nowadays i got no time for your heart
