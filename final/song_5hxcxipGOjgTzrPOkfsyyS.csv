universe surrounds
when youre ready
it waits for us to
to leave this earth
come on theyre calling your name
out
i dont know
i could stay or leave
either way
cause the comet can take us
all the way through

chorus
goodbye
safe heaven
new new
ill be waving
goodbye
safe heaven
new new
ill be waving goodbye

verse 2
return to see
everything looks the same
i dont know
if the change made was grave
cause the craving remains the same
