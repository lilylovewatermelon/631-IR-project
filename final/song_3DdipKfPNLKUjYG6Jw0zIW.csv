ordinary no
really dont think so
not a love this true
common destiny
we were meant to be
me and you
like a perfect scene
from a movie screen
were a dream come true
suited perfectly
for eternity
me and you

chorus
every day well i need you even more
and the nighttime too
theres no way i could ever let you go
even if i wanted to

verse 2
every day i live
try my best to give
all i have to you
thank the stars above
that we share this love
me and you

every day well i need you even more
and the nighttime too
theres no way i could ever let you go
even if i wanted to

verse 3
ordinary no
really dont think so
just a precious few
ever make it last
get as lucky as
me and you
