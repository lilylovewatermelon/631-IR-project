told you not to worry
but maybe thats a lie
honey whats your hurry
wont you stay inside
remember not to get too close to stars
theyre never gonna give you love like ours

chorus
where did you go
i should know but its cold
and i dont wanna be lonely
so show me the way home
i cant lose another life

refrain
hurry im worried

verse 2
the worlds a little blurry
or maybe its my eyes
the friends ive had to bury
they keep me up at night
said i couldnt love someone
cause i might break
if youre gonna die not by mistake
you might also likechorus
so where did you go
i should know but its cold
and i dont wanna be lonely
so tell me youll come home
even if its just a lie

bridge
i tried not to upset you
let you rescue me the day i met you
i just wanted to protect you
but now ill never get to

refrain
hurry im worried

outro
where did you go
i should know but its cold
and i dont wanna be lonely
was hoping youd come home
i dont care if its a lie149embed"
