oh im a mess right now inside out
searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
i cant work it out how
going through the motions going through us

prechorus
and oh ive known it for the longest time
and all of my hopes all of my words
are all over written on the signs
when youre on my road walkin me home
home home home home

chorus
see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love no
easy baby maybe im a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
and put your faith in my stomach

verse 2
i messed up this time late last night
drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
i cant shake this feeling now
were going through the motions hopin youd stop

and oh ive only caused you pain you know
but all of my words will always be low
of all all the love we spoke
when youre on my road walkin me home
home home home home

chorus
see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love no
easy baby maybe im a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
and put your faith in my stomach
