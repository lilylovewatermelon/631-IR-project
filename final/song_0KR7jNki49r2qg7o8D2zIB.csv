i never shouldve waited so long to say
what ive always known since the very first day
thought that you would stay forever with me
but the time has come to leave

chorus
before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you til the final goodbye
mmm

verse 2
hold on me close close to my lips
listen intently as i tell you this
outside the world wages its wars
ill rest in peace as long as you know

chorus
before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you til the final goodbye

bridge
promise you our love
will carry on
until you turn eternal
we belong

before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
ill tell you a secret ive held all my life
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you til the final goodbye
his respectful lips for the last time
and spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
its you that i live for and for you i die
so ill lay here with you
til the final goodbye
