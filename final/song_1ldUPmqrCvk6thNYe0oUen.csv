why cant you love me like i need you to
its such a simple task at hand
well you cant cure a broken man
or mend his gun hot hands
and i am still the same kid you fell for when we were young
how come every song i sing you say has already been sung
and i feel like a nuisance in my own damn mind
when i speak you say its too much when i scream you say ive lost my mind

chorus
so dont call in the mornin cause ill already be gone
oklahoma in the summertimes where my country ass belongs
love is patient love is kind should not make you lose your mind
thеres got to be more to this than bеin pissed off all the time
all the time

verse 2
why cant i love you like you need me to
it seems we just oppose
ill just head out on the town for deja vu until they close

chorus
so dont call in the mornin cause ill already be gone
oklahoma in the summertimes where my country ass belongs
love is patient love is kind should not make you lose your mind
theres got to be more to this than bein pissed off all the time
all the time
