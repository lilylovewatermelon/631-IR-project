drawing hearts on the foggy glass
new love chase away my past
nothing but the open road
saddle up here we go
one two three

verse 2
first winter here in your arms
flames rising as we fall like stars
making angels in the snow
warm fuzzies frozen toes
is this a dream

prechorus
dont wake me up
if this is love
please let me be

chorus
swept completely off my feet
this snow globe scene is turning me
this christmas eve
i became we
dont wake me please
from this winter dream

build a fire to escape the cold
bing crosby on the stereo
tracing letters on my skin
slowly starts sinking in
you love me

prechorus
oh dont wake me up
if this is love
please let me be oh

chorus
swept completely off my feet
this snow globe scene is turning me
this christmas eve
i became we
dont wake me please
from this winter dream

and dreams
while im wide awake
the tree the lights
staying up late
its true
im in love with you
chorus
swept completely off my feet
this snow globe scene is turning me
this christmas eve
i became we
dont wake me please
from this winter dream1embed"
