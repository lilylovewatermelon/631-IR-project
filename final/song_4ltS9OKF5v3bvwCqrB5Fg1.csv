uh
what they say what they say what they say
what they say what they say what they say

verse 1 nelly furtado
you speak out all you feel is defiance
all you need is some selfreliance
cause this world is gonna always try us
and all you wanted was to run for cover
well heres looking to yourself and no other
were all searching for that special something
and we keep on running

prechorus nelly furtado
we all have the choice to take the lead or follow
i want to feel the light shine on me

chorus nelly furtado
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay youll soon get strong enough
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
youre going to break so please dont do it

you wanna spread your wings but youre not sure
dont wanna leave your comforts wanna find a cure
were afraid of who we see in the mirror
we wanna let go but it feels too pure
who wants to be alone in this world
you look around and all you see is hurt
but the light it always finds us
if we move with a little trust

prechorus nelly furtado
we all have the choice to take the lead or follow
i want to feel the light shine on me

chorus nelly furtado
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay youll soon get strong enough
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
youre going to break so please dont do it

verse 3 attitude
a diamond dont define what shine is
i dont need a rolex to know what the time is
you got yours let me find what mines is
im a survivor look how strong my mind is
i stand on my own its all me
regardless of whatever they call me
im a leader not a follower
and id rather be paid than popular
grind homie get your dollars up
were in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
bridge nelly furtado
its the end of the world and we know it all
its the end of the world
and we know it

chorus nelly furtado
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay youll soon get strong enough
youre so afraid of what people might say
but thats okay cause youre only human
youre so afraid of what people might say
youre going to break so please dont do it
