verse 1
bend her over then i murk her
call gunna if you want you a birkin
oh baby you be lyin in your verses
i be hearin say you buyin em purses
i cant even lie you aint my type
you aint even all that fine in person
i can guarantee you if you my kind
she got every bag you can imagine
big house i can really be braggin
hundred thousand in my mouth like whats happenin
not the big cheap teeth thats embarrasin
he aint me you can keep the comparisons
my bitch probably one of the baddest
good girl turned her into a savage
dispatch got a problem in traffic
we came through in matching gwagens
lowkey ive been keeping it classy
could be really out here doin em nasty
niggas couldnt even see me in last year
just started and them niggas in last gear
i aint even try to and i passed em
giving looks i contribute to fashion
drop a song i be giving them captions

we play with our money and not with our nose
i used to go to the west to get loads
i just came back from the west with a trophy
