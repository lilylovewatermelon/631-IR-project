sometimes im a selfish fake
youre always a true friend
and i dont deserve you
cause im not there for you
please forgive me again

chorus
i wanna be there for you
someone you can come to
runs deeper than my bones
i wanna be there for you
i wanna be there for you

verse 2
swirling shades of blue
slow dancing in your eyes
the sun kisses the earth
and i hush my urge to cry cry

chorus
i wanna be there for you
someone you can come to
runs deeper than my bones
i wanna be there for you
i wanna be there for you
you might also likebridge
cause i hear the whispered words
in your masterpiece beautiful
you speak the unspeakable phrase
i love you too

outro
i wanna be there for you
someone you can come to
i wanna be there for you
and be
someone you can come to
the love
it runs deeper than my bones
the love
i wanna be there for youembed"
