verse 1
behind this smile im fightin these tears
cause a bitch be sad as fuck yeah
ever since my mama died 2019
i dont really know who i can trust
i was lookin for anything anybody
lookin for somethin to feel like somethin
i was hangin with bitches i thought really loved me
whole time they was jealous and judgin ooh
they be askin why me and not them shit
and i be askin the same same
if your mama and daddy still walkin this earth
then you probably aint feelin my pain my pain
i dont know why they want me to fail yeah
i dont know why they hate me so much why
i keep rackin up all of thеse wins and awards
and feel like i aint doin enough likе i aint doin enough
