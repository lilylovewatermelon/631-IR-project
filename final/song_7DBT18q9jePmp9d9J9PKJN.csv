forgive me now cause i
have been unfaithful
dont ask me why cause i dont know
so many times ive tried
but was unable
this heart belongs to you alone

chorus
now im in our secret place
alone in your embrace
where all my wrongs have been erased
you have forgiven
all the promises and lies
all the times i compromised
all the times you were denied
you have forgiven

verse 2
forgive me im ashamed
ive loved another
i cant explain cause i dont know
no one can take your place
and there is no other
forever yours and yours alone
