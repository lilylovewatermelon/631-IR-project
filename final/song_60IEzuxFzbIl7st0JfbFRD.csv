grown up she just turned 16
stuck in the moment dead at the scene
and its on tonight
this is the life that you wanted right
so turn off all the lights dressed up just like a movie star
at all the parties theyll know who you are
wouldnt it be great to be fashionably late
so why dont you wait till youre sedated

prechorus
dont it feel like somethings not right in his kiss tonight

chorus
yeah what im saying is do you do you want to lose it all
cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
you cant wait to fall in love
all im saying is do you do you wanna learn to fly
then you should pack it up and say goodbye
cause when the push comes to the shove
hes just a dance hall drug

verse 2
step in and you can lock the door
the candles are lit and the clothes on the floor
you could take a chance on finding romance
now youre holding hands
but hes got other plans
ticktock the clock is turning red
the room wont stop spinning and thoughts in your head
and its too late
you feel like youre making a big mistake
you shouldve waited
