you’re such a flirt i know you hurt
and so do i i empathize
i see you out you never cared
a conversation that we never shared
but it’s so strange it’s something new
amazing feelings that i have for you
i close my eyes when i’m alone
wonder what it’d be like to make you moan

prechorus
i wanna give you something better
than anything you’ve ever had
a stronger and a faster lover
the world it disappears so fast

chorus
sweet kiwi
your juices dripping down my chin
so please let me
don’t stop it before it begins

verse 2
so give it up and don’t pretend
and spread your arms and legs across the bed
and when you shake you won’t regret
the things i whisper in your ear
what i said

i wanna give you something better
you wanna give me something better
than anything you’ve ever had
than anything i’ve ever had
a stronger and a faster lover
a stronger and a faster lover
the world it disappears so fast
it disappears so fast

chorus
sweet kiwi
your juices dripping down my chin
so please let me
don’t stop it before it begins

verse 3
i can’t wait to take you home
fingers through your hair
kisses on your back
scratch me with your nails
save me from myself
show me how to care
get everything out
dripping everywhere
lipstick smeared all over your face
how much longer must we wait
don’t think that i can wait
chorus
sweet kiwi
your juices dripping down my chin
so please let me
don’t stop it before it begins hey yeah

chorus
sweet kiwi want to give you something better than this
your juices dripping down my chin hey yeah
so please let me want to give you something better than this
don’t stop it before it begins

outro
don’t stop it before it begins
don’t stop it before it begins
don’t stop it before it begins
don’t stop it before it beginsembed"
