intro sample  joey bada
go brooklyn
said what its like
joey bad and chuck strangers
leave niggas endangered
its the real yo whats the word word
pass the herbs—check

verse 1 joey bada
my man dirty had the buddha just to put me in my right mind
i rhyme stoned drop jewels and bright lines
sight dimes wit slight closed eyes im slight sober
ma you aint that girl at giving throat so bye
f it im bipolar took shorty to the backroom
play charades she actin like a vacuum
showed her to the door before the afternoon
she fell hard on the floor so you know that shell be back soon
fake mcs get their reps ruined
young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
clickclackboom resurrecting boombap from the tombs
raps dope like crack in cocoons
back in this mood back on the move
its the motherfucking real nigga chill act cool
pay respect to the cat drew
and im way too blessed to be throwing shots at you

verse 2 chuck strangers
im tryna find my own lane in this freeway of life
just remember home boy there aint no free way to life
my nigga its gon cost you try not to lose your soul
to the rims hoes and gold
cause once the devil grab hold that nigga aint letting go
and im far from religious i just know right and wrong
i know how to write these songs i know how to light these bongs
i know how to rip thongs and im pretty good at beer pong
nigga im so crazy nigga im loco
gassed up like sunoco press the pedal through the floor
bitch we out the door vroom vroom skrrt
bitch love dont live here no more
cause her weave look faker than her louie bag
weak chick i tried to bag had the nerve to turn me down
heard this song and turned around now she want me to unzip her pants
but im gone bitch missed her chance

verse 3  joey bada
i got sick of class started making classics
now all i really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
im sure to blow like bust acid
puff assist like maravich a true maverick
and i average above average on an average day
doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
and his teacher still pass him
though they adolescents be addin rappin sessions over addin lessons
like fuck trigonometry i’m trying to multiply monopolies
subtract some homies then divide the cheese
divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the e
shit on you hypotheses
hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
you can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
part the cheese head out the spot and leave
a pile of gs for apology

outro rokamouth
