i done gave the jails too many years
years that i wont get back
and i swear i done shed too many tears
for niggas that i wont get back
yeah i got niggas in the graveyard
niggas in the state yards
i swear not a day goes by
that i dont think about the times
i wish that i could rewind
cause i done gave the jails too many years
years that i wont get back
and i swear i done shed too many tears
for niggas that i wont get back
yeah i got niggas in the graveyard
niggas in the state yards
i swear not a day goes by
that i dont think about the times
i wish that i could rewind

verse 1 kodak black
i told my mama we gon be fine
so im up all night way after sleep time
im just thinkin bout lil kuda gave my dog a dime
he put a buckshot in a nigga behind
no daddy so i grew up to the street life
but my son ima keep him in the beehive
scheming on a heist i need to change my life
been geekin all night im going senile
with two niggas toting three fourfives
i seen a nigga play gangster then he broke down
lost a lot lost his mind in the courthouse
im on xxl im in new york now

verse 2 kodak black
i keep thinkin bout my niggas
i think i need a jigga
why we keep on falling victim
lost up in the system
miss my brothers love my sister
damn i miss my lil one
i know sometimes i be trippin
but i just miss my niggas
i got codeine in my liver
i gave the judge a piece of me
im too street for the industry
but i think thats where i need to be
cause verbally mentally and physically i keep that heat
me and my brother fit in
we smokin one with pnb
niggas say they fuck with me
but lowkey they be easin me
you bitches dont mean shit to me
people tryna sentence me
how a youngin posted on the street gon call it sesame
1k til the death of me dont put your life in jeopardy
chorus pnb rock
i done gave the jails too many years
years that i wont get back
and i swear i done shed too many tears
for niggas that i wont get back
yeah i got niggas in the graveyard
niggas in the state yards
i swear not a day goes by
that i dont think about the times
