verse 1
bitch im from chiraq when it get hot they bring them tecs out
better watch your back or youll be on that corner stretched out
quick to change a nigga standin tall with his chest out
and they like headshots it wont make sense to bring a vest out
shit be devastatin you find out your homie checked out
parents lose control dont know her daughter havin sex now
niggas hatin im gettin paper thats what they pressed bout
went down the wrong path switched it up and chose the best route
i aint used to have it all i used to feel left out
member i was broke aint have a dollar i was stressed out
now im tryna get richer like blast lets bring the jets out
bitch i need like ten bathrooms up in my next house

verse 2
got a baby 40 with a new extended clip inside
for any problem bitch its twentytwo up in this clip of mine
my peoples lookin up to me so no i cant be victimized
i got so much pentup anger i just wish a nigga tried
you gon die before you blink yeah thats gon be a quick demise
the world be so fucked up that shitll have you sick and tired
you cant even post a picture without being criticized
was broke but now im living everything i used to visualize
thinking bout them stories still dont make sense how my niggas died
that shit still haunt me to this day them ls hurt a nigga pride
how both of the twins leave why one of them didnt survive
still want that point for gucci look his killer in his eyes
my bad i never scored for yall but at least a nigga tried
walking through the opp shit with my wesson i couldnt get a ride
i gotta run through a check for every tear a nigga cried
gon make my mark up in this shit make sure my spot solidified
