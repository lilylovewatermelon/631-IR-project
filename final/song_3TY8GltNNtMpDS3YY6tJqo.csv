verse 1
heat shimmers
hips quiver
open smother
lipped lover

chorus
dead in the middle of the codoublemon
little did i know then that the mandela boys
soon become mandela men
razor blades on a melted toothbrush
assassin de la police

verse 2
heat shimmers
silky glistener
open smother
lipped lover

chorus
dead in the middle of the codoublemon
little did i know then that the mandela boys
soon become mandela men
silent knife unholy knife
iâ€™ve fallen for the black outside my window
on the codoublemon
