geek fag stupid loser find a rope to hang
im not bipolar see im just known by those couple names
i wanna tell my pops but shit hell probably say the same
fuck
hated by everyone thats the way it seems
i dont know whats shorter his damn temper or my selfesteem
i sit in my room and i listen to tunes im amused alone
cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
depressions on the stalk again
my best friends an inhaler because it will not let me cough
whenever i am losing oxygen bully hand around my neck
cause he felt disrespected when i decided to talk again
i brought that on myself see i should know my place
but not at lunchtime see i know better than to show my face
around them but the day i do itll be everywhere
when i share these feelings finally they gon fucking care
hook
grab a couple friends start a couple riots
crash a couple planes planes planes
then gather all the bullies crush them motherfuckers
odd future hooligans causing up a ruckus
its us nigga
i said its us nigga

hook
grab a couple friends start a couple riots
crash a couple planes planes planes

we are the sams and were dead—its just four of us
we come in peace we mean no harm and were inglorious
we took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
i guess we lost ours

verse 3
music had nothing to do with my final decision
i just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
but nobody would listen but stuffed animals that i had
since i was a kid but im growing up so theyre missing
i didnt mean to hurt anybody im sorry
i wouldnt hurt a fly or consider joining the army
im hardly ever angry roger rabbit framed me
mama im the same fucking kid that you made see
i dont wanna go to jail i just wanna go home
and i want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
and i i hear helicopters make em dip
im fucking reloaded i told you all that i aint taking shit
you better back up before this mac start to lift up
ill pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
the difference between us and our class is tan khakis
i got ninetynine problems and all of thems being happy37embed"
