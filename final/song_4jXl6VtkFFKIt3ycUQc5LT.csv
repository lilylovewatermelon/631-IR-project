well this is what it look like right before you fall
stumblin around youve been guessin your direction
next step you cant see at all
and i dont have a name i dont have a name no
who am i to blame who am i to blame though
and i cannot be changed i cannot be changed no
trust me ive tried
i just end up right at the start of the line
drawin circles
mmm

verse 2
well i drink my whiskey and you sip your wine
were doing well sittin watchin the world fallin down its decline
and i can keep you safe i can keep you safe mmm
do not be afraid do not be afraid
youre feelin sorry im feelin fine
dont you put any more stress on yourself its one day at a time
its gettin pretty late gettin pretty late
damn and i find
it goes around like the hands that keep countin the time
