verse 1 xavier wulf
if you wanna talk to f√ºhrer say excuse me
bitch dont ask me shit cause i aint no friend of yee
i dont gotta talk to nobody
but if they talking shit about me stop the car please
bitch where the fuck you at
name out your cross streets
i say who are you pick out your coffin
these niggas talk so much bitch i mean often
every so often you catch me cleaning blood off my claw fist
me and hollowsquad is the bosses
we gon take your life insead of losses
and bitch i dont do rap i monologue shit
cause you bitches need to know im not a target
i dont get bothered im the one doing bothering
i turn his bulletproof vest into a cardigan
when i hit a fool i feel my heart again
yall too retarded man all these rappers still on that faking shit
i smoke my biggest blunt while i break a bitch
i swing so quick he couldnt finish talking shit
bitch i dont give no fuck and i be loving it
im spending stupid stacks
what the fuck is cash i buy more weed with that
she looked at me and told me boy im needing that
i looked her right in her face and told her kill yourself
bitch get up out my way boy i dont need no help
you niggas see me now
see hollowsquad the fleet and put your head down
