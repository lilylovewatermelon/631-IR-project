one two three four

verse 1
i am going away for a while
but ill be back dont try and follow me
cause ill return as soon as possible
see im trying to find my place
but it might not be here where i feel safe
we all learn to make mistakes

prechorus
and run from them from them
with no direction
well run from them from them
with no conviction

chorus
cause im just one of those ghosts
traveling endlessly
dont need no roads
in fact they follow me
and we just go in circles

verse 2
now im told that this is life
and pain is just a simple compromise
so we can get what we want out of it
would someone care to classify
our broken hearts and twisted minds
so i can find someone to rely on

and run to them to them
full speed ahead
oh you are not useless
we are just

chorus
misguided ghosts
traveling endlessly
the ones we trusted the most
pushed us far away
and theres no one road
we should not be the same
but im just a ghost
and still they echo me
they echo me in circles22embed"
