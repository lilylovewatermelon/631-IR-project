miss mysterious who are you
whos the girl behind those eyes
just a stranger in disguise
miss mysterious who could you be
was the ghost of what we had
did you erase it from your past
so i pointed in every direction oh well
looking for answers ill never know

chorus
i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
or let me know when your heart went numb
i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
the saying goes if you love someone let them go

verse 2
miss mysterious may i ask
is your sunshine like my rain
is your pleasure like my pain
so delirious casting your stones
with a blindfold to my face
hoping that youll lose your aim
well it looked so bright with the lights out oh well
i guess our stars forgot how to glow

i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
or let me know when your heart went numb
i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
the saying goes if you love someone let them go

verse 3
now baby you you broke my heart
now how do i get closure when youre only ever closed off
tell me who could take your place
when these memories are telling me
that we were not a waste
now dont even try to tell me that i should just relax
and when our train derailed off the tracks
i tried to reach outstretch my hand but you turned around instead
so many nights living inside just to connect with you
now im trying hard to win this but weve lost all we can lose

chorus
i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
or let me know when your heart went numb
i said go run for your life
and tell me im right
the saying goes if you love someone let them go
outro
i stole the moon
i drove through that bleak december
baby baby just for you
you were my touch of duality
and ill haunt your every dream
i wont worry bout a thing
cause if you love someone
said if you love someone
now if you love someone yeah
let them go
let them go7embed"
