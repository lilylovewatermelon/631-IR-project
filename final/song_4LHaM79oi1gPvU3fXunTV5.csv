verse
im sippin that lean im tryna get me some sleep
re just popped another bean he gon be up for a week
i been up for a month cause my problems too deep
i just lay in my bed look at the ceiling and think
i just told my lil cousin to stay a child while you can
its a cold cold world you probably wont stand a chance
and these bitches say they love you be tugging all at your pants
they aint looking for love these bitches looking for bands
and this life so confusing some things you wouldnt understand
why this bitch tryna fuck me knowing this bitch got a man
boy these hoes be embarrassing that money i cherished it
i took it and buried it my daughters inherit it
they cant understand me so they judge me because im different
a milliondollar nigga still posted up in the trenches
your role models play they role on television
my role models sold dope died or went to prison
i gotta thank the lord for the hand that i was given
i jump on the stage and make 80k in thirty minutes
but my lifestyle aint always been bimmers bentleys and benzs
i had to walk a couple miles to get in this position
that real shit nah for real you know what im sayin
oh this that real shit ayy you gotta preach to em
oh this that real shit yeah
what i say
you might also likechorus
its gon take me a minute to try get over that pain
i was too busy running to know im winning the race
atr look like young money the way we ride with them dracs
cant believe i made it i love and hate it baby nah for real
fire and desire fire and desire yeah uh
fire and desire fire and desire uh
fire and desire fire and desire
fire and desire fire and desire mmm yeah
