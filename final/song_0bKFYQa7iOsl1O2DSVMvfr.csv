felt your touch and now i want it all now oh
waiting by the phone begging for a call now
centuries go by and still theres no sound

do do do you do do do you
when you know that i see right through through through you

and if you dont want me the way i want you
and if you dont need me the way i need you oh
i just got one thing to say to you

and all you had to do was kiss me goodnight
