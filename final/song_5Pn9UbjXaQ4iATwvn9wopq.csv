you bought a star in the sky tonight
because your life is dark and it needs some light
you named it after me but im not yours to keep
because youll never see that the stars are free

prechorus
oh we dont own our heavens now
we only own our hell
and if you dont know that by now
then you dont know me that well

chorus
all my life ive been so lonely
all in the name of being holy
and still youd like to think you know me
you keep buyin stars
and you could buy up all of the stars
but it wouldnt change who you are
youre still living life in the dark
its just who you are
its just who you are

yeah you know only how to own me

youre buying stars to shut out the light
we come alone and alone we die
and no matter how hard you try
ill always belong in the sky
