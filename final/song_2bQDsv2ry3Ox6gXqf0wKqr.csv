verse 1 gangsta boo
if you bitches aint scared put a bitch right to the floor
tell her she belong below under shoes where roaches go
ho im ready if you ready tell me what you wanna do
to the lovely gangsta boo buck as fuck i thought you knew
put my sign up in ya face leave ya state without a trace
you aint buck cause bitch i saw ya stankin ass yesterday
tuck ya chain hold yo weave cause im comin in the crowd boy
with niggas and im out slammin bitches to the ground

verse 2 lord infamous
i see ya from the stage ya angry face is fighting in the corner
full of marijuana niggas in the middle in a trauma
while they throwin bos they snatchin hoes they stomp ya in a coma
any thick lil fine bitch come on through a nigga all up on her
some trick done got mad and ran to the wagon and grabbed a 12 gauge pump
probably full of that numby numb that coke and rum and gettin dumb
cars are barrelin through the nigga shootin runnin to the rover
niggas catchin the heat from slugs negroes gettin trampled over
clubs is a motherfucker

verse 4 dj paul

packing automatics for that static that you stressin punk

raise your hands up in the air
cause bitch this aint no rosewood

slipped up chopped up fucked lights out

verse 6 crunchy black

bang what i bang nigga aint no thing
