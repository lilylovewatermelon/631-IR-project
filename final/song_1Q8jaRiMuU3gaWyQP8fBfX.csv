fall is here hear the yell
back to school ring the bell
brand new shoes walking blues
climb the fence books and pens
i can tell that we are going to be friends
yes i can tell that we are going to be friends

walk with me suzy lee
through the park and by the tree
we can rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs weve found
safely walk to school without a sound
we safely walk to school without a sound

well here we are no one else
we walk to school all by ourselves
theres dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now its time to learn
we clean up and now its time to learn

numbers letters learn to spell
nouns and books and show and tell
play time we will throw the ball
then back to school class the hall
the teacher marks our height against the wall
the teacher marks our height against the wall
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeand we dont notice any time pass
because we dont notice anything
we sit side by side in every class
the teacher thinks that i sound funny
but she likes it when you sing

tonight ill dream while in my bed
while silly thoughts run through my head
of the bugs and alphabet
and when i wake tomorrow ill bet
you and i will walk together again

outro
cause i can tell that we are going to be friends
yes i can tell that we are going to be friendsembed"
