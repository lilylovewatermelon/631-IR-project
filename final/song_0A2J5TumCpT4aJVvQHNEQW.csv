tell me that youll turn down the man
who asks for your hand
cause youre waitin for me
and i know youre gonna be away a while
but ive got no plans at all to leave

prechorus
and would you take away my hopes and dreams
and just stay with me ooh

chorus
all my senses come to life
while im stumblin home as drunk as i
have ever been and ill never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me youll always be a friend
cause you are the only one

verse 2
take my hand and my
heart and soul i will
only have these eyes for you
and you know everything changes
but well be strangers if we see this through

you could stay within these walls and bleed
or just stay with me oh lord now

chorus
all my senses come to life
while im stumblin home as drunk as i

cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide

cause you are the only one

stumblin halfdrunk gettin myself lost
i am so gone so tell me the way home
i listen to sad songs singin about love
and where it goes wrong

chorus
and all my senses come to life
while im stumblin home as drunk as i
have ever been and ill never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me youll always be a friend
cause you are the only one80embed"
