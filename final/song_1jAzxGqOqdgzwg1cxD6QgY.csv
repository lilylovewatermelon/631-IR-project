i was sittin on a wooden stool
in a barbecue joint in tennessee
when this old boy walked in
and he sat right down next to me
i could tell hed been through some hard times
cause there were tear stains on his old shirt
then he said do you wanna know what you get
when you play a country song backwards

chorus
you get your house back
you get your dog back
you get your best friend jackson back
you get your truck back
you get your hair back
you get your first and second jobs back
your front porch swing goin dingalingaling
your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
you get your farm and the barn and the boat and the harley
that old black cat named charlie
it sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
but thats what you get when you play a country song backwards

verse 2
well i never heard it said quite like that
it hit me in the face cause thats where im at
i almost fell flat out on the floor
he said wait a minute thats not all theres even more haha

you get your mind back
get your nerves back
your achy breaky heart back
you get your pride back
you get your life back
you get your first real love back
your big screen tv dvd and a washin machine
you get the pond and the lawn and the rake and the mower
you go back when life was slower
it sounds a little crazy a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
but thats what you get when you play a country song backwards
oh play that song
woo

bridge
we sat there and talked about how it would be
if we could just rewind it all and go back in time

chorus
you get your house back
you get your dog back
you get your best friend jackson back
you get your truck back
you get your hair back
you get your first and second jobs back
your front porch swing goin dingalingaling
your bling bling bling and a diamond ring
you get your farm and the barn and the boat and the harley
that old black cat named charlie
you get your mind back
get your nerves back
your achy breaky heart back
you get your pride back
you get your life back
you get your first real love back
your big screen tv dvd and a washin machine
you get the pond and the lawn and the rake and the mower
you go back when life was slower
it sounds a little crazy a little scattered and absurd
but thats what you get when you play a country song backwardsembed"
