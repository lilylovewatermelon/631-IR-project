my little love
i see your eyes widen like an ocean
when you look at me so full of my emotions
im findin it hard to be here sincerely
i know you feel lost its my fault completely
bridge adele  angelo adkins
tell me you love me
i love you a million percent

verse 2
i dont recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
so i aint surprised you can read through all of my lies
i feel so bad to be here when im so guilty
im so far gone and youre the only one who can save mе

bridge angelo adkins  adele
oi i feel like you dont love me

when you lay on me can you hear the way my heart breaks

outro
im having a bad day im having a very anxious day
i feel very paranoid i feel very stressed
um i have a hangover which never helps but
i feel like today is the first day since i left him that i feel lonely
and i never feel lonely i love being on my own
i always preferred being on my own than being with people
and i feel like maybe ive been like overcompensating
and being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
and i feel like today im home and i wanna be at home
i just wanna watch tv and curl up in a ball and
be in my sweats and stuff like that but i just feel really lonely
i feel a bit frightened that i might feel like this a lot31embed"
