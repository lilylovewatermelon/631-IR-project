you will always be a part of me
youre a beat in the heart of me
sometimes its kinda hard to see
it goes without sayin
beautiful as you ever were
youve given everything to make it work
it goes without sayin
it goes without sayin

chorus
how could it just disappear
i dont know how we got here
broke without breakin
drunk without drinkin
it dont tell you when your time is up
i guess sometimes love
goes without sayin
goes without sayin goodbye

verse 2
you used to whisper in my ear
how good it felt to lay right here
now your voice is just as clear
when it goes without sayin
those three words were easy ones
and now they wont roll off my tongue
it goes without sayin
it goes without sayin

i guess sometimes love
goes without sayin
goes without sayin goodbye

i dont want to really hurt you
you dont really want to hurt me
it goes without sayin
