verse 1
yeah mentally been pushing away
my past got me feeling some way
ive been tryna get better
but im always up or out of the states
came home calling you babe
number changed im kinda late
fears of you with another man
but i hope youre listening i gotta say
excuse me from my absence
things bad but i aint been asking
been working like a movie
so i hope you aint been casting
you aint even sleeping
you call im in a meeting

yeah okay

your attention i aint paid it
all it takes is achings
and i hope it makes the alist
ive been acting all boring
and i aint worried about scoring
but you do got the million dollar body
now that is forbes list
youve been down since day one
you still down when the days done
girl you kill it like jason
your hand cup like facin
girl you got your game face on but take that shit off
hard work dealing with this bullshit
now its time for your day off
