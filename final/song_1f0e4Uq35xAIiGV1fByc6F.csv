just light it up im burning for you
give me your loving i need you woman

verse 1 tnava
pretty little thing from oslo
where the weathers always nice and the drinks cold
know you never wanna go back though
now all she wanna do is party up in noho
roll a little green in the backwood backwood
now she goin through a breakup in westwood westwood
all she really want is to dance huh
every woman just wanna have fun

verse 2 tnava
you got all the things i want
and you got everything i need
