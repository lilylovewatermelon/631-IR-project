if you could step into my head
tell me would you still know me
if you woke up in my bed
tell me would you hold me
or would you simply let it lie
leaving me to wonder why
i can’t get you out of this head
i call mine and i will say

chorus
ooh whoa whoa i can’t let you go
my little girl
because you’re holding up my world
so i need you
your imitation of my walk
and the perfect way you talk
it’s just a couple of the million things
that i love about you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you

verse 2
and if i jumped off the brooklyn bridge
tell me would you still follow me
and if i made you mad today
tell me would you love me tomorrow please
or would you say that you don’t care
and then leave me standing here
like the fool who is drowning in despair
and screaming
you might also likechorus
ooh whoa whoa i can’t let you go
my little girl
because you’re holding up my world
so i need you
your imitation of my walk
and the perfect way you talk
it’s just a couple of the million things
that i love about you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you

bridge
i’m on my own
i’m on my own
i’m on my own

chorus
ooh whoa whoa cant let you go
my little girl
because you’re holding up my world
so i need you
your imitation of my walk
and the perfect way you talk
it’s just a couple of the million things
that i love about you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you
so i need you
