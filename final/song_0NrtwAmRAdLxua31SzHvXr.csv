chorus
damn
here we go again
common passed on this beat i made it to a jam
now everything im not made me everything i am
damn here we go
here we go again
people talkin shit but when the shit hit the fan
everything im not made me everything i am

verse 1
ill never be pictureperfect beyoncé
be light as al b or black as chauncey
remember him from blackstreet he was black as the street was
ill never be laid back as this beat was
i never could see why peoplell reach a
fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
you see how i creeped up you see how i played a big
role in chicago like queen latifah
ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like killa cam
or rock some mink boots in the summertime like william
let me know if you feel it man
cause everything im not made me everything i am

verse 2
and im back to tear it up
haters start your engines i hear em gearin up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops

okay fair enough the streets is flarin up
cause they want gun talk or i dont wear enough

i know people wouldnt usually rap this
but i got the facts to back this

he got changed over his chains a block off ashland
i need to talk to somebody pastor
the church want tithe so i cant afford to pay
pink slip on my door cause i cant afford to stay
my fifteen seconds up but i got more to say
thats enough mr west please no more today
