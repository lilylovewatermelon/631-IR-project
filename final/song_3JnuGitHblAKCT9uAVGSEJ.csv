i dont want nobody and you dont want nobody
and lets just get it started let this be your party
i dont want nobody and you dont want nobody
lets just get it started let this be your party

verse 1 goldlink
you called me on my phone last night
and you told me send the homies home that night
and you said nobody was invited
and you really didnt make it sound exciting
then you said youre lucy lucy with a kissy face
then i said well i dont know no fuckin lucy babe
then you said well yeah you know me from your latter days
who you think was runnin with you when your homies caved
and when they ran up in your shit and made your homies lay
or when them baltimore niggas shotted at your face
or when them motherfucking niggas from the southside
lit your block up but you wasnt even outside
or remember when a nigga tried to jump you
and you called i had the strap and then they ran fool
or remember when your broke black ass was hungry
in the fridge and now you only eat the finer things
now let me tell ya

chorus april george
i dont want nobody you dont want nobody
lets just get it started let this be our party
i dont want nobody you dont want nobody
lets just get it started let this be our party

outro
in this world mother no one can love me
in this world they do not know how to love me
in this world mother no one can love me
in this world they do not know how to love me
where is there pure loving love
where is there truly loving me
where is there pure loving love
where is there truly loving me
there my soul longs to be
there my soul longs to be
in this world mother no one can love me
in this world they do not know how to love me
in this world mother no one can love me
in this world they do not know how to love me
where is there pure loving love
where is there truly loving me
there my soul longs to be
there my soul longs to be1embed"
