she is a diamond i am a stone
i come from nowhere shes been to rome
her daddys a lawyer and mines not around
she has good manners im rough all around

prechorus
but you could come from something
you could come from nothing
you could be a princess
you could be a working man but in the end

chorus
we all want something else we all want something else
we all want something we cant have
we all want something else we all want something else
we all want something strange to us

postchorus
maybe a roll in the dirt or its a seat in first class
we all want something we cant have

verse 2
she wants to go to restaurants in beverly hills and people stare
but i dont care its just what she grew up around
she drags me to parties where people ask me where i went to
college she knows damn well i barely finished school
she knows a lot about yearly salaries and trust funds and
dividends she knows that i dont really care at all
but we got together
and its working okay
