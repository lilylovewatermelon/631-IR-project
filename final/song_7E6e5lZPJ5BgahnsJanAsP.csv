verse 1 kelly rowland
its over and done but the heartache lives on inside
and who is the one youre clinging to instead of me tonight

prechorus destinys child  kelly rowland
and where are you now
now that i need you
tears on my pillow
wherever you go go
cry me a river that leads to your ocean
youll never see me fall apart

chorus destinys child  beyoncé
in the words of a broken heart its just emotions taking me over
caught up in sorrow lost in the song
but if you dont come back come home to me darlin
dont you know theres no—
nobody left in this world to hold me tight
and dont you know theres no—
nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
kiss goodnight
goodnight goodnight
goodnight
