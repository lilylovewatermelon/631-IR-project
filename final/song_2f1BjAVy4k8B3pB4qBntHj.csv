pick me up
been bleeding too long
right here right now
ill stop it somehow

prechorus
i will make it go away
cant be here no more
seems this is the only way
i will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

chorus
now i see the times they change
leaving doesnt seem so strange
i am hoping i can find
where to leave my hurt behind
all the shit i seem to take
all alone i seem to break
i have lived the best i can
does this make me not a man

verse 2
shut me off
im ready heart stops
i stand alone
cant be on my own

i will make it go away
cant be here no more
seems this is the only way
i will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

chorus
now i see the times they change
leaving doesnt seem so strange
i am hoping i can find
where to leave my hurt behind
all the shit i seem to take
all alone i seem to break
i have lived the best i can
does this make me not a man

bridge
am i going to leave this place
what is it im hiding from
is there nothing more to come
am i gonna leave this place
is it only black in space
am i going to take its place
am i going to win this race
am i gonna win this race
i guess gods up in this place
what is it that ive become
is there something more to come
more to come
chorus
now i see the times they change
leaving doesnt seem so strange
i am hoping i can find
where to leave my hurt behind
all the shit i seem to take
all alone i seem to break
i have lived the best i can
does this make me not a man
now i see the times they change
leaving doesnt seem so strange
i am hoping i can find
where to leave my hurt behind
all the shit i seem to take
all alone i seem to break
i have lived the best i can
does this make me not a man12embed"
