out of time

verse 1
doc im dying im feeling compromised feeling compromised
and so dehumanized and so dehumanized
i lost my final fight to disease i feel that this is where it ends
i need that shot to enter my vein
my brompton cocktail blend

chorus
cause i cant feel my face
i wont struggle on
in a world so cold
in a world so wrong
im not running away been fighting this so long so long
such a price that we pay weve got to be so strong
in a lie

verse 2
im tired induced euphoria induced euphoria
to help me move along help me move along
i want to meet my maker in peace i want to feel alive again
so put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

chorus
cause i cant feel my face
i wont struggle on
in a world so cold
in a world so wrong
im not running away been fighting this so long so long
such a price that we pay weve got to be so strong

and ill take my life tonight
cause i have the right to die how i want to
and leave how i arrived

bridge
i believe my sins have been forgiven
and i believe my choice will save me from this life
please dont question why
my sins have been forgotten
i believe ill find peace in afterlife
please dont question why
i left this way

chorus
cause i cant feel my face
i wont struggle on
in a world so cold
in a world so wrong
im not running away been fighting this so long so long
such a price that we pay weve got to be so strong

and ill take my life tonight
cause i have the right to die how i want to
and leave how i arrived
