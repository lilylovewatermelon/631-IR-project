its a junked out joint off a backroad
a blinkin window sign with an arrow
a gravel iot chock full o toolbox trucks
makin their happy hour way home

prechorus
when guys like me lose girls like you
thats where we run to

chorus
they got whiskey river on the jukebox
a honky tonk sawdust dance floor
a neon five oclock pro clock
and plenty damn many when you want one more
this brokeheart fool on an old bar stool
drinkin beer almost as cold as you

verse 2
bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
a picture o you on the dart board
them cinder block walls aint ever been cleaned
still aint as dirty as you done me

chorus
whiskey river on the jukebox
a honkytonk sawdust dance floor
a neon five oclock pro clock
and plenty damn many when you want one more
this brokeheart fool on an old bar stool
drinkin beer almost as cold as you
