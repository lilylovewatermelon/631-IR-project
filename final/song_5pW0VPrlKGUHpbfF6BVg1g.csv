verse
ayy first of all i wanna thank you for showing your hand
how you niggas playin it gangsta but taking the stand

i don’t fuck with no rappers cause we different listen
i was on the block with brock chasing guap til the sun came
now we swapping glock when they pop like the gun game
if its beef then we turn your street to a gun range
i was lookin monday caught his ass sunday
