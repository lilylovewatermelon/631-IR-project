v vaughn—the travelin vaudeville villain
who dont give a flyin fuck who aint not feelin him
watch what ya dealin him ace king death card
strongarm the wrong man pardon the left god
get money and earn it that everythingyoutouchturn shit
got much to learn kid write it up burn shit
light it up like the dutch when the hash melt
only time they see him when they meet him with the cash belt
ay caramba now thats my number
one dry summer as far as i remember
burntout but gainin every edgy penny
then he hit him straight to the head like reggie denny
call him back when you need some more yak horshack
doin 80 down the van wyck on horseback
your man sick but he wreck tracks puto
get back too bro exactamundo
viktor the director flip a script like rob reiner
the way a lotta dudes rhyme their name should be knob shiner
for a buck theyd likely dance the jig or do the hucklebuck
to vik its no big deal theyre just a buncha knucklefucks
you wonder how well would they hold up in a holding cell
it sorta had the strange makings of a tale told in hell
like oh well hold tall riches
if the feds is really after them they just kill all the snitches
on borrowedtime rhymes gassed by the silver screen
they act like their monkeyass can heal back like wolverine
mellow out what yall bellow out ya yellow mouth
what happened to the typa spit that used to help a fellow out
no doubt leave a rapper in a body cast
and wonder what he was doing while we was in a karate class
snotty ass its really like he was a whitebelt
right before he nightnight ask him how the light felt
i wouldnt take their tape if they gave it free
maybe its me baby its v
throw down the key yall know how shit be
in the naked city rappers is so giddy
thats no ditty vaughn so witty
the way he take no prisoners and show no pity
its how son became a big man from a black boy
to name names a really big fan of dan aykroyd
he feel they need to give him his own dance
this his only chance to shoot the gift like a lone glance
or like a beef scene that leave the ooey smokin
or between hokuto shinken and nanto suichō kenyou might also like8embed"
