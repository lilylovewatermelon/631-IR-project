heart for brains you should have known
take a seat with the weak
but stand up for me stand up for me
mercilessly slaughtering
when the sick feed the strong
the pack marches on
the pack marches on

chorus
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love

verse 2
shit for brains youre living proof
that it pays to be hard on those around you
but the wolves who guard their wounds
hide their limps and their health are all eaten too
theyre all eaten too

chorus
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our love
lifes hard when youre soft
youve got our loveyou might also like15embed"
