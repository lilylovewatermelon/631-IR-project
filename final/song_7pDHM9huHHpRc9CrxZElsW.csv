you my friend
youre a lot like them
but i caught your lie
and you know i did
now im lost in you
like i always do
and ill die to win
cause im born to lose

chorus
firefly
could you shine your light
now i love your ways
cause theyre just like mine
now im justified
as i fall in line
and its hard to try
when youre open wide

verse 2
take my hand
well be off and then
well come back again
to a different land
now i like this way
you can go away
if you guess the name
you cannot replace

firefly
could you shine your light
now i love your ways
cause theyre just like mine
now im justified
as i fall in line
and its hard to try
when youre open wide

bridge
bring me your enemies
lay them before me
and walk away
walk away
walk away

chorus
firefly
could you shine your light
now i love your ways
cause theyre just like mine
now im justified
as i fall in line
and its hard to try
when youre open wide
fuck you firefly
have you lost your light
now i hate your ways
cause theyre just like mine
so you lost my friend
such a sorry end
and i dont know why
so i choke and smile
