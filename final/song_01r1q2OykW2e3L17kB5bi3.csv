i just want to enjoy my life
and show this world how to care
and nothing brings more joy to my life
than knowing my girl will be there

prechorus
are you happy girl
knowing that you ran and broke my heart in a piece or two
knowing that i would have walked across the ocean for you
saying youre young and confused
well thats a lame excuse
thats why the only one to blame is you

chorus
for last night
cant believe what i was hearing
telling me to have a nice life
so tonight
i dont think ill spare your feelings
youre on your own
ima do for me whats right

verse 2
in your eyes i see a second chance
maybe i should take another glance
but for now ill wash my hands
cause i love ya baby love ya baby
pharrell say dont do it the same
but i say aint playing my games
but for you my soul still remains
cause i love ya baby love ya baby
