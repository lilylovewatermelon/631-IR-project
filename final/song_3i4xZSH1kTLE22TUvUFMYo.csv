i think we have an emergency
i think we have an emergency
if you thought id leave then you were wrong
cause i wont stop holding on
so are you listening
so are you watchin me
if you thought id leave then you were wrong
cause i wont stop holding on
this is an emergency
so are you listening
and i cant pretend
that i dont see this

prechorus
but its really not your fault
that no one cares to talk about it
to talk about it

chorus
cause ive seen love die
way too many times
when it deserved to be alive
when it deserved to be alive
and ive seen you cry
way too many times
when you deserved to be alive
alive

so you give up every chance you get
just to feel new again
i think we have an emergency
i think we have an emergency
and you do your best to show me love
but you dont know what love is
so are you listening
so are you watchin me
well i cant pretend
that i dont see this

prechorus
but its really not your fault
that no one cares to talk about it
to talk about it

chorus
cause ive seen love die
way too many times
when it deserved to be alive
when it deserved to be alive
and ive seen you cry
way too many times
when you deserved to be alive
alive
bridge
these scars they will not
fade away

breakdown
no one cares to talk about it
to talk about it

chorus
cause ive seen love die
way too many times
when it deserved to be alive
when it deserved to be alive
and ive seen you cry
way too many times
when you deserved to be alive
