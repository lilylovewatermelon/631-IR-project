verse 1
she wore blue velvet
bluer than velvet was the night
softer than satin was the light
from the stars

verse 2
she wore blue velvet
bluer than velvet were her eyes
warmer than may her tender sighs
love was ours

feeling the rapture grow
like a flame burning brightly
but when she left gone was the glow of

verse 3

but in my heart therell always be
precious and warm a memory
through the years
