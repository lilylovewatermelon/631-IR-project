therell be another 7am im sorry
wishing i could take back what i said
as sure as right now ive got a heartbeat
i know ill let you down again
i want to be the man you need

chorus
i aint made it up the mountain but im climbing
i still got some miles to go but hell im driving
aint conquered all my demons but im fighting
i might never love you right but ill die trying

verse 2
and id love to say i wont get jealous
and that the past is back in my rearview
but i know me too well to try to lie to you or myself
so if you want to know the truth

chorus
i aint made it up the mountain but im climbing
i still got some miles to go but hell im driving
aint conquered all my dеmons but im fighting
i might never love you right but ill diе trying

bridge
ill be trying to deserve your heart of gold
till i get there or the good lord calls me home

i aint made it up the mountain but im climbing
still got some miles to go but hell im driving
aint conquered all my demons but im fighting
i might never love you right but ill die tryingembed"
