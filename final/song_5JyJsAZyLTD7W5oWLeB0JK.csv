out in the heartland
i looked in your eyes
and i asked are you ready
ready for this life

verse 2
did you see it coming
it happened so fast
the timing was perfect
water on glass

chorus
like tracing figure eights
on ice in skates oh well
and if this ice should break
it would be my mistake

verse 3
between the cities
between the thrills
theres something inside you
that doesnt sleep well

verse 4
it wont last forever
or maybe it will
the white clothes they gave you
you wear them so well
you might also likeverse 5
someone once told me
in love that you must
place all youre given
in infinite trust

chorus
yet im tracing figure eights
on ice in skates so well
and if this ice should break
it would be my mistake19embed"
