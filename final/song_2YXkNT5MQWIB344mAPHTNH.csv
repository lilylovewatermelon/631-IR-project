verse 1 jack johnson
everyone laughed at her joke
as if theyd never even heard it before
and maybe they were truly amused
but every word that she spoke was a bore
and maybe its because they had seen
the previews on the tv screen
well this part is good and thats well understood
so you should laugh if you know what i mean

chorus jack johnson
but its all relative
even if you dont understand
well its all understood
especially when you dont understand
then its all just because
even if we dont understand
then lets all just believe

verse 2 jack johnson
everyone knows what went down
because the news was spread all over town
and fact is only what you believe
and fact and fiction work as a team
its almost always fiction in the end
that content begins to bend
when context is never the same
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus jack johnson
and its all relative
even if we dont understand
and its all understood
especially when we dont understand
then its all just because
even if we dont understand
then lets all just believe

verse 3 jack johnson
i was reading a book
or maybe it was a magazine
suggestions on where to place faith
suggestions on what to believe
but i read somewhere that youve got to beware
you cant believe anything you read
but the good book is good and thats well understood
so dont even question if you know what i mean

chorus jack johnson
but its all relative
even if you dont understand
well its all understood
especially when you dont understand
then its all just because
even if we dont understand
then lets all just believe
outro jack johnson
but there you go once again
you missed the point and then you point
your fingers at me
and say that i said not to believe
but there you go once again
you missed the point and then you point
your fingers at me
and you say that i said not to believe
i believe
but there you go once again
you missed the point and then you point
your fingers at me
and you say that i said not to believe
i believe
i guess
i guess its all relative6embed"
