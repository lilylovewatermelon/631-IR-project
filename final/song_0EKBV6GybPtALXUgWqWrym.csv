all of these lines across my face
tell you the story of who i am
so many stories of where ive been
and how i got to where i am

chorus
but these stories dont mean anything
when youve got no one to tell them to its true
i was made for you

verse 2
i climbed across the mountaintops
swam all across the ocean blue
i crossed all the lines and i broke all the rules
but baby i broke them all for you

chorus
oh because even when i was flat broke
you made me feel like a million bucks you do
i was made for you

instrumental break

verse 3
you see the smile thats on my mouth
its hiding the words that dont come out
and all of our friends who think that im blessed
they dont know my head is a mess

no they dont know who i really am
and they dont know what ive been through like you do
and i was made for you

breakdown
all of these lines across my face
tell you the story of who i am
so many stories of where ive been
and how i got to where i am

chorus
oh but these stories dont mean anything
when youve got no one to tell them to its true
i was made for you

outro

that i was made for you11embed"
