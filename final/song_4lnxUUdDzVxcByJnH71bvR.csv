that burnin sunset in the sky
is callin out to us tonight
and i wont work for my old man anymore than you fit into your mamas plan
theres a place for people like you and me
but true loves still got room to breathe

chorus
and we can drive all night until the mornin light
lets go west
its our ticket out of here yeah we can disappear
lets go west
and that painted sky was made for us
its everything we ever dreamed of
lets go west

verse 2
its hard to leave this place behind
got memories turnin in my mind
little white house with a picket fence
that protected smalltown innocence
but it seems like an even trade to me
that security for our destiny

chorus
yeah and we can drive all night until the mornin light
lets go west go west
a place that we can go where the tall dreams grow
lets go west
and well find a place to call our own
theres somewhere out there we belong
lets go west
