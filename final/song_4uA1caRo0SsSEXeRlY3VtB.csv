was i born a stone heavy to hold
and cold in the hands that you left me to warm in the sun
was i born alone have i recently
developed a propensity to push people away
am i okay with that

prechorus
take it any way you want to
she lit a fire in your head standing with a flower in her hair
and alcohol plus information often makes it complicated
so youll hate me make love
lately ive spent my days in daydreams waking you me
saving every heartbeat word line that you ever gave to me
cause fair is a weather condition

chorus
if youre cold go inside
if youre tired go to sleep
if youre weak come to me find shameful company
if youre cold go inside
if youre tired go to sleep
if youre weak come to me find shameful company

verse 2
we were young dumb taking our chance
and making romance and breaking our promises
trying to be and failing miserably
but am i too late or hearts to your spades
if i dont suit you then what do you want from me
so were not written in the stars but im okay with that
im okay with anything
