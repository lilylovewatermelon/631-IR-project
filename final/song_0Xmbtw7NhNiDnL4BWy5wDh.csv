well i have a home longing to roam
i have to find you i have to meet you
signs of your face slowing your pace
i need your guidance i need to seek my innervision

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
innervision

verse 2 serj tankian
my pupils dance lost in a trance
your sacred silence losing all violence
stars in their place mirror your face
i need to find you i need to seek my innervision

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian

the road that leads to all leads to one
theres only one true path in life innervision
