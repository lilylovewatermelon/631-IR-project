verse 1
we are not the same i am too reckless
im not tryna go in that direction
these niggas they been doin too much flexin
and they about to call the wrong attention
and i dont got no patience no more testin
i do shit how i want dont need no blessin
xo niggas aint nothin to mess with
nobody stoppin us oh no we destined
and everybody round you is so basic
im never rockin white im like a racist
i dont drink my liquor wit a chase in
that money is the only thing im chasin
and some dope dimes on some coke lines
gimme head all night cum four times
baby girl just wanna smoke a pound

my cousin said i made it big and its unusual
she tried to take a selfie at my grandmas funeral
used to roam on queen now i sing queen street anthems
used to hate attention now i pull up in that wagon
and i was broken i was broken i was so broke
i used to roam around the town when i was homeless
me and lamar would rob a nigga for his jordans
and flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
now we get faded when we want girl we got choices
lay them on the fuckin table we got choices
and if they wanna fuck my niggas they got choices
