got it on smash

verse
my mom call me crying say she barely know me no more and i tell her im sorry
im addicted to working im prolly recording or bustin a move when you called me
i gotta do better but i got so many people and they all leaning on me ayy
wasted youth shawty i swear we an army and everybody on it charting
did a song with lil baby i went to the hood shot the video right in the trenches
had a glock on my hip like i missed my due date you know i gotta keep an extension
its qc for life but until i get right im just grinding and keeping my distance
so much food on the table but wont grab a plate until i do my thing in the kitchen
if i hit yo bitch from the back then thats a collision
hit and run i take off then i go missin
ima og like parker first one seen the vision yeah
bein young from miami youre scammin or pimpin
and my rims is offset forgiatos be tippin
me and yachty dont really talk much cause we different
but for you i pull that pistol out in a second
keep a nine just like marlo you might end up missin missin
might end up missin i bought my bitch a chloe bag and some christians
hope she never catch me cheating like tristan
gotta stay strapped like its click it or ticket
that bitch ass fake but it look realistic
i dont take meds no more bitch im holistic
ill draw my gun on a rapper artistic
i got that money its dumb its autistic
gotta put people on gotta keep flippin
really to me thats the only statistic
that you should care about empire building and you cannot tear it down
if you got problems then we find your whereabouts
like we hotboxin you know we gon air it out yeah
like we hotboxin you know we gon air it out air it out yeah
used to love me but you judge me like aaron now thats deep
you used to listen but you bad at hearin now wow
you wont even hear me out that fuck shit get canceled out
we was both on the road to the money you mad at me cause i took better routes
shout out to p feel like i won a grammy the night that you gave me my chain
we got a lot in common cause we both know what its like bein betrayed
i see that shit that you goin through sometimes it make me afraid of the fame
but its the life that i chose so theres really no one but myself i could blame
before the deal i had 35 hundred dollars to my name me
gave you a place you could sleep gave you clothes you could wear and put food on your plate you
when you was fightin the charge who was the one that made sure your lawyer was paid me
now youre writin statements bout me i swear to god i think about that shit every day you
who was the person you called when you got into beef and you needed it handled me
who used the wasted youth to get a deal and when they got a deal they gon cancel you
who was the one that you called when you had the gun pointed to your head in orlando me
look what youve done all your day ones you burned em all like a candle you
who got they dollars up me
who losin followers you
who took care of all of us me
who could we never trust you
whos the one gave you the help me
who signed a deal and got shelved you
who would write all of your lyrics me
who was a muhfuckin parrot you
who picked you up from the hospital me
whos fuckin parents was dodgin em you
who introduced you to haj and em me
who got a crew with the flaws in em you
whos chain is vvs diamonds me
whos shine is fake and they lyin you
who could make hits without tryin me
who left the studio cryin youyou might also likeembed"
