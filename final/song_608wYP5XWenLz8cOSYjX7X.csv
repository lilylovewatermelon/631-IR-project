will you let me come closer to you
i know that youre older but what can i do
i leave in the morning ill forget that i am surely falling

prechorus
grew up in a case of fragile glass
but hammer away its time to crash
and as it shatters let me shatter into you

chorus
the soft candle glow
the music so slow
your skin on my skin
the room is spinning
nerve in my bone
im shaking oh no
im talking though i shouldnt be
ive lost all sensibility
ive never been so fragile

verse 2
its been a year and forty days
since you picked me up and swept me away
i wanted to run with you into the midnight sun with you
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeprechorus
now i sit around and rust in rain
turn into dust as i just wait
for somеone to hold me like you did that night i still rеmember

chorus
the soft candle glow
the music so slow
your skin on my skin
the room kept spinning
round im alone
new town on my own
im missing you i shouldnt be
ive lost all sensibility
ive never been so fragile2embed"
