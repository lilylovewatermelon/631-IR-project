he says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
he says why fall in love just so you can watch it go away
he spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
he spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

prechorus
i call just checkin up on him
hes up 3am pacin
he says its not just a phase im in
my voice comes out beggin

chorus
all this time i didnt know
you were breakin down
id fall to pieces on the floor
if you werent around
too young to know it gets better
ill be summer sun for you forever
forever winter if you go

verse 2
he seems fine most of the time forcing smiles and never minds
his laugh is a symphony when the lights go out its hard to breathe
i pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
live my life scared to death hell decide to leave instead

i call just checkin up on him
hes up 5am wasted
long gone not even listening
my voice comes out screamin

chorus
all this time i didnt know
you were breakin down
id fall to pieces on the floor

too young to know it gets better
ill be summer sun for you forever

if i was standing there in your apartment
id take that bomb in your head and disarm it
id say i love you even at your darkest and

chorus
i didnt know
you were breakin down
id fall to pieces on the floor
if you werent around
too young to know it gets better
ill be summer sun for you forever
