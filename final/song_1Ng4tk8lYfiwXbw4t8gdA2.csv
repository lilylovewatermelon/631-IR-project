i miss the days my mind would just rest quiet
my imagination hadnt turned on me yet
i used to let my words wax poetic
but it melted a puddle at my feet now
it is a calcifying crime its tragic
ive turned to petrified past life baggage
i want to disappear and just start over
so here we are

prechorus
and ill breathe again

chorus
cause i have sent for a warrior
from on my knees make me a hercules
i was meant to be a warrior
please make me a hercules

verse 2
ive lost a grip on where i started from
i wish id thought ahead and left a few crumbs
im on the hunt for who ive not yet become
but id settle for a little equilibrium
there is a war inside my heart gone silent
both sides dissatisfied and somewhat violent
the issue i have now begun to see
i am the only lonely casualty

this is not the end though

chorus
cause i have sent for a warrior
from on my knees make me a hercules
i was meant to be a warrior
please make me a hercules
cause i have sent for a warrior
from on my knees make me a hercules
i was meant to be a warrior
please make me a hercules

verse 3
this is my darkest hour
a long road has lead me out here
i only need turn around to face the light
and decide flight or fight

bridge
cause i have sent for a warrior
from on my knees make me a hercules
i was meant to be

chorus
cause i have sent for a warrior
from on my knees make me a hercules
i was meant to be a warrior
please make me a hercules4embed"
