i cant come down
not today i feel alright
they believe every word i say
and it seems so jaded
every place i go it feels so jaded
theres people all around but im all alone

verse 1
the clock in my head wont stop ticking ticking
the phone in my hand rings all day long
ive been in la almost five months now
i try to pretend that it feels like home
oh oh
maybe i flew too far
shooting stars leave no mark

chorus
i cant come down
not today i feel alright
they believe every word i say
it seems so jaded
every place i go it feels so jaded
theres people all around but im all alone

verse 2
i know my dad only got a few years now
hes gon cry when he hears this song
and things with mom have become so weird now
i gotta book hotels for my detroit shows
oh oh
maybe i flew too far
shooting stars leave no mark

i cant come down
not today i feel alright
they believe every word i say
and it seems so jaded
every place i go it feels so jaded
theres people all around but im all aloneembed"
