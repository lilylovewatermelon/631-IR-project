im american made bud light chevrolet
my mama taught me wrong from right
i was born in the south
sometimes i have a big mouth
when i see somethin that i dont like
i gotta say it

verse 2
well weve been driving this road for a mighty long time
payin no mind to the signs
well this neighborhoods changed
its all been rearranged
we left that dream somewhere behind

chorus

baby you were screaming its a blast blast blast
look out babe youve got your blinders on
everybodys lookin for a way to get real gone
