like a song
and did you ever notice
the way light means more than it did all day long

words mean more at night
light means more
like your hair and your face and your smile
and our bed and the dress that you wore

ill send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them by the light of day
please read them by the light of the moon

and i wish i could leave my bones and my skin
and float over the tired tired sea
so that i could see you again

maybe you would leave too
and wed blindly pass each other
floating over the ocean blue
just to find the warm bed of our lover

ill send you my words
from the corners of my room
and though i write them by the light of day
please read them by the light of the moon
please read them by the light of the moon
please read them by the light of the moonsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like6embed"
