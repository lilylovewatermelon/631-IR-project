johanna drove slowly into the city
the hudson river all filled with snow
she spied the ring on his honors finger
oh oh oh

verse 2
a thousand years in one piece of silver
she took it from his lilywhite hand
showed no fear shed seen the thing
in the young mens wing at sloankettering

chorus
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh

postchorus

verse 3
his honor drove southward seeking exotica
down to the pueblo huts of new mexico
cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
oh oh oh

i saw johanna down in the subway
she took an apartment in washington heights
half of the ring lies here with me
but the other halfs at the bottom of the sea

chorus
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh
look outside at the raincoats coming say oh
