get down with the victim
we both know you need them
youre stuck in the middle
of all irrelevance
and your heart is beating
cause you know that you gotta
get out of the middle
and rise to the top now

prechorus

wont ya tell me what to do
cause im playin it all wrong
when youve made it when youve made it
wont ya tell me what to do
cause im playin it all wrong

chorus
you cant fight the friction so ease it off
you cant take the pressure so ease it off
dont tell me to be strong ease it off
you cant fight the friction
so ease it off

verse 2
and get into the system
we both know you need one
the tip of the needle
is taking over you
and your heart is beating
cause you know that you gotta
get out of the middle
and rise to the top now
