theres a walmart supercenter
in the field where i use to bale my daddys hay
where we used to ride our horses
now sits a brand new café
the ol house where my granddad was born
was torn down in 1973
aw theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for me

chorus
theyre takin gods name out of the schools
and robert earl keen right off the radio
theyre takin john wayne out of hollywood
replaced him with some brokeback picture show
and ol waylon would sure be mad as hell
if he knew they cuffed ol willie for smokin weed
aw theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for me

verse 2
well there used to be this ol honkytonk
right down there beside that ol town square
thats where i had my first dance
as i ran my fingers through her auburn hair
it was torn down to build a dealership
of some foreign car nobodyd ever seen
theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for me

theyre takin gods name out of the schools
and robert earl keen right off the radio
theyre takin john wayne out of hollywood
replaced him with some brokeback picture show
and ol waylon would sure be mad as hell
if he knew they cuffed ol willie for smokin weed
theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for me

chorus
theyre takin gods name out of the schools
and gary p nunn right off the radio
theyre takin john wayne out of hollywood
replaced him with some brokeback picture show
ol waylon would sure be mad as hell
if he knew they cuffed ol willie for smokin weed
theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for me
yeah theyre makin off with everything thats left
so whats left of texas for meembed"
