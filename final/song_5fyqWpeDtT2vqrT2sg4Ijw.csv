well i was raised up by a simple man
i grew up with a gun in my hand
taught me how to love and how to fight
taught me whats wrong taught me whats right
said you dont have a choice to choose
you do what you can and dont ever lose
just remember even when im dead and gone

chorus
stick to your guns son make me proud
dont ever back up dont ever back down
stand your ground and always tell it like it is
yeah this lifes gonna be real damn tough
you take them scars and you call that bluff
dont let me catch you fittin in
cause everyones an outlaw
until its timе to do outlaw shit

verse 2
well the times arе changin but not for me
ive got my own home now and a family
two calloused hands and some old work boots
bustin my ass payin my dues
i tell my kids every night
try to see the world through your neighbors eyes
and make a difference if you can

dont let me catch you fittin in
cause everyones an outlaw
until its time to do outlaw shit
