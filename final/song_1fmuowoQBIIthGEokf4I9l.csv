you ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing
like a broken record skipping down on main
pretty girls pickups and cutoff jeans
you know what i mean

dirt roads corn rows and homemade wine
juke joints jumping on the county line
heard them sing about it a million times
but i dont mind

chorus
as long as theres a small town and a saturday night
blue jean babies in the full moonlight
tip back your dixie howl at the stars
every time you hear that slide guitar
and your babys on the tailgate
and youre stealing those kisses to a little george strait
thats how we rock and thats how we roll
as long as theres country on the radio

verse 2
theres always going to be a party out in the pines
always going to be a shot up highway sign
paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
from time to time
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 49you might also liketheres always going to be people trying to run us down
saying we arenâ€™t got nothing on a big town
i bet theyd come around
if they came on down

chorus

verse 3
theres always going to be a part of me
kicking back in bfe
yeah thats how its always going to be

chorus

verse 4
some country on the radio
as long as theres a small town
saturday nights
blue jean babies
yeah tip back your dixie
stealing those kissesembed"
