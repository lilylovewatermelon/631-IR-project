ive been thinking that youve crossed the line
if you disappear that would be just fine
cause you waste my time and waste my money
and youre not too cool and not so funny
spreading your seed all over the town
getting too greedy and messing around
oh my gosh you must be joking me
if you think that youll be poking me

prechorus
dont take me on no no
dont take me on no no
dont take me on

chorus
shattered the lie but you think i dont already know
dont try to deny cause my fuse is ready to blow
its your turn to learn
i think that you know where to go
its a shame shame shame shame for you

verse 2
please dont come around and knock on my door
cause i dont wanna have to pick you up off the floor
when you ask if we can still be lovers
ill have to introduce my brothers
i think that they could teach you a lesson or two
by the time theyve finished youll be black and blue
youll be crying like a baby
a sea of tears theyll call the navy in

dont take me on no no
dont take me on no no
dont take me on

chorus
shattered the lie but you think i dont already know
dont try to deny cause my fuse is ready to blow
its your turn to learn
i think that you know where to go
its a shame shame shame shame for you
