yeah this shit beautiful nigga
the free nationals

verse 1 conway the machine
look pyrex has got the cocaine resi in it
see the wrappers in the trash we was heavy whippin
used to bag it up in vanessa kitchen
fifth close cross the mob let the dezzy lift em
told him no trappin round here but he aint never listen
had my youngins kick his door now his fetti missing
they found his body but his head is missin
spent his bread with my jeweler he made the presi glisten
blood bottoms got the pony hair
three racks went to christian and copped the only pair
i put up numbers nigga kobe here
diamonds in the rollie clear
grammy week with twenty of my homies there

verse 2 westside gunn
yo you like to bag all my dope cook all my dope
