verse 1 pimp c
i got money on my beeper dead trees on my phone
they call me mick jagger cause i roll a lot of stones
its a whole lot of clones but only one sweet jones
turning whores to carnivores they just cant leave my meat alone
its been a long time since i hustled on the block
but every corner that i hit i left it screwed up and chopped
marooned up and dropped like my biarritz on top
let the motherfucker bleed until it drip the last drop
im still that young boy that had a pocket full of stones
but now its nicks for sixty bricks gripping wood and flipping chrome

ugh i done smashed up my flying spur it wasnt shit
