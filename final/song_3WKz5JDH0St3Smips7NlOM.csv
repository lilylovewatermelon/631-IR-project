strange how we found ourselves
exactly where we left off
i know youre shaking my hand like it is the first time
are we alright
are you recounting all my faults
and are you racking your brain just to find them all
could it be that ive changed
or did you woo

chorus
stop asking why
why we had to waste so much time
well we just pick up pick up and start again
cause we cant keep holding on to grudges

verse 2
time is a bastard
i wont break my neck to get around it
but arent we so brave to give up a fight
and let the years go by without us
cause now i feel you by my side
and i dont even care if its been a while
i can feel that weve changed
and were better this way woo
