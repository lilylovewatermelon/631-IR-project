dreaming up this golden grain
but im falling from this shack
talking sweet to the queen
wishing i was riding with the jacks
walking proud and lonesome now
oh im yearning for the pack
but id never say i love you dear
just to hear you say it back

verse 2
ive heard the road to every truth
its just a culdesac
theres ladies and the lions there
but you know its just an act
you search the world for the milk of the pearl
she always takes it black
but youll love her till it all goes dark
youll love her even after thatsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also like5embed"
