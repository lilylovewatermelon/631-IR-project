i live on a lonely island there isnt any hope for me
i tell you my heart is broken its a shame have pity
i might as well be shipwrecked in the middle of the sea

nobody will believe me
nobody seems to care
how lonely how lonely can you be
i walk around the city
my heart sends out a flare
baby baby baby wont you rescue meyou might also likeembed"
