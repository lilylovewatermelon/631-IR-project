its hard to argue when
you wont stop makin sense
but my tongue still misbehaves and it
keeps diggin my own grave

chorus
with my hands open
and my eyes open
i just keep hopin
that your heart opens

verse 2
why would i sabotage
the best thing that i have
well it makes it easier to know
exactly what i want

chorus
with my hands open
and my eyes open
i just keep hopin
that your heart opens

postchorus
its not as easy as willin it all to be right
gotta be more than hopin its right
i wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
collapse into me tired with joy
its not as easy as willin it all to be right
gotta be more than hopin its right
i wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
collapse into me tired with joy
