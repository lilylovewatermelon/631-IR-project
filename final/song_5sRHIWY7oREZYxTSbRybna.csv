make it a strong one
we’re gonna have some fun tonight

i wanna be a castaway
and leave the world behind
take a tropic holiday
say goodbye to keeping time
wasting away down by the coast
pacifico and chasing lime
easy living down in paradise

pour me another one
make it a strong one
we’re gonna have some fun tonight
just like the other one
make it a double rum
we’re gonna castaway tonight

im in an island state of mind
dont think i’m ever gonna leave
id rather stay and watch the waves
move the sand beneath my feet
reggae on the radio
laying low and feeling high
easy living down in paradise

make it a strong one
were gonna have some fun tonight
just like the other one
make it a double rum
were gonna castaway tonight

chorus
castaway
ride the waves like we’re young
cause time flies by and soon well be older
its better to live in the moment
than stuck in the past
fast asleep as the world passes by

ay ay yo
where reality is history
oh yo eh
come and castaway with me
ay ay yo
the good times are free and
nobody can take that away
oh yo eh
come and castaway with me

pour me another one
smiling in the islands i’ve been
make it a strong one
we’re gonna have some fun tonight
for a little while i’ll be a castaway
gonna let the sun shine in
just like the other one
smiling in the islands i’ve been
make it a double rum
we’re gonna castaway tonight
for a little while i’ll be a castaway
gonna let the sunshine in
pour me another one
smiling in the islands ive been
make it a strong one
we’re gonna have some fun tonight
for a little while ill be a castaway
gonna let the sunshine in
just like the other one
smiling in the islands ive been
make it a double rum
we’re gonna castaway tonight
for a little while i’ll be a castaway castaway
gonna let the sunshine in
smiling in the islands i’ve been
make it a strong one
we’re gonna have some fun tonight3embed"
