the lights go out and i cant be saved
tides that i tried to swim against
have brought me down upon my knees
oh i beg i beg and plead singin
come out of things unsaid
shoot an apple off my head and a
trouble that cant be named
a tigers waitin to be tamed singin

chorus
you are
you are

verse 2
confusion never stops
closin walls and tickin clocks gonna
come back and take you home
i could not stop that you now know singin
come out upon my seas
cursed missed opportunities am i
a part of the cure
or am i part of the disease singin

chorus
you are
you are
