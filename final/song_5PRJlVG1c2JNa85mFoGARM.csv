theres nothing like a bad joke
to make the enemy choke
cant excuse the punchline
it never works the first time
look through broken windows
and everybody looks cold
wont ask for a reason
but shutting ups not easy

chorus john disco with scifi steven
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant understand
tell the world about the silver spoon and i wont understand

verse 2 john disco
i need secondary sight
of just whats lurking behind
step on cracks im bleeding
i never stopped believing
winter gave me shelter
but summer left me freezing
thirty thousand feet up
my head has taken enough

chorus all
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant understand
tell the world about the silver spoon and i wont understand
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant understand
tell the world about the silver spoon and i wont understand

understand
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant
understand

verse 3 john disco
theres nothing like a bad joke
to make the enemy choke
theres nothing like disaster
to make the heart beat faster
theres nothing like a bad day
to make the enemy say
life is like bad joke
its always making me choke

chorus all
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant understand
tell the world about the silver spoon and i wont understand
tell the world about the silver spoon that i cant understand
