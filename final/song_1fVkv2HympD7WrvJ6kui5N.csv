come and open up your folding chair next to me
my feet are buried in the sand and theres a breeze
theres a shadow you cant see my eyes
and the sea is just a wetter version of the skies
lets get a silver bullet trailer and have a baby boy
ill safetypin his clothes all cool and youll graffiti up his toys
ive got a perfect body though sometimes i forget
ive got a perfect body cause my eyelashes catch my sweat
yes they do they do

chorus
ooooooh ooooooh ooooooh ooh
ooooooooh ooooh
ooooooh ooooooh ooooooh ooh
ooooooh ooooooh

verse 2
now ive been sitting on this abandoned beach for years
waiting for the salty water to cover up my ears
but every time the tide come in to take me home
i get scared and im sitting here alone
dreaming of the dolphin song

chorus
ooooooh ooooooh ooooooh ooh
ooooooooh ooooh
ooooooh ooooooh ooooooh ooh
ooooooh ooooooh

maybe one day you will understand
i dont want nothing from you but to sweetly hold your hand
till that day just please dont be so down
dont make frowns you silly clown
just come and open up your folding chair next to me
my feet are buried in the sand and theres a breeze
theres a shadow you cant see my eyes
and the sea is just a wetter version of the skies

outro
theres a shadow you cant see my eyes
theres a shadow you cant see my eyes eyes8embed"
