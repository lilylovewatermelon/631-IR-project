but tonight i think i lost the plot instead
i said that id be cleared out by three said that id be cleared out by three
to the walls i know they listen to me
the teachers always called it a shame the teachers always called it a shame
they say i dont have passion the same
as i did a few years before as i did a few years before
they don’t see the light there anymorе

chorus
they call it sad but they’re thе outside lookin in
i mean they can’t understand when they all cope with everything
and when i opened my heart in front of my friends finally
it was not what i thought cause theyre not there anymore
i called my dad he told me theres no room for me
down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
now that my familys gone almost as far as i can see
i think they love me im sure but theyre not there anymore hey
nah nahnahnahnah
where can i sleep tonight
nah nahnahnahnah

verse 2
im breakin them in half they always say
i never wanted them to end this way
and now i have to gather all my things
they dont want the problems that i bring they dont know the problems that i bring hey
