i shouldve known from how i felt when we were together
and even more when we were apart
you tiptoed in and you got under my skin
you snuck your way right into my heart

verse 2
i put up barriers to shield my emotions
a wall that you could never break apart
but like a ninja of love rappelling down from above
you snuck your way right into my heart
oh yeah

outro
come on everybody let me hear ya
lala nanananananana nanana
you snuck your way right into my heart
lala nanananananana nanana
yeah yeah
