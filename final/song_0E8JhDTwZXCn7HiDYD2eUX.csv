something bout george jones on the headphones
truth through a microphone
livin on and on and on in a melody
something bout starlight on kansas
the way a wheat field dances
fence posts as far as the eye can see

prechorus
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me

verse 2
something bout the sound of crack in bottle tops
makes troubles fade and time stop
holdin that cold somehow sets you free
or thinking back to who i was
saving up for that used truck
her levis laying on my chevy seats

prechorus
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me

chorus
it aint like smoke gets in your clothes
naw it cuts through my skin and digs in way down deep
soaks in like rain
burns like a flame
takes ahold of my soul underneath
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me

something bout a drawer full of yesterdays
a handmedown knife and a last name
and a shoebox full of roots from the family tree
something bout me and her
and how our love turned into brown eyes looking up
the sound of hardwood floors on little feet

prechorus
it just gets all the way to me

chorus
it aint like smoke gets in your clothes
naw it cuts through my skin and digs in way down deep
soaks in like rain
burns like a flame
takes ahold of my soul underneath
just gets all the way to me
just gets all the way to me hey

bridge
something bout a wooden cross
forgiving sins and no love lost
gratitude i find on bended knee

outro
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me
it just gets all the way to me all the way to meembed"
