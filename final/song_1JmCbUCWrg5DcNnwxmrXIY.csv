silence is ringing in my head
stuck on repeat
not much longer ill be dead
so just forget me
im losing my mind
and i dont think you could save me this time

chorus
and it goes on and on
and i just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear out
on and on
when will i get through this
welcome to my own down and out

verse 2
im crawling deeper in this hole
to disaster
im gripping what i thought control
was falling faster
im losing my mind
and i dont think you could save me this time

chorus
and it goes on and on
and i just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear out
on and on
when will i get through this
welcome to my own down and out
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeverse 3
its dragging on
im wearing thin
i cant stop these walls
they keep caving in
its gone too far
wheres my mind
why cant time stop fear this paranoia

bridge
its a never ending story
and it starts with me
its a never ending story
and it starts with me

chorus
and it goes on and on
and i just feel helpless
how long will this take to wear out
on and on
when will i get through this
welcome to my own down and out

outro
welcome welcome
its never ending
welcome to my own down and out
welcome welcome
im falling further
welcome to my own down and outembed"
