my mama wants to know
where im spending all my dough
honey all she does is nag nag nag
but i wont apologize
id inject into my eyes
if there was nowhere else to stick my skag
all i want is brown
and im going into town
shooting up as soon as im back
my friends have got some good shit
all i want is some of it
gimme gimme gimme that smack

well ive ruined nearly all of my veins
sticking that fucking shit into my arms
yeahyeah

verse 2
getting off my face
theres a dragon i must chase
honey im the scourge of all mankind
and everyone but me
is destined just to be
slaves to the remorseless grind
see the darkness liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeprechorus
but i found myself an easy way out
sticking that fucking shit into my arms
into my arms
