i could spend ages reading the news
i could spend days singing the blues

prechorus
but i turn up the tv light
give up without a fight

chorus
better than pretending
to know whats wrong and whats right

verse 2
i could spend ages asking myself why
theres a million ways that i could say goodbye

prechorus
but i turn down the lights
come on baby come inside

chorus
better than being
some fools bride
better than pretending
to know whats wrong and whats right

prechorus
turn down the lights
come on baby come inside

chorus
better than pretending
to know whats wrong and whats right
better than being
some fools bride

to know whats wrong and whats right
