ill be coming home just to be alone
cause i know youre not there
and i know that you dont care
i can hardly wait to leave this place

this is not our home i think im better off alone
you always disappear even when youre here
this is not my home i think im better off alone

chorus
no matter how hard i try youre never satisfied
this is not our home i think im better off alone
you always disappear even when youre here
this is not my home i think im better off alone
