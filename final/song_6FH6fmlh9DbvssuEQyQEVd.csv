movies movies
i want a love like the movies

verse 1
i look at you like youre perfect for me
if you are the diamond then i am the ring
all of our friends think of us jealously
we’re so sweet so sweet
built us a world and i gave you the key
still cant believe that this isnt a dream
falling in love with a damn fantasy
that’s so me so me

prechorus
but ive been livin
life in fiction

chorus
in my head were dancing in the dark
in my head we kiss under the stars
but we know thats not what were doing
causе baby this aint like the movies

we go to parties with people you know
we’re holding hands but it’s all just for show
cause monday through friday we both barely spoke
they don’t know they cant know
that just on the drive here i was looking through your texts
i was screaming my damn head off how you still love your ex
and you say that its over but why does she call you
at 3am and 4am
thats a funny way of staying friends

chorus
in my head we’re dancing in the dark
in my head we kiss under the stars
but we know thats not what were doing
cause baby this aint like the movies
in my head we never grow apart
in my head you never break my heart
but we know thats not what were doing
cause baby this aint like the movies
