cause im awake in my room
i been up for 38 hours
and it dont look like sleeps coming soon
cause i could break like a bird
or i could swallow the sea
it seems like the daylight is coming
and no one is watching but me

but i dont mind the dark discovering the day
cause the night is a beautiful bright blue and grey

and what brings me down now is love
cause i can never get enough
and what brings me down now is love
cause i can never get enough

and its a dangerous time for a heart on a wire
shuttled from station to station noisily
not knowing why
so i put my head on the ground
and the sky is a wheel
spinning these days into things that ive lost
but you can keep all the years

but i dont mind the days gone rolling away
because all this sunlight feels warm on my face today
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likeand what brings me down now is love
cause i can never get enough of love
and what brings me down now is love
cause i can never get enough
i can never get enough of loveembed"
