i need some air
vampire town
no one out

verse 2
you were there and cold
didn’t smoke
made it count

chorus
so i thought you could come over mine sometime
our loneliness now gone
so i thought you could come over mine sometime
have we ever been old friends

verse 3
i didn’t think
late in time
we’d meet again

verse 4
you looked a bit old
in this cold
you stood out
see men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
so i thought you could come over mine sometime
our loneliness now gone
so i thought you could come over mine sometime
have we ever been old friendsembed"
