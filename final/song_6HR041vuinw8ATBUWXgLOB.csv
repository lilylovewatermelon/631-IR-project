you light me up and then i fall for you
you lay me down and then i call for you
stumbling on reasons that are far and few
id let it all come down and then some for you

chorus
pretty baby dont you leave me
i have been saving smiles for you
pretty baby why cant you see
youre the one that i belong to
ill be the embrace that keeps you warm
for youre the sun that breaks the storm
ill be alright and ill sleep sound
as long as you keep comin round
oh pretty baby

verse 2
and i know things cant last forever
but there are lessons that youll never learn
oh just the scent of you it makes me hurt
so hows it you that makes me better

chorus
pretty baby dont you leave me
i have been saving smiles for you
pretty baby why cant you see
youre the one that i belong to
ill be the embrace that keeps you warm
for youre the sun that breaks the storm
ill be alright and ill sleep sound
as long as you keep comin
you might also likebridge
why cant you hold me and never let go
when you touch me it is me that you own
pretty baby oh the place that you hold in my heart
would you break it apart again

chorus
pretty baby dont you leave me
i have been saving smiles for you
pretty baby why cant you see
youre the one that i belong to
ill be the embrace that keeps you warm
for youre the sun that breaks the storm
ill be alright and ill sleep sound
as long as you keep comin round

outro
pretty baby why cant you see
pretty baby dont you leave me
pretty baby why cant you see
pretty baby dont you leave me
oh pretty baby my pretty baby my pretty baby
dont you leave me
oh pretty baby my pretty baby my pretty babyembed"
