with yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
she would merengue and do the chacha
and while she tried to be a star tony always tended bar across the crowded floor
they worked from eight till four

they were young and they had each other
who could ask for more

at the copa copa copacabana copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana here
at the copa copa copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion at the copa
they fell in love

copa copacabana

his name was rico he wore a diamond
he was escorted to his chair he saw lola dancin there
and when she finished he called her over
but rico went a bit too far tony sailed across the bar
and then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two

there was blood and a single gun shot
but just who shot who

the hottest spot north of havana here
at the copa copa copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion at the copa
she lost her love

copa copacabana

copacabana
music and passion always in fashion

her name is lola she was a showgirl
but that was thirty years ago when they used to have a show
now its a disco but not for lola
still in the dress she used to wear faded feathers in her hair
she sits there so refined and drinks herself halfblind

she lost her youth and she lost her tony
now shes lost her mind

at the copa copa copacabana copacabana
the hottest spot north of havana here
at the copa copa copacabana
music and passion were always the fashion at the copa
dont fall in love
