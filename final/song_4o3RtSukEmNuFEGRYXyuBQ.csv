i never thought the sun would shine my way
all ive known is empty promises and pain
i need a way out or some type of escape
so i take refuge in this place

prechorus omarion
even though the road to glory seems long
the fire in me could win a marathon
believe theres nothing you cant overcome

chorus
if you dream then you can do anything
if you dream youre halfway to destiny
if you dream dream the impossible
if you dream cause a dreams unstoppable

verse 2 toni braxton and faith evans
i could have gave up a long time ago
though the door i need to get through will always close
storms and rain everywhere i go
but i dont give up cause i know

prechorus tyrese and jojo
even if they say you just cant win
believe you can go where youve never been
and you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

if you dream then you can do anything
if you dream youre halfway to destiny
if you dream dream the impossible
if you dream cause a dreams unstoppable

bridge
dream that you can fly
dream that you can climb
dream a mountain
all you gotta do is just

dream that you can win
dream with confidence
dream to the very end
cause dreamers become champions

dream until its real
dream dont let them kill your
dream the fight still is in you
all you gotta do is

dream just keep the faith
dream dont ever break
dream dont let it slip away
cause all you gotta do
prechorus tank
even though the road to glory seems long
the fire in me could win a marathon
believe theres nothing you cant overcome

if you dream then you can do anything
if you dream youre halfway to destiny
if you dream dream the impossible
all you gotta do is dream

dream then you can do anything
dream youre halfway to destiny
dream dreams unstoppable
