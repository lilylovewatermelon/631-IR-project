like on the benches in the park
except their balding spots
are glistening with gold

and though they do not know it all mankind are now your brothers
and thus the cathedral had spoken wishing well to all us sinners
and with a sigh grew silent till next years big human winner
outside the cars are beeping out a song just in your honor
and though they do not know it all mankind are now your brothers
all mankind are now your brothers
