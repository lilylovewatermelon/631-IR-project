yo ayo

chorus
blood sweat and tears what i shed sleepless nights in my bed
they only love you when you shining i wont let it get to my head
got a lil one on the way now i gotta do this shit for my kid
havin conversations with the sky and i meant everything that i said
for my family gotta build a legacy ima be the man when im dead
worked too hard i cant slip up so im clutching tight on this lead
naw i aint a killer but dont push me im too close to the edge
it is what it is aint no looking back dont regret the things that i did ayy

verse 1
system got the hood fucked up killers crack fiends and some christians
lil nigga all he know is bang only sixteen on a mission ayy
drug money out there serving fiends only time he show his ambition
kid on the way mama bills late gotta hustle hard gotta get it
block was slow so he had to rob just to make em smile on christmas
caught a case judge aint tryna hear all the things influenced my decisions
hate to follow rules elementary school all started off with suspensions
if it werent for rapping where would i be i just thank god that im gifted
made it to the top and i stood up first i had to crawl in them trenches
we got hate in us tryna murder somethin runnin through the field hoppin fences
they left blood stains on our corner gotta spin back with a vengeance
glock discharge its a man down real gang members handle business

blood sweat and tears what i shed sleepless nights in my bed

for my family gotta build a legacy ima be the man when im dead
worked too hard i cant slip up so im clutching tight on this lead

verse 2
we some young niggas we dont give a fuck knock a nigga head right off
bunch of hollow shells on that crime scene it was doa white chalk
i know real killers no remorse in em proud of the bodies they caught
went through a lot and im only twenty its a lot of things that i saw
shit left me cold on the inside feelin like i need to unthaw
was it to fill a void or acceptance lookin at the things that i bought
i still get depressed in my mansion contemplating deep in my thoughts
im just glad that im still standing its a lot of demons i fought
voices in my head and that gun cocked late night rides in all black
really come from nothin i was on that block like the streets all that i got
i done been snaked by my own kind so who really watchin my back
know they want me gone one up top im a dead man if i lack

chorus
blood sweat and tears what i shed sleepless nights in my bed
they only love you when you shining i wont let it get to my head
got a lil one on the way now i gotta do this shit for my kid
havin conversations with the sky and i meant everything that i said
for my family gotta build a legacy ima be the man when im dead
worked too hard i cant slip up so im clutching tight on this lead
naw i aint a killer but dont push me im too close to the edge
