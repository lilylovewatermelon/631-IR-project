i need it now
give me a trunk load
and ill show you how
well take that shinin in no time
well be rollin in the dough

but you dont take nothin
without gettin bruised
see theres always somethin
your bound to lose
and its usually gone
before you know
when the man comes down
he wont cut us any slack
weve had our fun
on our own

you see all them blue lights
they aint your friends
theyre bound to get you
but in the end
ill show you all the tricky curves
and what you need to swerve around

but you dont take nothin
without gettin bruised
see theres always somethin
your bound to lose
and its usually gone
before you know
when the man comes down
he wont cut us any slack
weve had our fun
on our own

he wont cut us any slack
weve had our fun
