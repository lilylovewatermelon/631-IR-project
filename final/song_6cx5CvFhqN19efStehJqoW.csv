ive rejected affection
for years and years
now i have it and damn it
it‘s kind of weird

he tells me im pretty
dont know how to respond
i tell him that hes pretty too
can i say that don‘t have a clue

prechorus
with every passing moment
i surprise myself
i‘m scared of flies
i‘m scared of guys
someone please help

chorus
cause i think ive fallen
in love this time
i blinked and suddenly i had a valentine

verse 2
what if hes the last one i kiss
what if hes the only one ill ever miss
maybe i should run im only twentyone
i don‘t even know who i want to become
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likebridge
ive lost all control of my heartbeat now
got caught in a romance with him somehow
i still feel a shock through every bone
when i hear an “i love you”
cause now ive got someone to lose

prechorus
the first one to ever like me back
i‘m seconds away from a heart attack

chorus
how the hell did i fall in love this time
and honestly i can‘t believe i get to call you mine
i blinked and suddenly
i had a valentine1embed"
