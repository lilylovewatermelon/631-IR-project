and some that are made out of livin alone
i built a wall no one could break down
locked up my heart where it couldnt be found
you saw past my shackles and let love unfold
showed me the truth from the lies id been told
my heart was a prisoner like no heart at all
till your love reached higher than the wall

higher than the wall a thousand feet tall
high above the darkness where the blue shadows fall
your love reached higher where its better and brighter
yeah your love reached higher than the wall

now im wearin freedom instead of those chains
empty reminders dont cause me no pain
its all gone away like the leaves in the fall
cause your love reached higher than the wall

higher than the wall a thousand feet tall
high above the darkness where the blue shadows fall
your love reached higher where its better and brighter
yeah your love reached higher than the wallsee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
