tick tock hear the clock count down
wish the minute hand could be rewound
so much to do and so much i need to say
will tomorrow be too late
feel the moment slip into the past
like sand through an hourglass
in the madness i guess i just forget
to do all the things i said

prechorus
time passes by
never thought id wind up
one step behind
now ive made my mind up

chorus
today im gonna try a little harder
gonna make every minute last longer
gonna learn to forgive and forget
cause we dont have long
gonna make the most of it
today
today im going to love my enemies
today
reach out to somebody who needs me
make a change make the world a better place
cause tomorrow could be one day too late
one day too late
one day too late
