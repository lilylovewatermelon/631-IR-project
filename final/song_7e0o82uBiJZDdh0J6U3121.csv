verse 1
steer the whip with my knee while i count up bands
i show love and affection to all my fans
i got ferragamo holding up my pants
i turn up on the stage while i hit my dance
i get serious when it comes to business
dont waste my time boy you know that i aint playing
i got a clique of niggas with me
when we done twenty hoes laying where im staying
i never dap you with the left hand
i draw down with the glock in the right hand
i got partnas with me when i walked in
lotta shooters waiting and in the sprinter van
i swear that im hot boy i need a fan
i got prices and sales and they all paying
make it work while im using the left hand
bring it back while im using the right hand
