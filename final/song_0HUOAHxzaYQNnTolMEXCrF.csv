im walking down the street shuffling my feet
whistling a feel good song
got the sun on my face nothing in my way
so i keep rocking along

chorus
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
just floating on a breeze
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
dont worry bout me

verse 2
the people downtown are hustling around
the weight of the world on their mind
me im sitting in the shade soaking up the day
watching them all roll by

chorus
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
just floating on a breeze
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
dont worry bout me

verse 3
i like it laid back like a baby blue cadillac
easing on down the road
i like it nice and slow laying low
rolling anywhere the wind may blow

im just doing my thing just doing my thing
just floating on a breeze
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
dont worry bout me
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
just floating on a breeze
im just doing my thing just doing my thing
dont worry bout me
dont you worry
