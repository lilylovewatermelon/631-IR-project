hey hey
keep your chin up
hey hey

verse 1
i wonder if jack and diane ever made it
after the drums and the guitars all faded
was the best they could do good enough
or did the heartland just swallow em up
how did my mom and my dad ever do it
if there was struggles then we never knew it
i guess they had each other
that was enough

chorus
you know you cant keep the ground from shaking
no matter how hard you try
you cant keep the sunsets from fading
you gotta treat your life like youre jumping off a rope swing
baby cause the whole things really just a shot in the dark
you gotta love like theres no such thing as a broken heart
you gotta love like theres no such thing as a broken heart

verse 2
what am i gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on tv
when the whole world is down on its luck
i gotta make sure they keep their chin up
cry when it hurts laugh when its funny
chase after the dream dont chase after the money
and know we got each other
thats whats up
