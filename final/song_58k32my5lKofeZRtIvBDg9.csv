halfpast twelve i was all alone
i cant be compromised
fuckin on my ex we aint apologize

verse
youre not who i love huh
i just need to pass the time huh
felt good you felt that
come and get a peace of mind huh
move on brands on me
stripes in my pocket and a check on me
never needed shit so dont you check on me
home last night the scent of sex on me
baby keem shit im chosen
i whip that red toyota like its stolen
i treat my lil orange soda like a hellcat hellcat
she put me out in the winter feet frozen frozen
she wanna fuck with me cause im famous im famous
and thats okay with me cause you been my favorite my favorite
i let her do it she do a lil bit
a lil air in her room she do a lil bit
