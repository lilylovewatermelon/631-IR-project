songbook baby
id like to than mr bryanmichael cox for helping me illustrate my feelings
this is getting too hot baby this is getting too hot baby
this the last time its the last chapter
but for real this is gotta be the last time
its gon be the best though promise
just one last time

verse 1
cause if she catch me with you she gon kill us
these hotel rooms is looking too familiar
your love is so so serious
girl you keep me coming back that is
i be with her thinking of you
i be with you thinking of her my boo
she just dont deserve this
aint nobody perfect but i just cant take no more cause

chorus
im living two different lives
one girl in the day you at night
and even though this aint right
i just cant get enough of the way you put it down
you really got me tripping
hold up baby girl dont talk just listen
girl for the last time
yep i said the last time
girl this is the last time
all caught up  and its time to put it down
you really got me tripping
hold up baby girl dont talk just listen
this the last time

baby let your hair down take it to the bed now
spread them lovely legs now one last round
