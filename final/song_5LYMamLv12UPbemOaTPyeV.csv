verse 1
green eyes fried rice i could cook an egg on you
late night game time coffee on the stove yeah oh
youre sweet ice cream but you could use a flake or two
blue bubblegum twisted round your tongue

prechorus
i dont want you to get lost
i dont want you to go broke
i want you

interlude
its cause i love you babe
in every kind of way
just a little taste
you know i love you babe
