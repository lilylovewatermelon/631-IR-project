you couldve been all i wanted
but you werent honest now get in the ground
you choked off the surest of favors
but if you really loved me you wouldve endured my world
well if youre just as i presumed
a whore in sheeps clothing fucking up all i do
and if so here we stop
then never again will you see this in your life

chorus
hang on to the glory at my right hand
here laid to rest is our love ever longed
with truth on the shores of compassion
you seem to take premise to all of these songs

verse 2
you stormed off to scar the armada
like jesus played letter ill drill through your hands
the stone for the curse you have blamed me
with love and devotion ill die as you sleep
but if you could just write me out
to neverless wonder happy will i become
be true that this is no option
so with sin i condemn you demon play demon out
you might also likechorus
hang on to the glory at my right hand
here laid to rest is our love ever longed
with truth on the shores of compassion
you seem to take premise to all of these songs

bridge
one last kiss for you
one more wish to you
please make up your mind girl
ill do anything for you
one last kiss for you
one more wish to you
please make up your mind girl
before i hope you die
