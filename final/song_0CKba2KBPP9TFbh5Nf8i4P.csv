staring at you taking off your makeup
wondering why you even put it on
i know you think you do but baby you dont need it
wish that you could see what i see when its gone

chorus
i see a dust trail following an old red nova
baby blue eyes your head on my shoulder
wait baby dont move right there it is
a tshirt hanging off a dogwood branch
that river was cold but we gave love a chance
yeah yeah for me
you dont look a day over fast cars and freedom
that sunset river bank first time feeling

verse 2
yeah smile and shake your head as if you dont believe me
ill just sit right here and let you take me back
im on that gravel road look at me
on my way to pick you up
youre standing on the front porch looking just like that
remember that

chorus
i see a dust trail following an old red nova
baby blue eyes your head on my shoulder
wait baby dont move right there it is
a tshirt hanging off a dogwood branch
that river was cold but we gave love a chance
yeah yeah for me
you dont look a day over fast cars and freedom
that sunset river bank first time feeling
you might also likeoutro
i see a dust trail following an old red nova
baby blue eyes your head on my shoulder
you dont look a day over fast cars and freedom
that sunset river bank first time feeling3embed"
