swaying room as the music starts
strangers making the most of the dark
two by two their bodies become one
i see you through the smokey air
cant you feel the weight of my stare
youre so close but still a world away
what im dying to say is that

chorus
im crazy for you
touch me once and youll know its true
i never wanted anyone like this
its all brand new
youll feel it in my kiss
im crazy for you
crazy for you

verse 2
trying hard to control my heart
i walk over to where you are
eye to eye we need no words at all
slowly now we begin to move
every breath im deeper into you
soon we two are standing still in time
if you read my mind youll see
see madonna liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likechorus
im crazy for you
touch me once and youll know its true
i never wanted anyone like this
its all brand new
youll feel it in my kiss
youll feel it in my kiss
because im crazy for you
touch me once and youll know its true
i never wanted anyone like this
its all brand new
youll feel it in my kiss
im crazy for you
