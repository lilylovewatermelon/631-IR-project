layin there doin that sleepy head thing
theres a bird out my window spreadin his wings
cheap chirp doin that singin
thing i do when i first get up is that coffee thing in my favorite cup
two gets me goin got things to do
let me tell you a thing or two

everythings a thing is you know what i mean
cant do nothin cause theres no such thing
some things are big some things are small
some mean a lot some nothin at all
its all laid out in the scheme of things
no matter what it is
everythings a thing

off to work in my old mustang
doin that bumper to bumper thing
up ahead a ring a ling ding ding
some guys doin that cell phone
thing is the lights turned green and he aint doin that drivin thing
and the thing is about all this that talkin thing and drivin dont mix

everythings a thing is you know what i mean
cant do nothin cause theres no such thing
some things are big some things are small
some mean a lot some nothin at all
its all laid out in the scheme of things
no matter what it is
everythings a thing
