i started out on the wrong foot
now im not myself
i am jekyll i am hyde
found this place to hide
come seek me
oh so up and down
so back and forth
so insecure
cant get this taste out of my mouth
swallow it down
pretend

chorus
and hold it hold it all in
let it build up
oh build a bomb
and blow it blow it away
clear it all out
just end it

verse 2
im just a normal person
without those problems
when did it change
admissions so embarrassing
im on the verge of tears again
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
ill hold it ill hold it all in
ill let it build up
oh build a bomb
and blow it blow it away
clear it all out
just end it

bridge
oh look i took the bandaid off
did i take it off too soon
hysterical confession
my big courageous move

verse 3
dont gasp at the predictable
a comforting lie cant last
preordained checklist of this awkward love
its so sad

chorus
ill hold it hold it all in
let it build up
oh build a bomb
and blow it blow it away
clear it all out
just end it
postchorus
ill sort it sort it out
ill just give it back
no thank you
and toss it toss it away
eliminate
just give up

outro
i i cant decide
this tug of war
im feeling weakembed"
