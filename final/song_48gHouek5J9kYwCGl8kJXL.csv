when you look at the world
what is it that you see
people find all kinds of things
that bring them to their knees

verse 2
i see an expression
so clear and so true
that it changes the atmosphere
when you walk into the room

chorus
so i try to be like you
try to feel it like you do
but without you its no use
i cant see what you see
when i look at the world

verse 3
when the night is someone elses
and youre trying to get some sleep
when your thoughts are too expensive
to ever wanna keep

verse 4
when theres all kinds of chaos
and everyone is walking lame
you dont even blink now do you
or even look away
see u2 liveget tickets as low as 450you might also likechorus
so i try to be like you
try to feel it like you do
but without you its no use
i cant see what you see
when i look at the world

guitar solo

chorus
i cant wait any longer
i cant wait till im stronger
cant wait any longer
to see what you see
when i look at the world

verse 5
im in the waiting room
i cant see for the smoke
i think of you and your holy book
when the rest of us choke

outro
tell me tell me
what do you see
tell me tell me
whats wrong with me1embed"
