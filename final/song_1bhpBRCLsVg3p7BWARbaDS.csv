such is the way of the world
you can never know
just where to put all your faith
and how will it grow

chorus
gonna rise up
burning black holes in dark memories
gonna rise up
turning mistakes into gold

verse 2
such is the passage of time
too fast to fold
suddenly swallowed by signs
lo and behold

chorus
gonna rise up
find my direction magnetically
gonna rise up
throw down my ace in the holeyou might also like1embed"
