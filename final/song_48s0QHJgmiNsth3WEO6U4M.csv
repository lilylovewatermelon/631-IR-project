this town is colder now i think its sick of us
its time to make our move im shaking off the rust
ive got my heart set on anywhere but here
im staring down myself counting up the years
steady hands just take the wheel
and every glance is killing me
time to make one last appeal for the life i lead

chorus
stop and stare
i think im moving but i go nowhere
yeah i know that everyone gets scared
but ive become what i cant be oh
stop and stare
you start to wonder why youre here not there
and youd give anything to get whats fair
but fair aint what you really need
oh can you see what i see

verse 2
theyre trying to come back all my senses push
untie the weight bags i never thought i could
steady feet dont fail me now
im gonna run til you cant walk
something pulls my focus out
and im standing down
