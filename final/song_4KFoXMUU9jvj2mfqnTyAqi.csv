you cant abide my showing fatigue
when you come home just to relay
all the events that made your heart bleed
and the ones that ruined your day

prechorus
were not as close
as everybody thinks
in the eye of the storm
oh we keep each other warm

chorus
love on the rocks
youd do anything for a quiet life
love on the rocks
love on the rocks with no ice
love on the rocks
youd do anything for a quiet life
love on the rocks
love on the rocks with no ice

cause our lives just dont correlate

bite our tongues until its too late

were not as close as we always used to be
oh you and me
in the eye of the storm
oh we keep each other warm

love on the rocks
youd do anything for a quiet life

love on the rocks with no ice

youd do anything for a quiet life
