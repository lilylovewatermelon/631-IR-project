all the ladies of the canyon
wearing black to their house parties
crosby stills and nash is playing
wine is flowing with bacardi

prechorus 1
but sometimes girls just want to have fun
the poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

chorus
i bought me a truck in the middle of the night
itll buy me a year if i play my cards right
photofree exits from babys bedside
cause they dont yet know what car i drive
im just tryna keep my love alive
with my bartender hold me all night
bartender our loves alive
baby remember im not drinking wine
but that cherry coke you serve is fine
and our loves sweet enough on the vine
bartender bartttender

verse 2
all the ladies of the canyon
wearing white for their tea parties
playing games of levitation
meditating in the garden
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 163you might also likeprechorus 2
and i love the little games that we play
from the valley to the beach
and when at last the day is done i grab my keys

chorus
i bought me a truck in the middle of the night
itll buy me a year if i play my cards right
photofree exits from babys bedside
cause they dont yet know what car i drive
im just tryna keep my love alive
with my bartender hold me all night
bartender our loves alive
baby remember im not drinking wine
but that cherry coke you serve is fine
and our loves sweet enough on the vine

outro
i bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 mph on pch drive
here to long beach to newport by your side
as they dont yet know where i reside
60 miles from the last place i hide
with my bartttender hold me all night
bartttender keep love alive
