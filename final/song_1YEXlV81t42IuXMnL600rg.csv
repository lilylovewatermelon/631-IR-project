verse 1
feels like i work my hardest when im at my lowest
even unhappy people can have happy moments
even small circles fall when the people you chose are
lookin at you like you owe em that money youre grossin
brief seconds that impacted my life on a huge scale
weigh em like whats wrong and whats right
predictions i predicted often arrive
like they own the place and suffocate thе areas that i thrive
had some disagreemеnts
business model got some cracks thats your biggest weakness
way before i got involved you knew that ship was sinkin
so tellin me to dive in water you wont dip your feet in
tends to make me question you for lots of reasons
keep twistin my words you got some courage i applaud you
tables they turned but was it worth what it cost you
watch and observe lotta concerns in my heart still
angry and hurt got what you earned bein prideful

verse 2
thats so shameful
guess thats what i get for bein faithful
oh you think im soulless cause the banks full
yeah oh you think im heartless cause i made dough
yeah thats so painful
didnt know what you was doin on the downlow
yeah still you out here actin like its my fault
yeah i aint never said i was an angel no
i know myself enough to know what i need
showed your true colors i dont like what i see
story keeps changin i know what that means
know what that means i know what that means
howd you go from bein that somebody i believed
into bein someone doubtin me behind the scenes
cant forgive a sorry that i aint ever received
i mean least you couldve done was gave me an apology but youre so
