someone that i met but i hardly knew
he said that everyone loves a defective heart
hed parted ways with diction this was late last night
he see me getting your affection and it proved he was right
the way i stared off thinking that all was sound
anyone i knew they woulda called me down
you can break my legs you can kick me downstairs
but there aint no getting over joanie halemaier
just let me walk away
ah let me walk away

chorus
and then the place ignite
its in my face and im
behind the bassline

verse two
someone that i knew but i hardly met
told me its hopeless im a slut for the new york times
she made my heart soft worn an aiguillette on her arm
she never been to texas never heard of king kong
and itd been so long since id been suitably high
so we did an airborne settled in for the night
tell me sweetness dont somehow reach your heart
until you fall flat down and you cant wait to start
this is the one cold truth weve all of us known
as i think to myself this could be easy or i could face it alone
you might also likechorus
and then the place ignite
all out of grace and im
behind the basslineembed"
