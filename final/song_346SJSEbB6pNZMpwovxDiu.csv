im sensitive i feel everything i feel everybody
one man standin on two words heal everybody
transformation then reciprocation karma must return
heal myself secrets that i hide buried in these words
death threats ego must die but i let it purge
pacify broken pieces of me it was all a blur
mother cried put they hands on her it was family ties
i heard it all i shouldve grabbed a gun but i was only five
i still feel it weighin on my heart my first tough decision
in the shadows clingin to my soul as my only critic
wheres my faith told you i was christian but just not today
i transformed prayin to the trees god is taking shape
my mothers mother followed me for years in her afterlife
starin at me on back of some buses i wake up at night
loved her dearly traded in my tears for a range rover
transformation you aint felt grief til you felt it sober

chorus beth gibbons
i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself
ooh i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself

verse 2 kendrick lamar
i remember lookin in the mirror knowin i was gifted
only child me for seven years everything for christmas
family ties they accused my cousin did he touch you kendrick
never lied but no one believed me when i said he didnt
frozen moments still holdin on it hard to trust myself
i started rhymin copin mechanisms to lift up myself
talked to my lawyer told me not to be so hard on myself
he has an aura i hope to achieve if i find some help
congratulations made it to be famous still i feel uneasy
water watchin live my life in nature only thing relieves me
spirit guide whisper in my ear tell me that she sees me
did he touch you i said no again still they didnt believe me
mother’s brother said he got revenge for my mother’s face
black and blue the image of my queen that i cant erase
til this day cant look her in the eyes pain is takin over
blame myself you never felt guilt til you felt it sober

i wish i was somebody

verse 3 kendrick lamar
i was never high i was never drunk never out my mind
i need control they handed me some smoke but still i declined
i did it sober sittin with myself i went through all emotions
no dependents except for one let me bring you closer
intoxicated theres a lustful nature that i failed to mention
insecurities that i project sleepin with other women
whitneys hurt the purest soul i know i found her in the kitchen
askin god where did i lose myself and can it be forgiven
broke me down she looked me in my eyes is there an addiction
i said no but this time i lied i knew that i cant fix it
pure soul even in her pain know she cared for me
gave me a number said she recommended some therapy
i asked my momma why she didnt believe me when i told her no
i never knew she was violated in chicago im sympathetic
told me that she feared it happened to me for my protection
though it never happened she wouldnt agree
now im affected twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
amplified as i write this song i shiver cause im nervous
i was five questioning myself lone for many years
nothings wrong just results on how them questions made me feel
i made it home seven years of tour chasin manhood
but whitneys gone by time you hear this song she did all she could
all those women gave me superpowers what i thought i lacked
i pray our children dont inherit me and feelings i attract
a conversation not bein addressed in black families
the devastation hauntin generations and humanity
they raped our mothers then they raped our sisters
then they made us watch then made us rape each other
psychotic torture between our lives we aint recovered
still livin as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
every other brother has been compromised
i know the secrets every other rapper sexually abused
i see em daily buryin they pain in chains and tattoos
so listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
learn how he cope whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
his anger grows deep in misogyny
this is posttraumatic black families and a sodomy today is still active
so i set free myself from all the guilt that i thought i made
so i set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
so i set free my cousin chaotic for my mothers pain
i hope hykeem made you proud cause you aint die in vain
so i set free the power of whitney may she heal us all
so i set free our children may good karma keep them with god
so i set free the hearts filled with hatred keep our bodies sacred
as i set free all you abusers this is transformation
chorus beth gibbons
i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself
ooh i wish i was somebody
anybody but myself

interlude whitney alford
you did it im proud of you
you broke a generational curse
say thank you dad
thank you daddy thank you mommy thank you brother
