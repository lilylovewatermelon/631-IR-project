they started out blue like an east tennessee june sky
full of smalltown innocence
guarded by a picket fence
perfect til i drove by
you were lookin for a way out and i was on my way
girl once you love a cowboy youll never be the same
i know right now you think this is it
but im gonna leave you with

chorus
neon eyes
dollarinajukebox heartache
drinkin off a dive bar highway
thick smoke soaked up in tequila
told you id leave you with neon eyes
dancin with a ghost on thе dance floor
never rеally gettin what you came for
lonely lips sippin on a margarita
girl id hate to see you with neon eyes

verse 2
right now theyre glowin like the cigarette we just sparked
aw but ive seen this scene before
like the lights on a liquor store
pretty soon theyll go dark
i know youre tired of all the same shit
thats why you think you want this
i can show you firsthand girl what you wish youda missed
but if you wont take it from me
i guess youre gonna have to see through

drinkin off a dive bar highway
thick smoke soaked up in tequila
told you id leave you with neon eyes
dancin with a ghost on the dance floor
never really gettin what you came for
lonely lips sippin on a margarita
girl id hate to see you with neon eyes
neon eyes

bridge
i dont wanna be the one to say i told you so
just let me push you away before you get too close
i cant go and make up your mind
and i dont wanna be the reason behind those

chorus
neon eyes
dollarinajukebox heartache
drinkin off a dive bar highway
thick smoke soaked up in tequila
told you id leave you with neon eyes
dancin with a ghost on the dance floor
never really gettin what you came for
lonely lips sippin on a margarita
girl id hate to see you with neon eyes
