if you said it and said it clearly it would be heard by me
if you felt it felt it in your heart
if your mind inside was like mine you would find and see me
you would be welcome in my dreams you would be welcome

verse 2
we have argued til we are black and blue
nothing to say this is what i tell you
happiness is as freedom it is welcome
if you saw this you would know this is the truth

verse 3
all of your hopes inside are lonesome without me inside of you
i feel the world calling  i will wait for you
ohh how you are dear to me
if you knew this you would see this is the truth
you would be welcomed in my dreams you would be welcome
yeah
