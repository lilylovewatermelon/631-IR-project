you take the dark and carve me out a home
i picture you when you are all alone
i know how we got here
i know how we got here
i am the shadow youre a passenger
i am the intake of breath so sharp and i know you better
just want to know you better

chorus
if you want to give
then give me all that you can give
all your darkest impulses
and if you want to give me anything then give
give in again

verse 2
ill tear the fibre from the filament
ill be the limit of your light again
i want to taste you better
i want to taste you better
i will be watching for your enemies
to let them know that they contend with me
i want to know youre out there
i want to know youre out there

if you want to give
then give me all that you can give
all your darkest impulses and
if you want to give me anything
then give give in again
i just want to give
want to give you all that i can give
all my darkest impulses
if you want to give me anything then give
give in again

bridge
in this open warfare
i wont fight fair
no i wont fight fair
and in your waking moments
i will be there
i will be there

chorus
if you want to give
then give me all that you can give
all your darkest impulses
and if you want to give me anything then give
give in again
i just want to give
want to give you all that i can give
all my darkest impulses
if you want to give me anything then give
give in againembed"
