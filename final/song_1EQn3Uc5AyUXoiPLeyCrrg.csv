elevator buttons and morning air
strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs
seems like theres always someone who disapproves
theyll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jurys out but my choice is you

chorus
so dont you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the waters rough
but this love is ours

verse 2
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i dont care cause right now youre mine
and youll say

chorus
dont you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the waters rough
but this love is ours
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
and its not theirs to speculate if its wrong and
your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
will be ignored cause my heart is yours

chorus
so dont you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
and dont you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they cant take whats ours
they cant take whats ours
the stakes are high the waters rough
but this love is ours20embed"
