go

verse 1
stapled shut inside an outside world and im
sealed in tight bizarre but right at home
im claustrophobic closing in
and im catastrophic not again
im smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
i wear you like a stain yet im the one whos obscene
catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
ive got no time to lose im just caught up in all the cattle

prechorus
fray the strings
throw the shapes
hold your breath
listen

chorus
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that

im ripped across the ditch
and settled in the dirt and i
wear you like a stitch
yet im the one whos hurt
pay attention to your
twisted little indiscretions
ive got no right to win
im just caught up in all the battles

prechorus
locked in clutch
pushed in place
hold your breath
listen

chorus
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
bridge
my end it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road
and my end it justifies my means
all i ever do is delay
my every attempt to evade
the end of the road

chorus
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
i am a world before i am a man
i was a creature before i could stand
i will remember before i forget
before i forget that
