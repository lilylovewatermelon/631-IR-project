like back when a nigga was clockin

verse 1
see nowadays it seems like everybody wanna be killers
gorillas gettin high off their weed and liquor
you die quicker paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
you get pronounced dead at 4 to the hospital
stop frontin when you know you wont pull nothin
first nigga to retreat when the tools bustin
playin with death is bad for your health
all your homeboys gone you the last one left
now they hearts beatin but these niggas be scared
the real ones are all locked up or dead
nowadays you cant find a good connect
but if you do you might be the feds so

chorus
i dont know you you dont know me
you dont know the history i got on these streets
only if you see what my eyes have seen
then youll understand why im surrounded by gs
if you owe me or we got beef
i recommend you reach for your heat and dont freeze
pause for a minute guarantee you gon bleed
cause thats how we was raised growin up in these streets
see akon liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likeinterlude
go gangsta keep boppin
rock with me lets get this bitch poppin
go gangsta keep boppin
like back when a nigga was clockin

verse 2
see its hard to be good but easy to do evil
and i aint really into meetin with new people
just put the money in the bag and ill leave you
the weed coke lambo or evisu
you make a hundred dollars to the streets you made a g
when you coppin os they swearin you move kis
feds gettin close and the rats seein cheese
and they tryna find them birds not the ones that sleep in trees
we got that bird we got that blue
you want short skirts we got that too
whatever you need my nigga show me the cheese
and baby you can believe that we can make that brew

chorus
i dont know you you dont know me
you dont know the history i got on these streets
only if you see what my eyes have seen
then youll understand why im surrounded by gs
if you owe me or we got beef
i recommend you reach for your heat and dont freeze
pause for a minute guarantee you gon bleed
cause thats how we was raised growin up in these streets

streets been watchin and they dont blink
sidewalk got ears the pavement dont sleep
the fittest will survive the weak just dont eat
everybody in between just gettin a rap sheet
the streets been watchin and they dont blink
sidewalk got ears the pavement dont sleep
the fittest will survive the weak just dont eat
everybody in between just gettin a rap sheet
