i dont miss you
til the moment when i flip off the lights and im in this room
going back in space and time when were still kissin
and now it hurts i know youre somewhere out there still existing
this shits persistent

prechorus
cause you split my world in two
now im half the one you knew
and i know that we got different views

chorus
but were lookin at the same moon oohooh oohooh oohooh ooh ooh
wonder if you miss me too when were lookin at the same moon oohooh oohooh oohooh ooh ooh
how can i be dead to you when were lookin at the same moon

verse 2
are you lonely
are you movin on quick  i hope youre healin slowly
and that your nights they hurt like mine cause im not sleepin
im just talkin with your ghost and dancin with your demons
and theyre not leavin

prechorus
cause you split my world in two
now im half the one you knew
and i know that we got different views
