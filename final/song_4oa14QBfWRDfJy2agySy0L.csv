something always brings me back to you
it never takes too long
no matter what i say or do
ill still feel you here til the moment im gone

verse 2
you hold me without touch
you keep me without chains
i never wanted anything so much
than to drown in your love and not feel your rain

chorus
set me free leave me be
i dont wanna fall another moment into your gravity
here i am and i stand
so tall just the way im supposed to be
but youre on to me and all over me

verse 3
oh you loved me cause im fragile
when i thought that i was strong
but you touch me for a little while
and all my fragile strength is gone

chorus
set me free leave me be
i dont wanna fall another moment into your gravity
here i am and i stand
so tall just the way im supposed to be
but youre on to me and all over me

i live here on my knees
as i try to make you see
that youre everything i think i need here on the ground
but youre neither friend nor foe
though i cant seem to let you go
the one thing that i still know is that youre keeping me down
youre keeping me down yeah yeah yeah yeah
youre on to me on to me and all over

outro
something always brings me back to you
it never takes too long30embed"
