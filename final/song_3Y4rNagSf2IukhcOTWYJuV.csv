cold seems crippling
lame meander through corridors
aromas thick with age
mark off the day

refrain
reflections of my life are fading
pull me out of body
dont want it
dont want in
feeble frail and rotting
descending
im lost in a structure
thats collapsing
dont want it
cast into
maker take the body
dont want it wants me

verse 2
past has found its place
salvation is no more
will god accept my peace
bleach will pardon me
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likerefrain
reflections of my life are fading
pull me out of body
dont want it
dont want in
feeble frail and rotting
descending
im lost in a structure
thats collapsing
dont want it
cast into
maker take the body
dont want it wants me

chorus 1
i just want to run
fly kites wrestle jump and play
swim through waves that crash to shore
memories in me cocooned in misery

bridge
im sick and tired
of embracing reflections of past time
receive me or cast me away
god please take me away
resistance futile suicidal ideas
i will crucify my own being
satisfy selfish needs fuck the deities
justify my own right to whats waiting for me
on the other side the time has come
lock and load
im coming im coming
im coming im coming
im coming im coming
im coming home
prechorus
pull me out of body
dont want it dont want in
pull me out of body
dont want it dont want in
pull me out of body
dont want it dont want in
feeble frail and rotting
descending
im lost in a structure
thats collapsing
descending dont want it
maker take the body
dont want it dont want in

chorus 1
i just want to run
fly kites wrestle jump and play
swim through waves that crash to shore
memories in me cocooned in misery

chorus 2
the darkness overcomes
soul soars to the other plane
existence past the door
i sail through purgatorys bay
outro
i asked a god for poison cradle me
sown to my dreams souls searching
death blossoms where clouds lie over me
held in gods hands death blooming

dark for fear of failure
an inner gloom as wide as an eye and fermenting
roiling hate
death grip in my veins
unveiling rancid petals flowering forth foul nectar
the space between a blink and a tear
death blooms2embed"
