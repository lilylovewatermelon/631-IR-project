you keep me wrapped around your finger
wrapped around your finger
i was caught up in your orbit spinnin like a bullet
i was wrapped around your finger wrapped around your finger
then i shot back down to earth

verse 1
i can’t call you right now i been drinking
and i know that ill say what im thinking
my whole life i was drawn to the deep end
when will it sink in
why do i tell myself that i’ll do the best i can
i know damn well that you couldnt give a damn
ten billion cuties that think im the man
but if you come around ill be eatin out your hand

chorus
keep me wrapped around your finger
wrapped around your finger
i was caught up in your orbit spinnin like a bullet
i was wrapped around your finger wrapped around your finger
then i shot back down to earth shot back down to earth
i keep wondering whos thе one replacing me
takе me back to yesterday
when i was wrapped around your finger
wrapped around your finger
then was shot back down to earth shot back down to earth

when we met you aint know i was a singer
you weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers so icy
i had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky my pinky
if ida known what it’d be like now
i wouldnt be in misery right now
look in the mirror i dont see myself
being with me has gotta be like hell
so tell the devil ima be right down

chorus
you keep me wrapped around your finger
wrapped around your finger i was caught up in your orbit
spinnin’ like a bullet spinnin like a bullet
i was wrapped around your finger wrapped around your finger
then i shot back down to earth shot back down to earth
i keep wondering whos the one replacing me oh

when i was wrapped around your finger
wrapped around your finger
then was shot back down to earth shot back down to earth
