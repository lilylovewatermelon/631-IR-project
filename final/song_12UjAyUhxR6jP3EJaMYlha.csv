or nothing i can say
just what i want to anyway
and i dont care just what people may say
and if i if i take a notion
the jumpoff into the ocean
aint nobodys bizness if i do
and if i go to church on sunday
then cabaret all day monday
it aint nobodys bizness if i do

if my baby aint got no money
and i say take all of mine honey
aint nobodys bizness if i do
if i give my baby my last nickle o
and it leaves me leaves me in a pickle
it aint nobodys bizness if i do
id rather from my baby to hit me
then to jump off and quit me
aint nobodys bizness if i do
nobodys bizness if i doyou might also likeembed"
