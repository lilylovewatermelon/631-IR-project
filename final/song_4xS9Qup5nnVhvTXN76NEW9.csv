i notice everything
but lack the voice to tell you what i see
this permamute is driving me crazy
youd fall for anything
a place to sleep a home to call your own
when youre up all night
you repeat on the phone

chorus
lets get away
drive out in the rain
lets get away
climb inside my brain

verse 2
you say youll never sing
punishing the one who made you whole
lacking perfection isnt good at all
dont treat me like a king
hang me like the sinner that i am
your words repeat in my head
like you give a damn

chorus
lets get away
drive out in the rain
lets get away
climb inside my brainyou might also likeembed"
