theres two angels sittin on my shoulders
all they ever do is disagree
one sits on the side of rhyme and reason
the other on the reckless side of me

well ive been known to gamble on a long shot
leave my better judgment on the rocks
when it comes to takin sides or takin chances
theres a part of me that didnt come to talk

theres two angels sittin on my shoulders
all they ever do is disagree
one sits on the side of rhyme and reason
the other on the reckless side of me

ive spent a lifetime listening to the whispers
always try to heed my second mind
never done nobody wrong on purpose
but ive come mighty close a couple of times

theres two angels sittin on my shoulders
all they ever do is disagree
one sits on the side of rhyme and reason
the other on the reckless side of me

all they ever do is disagree
one sits on the side of rhyme and reason
the other on the reckless side of me

theres two angels sittin on my shoulders
all they ever do is disagree
one sits on the side of rhyme and reason
the other on the reckless side of meembed"
