waking up here in your arms
i feel like a queen in your kingsize bed
the suns lightin up your face in the dark
and i see the wheels turnin in your head

chorus
think youre the one thats gonna turn me around
give me a ring and settle me down
got a little old on me dont get me wrong
but baby my heart runs wild and free
you gotta know fore you fall for me
like a feather in the wind i could be gone
you dont give a rock to a rolling stone

verse 2
a home to you is a handeddown farm
little house on the back of your grandpas land
home to me is this old guitar
yeah a country song and a beatup van

chorus
think youre the one thats gonna turn me around
give me a ring and settle me down
got a little old on me dont get me wrong
but baby my heart runs wild and free
you gotta know fore you fall for me
like a feather in the wind i could be gone
you dont give a rock to a rolling stone

aint got a thing to do with love
i was born to roll like a tumbleweed does
and i belong to a long highway
and there it goes callin my name
callin my name
callin my name

chorus
think youre the one thats gonna turn me around
give me a ring and settle me down
got a little old on me dont get me wrong
but baby my heart runs wild and free
you gotta know fore you fall for me
like a feather in the wind i could be gone
you dont give a rock to a rolling stone
no you dont give a rock to a rolling stoneembed"
