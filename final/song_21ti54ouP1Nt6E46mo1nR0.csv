but i sneak between the lines
dead heads mime make a ill sign
hot teeth shine
while the freaks pump their behinds
the fantastic kill mind hacker
in it rockin the spot
red eye slot
ready to shoot it up
while the mainstream seenex team screams
and seems stupider getting progressively stupider
pity the warrior media terrorist
on some who got skills kill
if you not ill
with a hole in your pocket
like young dumb bum boom fucks
kak to nostril
i do not kill em back with a bang like the real deal
not a fashion flash in the pan
on a spill thrill
i stand still with my dick in my hand
mc totally rad im big in japan

electrical boom
808
pressure pushing pushing
no kushehsheh
the two stairees jump for un still for the fun
high off the fun like come shake the bum
two weeks on zen and i been
smiley on the weekend
sheepskin 
sticky street corners and the smoke infested
i love to skip school from hopping fences

the nazis didnt lose the war
thats a lie
no no they didnt lose
they just swapped sides
now there a lot more advanced with lot more money to spend
a lot more invisible
just like me
f u c to the k t h e u s a
g o v e r n m e n t
empty vessels possessed by demons
spineless evil
wars arent won on the battlefield theyre won in the minds of the poeple
neck jerk so head hurt rock on
like the realevolutionnetworkcom
pay dues a brave new world gone wrong
i came to play you one strong song
hook
sticky stepping 2d too many dumbfucks 8bit 16 color
32 emotional states kickflip preset my hoverboard
program device gettin closer to the motherboard
matchstick medum bumps upon a female
joy sent through in between email
siamese connect to a pitch rising sun chip controls it
the deed undid
swing low instantly the sweat drop drip bug eye big eye
watch fiberoptic overload my head crown

which bigbadscumbag to bring down today huh
comiomensup
which bigbadscumbag to bring down today huh
come blend in blend in
which bigbadscumbag to bring down today

what’s that distant rumbling
guess who’s coming through thunderin
back on the scene
rocking his black comedy
for all my little underlings
the fully posable mimic is a disposable gimmick
flips his manipulative quotable lyric
that gets all up in your shit like a grudge
when i speak i freak intense sentences like a judge
don’t mess around
nobody can hold me back
when i blow up in your face like a faulty gat
come on girl
let me see you work that booty to the beat
like a salty crack
we’re here to motivate there’s no debate
you’re overweight
mc sounds silly
trumpets sound
walls come tumbling down
cuz her waist is so skinny
what you doing man youve released a ghost
youve got company
it’s a parasite be the host
now you want me to stop
but fuck it i love it
open the cupboard
open the cupboard
upon from within all over you like skins
i look forward to our next match
ill let you stay alive for now but not if i see you again
spoek mathambo
team fantastic kill

do your best

youre a thoroughbred girl a thoroughbred

dj fuck
bitches aint shit but hoes and tricksembed"
