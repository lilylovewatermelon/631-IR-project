in somebody elses lake

you dream about going up there
but that is a big mistake

just look at the world around you
right here on the ocean floor

such wonderful things surround you
what more is you looking for

under the sea under the sea
darlin its better
down where its wetter
take it from me

up on the shore they work all day
out in the sun they slave away

while we devotin
full time to floatin
under the sea

down here all the fish is happy
as off through the waves day roll
you might also likethe fish on the land aint happy
they sad cause theyre in a bowl

but fish in the bowl is lucky
theyre in for a worser fate

one day when the boss gets hungry
guess whos goin be on the plate uhoh

under the sea under the sea
nobody beats us
fry us and eat us in fricasee

we what the land folks love to cook
under the sea we off the hook

we got no troubles life is the bubbles

under the sea under the sea
since life is sweet here
we got the beat here naturally

even the strugeon an the ray
they get the urge an start to play

we got the spirit
you got to hear it under the sea
the newt play the flute
the carp play the harp
the plaice play the bass
and theyre soundin sharp
the bass play the brass
the chub play the tub
the fluke is the duke of soul
yeah

they ray he can play
he lings on the strings
he trout rockin out
the blackfish she sings
the smelt and the sprat
they know where its at
an oh that blowfish blow

under the sea under the sea
under the sea under the sea

when the sardine
begin the beguine its music to me

what do they got a lot of sand
we got a hot crustacean band
each little clam here
know how to jam here under the sea

each little slug here
cutin a rug here under the sea

each little snail here
know how to wail here
thats why its hotter under the water
ya we in luck here
down in the muck here under the seaembed"
