im like nine minutes away from finishing my nine hour shift
and wishin i was gone nine hours ago
cause nine hours wasted tossin back of this chicken
i coulda written nine verses just in time for the show
slacker mindstate livin on time thats borrowed
my mottos ill stop procrastinatin tomorrow
i took the sorrow from the windchimes left happiness lonesome
and strung up sarcasm to make the melody wholesome
from my lungs to my feet im breathin everything i speak
and now they chargin for oxygen and the bills due next week
ill be a day late and a buck short story of my life
i wish my pay rate was much more duckin swords in the rat race
i didnt apply for runnin’ towards something thats fake
and thinkin’ why for they shuttin’ doors right in my face
and sittin’ high horse is a car and a dope place
somethin’ to die for this is my war so

hook
now im schemin on plots to make my pockets swell
simple livin is a bitch but damn i do it well
some are fortunate to make it and some of em fail
some locomotives push through and some of em get derailed
schemin on plots hey hey
simple livin’ is a bitch hey hey
some are fortunate to make it hey hey
some locomotors push through hey hey

i lead a crocodile mile lifestyle i run and slide
but when its time to collide with the bump i always bail
cause im not ready for that dive or that silly nine to five
solidified career option a hop skip and a leap
away from rock star and not too far away from fillin pops shoes
the idyllic hard workin type of calloused hands
complete with wife kids dog house and picket fence thats nonsense
im convinced im built for better things
and wont settle for the empty smile that cheddar brings
it seems like im workin hard simply cause its what they say i have to do
you graduate and then you either get a job or you go to school
12 years wasnt enough
thats more than half of my life spent tryin to make the world accept me
plus ive got the papers saying that i made it through
now im working 2 jobs 3 with music and you dont respect me
fuck it ill retire now youll work until youre 62 and

now im schemin on plots to make my pockets swell
simple livin is a bitch but damn i do it well
some are fortunate to make it and some of em fail
some locomotives push through and some of em get derailed
schemin on plots hey hey
simple livin’ is a bitch hey hey
some are fortunate to make it hey hey
some locomotors push through hey heyembed"
