dont tell me to stop
tell the rain not to drop
tell the wind not to blow
cause you said so mmm
tell the sun not to shine
not to get up this time no no
let it fall by the way
but dont leave me where i lay down

chorus
tell me love isnt true
its just something that we do
tell me everything im not
but please dont tell me to stop

verse 2
tell the leaves not to turn
but dont ever tell me ill learn no no
take the black off a crow
but dont tell me i have to go
tell the bed not to lay
like the open mouth of a grave yeah
not to stare up at me
like a calf down on its knees
