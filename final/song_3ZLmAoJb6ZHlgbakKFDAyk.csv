verse 1 andre 3000  gwen stefani
hisher skin wasnt the same color as mine
but shehe was fine heshe was fine
if all men are made equal then

up until the time we went out on a date
i was fine i was fine
now im getting dirty looks i wonder what theyd say
if we were blind we were blind people

beauty is beauty whether its black or white
yellow or green baby you know what i mean
what if picasso only used one color
there shouldnt be a rule how to choose your lover
lovers in love is such a wonderful thing
maybe in time well get together and sing
i really hope so theres nothing wrong with this picture
we go a long way to go we gotta get there quick
ooohh

outro martin luther king juniors i have a dream speech
that all men are created equal
children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by
by the color of their skin but but by the content of their character
this will be the day when all gods children
will be able to sing with a new meaning
not only that8embed"
