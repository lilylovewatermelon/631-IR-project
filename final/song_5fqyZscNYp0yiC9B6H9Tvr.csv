youre sittin’ pretty in your sky blue dress
right here beside me on our back deck
watchin you watchin that sunset ain’t it beautiful
mmm nah we aint gotta take a round trip flight
we can operate on gulph coast time
just sit back and put your hand in mine
baby we can go to mexico

chorus
in our minds
on this tennessee saturday night
actin like this bud light is a corona and lime
and this green grass is that sand so white
all that you gotta do is close your eyes
and come a little closer if you wanna go to mexico
mexico in our minds

verse 2
well play some buffet on the stereo
take off your shoes show them pretty pink toes
thats how they dance down there you know its so beautiful
mmm well pretend that when them trucks go by
thats just the sound of that rollin’ tide
let’s tell this little town adiós
girl we can go to mexico

in our minds
on this tennessee saturday night
actin like this bud light is a corona and lime
and this green grass is that sand so white
all that you gotta do is close your eyes
and come a little closer if you wanna go to mexico
mexico in our minds
we can get there is no time in our minds

outro
yeah i got a bottle of cheap tequila
stashed in the back of a drawer
if we need to get out of this town
we can take a sip and head on out
to mexico mexico in our minds
baby in our minds
take a trip in no time in our minds
