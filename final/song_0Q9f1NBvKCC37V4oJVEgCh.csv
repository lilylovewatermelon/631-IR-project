the sun is gone and the flowers rot
words are spaces between us
and i should have been drowned
in the rivers i found of token lost
and i should have been down
when you made me insecure

chorus
so break me down if it makes you feel right
and hate me now if it keeps you all right
oh you can break me down if it takes all your might
because im so much more
than meets the eye

verse 2
and im the one you can never trust
because wounds are ways to reveal us
and yeah i could have tried
and devoted my life to both of us
but what a waste of my time
when the world we have is yours

chorus
so break me down if it makes you feel right
and hate me now if it keeps you all right
oh you can break me down if it takes all your might
because im so much more
than all your lies
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likebridge
hate me break me down
so break me down down
so break me down

chorus
so break me down if it makes you feel right
and hate me now if it keeps you all right
oh you cant break me down if it takes all your might
because im so much more
than meets the eye9embed"
