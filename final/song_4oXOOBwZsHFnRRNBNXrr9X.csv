they say life is so much sweeter
through the telephoto lens of fame
around here you get just as much attention
cheerin at the high school football game
i dreamed of goin to nashville
put my money down and place my bet
but i just got the first buck of the season
i made the front page of the turner town gazette

chorus
every last one route one rural hearts got a story to tell
every grandma inlaw exgirlfriend
maybe knows you just a little too well
whether youre late for church or youre stuck in jail
hey words gonna get around
everybody dies famous in a small town

verse 2
tyler and casey broke up
it ended pretty quietly
we heard he was caught redhanded with her mama
so thats just what they let us all believe

chorus
every last one route one rural hearts got a story to tell
every grandma inlaw exgirlfriend
maybe knows you just a little too well
whether youre late for church or youre stuck in jail
hey words gonna get around
everybody dies famous in a small town
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebridge
baby who
needs their faces in a magazine
me and you
weve been stars of the town since we were seventeen

verse 4
lets go on down to the quick stop
wear your yellow shades and ill put on my tight jeans
and well just spend the weekend burnin rubber
and well let em point and stare in disbelief

chorus
cause every last one route one rural hearts got a story to tell
every grandma inlaw exgirlfriend
maybe knows you just a little too well
whether youre late for church or youre stuck in jail
hey words gonna get around
everybody dies famous in a small town
everybody dies famous in a small town2embed"
