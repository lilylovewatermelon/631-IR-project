you youd fall in love with anyone
i think youd fall in love with anyone
who fell in love with you
and they frequently do
so take comfort
cruel comfort
before you start to wonder
how you got locked inside your room

chorus
and how long will it
take before you start to hate yourself and go
straight to the arms of someone else and ill just
wait til those arms belong to me and im not
saying that you love me
im not saying any
thing

verse 2
tell me do you let them down gently
does it only make it harder
to let the feeling linger
to drag it out a little longer
does it put your mind at ease
but youre the one who brought em here
youre the one who has to take em when you leave
