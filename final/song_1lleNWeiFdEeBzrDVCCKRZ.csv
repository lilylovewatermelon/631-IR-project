take this down turn it around
i am water underneath a bridge
so what do i know
getting here must be a privilege
should say something meaningful
if at all just to fill the air
or believe i adore you
love you if i dare

chorus
by chance when i turn out the light
im finding the right line
by chance i could put this to right
not in the rest of this lifetime

verse 2
let it slide always inside
isnt worth the indecision i hide
so nowhere to go
stimulating no illusion
i should say something pivotal
belittle how you let me down
or believe i adore you
love me if you dare

by chance when i turn out the light
im finding the right line
by chance i could put this to right
not in the rest of this lifetime no no

bridge
look at you going places
see two faces
i know which to trace
i would be holding my breath
but things will stay the same wont they
oh i know

chorus
by chance when i turn out the light
im finding the right line
by chance i could put this to right
not in the rest of this lifetime
by chance when i turn out the light
im finding the right line
by chance i could put this to right
not in the rest of this lifetime
by chance when i turn out the light
im finding the right line
by chance i could put this to right
not in the rest of this lifetime not no
outro
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it out
take it down turn it round
tell me we can work it outembed"
