once i had me a woman
everything was goin my way
she thought i had hung the moon
and she had an angels face
til one night i pulled in my drive
and somethin was goin on
there was a long bed ford in my spot
that i damn sure didnt own
i walked up to the screen door
and i heard this awful noise
i moved on to the living room and there sat my two boys
i said wheres mama
and they both pointed to the bedroom down the hall
now i aint ever been a fightin man
but red was all i saw

chorus
see brother cause ive been down and ive been out
and i know how it feels
to stand up for what you think is right
then get knocked off your heels
and if murderin a man who didnt understand
just what she meant to me
means ill rot here in this cell for eternity
well then mister im as guilty as can be
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeverse 2
well i wish i had me a picture of what his face looked like
when i kicked in my bedroom door and raised my 45
i said aint the kind to hurt a woman and i hope you understand
but somebodys got to die today
son it looks like youre the man

chorus
see brother cause ive been down and ive been out
and i know how it feels
to stand up for what you think is right
then get knocked off your heels
and if murderin a man who didnt understand
just what she meant to me
means ill rot here in this cell for eternity
well then mister im as guilty as can be

bridge
thats what i told that jury
thats what i told that judge
and i knew thered be hell to pay if i fulfilled my grudge
see i dont mind these prison bars tucked off in these pine trees
one thing about that cheatin woman
she wont cheat again on me

chorus
see brother cause ive been down and ive been out
and i know how it feels
to stand up for what you think is right
then get knocked off your heels
and if murderin a man who didnt understand
just what she meant to me
means ill rot here in this cell for eternity
well then mister im as guilty as can be
i said if murderin a man who didnt understand
just what she meant to me
means ill rot here in this cell for eternity
well then mister im as guilty as can be
outro
go ahead and lock me up boys
im guilty anywaysembed"
