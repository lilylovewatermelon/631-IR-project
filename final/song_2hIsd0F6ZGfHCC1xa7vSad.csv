each time you fall in love
its clearly not enough
you sleep all day and drive out in la
it isnt safe
and each time you kiss a girl
you never know what its worth
you say all of the words they wanna hear
it isnt real

chorus
she took you for a ride in summer baby
lost all your money to her
all i wanna know is if you love her
how come you never give in

verse 2
each time you have a dream
you never know what it means
you see that open road and never know which way to go
and each time you fall in love
its clearly not enough
you sleep all day and drive out in la
it isnt safe

chorus
she took you for a ride in summer baby
lost all your money to her
all i wanna know is if you love her
how come you never give inyou might also like8embed"
