verse 1
as i hopped off the train this shawty caught my eye
i asked her for her name she gave me no reply
she left me standing there with arrows in my heart
but yet and still im wanting her
and later on that week while driving in my car
i coulda sworn i saw that shawty walking out the bar
i thought she glanced at me while i was staring from afar from afar
or is just my young mind wishing

chorus

she keeps on passin me by she keeps on passin me by
maybe her eye is just on some other guy i dont know

verse 2
it gets so confusing this game
i met a lot of girls but never felt this way
i get strange pleasure though from going through this pain
and like a ghost im haunting her
i often fantasize about walking hand in hand walking hand in hand
but i dont know her name or if shes got a man hoo
and the only thing that gives me hope to stay
is maybe one day shell notice me

chorus

she keeps on passin me by she keeps on passin me by
maybe her eye is just on some other guy some other guy oh
and ill forever be that fella on the side
but i dont wanna be on the side baby
