so now we see comes burying my burnt remains
these puddled clouds
oh i i understand now

but darkness falls like shattered pieces
dangling shimmering
torn and tattered yet crowned
oh ill not be told no to no more

you must believe to hear me sing these
messy morsels of my selfassuring love
oh its painful kneading
yes i lie and i wrangle with prospective angles
that glare me down and face me
with all i do wrong
why do they all look like me

chorus
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh
just to prove im alive and its alright
cause tonight theres a way ill make light
of my treacherous life

verse 2
if i had hands id hold up high
my lofty dreams my alibis real name
but i have no strength
you might also likeso i toss and i turn and i spit in the urn
theres a ghost in your eye
there is someone that knows more than i
but im quick to deny

chorus
so i try and i scream and i beg and i sigh
just to prove im alive and its alright
cause tonight theres a way ill make light
of my treacherous life
