i left my fear behind me
of those lights out by the station
the government is lying
the youth they wont believe them

chorus
we cant go wrong cant get
fucked this time
speak up now lose or get
left behind

verse 2
when will this be over
this cold and bitter season
the government is lying
the truth is found with reason

chorus
we cant go wrong cant get
fucked this time
speak up now lose or get
left behind

we cant go wrong cant get
fucked this time
speak up now lose or get
left behind

all forgotten kids who made it
