i only brought her trouble since the day she met me
if i was her by now i would have left me
i would have walked away
but now ive broken away
somehow instead she forgave me
she said a womans got to do what shes got to do
even if it means she denied herself the truth
cause when youre in too deep you wake up when its too late
youve fallen in love in the worst way
and if you dont go now then youll stay
cause ill never let you leave never let you breathe
cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me

so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
but still she stays
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likeshes standing in the heart of darkness
saying i know you got a soul even though youre heartless
how could any woman in their right mind be so blind
to find something this safe
instead of walking with me she should have walked away

she finds color in the darkest places
she finds beauty in the saddest of faces
for such a clued in headstrong city girl
couldve had the world but shes fallen in love in the worst way
and if you dont go now then youll stay
cause ill never let you leave never let you breathe
cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me

so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
but still she stays
oh yeah
but still she stays
oh yeah
i dont know why shes with me
i only brought her trouble since the day she met me
if i was her by now i would have left me
i would have walked away

but youve fallen in love in the worst way
and if you dont go now then youll stay
cause ill never let you leave never let you breathe
cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me

so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
so walk away
walk away
walk away oh
save yourself from the heartache oh
go now before its too late
but still she stays
