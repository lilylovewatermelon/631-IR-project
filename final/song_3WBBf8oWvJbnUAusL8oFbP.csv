every morning the last couple of weeks
in between shaving and brushing my teeth
id lean on the sink and practice my lines
by now you would think theyd be memorized

verse 2
but leave it to me to come all this way
get down on one knee and forget what to say
im at a loss should have known this is how it would be
because you have that effect on me

verse 3
i must admit i still dont understand
why i lose my head holding your hand
theres no explanation no simple excuse
for this intoxication i feel around you

verse 4
and now truth be known since ive met you girl
ive been walking around in my own little world
one look in my eyes and darling any fool could see
that you have that effect on me

verse 5
youve had your eyes on a two carat ring
i finally went out and i bought it
right now its at home sitting on my tv
would you believe i forgot it
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 6
but you cant blame me because its plain to see
that you have that effect on me
yeah you have that effect on me
girl you have that effect on meembed"
