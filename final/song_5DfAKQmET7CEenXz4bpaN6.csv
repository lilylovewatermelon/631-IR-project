album on hold whole world on hold
the crowd is like ho operators like hold please hold
man now aint that cold
im just tryin to talk to my homie thats up in the hole
and homegirl not tryin to be a ho even though she on a pole
can she get a second chance no
whoa like the opposite of go
that aint how its supposed to be or butterfly
but for the sake of rhyming lets just say butterflyee
the truth stings like muhammad ali
i tell em tell em dont homicide me
im just a little old hope with his back against the ropes
fightin for his fans and fightin for his folks
but the boos from the crowd can become so loud
if i can block em out then i could knock em out and
dance around the ring but until then ill sing

hook
ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and its how its gon be
until i get there
till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there
when i get there whoa oh

doctor doctor please the fame aint painless enough
thats cause you aint famous enough
you got a little game but your name aint ringin enough
he said take two of these put some change in my cup
i said i wasnt poor he gave me some more
prescribed me a publicist and pointed to the door
out ouch
im tellin you this all from a therapists couch
tell me about your mother what shes all about
prescribed me a interview and then told me to bounce
damn jeez
the world is so cold im glad i bought these skis
went right off of the bunny slopes and right into the trees
rendered unconscious they rushed me to a concert
instead of green jello and maybe chicken soup
they fed me magazine covers and video shoots

hook
ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and its how its gon be
until i get there
till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there
when i get there whoa oh
verse 3
and when i finally make it ima stunt so hard
evil as knievel ima jump so far
way up in the atmosphere i aint comin back
be a jerk to them jerks yeah thatll make em hurt
huh said a young boy in the mirror
a young version of me so i started to tear up
he said you need to cheer up your mind need to clear up
youre already here just be yourself from here up
then he disappeared and i felt something familiar
somethin i was taught somethin i had lost
if you are afraid or fear that you gon change some
all you gotta do is just remember where you came from

hook
ima keep it cool and ima do me
it is what it is and its how its gon be
until i get there
till i get there
and yeah i got flaws i know im not perfect
but all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
when i get there
when i get there whoa oh9embed"
