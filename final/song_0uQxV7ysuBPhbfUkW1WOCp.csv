say well get married on a porch in vegas
we can get hitched and have a couple of kids
and none of them will look at all like us
and our neighbors all be a bit too much
and youll live out in the desert with a man you never loved

chorus
is this it
what you want
what you wanted
do you need love
am i enough for you
in time youll find ive got my baggage too

verse 2
say well get famous and well die with our names
in every paper every news report as any consolation
to the people that you love and all the people that you hate
but well love you all the same because youre beautiful
say you didnt see it that i saw right through you
say you didnt mean it that i mean nothing to you
like you said
do you believe me
that ill be right for you
refrain
say you love me like you used to

verse 3
we were born splaying in the wreckage
tearing down on birds with stones
i bore my weight upon your shoulders
water as warm as morning suns
i dont think quite like i used to
i got a bed to call my own
i see stars and painted lies
broken glass upon your road
now im driving home too soon

refrain
woah woah
say you love me like you used to

bridge
and well vacation first class
im breaking your fall
youre breaking my ass
youre working all day
hating on all the bitches at work
you say youre okay
youre faking fucked up
youre drinking all day you give me a cup
and ill be damned if we can make it out of this alive baby
i say ill be damned if we can make it out of this alive

but is this what you want
what you wanted
do you need love
am i enough for you
in time youll find ive got my baggage too

verse 4
oh and say well get famous and well die with our names
in every paper every news report as any consolation
to the people that you love and all the people that you hate
but well love you all the same because youre beautiful
say you didnt see it that i saw right through you
say you didnt mean it that i mean nothing to you
like you said do you believe me
that ill be right for you

refrain
say you love me like you used to
woah
say you love me like you used to

hating on all the bitches at work
you say youre okay
youre faking fucked up
drinking all day you give me a cup
and ill be damned if we can make it out of this alive baby
i said ill be damned if we can make it out of this alive
