m fuck the uk
s fuck the monarchy
m fuck tea
s fuck you knowthe weather
m having a prime minister is gay
s and our accents a joke
m daniel we know
s we just covered 99 percent of the angles you wrote
cause when you’re against international opponents you’re never direct with your lines
m instead you rely on every cliché that exemplifies the wellknown nation from where they reside
if we were from the federated states of micronesia the fuck would you say dan
you’d have a terrible time
s you need to stop depending on stereotypes you fat guntoting american guy
m and after recycling his leftovers from deffinition
they’re gonna call us homosexual there’s a given
so we thought we can make this more interesting
and came up with a clever system
every time they say that we are gay and don’t have sex with women
we’ll add another bar to our third round about dan’s dad’s meth addition
you’re both called dan
thanks for the name flip opportunities
s it’s dan and dan
and even the and in dan and dan is an anagram of dan
so really it’s dan and an anagram of dan so really its a dan and nad of dan
aka dan dan dan
m dun dun dun
s dan dan dan
this daniel here is so excited about this
he’s the only person here who has been calling this match great
when he got it confirmed he lifted up caustic like pat stay
m his wife cooked him a big old breakfast this morning with ham steaks
and all four of our faces drawn in the pancakes
s the caption underneath in powdered sugar read “hope you all have a grand day”
m in preparation for today this dude created a mood playlist of tunes and named it “the shufflo vibes”
it’s literally “happy” by pharrell williams duplicated a hundred times
but let’s be real we’re grateful to be on the west coast
you’ve got to laugh most of the battles here today are proper hard
these people here have paid and they want some bars
and somehow us ridiculous comic farts have got the part
at an event in which diz verb and hoffa star
s what the fuck
m yo lush listen
thanks a million but you’re a bad magician but this is not our card
s surely this is a purely big mistake
i bet when you got the flights paid for we knew something was up dude
surely now no one with any money will trust you
i can imagine him and lush sitting just buzzing on mushrooms
as soon as they hit confirm payment they went “the fuck did we just do”
m and caustic what the hell are you doing
you’re battling with dirtbag dan
i think you’ve hit your head you know
you’re battling with dirtbag dan
that’s a bigger risk than wearing those
points to shuffles shoes
did you not see the flyer
did it not click that this was set in stone
i know they call you the career ender i just didn’t think they meant your own
s caustic is so pissed
what the fuck are you doing here mr serious
what were you smoking
i can imagine when the trailer dropped and he watched the whole thing he called up dirt like “oh man i kind of thought you were joking”
m mate you didn’t think this through a damn bit
dan’s shit trust me you can’t lift this human baggage
and you know the kind of shit we pull
just silly kookie antics
fuckin’ immature dramatics
this battle will destroy the image you’ve established
s let’s take your interview with rap grid
you just battled aye verb you said you wanted big t
shit you even hinted moves to patrick
you’re a serious dude and that’s it
m but i guess in a room with dan it’s simple who the man is
s so now you’re battling us
m two nincompoops with wack kicks who sniff the boot and rap sick
s just some kids who grew up acting and switched to do some rapping
m we’re so incredibly overrated there’s no sense in us going places
and all that’s left we’re going to say is
both caustic this is who you’re battling
you might also likeround 1 dirtbag dan and caustic
dd y’all ready
you know what rhymes with marlo and shufflet
c ah no no no
you know what i don’t think we’re gonna do that
dd what the fuck man
go ahead you fuckin’ go
already fuckin’ this shit up go ahead
c yo you wanna know what rhymes with marlo and shufflet
none of y’all can fuck with me
before i murdered verb i was a certified vet
but i’m white and i’m funny so i don’t get any respect
i say fuck that shit
i’m tried way less than verb did in the end
they only book my ass to ruin the integrity of the event
the second he stepped on that stage he was already dead
i saw the bitch in his eyes that’s how i knew i had got in his head
and illmac about to stomp his ass with the pen
and if verb got a problem with what i said tell him to drink some fuckin’ water before you end up in fuckin’ hospital again
bitch
dd hey if you’re gonna get on your verb shit i’ma get on my bird shit
cause y’all both white like bird shit
i’ll get the drop on ‘em like bird shit
you fuck around with me you’ll end up all over the news like bird shit
c yo you keep droppin’ all this bird shit
you’re gonna get the fuckin’ bird flu like verb did
dd fuck that shit
i came to take your head like a trophy t
how it’s supposed to be
watch your british bitch get fucked on cam like sophie dee
i watch porno too right after my wife goes to sleep
c you know you fucked up when you accepted those flights
dd you know how close this is to mexico right
you’ll learn lessons in life if you get through the night
c shit you fuck around with me you’ll get jefferson price’d
dd you know what happened to jefferson price
c he got slapped by that fat bitch and it ended his life
dd marlo’s bitch look just life jefferson’s wife
to fuck he gotta lift the coochie fat
while you’re out of town she got your homies at the place
putting cream on her face like a gucci tat
she barely let you fuck missionary
they got the cameras out and the lights on
filming british movies after she open her snatch they give her the full monty python
c i said i’m good in the hood i know la crooks
they let this british fairy come all the way out to la shook
i choke you in front of everybody i’ll let la look
i’ll put him in that super mega hold
dd whats that
c that’s la looks
dd which one of these fuckers are you talking to
comb over or doctor who
c what the fuck is a doctor who
dd you know fuckin’ doctor who
c doctor who like chinese dude on sauce is doctor who
dd no doctor who it’s a tv show on the bbc dude with the tardis
c there’s a bbb show about a chinese dude who’s retarded
dd no caustic
c if there was i would totally watch it
dd look that’s way off topic stay by us
no i said we’re californian i need you to stay bias
plus we’ve got these big beautiful beards and they’ve got facial hair like fuckin’ gay pirates
hey these faggots think that they invented multis
you come from the wrong scene
c these fuckin’ bizarre dweebs have been fuckin’ with our steez
dd it’s nothing for one of us to… hundreds of long schemes
c but the trouble with that shuffle is what do the bars mean
dd i’m tryin’ to make a sonnet to tug at your heartstrings
you’re trying to force multis some of them aren’t clean
c so if you’re going to take your whole fuckin’ shit from the wrcs
try to limit it to a couple of bars please
round 2 marlo and shufflet
m i loved all that overperforming like fuckin’ acting shit
and i love the fact that in that vlog you said you weren’t practicing
yo soul fuckin’ ko’ed you mate
sorry guys
i know how the past is one thing
but soul mowed down his ass with one swing
thrown out for harmful punching
and if you hear different it’s like music trivia no doubt stefani’s fronting
alright look maybe that day’s a little fuzzy in my memory
s but back at home him exposing jeff is still by some considered treachery
but tell the truth caustic
it meant more than a battle to you when you dumped the shit on jeffy p
m it was nothing personal
he’s just incredibly morally upstanding when it comes to infidelity
s and it’s not just caustic’s performance that causes divorces
he writes down the stuff that you’ve been doing in his book of sins
then tells your girl what you’ve been doing in the bulletin
she starts crying eating straight out of a pudding tin
as he breads her hair like “i said you were too good for him”
m ask any chick in the place
they’ll tell you who’s really the biggest snitch in the game
s it’s not the biggest breakage of the bro code that’s been done
you start hanging around them at first he seems totally fun
then he finds out that one of his homies in love
then he starts wearing a fucking wire when he goes to the club
m then his boy’s telling a story like “so she pouts her cheeks says she’s gonna go down on me”
and then caustic chimes in like
s “whoa that’s sweet say it again just a little bit louder please”
mlook at this fucking guy you must live like a slob i’m sure
you’re the type to order a plasma screen to your crib and set it up on the floor
s i bet you’ve got two microwaves
one that doesn’t work at all
and one that only works when you hold the door
m and dan thinks he’ll be remembered for the lyrics in his tunes
i think that’s really cute
but you’re a long way away from a hit single with some views
so it’s a massive fuckin’ stretch to think that things will look up soon
trying to make that dream work before you’re fishing from the moon
dream work boy fishing from the moon
i just said a bunch of the words i just said in that sentence i just said
s now when you’re up on stage battling saying something amusing
telling the guy that you’re against that he’s ugly and stupid
and you remember you had dreams of being loved for your music
do you ever stop and think to yourself “what the fuck am i doing”
what is proper depressing is when the family dog catches you jackin’ off and you have to sulk like “god i’m pathetic”
m we sent dan a vlog to be used in his podcast
then get this the bit we filmed was dubbed with the wrong stuff
you got us
and then dan was like
s “yeah think you can come on my show and talk that kind of smack to me”
m oh yeah ‘cause with your millions of viewers we would have really caused some damage d
the numbers that watched your show so strongly scared and baffles me
i had to email our original footage to all 12 of them manually
but let’s switch this shit
s it’s the british kids
m english pricks
s home of rizzle kicks little mix wiz and scizz and fish and chips
m really weird things to list but keep going shuffle mate stick with it
s we’re taking over your judicial shit like the american colonies at 1766
you like that random historical reference
m that’s a rhetorical question
s of course it fricking did
we got this in the palm of our handsw e’re just spinning it in our finger tips
m the battle clowns can still hammer down we make standing out our initiative
s so the cali crowd can gather round as the west coast witnesses
the red coats in this flick like the dress code of schindler’s list
round 2 dirtbag dan and caustic
dd i understand
to be a battler these days you don’t need to be a part of the music biz or have any concept of what music is
but where do we draw the line with this stupid shit
there’s a difference between us spitting bars and you two talking in unison
you’re not even battle rappers you’re freeform speech enthusiasts
you’re battle actors tou don’t even fucking rap
you do sketch comedy and you suck at that
don’t flop put you on but off top that’s a bad decision
like one of lush’s hats
c shit at least it wasn’t one of aspect’s fucking uglyass bucket hats
lookin’ like schoolboy tool what the fuck is that
dd nobody’s safe
c i mean honestly i think it’s kinda tight the way shuffle recites his bars
and then marlo comes in and says something kinda smart
but the reality is y’all spend less time apart than pussy lips when vaginas fart
we some veterans believe it so we’re not threatened by your secrets
i mean the delivery’s kind of clever but the setups aren’t as seamless
no wonder your bars always seem to sounds better in a sequence
but whenever you’re not together everyone remembers that you’re english
dd that’s why y’all pale in comparison
no y’all pale in comparison
it’s embarrassing makes me wish i had melanin i could share with ‘em
i tell you what here’s a travel tip
head up to cbs get some suntan lotion smother that shit
make sure you get on baldy’s forehead real good cause his wispyass bangs don’t cover that shit
c marlo’s basically a fuckin’ heretic ‘cause he fuckin’ lies about where his hair exists
if you’re really not embarrassed bitch why don’t you lift up that cheapass toupee and show us where it is
both whoop there it is whoop there it is tag team
dd more travel tips
make sure you collect your miles from that airline when you get back
c and make sure you let the stewardess know that your hairline suffers from jet lag
it looks like your forehead made the trip but your hairline got left back
and no mexico but if you started sweating right now you’d have a wet back
dd at least i’m not going to be a hype man for the rest of my life dawg
it’s ironic marlo’s whiter than a qtip and he’s forever shufflet’s phife dawg
c i’m on my spy vs spy shit
i’ll rig his cell so when he answer his phone it blow up like a side chick
i can see into your future marlo i’m a motherfucking psychic
you lucky that t mobile ‘cause you only known for the sidekick
y’all like the nicole richie and paris type
dd nah the cameron and ferris type
c kinda like a pirate with a parrot type
bottom feeding talent leaching personality parasite
i mean we all know marlos a fucking lame that’s why we only listen to what shuffle’s saying
a marlo battle is like a poker game
if you don’t see a good shuffle it’s not worth playing
c what the fuck does marlo even bring to the table
at least shuffle’s a character
he’s got the bars the charisma the striking good looks
and what has marlo got
dd a fuckin’ free trip to america
aye look
we could go on forever with these marlo bars because everybody likes shuffle more
but it’s getting old playing games with marlo i bet shuffle bored
yo y’all are supposed to be best friends
how many times you tried to fight each other
i feel like me and caustic are better friends and most of the time we don’t even like each other
i still got his back just like a brother
c and i’m down to scrap if dan’s ever got in some trouble
but wait a minute what would it look like if marlo and shuffle ever got in a scuffle
dan and caustic get into a mock fight

round 3 marlo
dissing me for balding blatantly
‘cause you wished that your ginger wife actually shared the same fate as me

shufflet
you’re right i am a speech enthusiast
and it’s never fiction
it’s more like your dad ‘cause when i rap my meth addiction method diction
now lush assured us that we were gonna get plenty of ass on the west coast
m even went as far as to offer us his family members
well since our plane landed you will not believe the action we’re tasting
i met a chick yesterday at  station
her rack was amazing and she was asian
we started chatting away and she asked me back to her place
cause she needed some help getting her mattress inflated
anyway i showed her a picture of my girlfriend and said i’m happily taken
wellmannered brits
she started backing away then gave me a double thumbs up and started randomly waving

shufflet
cali’s amazing
especially when you’re as awesome as this
yesterday went to talk to a chick awkward as shit
four minutes in boring the bitch
but let’s just say the oral was sick
by which i mean she was orally sick
caustic ya prick
you look like you’ve been drawing your beard on with a marker tip
your facial hair is worse than marlo’s is
you look like john turturro in barton fink if he went apple bobbing in a barber’s sink
m hey dan great performance against charlie clips
fucking idiot it was the total opposite
the only bit i liked from that chokathon was this
seven minutes 17 seconds go and watch the clip
you go to bop his fist but he don’t respond with his
so you just hang for a second and drop pathetically like wile e coyote floating off the cliff
sand that rejection probably sent him into seething pain
cause being selfobsessed is in his dna
and guess what america i’m not gonna rhyme that with aaliyah’s plane
why does everybody keep rhyming shit with aaliyah’s plane
that was 13 fucking years ago that scheme is played
stop bringing it up or you’ll be going down

marlo
like aaliyah’s plane
now i didn’t want to be the one to pass the message
but you’re both getting old and you can’t accept it
you still getting on your little skateboards dan
still trying to shred it
you can’t really go on a skateboard anymore can you you’re far too heavy
that’s why i said it
s both of them are trying to grab on to their youthful cheer
dan uses slang he doesn’t know hasn’t been used for years
walks up like “what’s up daddio what’s the scoop in here you guys have been out skateboarding tubular”
m and your music video to “concentrate”
you got that shit popping dan
you’ve even got caustic downing a beer at the end and then he flips off the cam
yeah you’ve still got it lads
s that’s why dan’s our biggest supporter at nearly 33
it started off on his show just kind of inadvertently
m but now he’s basically like our really pushy parent
enforcing the strictest work regime
s “come on guys that really didn’t fucking work for me
this is our fifth rehearsal let’s see a bit of urgency”
m every battle that we’re in he’s standing in the wing
goes all joe jackson with a stick if we’re not spitting perfectly
s he waves his fist frustrated if we skip a word ’cause he thinks we did it purposefully
and then his face goes like anchorman’s son a little burgundy
m the last time a parent pushed me that hard she was in a surgery lying on her back fucking giving birth to me
s he watches over us like we’re kids in nursery
trying to use us only so to live out his disturbing dream
m stop trying to recapture your youth through us you sick perverted freak
s ‘cause we’re fighting back this time like a prince of persia scene
m how’s it going pinocchio
s fucking nose like a toblerone
m you need a reality check if you’re planning again to go in exposing mode
i mean if every single fucking week your own kid’s at home exposed to you
stoned on ya homie’s show or posing drunk before a battle trying to pose like it’s totally dope
you need to question as a parent if you’ve shown him the ropes you know
‘cause your role model levels lower than porich’s vocal tone
this is the guy they call the career ender
more like the fucking tattletale who’ll say anything to get them to listen
m caustic brings up your alleged convictions
and then he’ll sketch a description so that a sentence is given
s but it’s not detention or prison it’s dealt in a written
and even two posh guys from reading in britain can tell that it’s snitchin’
m it’s as if all he’s doing is embellishing wisdom
but he brought up the way jeffy was living
so attention was driven from his own tensions with women
s you ignore your own problems by taking your enemies shit and exposing them in an instance
m but he’s developed addiction
s worse than dirtbag’s dad with his meth in the kitchen
m you ever think they way you act with leave effects on your infant
like he won’t see daddy doing drugs and remember it hit him
s though he thinks he dealing justice that’s just his devils within him
trying to find a place to hide away from his own pathetic existence
and whilst we’re here on the west coast in neutral grounds in the western contingent
we thought we’d put our diplomatic ties to work
m cause frankly all this silly international bother has got us sad and kind of hurt
s so before dan dan dan dan and dan recite their third
organik we want to put this don’t flop spat behind us first
m shuffle what’s that you have inside your shirt
s a peace treaty
m gee really
s and it’s signed by eurgh
whoa
now dizaster this isn’t laminated
and it’s our only copy
m so if you can oblige sir
now organik
fuck it lush
if you can sign here we can have a night of mirth
m and some fireworks
s sorted bola
m the war is over
woo

round 3 dirtbag dan and caustic
c these fucking 90pound pussies talking real greezy
you better be ready to turn up
you do fucking three minutes about me and jeff and then you start bringing his girl up
yo if you bring up my fucking son i’ma punch you in your nuts
do you follow soccer by the way no you should have wore your world cup
dd these fucking queens did a battle where they licked the cream out of oreos
that shit wouldn’t be gayer if you filmed the whole thing through a glory hole
you just do whatever eurgh tells you to honestly what the fuck for
sure shuffle can get the cream off a cookie faster
we both know which one of you sucks more
c so wait
y’all just ate the middle of the cookie i don’t think that’s the way it should be
bunch of white guys eating the white part of the cookie
i dunno that shit sounds pretty fucking racist to me
m well i bought some oreos today and i’ve got just the plan
let’s do a web redemption since we’re up on cam
before we finish this round one of you eats one of these fuckin’ cookies like a fuckin’ man
anybody cookie biscuit biscuits
c and y’all trying to be the fucking champs
shit peter and greg will put y’all to shame
look it’s adam and theo
more like adam and the old ball and chain
yo i can’t wait for the day your little relationship finally ends
cause one would die without the other you’re basically fucking siamese friends
is this how you wanna spend the rest of your future
your best friend’s a loser a desperate moocher surviving off your talent and your sense of humor
m this is hollywood shuffle
i brought you out here to make maneuvers
i’ve been to that shitty country you’re from i know you want to escape your future
your father basically lives at the pub but you can’t blame him for being a daytime boozer
cause your mom’s a typical british bitch
she got big old tits with a face like cruger’s
that’s ‘cause her ancestors are incesters
that’s the problem with your country fam
your aunt’s father’s were in sisters
so your grandmother looks like a fucking man
c wait a minute dan
since we’re battling british kids don’t you think we should put it in some shit they can understand
m okay
shuffle’s nan has supple cans but her face resembles russell brand
that’s fucking disgusting you couldn’t pay me to stuff her clam
c don’t be in such a rush now dan
i mean on the other hand
a nice guy like me could stomach shuffle’s nan
shit for a couple grand i’ll fuck the bitch dressed like i’m fucking uncle sam
m america fuck yeah
you’ll hear the rockets red glare when they cocking and spray
it’s a revolution so when it’s party time i’ma throw t off the dock of the bay
i’m like daniel boone when those cannons boom
i’m like davy crockett when i wave these rockets
i’m like george washington when i…
c dan you’re not fucking george washington stop it
this hyper america bullshit is fucking way too obnoxious
m fuck that shit caustic
they used to fear the beard i lose a couple battles and now i’m doubted
it’s like y’all forgot who burned down ness lee’s house just so i could write a fucking round about it
sorry ness
c you beat us in a dream you better wake up and apologize
he’s holding back your character you basically han solo in the carbonite
you couldn’t walk a mile in his shoes
you couldn’t fill an inch of his condom size
it’s like without shuffle the entire operation is compromised
it’s pretty safe to say i know where the problem lies cause without you one of ‘em will not survive
i’ma give you a minute to let that sink into your head like marlo’s eyes
m basically as far as the bars go
me and caustic got stripes like a bar code
people in the back are like “why didn’t they write more shuffle bars”
well that’s easy
c cause shuffle’s fucking awesome dude
m fuck you marloembed"
