stuck outside the middle of the desert wishin i was home
long way from no where wishin i was somewhere
sangre de cristo to the devils backbone

ive been to california and north carolina
hung with the hippies in austin and the cowboys of mexico
ive laid up in fort worth with beautiful ladies
hitch hiked on down to tijuana and hit the rodeo in san anton

in the back of a ranchero i rode down to laredo
had a good time with the la posada yea you know i was left alone
on a rig out of el paso rainin down in houston
told the truck driver put the pedal to the metal cause houston gets me down
on down to louisiana whiskey river landing
crawfish pie and eat jambalaya with a big ole coon ass smilesee ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likeembed"
