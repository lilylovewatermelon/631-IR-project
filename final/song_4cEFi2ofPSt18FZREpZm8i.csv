casted out im watching your eyes
casting out my visions of nine
blacking out casted out
im watching your eyes bleed dry

verse 1
touch with frustrated lips
love is like starting over
with every step engraving
the problems of memories

chorus
casted out im watching your eyes
casting out my visions of nine
blacking out casted out
im watching your eyes bleed dry

verse 2
drunk on failures regrets
letters of silence confess
burdens within
speaking as loneliness listens
while hopelessly feeling

chorus
casted out im watching your eyes
casting out my visions of nine
blacking out casted out
im watching your eyes bleed dry

theres a definite pattern
to our behavior
somehow the end draws us closer

chorus
casting out my visions of nine
cast it out let ten die with time
blacking out casted out
im watching your eyes bled dry

outro
blacking out
