give me give me give me the truth now
i promise i can handle it if you can
cause youve been running from yourself for way too long
so give me any reason not to cut you out
youre far too gone yeah
watch you pretend you know it all
shift any blame aside
vending the victim when it sells
how do you even sleep at night
as i drive and drive

chorus
in that bleak december youre just too cold
but i need the answer before youd fold
you would hold your cards inside your chest
i think i drove too far for that bleak december
and how full of shit you are how full of shit you are

verse 2
i really really really wanna know you
and not all the fifty fucking personalities inside your skull
if youd stop trying to steal the spotlight and steal the show
then maybe you would have a better chance at not dying alone
so i hit the road
you might also likechorus
in that bleak december youre just too cold
but i need the answer before youd fold
you would hold your cards inside your chest
i think i drove too far for that bleak december
and how full of shit you are

bridge
now what are you to me
but a fly inside a web of lies you weave
youre not fooling anyone not you not me
so i wonder how you stay alive
when all i do is freeze

chorus
in that bleak december youre just too cold
but i need the answer before youd fold
you would hold your cards inside your chest
i think i drove too far for that bleak december
in that bleak december youre just too cold
but i need the answer before youd fold
you would hold your cards inside your chest
i think i drove too far for that bleak december
and how full of shit you are2embed"
