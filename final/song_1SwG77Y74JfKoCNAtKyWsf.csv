ohoh i cant even take it in
ohoh i cant even take it in
ohoh i left my heart in metropolis

verse 1
so far apart i check that the coast was clear
i feel like a postcard i wish you were here
subway through the dark carriage through the park
taxi down the street get out and use my feet
dont matter much to me what it is that i do
as long as im coming home with you

chorus
oh oh oh as far as i can see
youre the only one the only one who can get to me
like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
or a speeding bullet theres no stopping this
i left my heart in metropolis

verse 2
a thousand miles feels like a million years
like hundreds of postcards that say i wish you were here i cant even take it in
airplane through the sky greyhound racing by
dirt bike on the beach sailboat on the sea
dont matter much to me what it is that i do
as long as im coming home with you

oh oh oh as far as i can see
youre the only one the only one who can get to me
like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
or a speeding bullet theres no stopping this
i left my heart in metropolis
i left my heart in metropolis

verse 3
like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
or a speeding bullet theres no stopping this
i left my heart in metropolis
i left my heart in metropolis
i left my heart in metropolis
i left my heart in metropolis

outro
ohoh i cant even take it in
ohoh i cant even take it in
