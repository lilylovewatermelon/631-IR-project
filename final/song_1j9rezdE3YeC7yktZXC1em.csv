blind faith heartache
mind games mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole

chorus
i want it all
i want it all

verse 2
old dogs new tricks
can you feel it
space age country girl
stone cold miracle

chorus
i want it all
i want it all

since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
said aint it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
leave me listening to the stones 2000 light years from home
