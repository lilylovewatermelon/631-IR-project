and clear her head
do you know what sarah meant
when she said you be my guest
and keep the pace to save your face
youll never make the place
why do you even run the race
i cant be what you need
i am stuck in a dream
i am stuck in a dream
dont you know
shes been here all along in a dream
she belongs in a dream
every day ill make promises that plague sarahs heart
so i can watch her fall apart
cause i know when i break her down
well spit on all the happy clowns
that live around this sunny town
she loves me like a dog doodoo
and when we mess around doodoo
ill let her know the truth i found doodoo doodoo
in my own hopeless hate doodoo
and every time i wake doodoo
i second guess the game i played doodoo
did i make a mistakeyou might also like11embed"
