you can set my house on fire baby
you can turn it into cinder and smoke
cause this house is mighty cold and i feel like
melting all the snow away

verse 1
you see these boots im wearing
theyre tough enough to go
and they will take many a road to reach you
honey wont you light the way

chorus
you can set my house on fire baby
you can turn it into cinder and smoke
cause this house is mighty cold and i feel like
melting all the snow away

verse 2
you see this train im riding
its burnin up the coal
and its wheels are bound to roll right by you
honey wont you jump my train

chorus
you can set my house on fire baby
you can turn it into cinder and smoke
cause this house is mighty cold and i feel like
melting all the snow away

you can set my house on fire baby
you can turn it into cinder and smoke
cause this house is mighty cold and i feel like
melting all the snow away
you can set my house on fire babyembed"
