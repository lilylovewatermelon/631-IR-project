now when you choose a law career
the moment you embark
there is that joke youre bound to hear
a lawyer is a shark
ignore that its simplistic and its dumb
only some of you will turn out sharks just some
the rest are chum

our topic is blood in the water
kids its time you faced
law school is a waste
oh yes unless you acquire a taste for blood in the water
dark and red and raw
youre nothing until the thrill of the kill becomes your only law

spoken
mr schultz hypothetical question
would you be willing to defend the following banker accused of fraud

sung
a kind old grandma took her savings and she sent it
off to your client all she saved since she was born
well he promised to invest it but he spent it
on prostitutes and heroin and porn
you might also likeaaron schultz
no i would not want to take that case

callahan
wrong
this one is a win unless youre lazy
grandmas broke shell have some hack from legal aid
put her on the stand and call her old and crazy
your guy goes free and he can get you high and laid

look for the blood in the water
read your thomas hobbes
only spineless snobs
will quarrel with the morally dubious jobs
yes blood in the water
your scruples are a flaw

spoken
ms hoopes hypothetical question
would you be the right lawyer for the following client

sung
say they offer you a bundle for defending
a famous hitman for the mafia elite
seems he missed his chosen prey
killed a nun and drove away
running over three cute puppies in the street
enid hoopes spoken
what you think i wouldnt defend him just because hes a typical man

callahan spoken
oh you lesbians think youre so tough

hoopes spoken
stammers incoherently

callahan sung
oh dear i fear my comment has offended
hard to argue though when youre too mad to speak
your employment will be very quickly ended
when they see how your emotions make you weak

so whats my point
i run a billion dollar law firm
and i hire four new interns every year
from this class i will select
four young sharks whom i respect
and those four will have a guaranteed career
do you follow me

so i wanna see what

students
blood in the water
callahan
exactly
let the games begin
four of you will win
but just those four with a dorsal fin
yes

callahanstudents

callahan
so bite and scratch and claw

spoken

elle spoken

callahan spoken
someones had their morning coffee
would you summarise the case of state of indiana v hearn from your reading please

elle spoken
oh i wanted to answer the puppy question

callahan spoken
but im asking you about the assigned reading

elle spoken
okay who assigns reading for the first day of class

callahan spoken
you have guts ms woods
ms kensington

sung
let us say you teach a class at harvard law school
a position that youre justly proud about
but a girl on whom you call hasnt read the case at all
should you let it go or

vivian kensington
no id throw her out

callahan
alright then
you heard your classmate
you have just been killed
she cut your throat so grab your coat
yes youve got guts

callahanstudents
but now theyre spilled
your bloods in the water

students
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

callahan
so would you please withdraw
and if you return be ready to learn
or is that unfair oh wait i dont care
thats just how i rule
in life as in school
with fear and shock and awe

youre nothing until

students
blood in the water

callahan
the thrill of the kill

students
blood in the water

callahan
becomes your only law

students
blood in the water

callahan
your only law

students
blood in the water

callahan
your only law

students
blood in the water
blood in the water1embed"
