verse 1
baby baby baby
im scatterbrained and lost in love
ooh i crave it on the daily
that sugar pill that dopes me up ah
ooh its raining its pourin
i picture you in the mornin
the hot water and the steam
ooh the way that you feel between
both my hands on your hourglass
the minutes then the hours pass
i wanna watch you bloom
gimme that sweet perfume

prechorus
its makin my heart beat so fast
in my mind youre the angel on the painted glass
lookin for high divine connection
im a lover in need of confession

chorus
let me satisfy your soul
im not a saint but do i have to be
well baby youre my holy ghost
and i need you close come back to me

in my mind youre the angel on the painted glass
