daddy im afraid wont you stay a little while
keep me safe cause theres monsters right outside
daddy please dont go i dont wanna be alone
cause the second that youre gone theyre gonna know
before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

chorus
just cause im leavin
it dont mean that i wont be right by your side
when you need me
and you cant see me in the middle of the night
just close your eyes and say a prayer
its okay i know youre scared when im not here
but ill always be right there
even though im leavin i aint goin nowhere

verse 2
dad well be late and uncle sam dont like to wait
hes got a big old plane thats gonna take me far away
i know i act tough but theres a churnin in my gut
cause i just cant call you up when things get rough
before i left he hugged my neck and said

chorus
just cause youre leavin
it dont mean that i wont be right by your side
when you need me
and you cant see me in the middle of the night
just close your eyes and say a prayer
its okay i know youre scared i might be here
but ill always be right there
even though youre leavin i aint goin nowhere

daddy im afraid wont you stay a little while
i never thought id see the day i had to say goodbye
daddy please dont go i cant do this on my own
theres no way that i can walk this road alone
daddy grabbed my hand and said

chorus
just cause im leavin
it dont mean that i wont be right by your side

and you cant see me in the middle of the night
just close your eyes and say a prayer
