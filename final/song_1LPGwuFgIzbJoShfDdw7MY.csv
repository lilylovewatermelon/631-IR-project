boy when i left you you were young
i was gone but not my love
you were clearly meant for more
than a life lost in the war

i want you to be happy
free to run get dizzy on caffeine
funny friends that make you laugh
and maybe youre just a little bit dappy

chorus

feel your mother right at your side dont you know you got my eyes
ill make you fly
youll be happy all the time i know you can make it right

verse 2
boy now your life is backtofront
but youll see thats not for long
cause i know youll feel the ghost
of some memories so warm

prechorus
boy i want you to be happy
free to run get dizzy on caffeine
funny friends that make you laugh
and maybe youre just a little bit dappy
