verse 1
just cause the game is up doesn’t mean i didn’t win
i got three aces and a king
you might have got love from unnatural things
that’s why my instincts kicks in
it doesnt matter if you win it’s based on what you bring
i still feel it and i chase it with a drink
your telephone rings but you ain’t listenin
so motherfucker now i’m steppin’ in

chorus

lara croft is soft when it comes my stuff
she’s made up i’m real
i’m a lady of rage with an afro puff
who else can say the things they feel
more jiggy than will
from a mill to a trill
there’s no beat i cannot kill
still chill up on a hill
like i’m poppin’ a pill
there’s no other things i want to feel

chorus
theres only one you you you you
theres only one you you you you
theres only one you you you you

there’s trillions of cash
and there’s billions of us
and there’s millions of things that can happen with this stuff
and there’s thousands that will crash
and there’s hundreds that will smash
there’s only one you and ima drink to that

outro
come on let go let we go take off
tonight’s the one cause tomorrow may never come
working all day and tonight is gonna be mine
making money is fine but your life is one of a kind9embed"
