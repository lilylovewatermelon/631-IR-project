verse 1 mike shinoda
yeah i am not a pattern to be followed
the pill that im on is a tough one to swallow
im not a criminal not a role model
not a born leader im a tough act to follow
i am not the fortune and the fame
nor the same person tellin you to forfeit the game
i came in the ring like a dog on a chain
and i found out the underbellys sicker than it seems
and it seems ugly but it can get worse
cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
and im not a robot im not a monkey
i will not dance even if the beats funky
opposite of lazy far from a punk
yall ought to stop talkin start tryin to catch up motherfucker

chorus mike shinoda
and all the people say
ah ahahah ahahahah
ah ahah ahahahahah
try to catch up motherfucker
ah ahahah ahahahah
ah ahah ahahahahah

lauryn said money change a situation
big said it increase the complication
kane said dont step i aint the one
chuck said that uzi weigh a motherfuckin ton
and im just a student of the game that they taught me
rockin every stage in every place that it brought me
im awfully underrated but came here to correct it
and so it aint mistaken ima state it for the record
i am the opposite of wack opposite of weak opposite of slack
synonym of heat synonym of crack
closest to a peak far from a punk
yall ought to stop talkin start tryin to catch up motherfucker

chorus mike shinoda
and all the people say
ah ahahah ahahahah
ah ahah ahahahahah
try to catch up motherfucker
ah ahahah ahahahah
