if i could invent a time machine
then baby wed both be seventeen
cruising in my first car
acting like movie stars on a friday night
do you remember those friday nights

chorus
when we were a rock ready to roll
and there was a fire down in our souls
and all the whole world had to stand still
and turn around us cause that was the deal
and oh how those nights went flowing like wine
when i was all yours and you were all mine
and we were in love yeah we were in love

verse 3
i can still see you when i sleep
there is a picture i still keep
you with your hair in the wind
and me with that crazy grin
under summer skies
when dreams were too young to die

chorus
when we were a rock ready to roll
and there was a fire down in our souls
and all the whole world had to stand still
and turn around us cause that was the deal
and oh how those nights went flowing like wine
when i was all yours and you were all mine
and we were in love yeah we were in love

oh i know i know it sounds crazy but baby youre still the one
so let us find a way to bring back the days that our hearts were forever young

chorus
when we were a rock ready to roll
and there was a fire down in our souls
and all the whole world had to stand still
and turn around us cause that was the deal
and oh how those nights went flowing like wine
when i was all yours and you were all mine
and we were in love yeah we were in love yeah we were in love1embed"
