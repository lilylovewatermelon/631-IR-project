destination remote
we done been everywhere
only thing we aint traveled
is time yo

verse 1 tyler the creator
the boy record smell like bleach
i can travel where i want
im accustomed clearin customs
it aint custom i dont come
flee the bird to the truck
i scream au revoir to the stewardess
border control asking stupid shit
stayin at home i hate
runaway love but im no ludacris
sippin on mint tea take my shoes off
then we take off then i snooze off
until i land where im foreign
then i wake up wipe the drool off
got my passport in my weekend
ima cool off get a sweet tan
loafers filled with beach sand
recline til its time to peace sign
fuck all the chains and the cars get a passport
see the world open your eyes til your back hurt
niggas get bread and wont leave shit is backwards
start with your feet then a car then an airport
get out your bubble gum
blow up horizons sun
sled in the alps or go tube in missoula
or tour in japan or go scuba in cuba
or land in a borough jerrod got the brioche
ciabatta in como it matches my peacoat
oversee the sea all the things that you could see
like them languages i speak out in paris for a week
take my nephews out to nice they like who im like oui ha

verse 2 tyler the creator
every car retarded the garage look like a loony bin
what coupe he in depends on the fit and the type of mood he in ugh

the suit was so sharp that it could get medusa coochie trimmed ugh
hov talkin bout a hundred million nigga loop me in

mama named him tyler and his brothers call him t
and the bank they call him when that wire clear like season three or somethin ugh
