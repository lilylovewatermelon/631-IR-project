see we both shared a crowded room
not formally introduced
but ive been watching her watching me all night
and then she disappeared for a few
must have got herself a drink or two
to work up a nerve to come and say hi
she politely spoke her name
like a gentleman i did the same
and she sat down and we talked for a moment yeah
she told me shed be pleased to be
the lucky lady leaving with me
that sounds nice but id hate to hurt my woman

hook
so what so what its all love its all love show nuff
thats what she said to me yeah
its alright its alright goodbye goodbye
but for now you gotta live for the moment

verse 2
now what i look like deceiving my lady
the future mother of my babies
and lose a love that took years to build
to do that i must be crazy
and right now i dont feel crazy
even though youre killing me with your sex appeal
and on the real she may never know
but the problem is ill know
but how can i look into my babys eyes
now it just might be cool for some
but i refuse to be the one
to let a moment ruin my life

bridge
i must admit you look remarkable
but my woman puts you to shame
cause what we have is more than physical yeah
more like spiritual souls intertwining
intertwining like a braid
