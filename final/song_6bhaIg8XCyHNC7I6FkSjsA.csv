a nickels just a nickel son
your pleasure becomes your pain
its gonna hurt
your out on the road
your just an old horse walking alone
shaken off the miles been rode
pardon me
through the valley of the shadows
wickedness unravels

some crooked man
dealing cards to an honest man
stealing up all his farming land
its a damn shame
his oldest son is starving now
there aint no mule to pull the plow
there aint no rain
cause all the crops are burning dry
except for the tear in his mamas eye
in her eye
everything is fine

with one touch
the water turns to rust
tell me who is there to trust
anymore
your falling fast
youre just a rock in glass
running from your shattered past

said a nickels just a nickel son
your pleasure becomes your pain
its gonna hurt
your out on the road
your just an old horse walking alone
shaken off the miles been rode
pardon me
through the valley of the shadows
wickedness unravels

with one touch
said the water turns to rust
tell me who is there to trust
anymore
when your falling fast
youre just a rock in glass
running from your shattered past
tell me all you need
is a guitar string and a bended knee
a country boy thats all you need to be

think im in tune
always gotta be a fucking train

sometimes i cant recall
whats left of me
laughter on my back been peeled on off
and the past is always catching up with me
but im tired of stepping on memories and walking on
if you could only see the best in me
i wouldnt have to pick the guitar or write you a song
but you only be what you can see
and i guess the heart dont always come with the soul
i think ill go on and call my mama
tell her i loving you if i ever did ever drove me away
it wasnt that i didnt want to stick around
just i couldnt find the courage in the bottom of the bottle to stay

well around my old man cleared up
well then tell him that everything will be okay
and even if you cant give up on the drinking
well i guess i couldnt either and i still gonna love you anyways

well i called my sister out in vegas
well and tell her to roll the dice for me
and if you help me ill help you roll you a seven
well i hope you can buy you a pretty house out in la

this is the best in me
this is the best in meembed"
