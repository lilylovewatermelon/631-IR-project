how have i been
i think you should know well
the shape that im in
you tell me you wondered
if i was okay
well thats a damn fool thing to say

the water is rising
the water is wide
and youre always standing
on the other side
and then comes the moment
i wake in the dawn with hours to lie here alone

and you seem so surprised
that im feeling this way
how am i so lonely today
if you ever loved me the way i loved you
you would be lonely too

so heres to the lovers
for old times sake
who dont hold each other
to the promise they break
and smile through the window
and wave on the street
cause thats all you want now from me
see lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeshould i say something
to put you at ease
or should i get down on my knees
if you ever loved me the way i loved you
you would be lonely too
if you ever loved me the way i loved you
you would be lonely tooembed"
