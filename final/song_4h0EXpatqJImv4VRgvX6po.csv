i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 158
the words that you whispered for just us to know
you told me you loved me so why did you go away
away

verse 2
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane
that july ninth the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms

prechorus
but now ill go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i dont know
how to be something you miss

chorus
i never thought wed have a last kiss
i never imagined wed end like this
your name forever the name on my lips

verse 3
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party youre showing off again
and id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in
im not much for dancing but for you i did
because i love your handshake meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how youd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something
theres not a day i dont miss those rude interruptions

and ill go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i dont know
how to be something you miss

chorus
i never thought wed have a last kiss
i never imagined wed end like this
your name forever the name on my lips ooh

bridge
so ill watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and ill keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope its nice where you are

verse 4
and i hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day
and something reminds you you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in the weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind

prechorus
so ill go
sit on the floor wearing your clothes
all that i know is i dont know
how to be something you miss
chorus
i never thought wed have a last kiss
i never imagined wed end like this
your name forever the name on my lips

outro
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last42embed"
