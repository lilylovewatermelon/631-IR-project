verse 1
what if i pick you up from your house
we should get out we havent talked in a while
we should roll to see where it goes
i saw potential in you from the go you know that i did
i dont know if you know but i know who you are
you could be big as madonna
just get in the car and then lets touch the road
dont make other plans
say you get up early you work for the man
well hell understand
pull up im pullin up on you in ten
already on ten
big as madonna ill say it again sixsixsix
soon as you get in oh no no

verse 2
plan this shit out on my own the way it should go
wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
so theyll never know
but i might tell you one day you never know
well see how i feel
well see if you hold up your end of the deal
for now let me handle the wheel
and dont worry about doing your hair
or what you should wear
this not a video shoot i dont care
dont overprepare
got to remind me again where you stay
even though i think i know the way
but you know just in case i miss the road
pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
