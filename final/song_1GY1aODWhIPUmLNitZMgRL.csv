verse 1 daniel caesar
see i can write down what i see
im hanging by the thread of my misery
been feeling like there’s nothing out there for me
still waiting on a feeling got away from me

chorus daniel caesar  jacob collier
im trying to restore the feeling
god damn wouldnt it be nice
i know that my mind is willing
cant seem to get this right
im trying to restore the feeling
god damn wouldnt it be nice
i know that my mind is willing
i just gotta get my body right
wont you sing it now

right now i cant seem
to fight the feeling demons here waiting on me
i’m hanging by my pride my energy
is draining slowly please don’t cry shorty
ay miss me with that how you been how you doing
in paris talking fluent like they know my influence
took a lot of talent to make thousands out of toonies
but thats exactly what i’m doing

im peeling back backwoods i guess im back to work
make a mill off a classic verse
will i make a mill’ or a classic first
