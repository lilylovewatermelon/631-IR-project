though i never met you and we spoke not a word
ill never forget you through stories that ive heard
for you unknown brother my babys mothers pained
cause your soul is in heaven but your memory remains

chorus
unknown unknown brother
ill meet you someday
unknown unknown brother
well walk through fields where children play

verse 2
your eyes shined bright when you were a kid
your sisters loved you and all that you did
big brother big brother dont worry a bit
your flame has not faded since the day it was lit

bridge
your life was joy
your mamas only boy
and when the skies are blue
big brother theyre blue for you

verse 3
well smile like pictures of you as a boy
before you retired to heavenly joy
