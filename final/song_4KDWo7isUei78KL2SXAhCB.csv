another saturday another careless move
tells the world that youre thinking of what to do
a window opens up and someone calls your name
but i can tell you dont know how to play this game

prechorus
i know this isnt it oohooh oohooh
youll hit your target someday oohooh oohooh

chorus
so now youre on your own
wont you come back home
to see youre not that kind
and find the strength to find the strength to find another way
to find another way
to find another way
to find another way

verse 2
so tell me what you need and ill accommodate
but if too long goes by you just might be too late
an opportunity you cant afford to waste
so have the lines in your head first for heavens sake

prechorus
you hear the day beckoning oohooh oohooh
know that its all in your head oohooh oohooh

so now youre on your own
wont you come back home
to see youre not that kind
and find the strength to find the strength to find another way

instrumental break

chorus
so now youre on your own
wont you come back home
to see youre not that kind
and find the strength to find the strength to find another way2embed"
