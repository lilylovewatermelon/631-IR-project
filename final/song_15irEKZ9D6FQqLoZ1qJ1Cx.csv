one two three four

verse 1
wakey wakey rise and shine
its on again off again on again
watch me fall like dominoes
in pretty patterns
fingers in the blackbird pie
im tingling tingling tingling
its what you feel not what you ought to
what you ought to
reasonable and sensible

chorus
dead from the neck up
i guess im stuffed stuffed stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but not not not
for no real reason

verse 2
squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
i take a bow take a bow take a bow
its what you feel not what you ought to
what you ought to
the elephant thats in the room
is tumbling tumbling tumbling
in duplicate and triplicate and
plastic bags
in duplicate and triplicate

dead from the neck up
i guess im stuffed stuffed stuffed
we thought you had it in you
but not not not
exactly where do you get off
is enough is enough
i love you but enough is enough
enough of that stuff
theres no real reason

outro
youve got a head full of feathers
you got melted to butter8embed"
