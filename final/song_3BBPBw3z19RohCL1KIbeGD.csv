too many voices it wont take long
which ones right and which ones wrong
and yours is most likely to be misunderstood
screaming in tongues
at the top of my lungs
until i find you until you found me
somehow i always knew that you would

chorus 1
and i am contemplating matters
all this cling and clatter
in my head and what you said
is ringing ringing faster

chorus 2
and its all good if you would
stop the world from making sense
and if i could just realize
it doesnt really matter
doesnt really matterx2

verse 2
if i could touch
the sound of silence now
you know i would if i knew how
to make these intentions
come around
and im hearing without listening
and believing every word that
youre not saying
speaking without a sound

chorus 2

verse 3
trapped inside
of these four walls
walking brainless muppet dolls
mushroom face
beneath the tangles
bleeding silhouette inside
dancing like an angel would
