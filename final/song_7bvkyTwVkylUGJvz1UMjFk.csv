verse 1 the weeknd
i think im fucking gone rolling on this floor
messing up your carpet
ill get on it after four more
sessions of the strong on your floor
should have fucking rolled but i fucking pulled
feeling like a million bucks before
i walked through this door
when i walked through your door
cant believe i made it
but i made it thats for sure
for sure
your loving
i need more
i need yours
she aint looking for that unconditional
what the fuck these bitches on
they want what im sitting on
they dont want my love
they just want my potential
fuck it
ill be sipping on this baby living off bliss
got me drowning in your love
got me drowning in the mist
gimme right attention
or ill start drowning from my wrist

verse 2 the weeknd
i i got a brand new girl
call her rudolph
shell probably od before i show her to momma
all these girls try to tell me she got no love
but all these girls never ever got her blowjob
ringtone on silent
and if she stops then i might get violent
no call is worth stopping
so momma please stop calling
we can play all night
it just takes one night
to let me fucking prove
this feeling i would give to
