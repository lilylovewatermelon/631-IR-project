hook mr kane
in the world of change here i am
tryin to have some thangs
so what you need is some game to get your money man
ohh baby in the world of paper paper

snoop dogg
thinkin of a master plan
cause aint nuttin but sweat inside my hand
so i dig into my pockets all my money is spent
so i dig deeper but still comin up with lint
so i start my mission leave my residence
thinkin how can i get some dead presidents
i need money i used to see a stickup kid
so i think of all the devious things i did
i used to roll up this is a hold up aint nuttin funny
stop smilin cause still dont nuttin move but the money
cause now ive learned to earn cause im righteous
i feel great so maybe i might just
search fo a 9 to 5 if i strive
then maybe ill stay alive
so i walk up the street whistlin this
feelin out of place cause man do i miss
a pen and a paper a stereo a tape of
me and warren g and a big fat plate of
chicken wings cause thats my favorite thang
but without no money man that shits a dream
cause i dont like to dream about gettin paid
so i dig into the books of the rhymes that ive made
soon as i bust em see if i got pull
i hit the dogghouse cause im paid in full echoes
see snoop dogg liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likehook
