lets go

verse 1
i kissed the scars on her skin
i still think youre beautiful
and i dont ever want to lose my best friend
i screamed out god you vulture
bring her back or take me with her
tear it down break the barricade
i wanna see what sound it makes
i hate this flavor with a passion
and i fucking hate the aftertaste
how does it feel how does it feel
how does it feel well it feels like im on fire
wake up i know you can hear me

chorus
make me a promise here tonight love like a tidal wave
dreamless in early graves i never want it to be this way
the chemicals will bring you home again
this is it when its done we can say that
when its sudden death we fight back

verse 2
oh yeah this was just as i suspected
pretend like i dont entice you
ive seen you circling the sky above my head
you traitor i will never be taken for granted again
keep digging holes in the desert
say a prayer for you i know that youre in pain
but if we die at the same time does it still scare you
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
make me a promise here tonight lets go
dreamless in early graves i never want it to be this way
the chemicals will bring you home again
this is it when its done we can say that
oh my god were not gonna make it

bridge
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave
we will bring the tidal wave and nothing will remain
shes mine
you stay away from her its not her time
cause baby im the one who haunts her dreams at night
until shes satisfied

chorus
make me a promise here tonight love like a tidal wave
dreamless in early graves i never want it to be this way
the chemicals will bring you home again
this is it when its done we can say that
when its sudden death we fight back
outro
