is there a god
is he watching
is she watching
are they watching out
if not what are we doing
where are we going
what are we doing now
look at all these people
searching for a reason
searching for a peace of mind
hey i say we’re all created equal
that’s what they teach us
but that ain’t how we treat each other
naw that ain’t how we treat each other
shit the truth is that we need each other yea

hook
diamond in the back babies on crack
kick in the door wavin’ the 44
white collar war crime money gets spent
candles in the sun blowin’ in the wind
sun goes down heroes often get shot
peace has long been forgot
ooh will it be too late when we find out
yeah all that we got
take a look around now
just take a look around

business and governments just watch out an innocent fade
mindless bureaucracy fails hindering government aide
arent you appalled
what are we doing
where are we going
what are we doing

hook
diamond in the back babies on crack
kick in the door wavin’ the 44
white collar war crime money gets spent
candles in the sun blowin’ in the wind
sun goes down heroes often get shot
peace has long been forgot
ooh will it be too late when we find out
yeah all that we got
take a look around now
just take a look around
oh may we all live long
may we all be brave
and the bridges we burn
only light our way
may we all be strong
and we all be brave
and the bridges we burn
only light our way
oh may we all live long
may we all be brave
and the bridges we burn
only light our way
may we all live long
may we all be brave
and the bridges we burn
just be the bridges we burn
all that we got
oh were all that we got
look around now all that we got
hey yeah yeah
is there a god
is he watching
is she watching
are they watching out
is there a god
im sure hes watching
are we doing
are we going
oh take a look around now10embed"
