you drag your bones across the earth
like everyone who dragged theirs first
a speech a prayer a stone to read
a wooden case for worms to eat

bridge
corpses met with hallmark afterthoughts
apparently theyre sorry for the loss

verse 2
its sad but true and tough for you
your brains synaptic buzz is through
exist to die and still live on
to haunt the ones who done you wrong

chorus
20 grams of weight and the souls escaped
youre coming back a duck or an ape
20 grams of weight and the souls escaped
youre coming back a duck or an apeyou might also like14embed"
