i like the way black coffee tastes
i like fresh cut soybean fields
cold beer on a saturday
round here there aint no interstate
when you sit shotgun you close the gate

im stubborn as my granddads mule
wild as wild turkey too
apples dont fall far from trees round here
want to know where this boys comin from
you gotta know where this boy came from
its gonna take some time and an old john deer
if you wanna see where i belong
where theyll bury this boys bones
where this rеbel soul calls home
you gotta go wherе the dirt road dont

i like the way your hand holds mine
middle of the bench with you hair pulled back
listen to you don singin tulsa time
where were going aint on the map
gotta place you need to see baby
if you wanna know more about me

im stubborn as my granddads mule
wild as wild turkey too
apples dont fall far from trees round here
want to know where this boys comin from
you gotta know where this boy came from
its gonna take some time and an old john deer
if you wanna see where i belong
where theyll bury this boys bones
where this rebel soul calls home
you gotta go where the dirt road dont
dirt road dont
see warren zeiders liveget tickets as low as 98you might also likea part of me is in this place itll always be that way

im stubborn as my granddads mule
wild as wild turkey too
apples dont fall far from trees round here
want to know where this boys comin from
you gotta know where this boy came from
its gonna take some time and an old john deer
if you wanna see where i belong
where theyll bury this boys bones
where this rebel soul calls home
you gotta go where the dirt road dont
dirt road dontembed"
