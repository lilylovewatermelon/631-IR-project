just listen to the politician
wishing his position wasnt missing
everything his heart would like to say
and a constant in the constitution
is that there cant be one solution
itd be so far from the truth
and we would hate it anyway

prechorus
opinions are immunity to being told youre wrong
paper rock and scissors they all have their pros and cons
and all of us we will endure
just like we always have
but you cant just be too sure
how long this will last

chorus
cause we control the chaos
in the back of our minds
our problems seem so small
but they grow on us like gravity
but gravity still makes us fallyou might also likeembed"
