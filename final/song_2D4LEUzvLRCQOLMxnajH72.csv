stay for tonight if you want to
i can show you what my dreams are made of
as im dreamin of your face
ive been away for a long time
such a long time and i miss you there
i cant imagine bein anywhere else
i cant imagine bein anywhere else but here
oh ooh

verse 1
how the hell did you ever pick me
honestly i could sing you a song
but i dont think words can express your beauty
its singing to me
how the hell did we end up like this
you bring out the beast in me
i fell in love from the moment we kissed
since then weve been history

chorus
they say that love is forever
your forever is all that i need its all that i need
please stay as long as you need
cant promise that things wont be broken
but i swear that i will never leave i will never leave
please stay forever with me
