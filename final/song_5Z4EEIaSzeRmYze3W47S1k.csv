once upon a time
there were two lovebirds
one shy one so not
they met each other at the perfect time
and one just didnt know how to handle it

verse 1
these days feel so different with the thought
of you bah bah in my mind bah bah
i cant help but see your face
the look in your eye lets me know im mesmerized
i wish i never met you no more no

break
ooh ohoh ohoh
oh woah uh

verse 2
still bah bah here bah bah in my head can you come back
you lеft me a mess since thе day we kissed and said
goodbye just for now youll be back next saturday
i wish i never met you no more
i wish i never met you no more

outro
oh oh oh
oh
oh oh oh oh ah ah ah ah oh
oh i wish i never met you at all
i wish i never met you no more
i wish i never met you no more
i wish i never met you no more
i wish i never met you no moreyou might also like2embed"
