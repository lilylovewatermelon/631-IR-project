i’ve flown too close to the sun this time
i keep flying and i’m gonna get burned
i walk by the edge of the ocean
and i look to the sky
and then i watch this world turn

chorus
in this love in this love
in this love in this love oh

verse 2
i feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
our love it always stays the same
i don’t believe all the things that they told us
it’s love that makes us feel this way

chorus
in this love in this love
in this love in this love oh

verse 3
i’m not ready to go
this world is not ready for me
the clock keeps spinning so slow
i guess we’ll have to wait and see
