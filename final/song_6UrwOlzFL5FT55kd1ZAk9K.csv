sky is blue you say forever
ooh ooh ive been trapped by love
then you go so change the weather
sky is grey bit more than ever
ooh ooh ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love

so my beer now taste so bitter
but i cant find anything sweeter
ooh ooh ive been trapped by love
then you come and i feel better
see my eyes theyre full of water
then again you go
so change the weather

askin for the next together
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love
ive been trapped by love

when you come i feelin better
sky is blue you say forever
ooh ooh ive been trapped by love
then you come and i feel better
see my eyes theyre full of water
then again you go
so change the weather
