im like a child lookin off in the horizon
im like an ambulance thats turnin on the sirens
ohohoh im still alive
im like a soldier comin home for the first time
i dodged a bullet and i walked across a landmine
ohohoh im still alive

prechorus
am i bleedin
am i bleedin from the storm
just shine a light into the wreckage
so far away away

chorus
cause im still breathin
cause im still breathin on my own
my heads above the rain and roses
makin my way away
cause im still breathin
cause im still breathin on my own
my heads above the rain and roses
makin my way away my way to you

verse 2
im like a junkie tyin off for the last time
im like a loser thats bettin on his last dime
ohohoh im still alive
im like a son that was raised without a father
im like a mother barely keepin it together
ohohoh im still alive

cause im still breathin
cause im still breathin on my own
my heads above the rain and roses
makin my way away
cause im still breathin
cause im still breathin on my own
my heads above the rain and roses

as i walked out on the ledge
are you scared to death to live
and ive been runnin all my life
just to find a home thats for the restless
and the truth thats in the message
makin my way away away
