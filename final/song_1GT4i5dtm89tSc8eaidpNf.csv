90s televisions that raised me
made me feel like it was gravy i wasnt crazy
nowadays the kids all lazy the pics all crazy
in the land of doin drugs and bustin clips off safety
i be cryin to the lord in the times that i feel unsure
wisdom of the scriptures like carvin lines in the sword
i pray we stick together like all the vines on the wall
climbin until we fall and drivin until we stall
designer clothes got us here dyin in every store
buyin it when we poor knowin this shit a hassle and
money that shouldve been going to ownin bigger castles
and still well dibbledabble and try to find it abroad
livin life in this fog our eyes covered
with all the selfinflicted danger we could die from it
im runnin through the game just tryna find some ties from it
i was buggin the times that i said that i love it
because i grew to love myself and who hovers above me
and plus my family and my brothers who love me
this is god purpose
i know the devil wanna scratch me off surface
but every attempt he tryin is worthless that boyll never get me
or represent me fall out and get to resent me
im part of jehovah army i know exactly who sent me
and i dont mean to sound like im preachin you down
disregard my past ways this what im teachin you now
words that i shouldve been spoke ima speak em up now
niggas try to ether my style while keepin me down
i can tell you so many people wan find reason for livin
wanna be a helpin hand but dont know how to give it
i told em fall on your knees repent for your evil deeds
ask god to show you but nigga actually seek
mean it when you say it dont pray it because i told you
do it for the need of him to show you im tellin yall
i aint never ever ever felt better dawg
bentley pullin off bentayga still smellin off yeah
i love my haters when they jealous dawg uh
cause all that i can do is flourish dawg
yeah daystaryou might also like3embed"
