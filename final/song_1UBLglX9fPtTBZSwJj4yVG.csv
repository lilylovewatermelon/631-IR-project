40 acres and a mule was the plan by the radical republicans during reconstruction to help the former slaves prosper and make a living by giving them land it got turned down and never passed because some felt it was too harsh on the south not like they were not harsh on the slaves…

also a typical of contradictionoxymoron since mules are hybrid animals meaning they’re not fertile at all

suggestion
the plan was orchestrated by the bureau of refugees freedmen and abandoned lands with oliver howard as the leader the phrase “forty acres and a mule” was created by general william sherman who originally came up with the idea besides redistributing land the bureau’s main function was fostering education which is why colleges such as howard university are named after members of this bureau among others
it should be noted that the plan of land redistribution was struck down in court for the southerners whose land was being taken took this matter to court where it was ruled unconstitutional to take this land even if it was abandoned during the civil war

mike starts off the album with heavy use of “izzle” slang first used as part of jive talk by pimps and hustlers in new york and later popularized by snoop dogg
this sort of pseudo language which is also known as izzo for adding iz in front of the first vowel in the syllable can be used to disguise words for people to use amongst themselves here he is disguising nikes pipe knife right fright mike and then right once again

excluding the izzles mike is telling us he’s up and about at night scaring his enemies with the variety of weapons he has with him

the title is enochian for “voice of god”

the talking is from a radio callin show coast to coast am with art bell it is one of the classic moments from that show during which the caller claims to be a former area 51 employee and that the military was out to get him oddly enough the satellite which carried that show suddenly died losing the feed to some fifty stations during the broadcast the caller later admitted that the story was a hoax

if you play this song over “lost keys blame hofmann” by tool it terminates right as the dialogue in that song picks up it is commonly believed that this ties into the aforementioned song which the segues into “rosetta stoned” many think that the three songs together make a story

 parking lot by tyler the creator feat casey veggies  mike g

original annotation
sam is after wolf after discovering that he’s hanging out with salem his girlfriend
oh she with that new dude wolf
hey you know where they went
i seen ‘em going down by the lake
he’s pretty angry now and clearly wants to put an end to their relationship by killing him but wolf is going to face sam and kill him first

notice that between where wolf says ‘what the fuck you mean kill me’ and ‘slow down’ the dude in the background lionel says “you got a booger in your nose” i thought it was pretty fucking silly

suggestion type missing something

suggestion
it should be noted that during the skit the riff for “rusty” the next track begins playing in the background this is relevant seeing as how the skit at the end of “parking lot” ties in to how “rusty” ends sam killing earl and loudly questioning where wolf can be found

suggestion
the current annotation has some personal commentary kinda it’s a bit questionable

original annotation
i feel like this line has hidden significance this mirrors exactly what the recording says in the previous episode right before harry’s head popped
