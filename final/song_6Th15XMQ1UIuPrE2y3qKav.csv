carrying the weight on the end of a limb
your just waitin for somebody
to pick you up again
shaded by a tree cant live up to a rose
all you ever wanted was a sunny place to grow

chorus
pretty little thing
sometimes you got to look up
and let the world see all the beauty that youre made of
cause the way you hang your head nobody can tell
youre my virginia bluebell
my virginia bluebell

verse 2
even through a stone
a flower can bloom
you just need a little push
spring is coming soon
umbrella in the rain
theyll roll off your back
better what you can realize what you have

chorus
pretty little thing
sometimes you got to look up
and let the world see all the beauty that youre made of
cause the way you hang your head nobody can tell
youre my virginia bluebell
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebreak
put a little light in the darkest places
put a little smile on the saddest faces

chorus
pretty little thing
sometimes you got to look up
and let the world see all the beauty that youre made of
cause the way you hang your head nobody can tell
youre my virginia bluebell
