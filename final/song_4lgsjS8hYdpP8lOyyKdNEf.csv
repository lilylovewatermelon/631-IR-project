when you refuse me
you confuse me
what makes you think ill let you in again
think again my friend
go on misuse me and abuse me
ill come out stronger in the end

chorus
and does it make you sad
to find yourself alone
and does it make you mad
to find that i have grown

verse 2
you do not know how much this hurts me
to say these things that i dont want to say
but have to say them anyway
i would do anything to end your suffering
but you would rather walk away

chorus
and does it make you sad
to find yourself alone
and does it make you mad
to find that i have grown
ill bet it hurts so bad
to see the strength that i have shown
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likebridge
when you answer the door pick up the phone
you wont find me cause im not coming home

chorus
and does it make you sad
to find yourself alone
and does it make you mad
to find that i have grown
ill bet it hurts so bad
to see the strength that i have shown
and does it make you sad
to find yourself alone
and does it make you mad
to find that i have grown
ill bet it hurts so bad
to see the strength that i have shown

outro
when you answer the door pick up the phone
you wont find me cause im not coming home
when you answer the door pick up the phone
you wont find me cause im not coming home
when you answer the door pick up the phone
you wont find me cause im not coming homeembed"
