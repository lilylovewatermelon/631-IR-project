ill live in the bathtub
its cool and clean
its smooth and its steady
its all that i need
i broke our belongings
theyre all on the floor
the room is now empty
nothing left to throw

chorus
all the eggshells are on the ground
and i try im trying to pick them up
but they crack and crumble its all too much
too frail for me to touch
all the eggshells are on the ground
and i try im trying to pick them up
but they crack and crumble its all too much
too frail for me to touch

verse 2
ill live in the bathtub
surrounded by tiles
all so square and so steady
i will die in their cool cool arms
i broke what you gave me
but you kept giving more
and im sorry for taking
but i keep wanting more more more oh

all the eggshells are on the ground
and i try im trying to pick them up
but they crack and crumble its all too much
too frail for me to touch
all the eggshells are on the ground
and i try im trying to pick them up
but humpty dumpty youre much too much
too frail for me to touch
