verse 1 william
hey baby my nose is gettin big
i noticed it be growin when i be tellin them fibs now
you say your trusts gettin weaker
probably cause my lies just started gettin deeper
and the reason for my confession is that i learned my lesson
and i really think you ought to know the truth
because i lied and i cheated and i lied a little more
but after i did it i dont know what i did it for
i admit that ive been a little immature
with your heart like i was the predator
in my book of lies i was the editor
and the author i forged my signature
and now i apologize for what i did to ya
cause what you did to me i did to you

chorus fergie
no no no no baby no no no no dont lie
cause you know know know know
yeah you know know know know you gotta try
what you gonna do when it all comes out
when i really see you what youre all about
no no no no baby no no no no dont lie
cause you know you know you know you know
you know you gotta try stop ststop stop ststop stop lying

she said im leaving
cause she cant take the pain
its hard to continue this love it aint the same
cant forget the things that ive done inside her brain
too many lies committed too many games
she feelin like a fool gettin on the last train
tryna maintain but the feeling wont change
im sorry for the things that ive done and what i became
caught up in living my life in the fast lane
blinded by lights cameras you know the fame
i dont know the reason why i did these things

prechorus 1 apldeap fergie william
oh and i lie and i lie and i lie and i lie
and now our emotions are drained
cause i lie and i lie and a little lie lie
and now your emotions are drained
