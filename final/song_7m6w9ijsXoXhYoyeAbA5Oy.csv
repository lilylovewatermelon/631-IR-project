i was young but i wasnt naive
i watched helpless as he turned around to leave
and still i have the pain i have to carry
a past so deep that even you could not bury if you tried

chorus
after all this time
i never thought wed be here
never thought wed be here
when my love for you was blind
but i couldnt make you see it
couldnt make you see it
that i loved you more than youll ever know
a part of me died when i let you go

verse 2
i would fall asleep
only in hopes of dreaming
that everything would be like it was before
but nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting
they disappear as reality is crashing to the floor
