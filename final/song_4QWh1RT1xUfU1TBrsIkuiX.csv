down upon your hands and knees
underneath the poplar trees
digging through the sticks and stones
looking for store bought bones

waiting on the rising sun
clutching at your holstered gun
praying on a shooting star
that i can be wherever you are

verse 2
looking through a telescope
maybe theres a sign of hope
leaving everything behind
stirring a store bought mind

sitting at the edge of the seat
wishing you were here by me
sifting through the mud and the bricks
looking for a store bought fix

outro
you cant buy what you cant find
what you cant buy what you find
what you cant buy what you can
you cant buy what you cant find what you can
