lord let me tell you about a place where we all used to go
turn down towards goose island keep your eyelids on the road
cause theres boys in the hills and theyre getting lost tonight
and the girls in their cars are all gettin high

verse 2
i use to hang around a rowdy crowd out in the rogers
siren sounds aint nothing boys as long as you can dodge her
and i had no idea this damn road got so curvy
you said brother this roads straight
youre just drunk and its gettin early

chorus
so wont you count em up now count em up
all the people that ive let down
wont you round em up now round em up
all the liars in this town
cause im coming home and im toeing the line
i just hope those boys i used to know
are all doing fine doing fine

verse 2
i remember those old trains they made noises like a steam boat
and we would throw our rocks at them like some assholes with some high hopes
cant get back those aimless nights that we all claim is ours
i guess well never die up there with all those ever shining stars
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
so wont you count em up now count em up
all the people that ive let down
wont you round em up now round em up
all the liars in this town
cause im coming home and im toeing the line
i just hope those boys i used to know
are all doing fine doing fine

outro
lord let me tell you about a place where we all used to go
turn down towards goose island
keep your eyelids on the road1embed"
