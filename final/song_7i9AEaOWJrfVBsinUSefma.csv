im not a bad guy
so don’t treat me bad if im feelin sad alright
please don’t be mad if i dont smile back alright
if i fuck up my words dont think im absurd alright
alright

prechorus
im physically exhausted
tired of my knuckles beatin
im chewin gum to pass this time of sadness
can’t you see it
you’re too busy seekin selfish wishes
don’t care how im feelin
you write me up and say its love
and i can’t believe it

chorus
baby can you meet me tonight in detention
i can feel your blood pressure rise fuck this tension
let me crawl up into your mind did i mention
pretending everythings alright is detention
