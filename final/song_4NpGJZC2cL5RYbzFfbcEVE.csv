how the hell does a broken heart
get back together when it’s torn apart
teach itself to start
beating again babababa

verse 1
this little blue bird
came looking for you
i said that i hadn’t seen you
in quite some time
this little blue bird
she came looking again
i said we weren’t even friends
she could have you

prechorus
don’t you think it was hard
i didn’t even say that you died
but it wouldn’t have been such a lie
cause then i started to cry

verse 2
this little blue bird
sure won’t give it a rest
she swears that you may be better than all the rest
i said no you’ve got it all wrong
if he was something special i wouldn’t have this song
you might also likeprechorus
don’t you think it was hard
i didn’t even say that you died
but it wouldn’t have been such a lie
cause then i started to cry

chorus
how the hell does a broken heart
get back together when it’s torn apart
teach itself to start
beating again babababa

bridge
what if when she comes over i am in your arms
taking all i want from you again
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

chorus
how the hell does a broken heart
get back together when it’s torn apart
teach itself to start
beating again babababa

how the hell does a broken heart
get back together when it’s torn apart
teach itself to start
beating again babababa
beating again babababa
outro
this little blue bird
don’t come around here anymore
so i went looking for her
and i found you4embed"
