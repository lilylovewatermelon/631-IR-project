chorus
well you only need the light when its burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know youve been high when youre feeling low
only hate the road when youre missing home
only know you love her when you let her go

postchorus
and you let her go

verse 1
staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day youll make a dream last
but dreams come slow and they go so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day youll understand why
everything you touch surely dies

chorus
but you only need the light when its burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know youve been high when youre feeling low
only hate the road when youre missing home
only know you love her when you let her go

staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
well you see her when you fall asleep
but never to touch and never to keep
cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

chorus
well you only need the light when its burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know youve been high when youre feeling low
only hate the road when youre missing home
only know you love her when you let her go

postchorus
and you let her go oh woah mm oh
and you let her go oh woah uh no
well you let her go

chorus
cause you only need the light when its burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know youve been high when youre feeling low
only hate the road when youre missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
outro
cause you only need the light when its burning low
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
only know you love her when you let her go
only know youve been high when youre feeling low
only hate the road when youre missing home
only know you love her when you let her go
and you let her go343embed"
