verse 1 natalie marsha floetry
said im concerned that i feel this pain
my heart is aching breaking
painstaking in this gambling thing
this aint no parallel universe
parallel life you choose two
in one youre living like love of my life
and in the other youre the daddy of theirs
so i play russian roulette and put this phone to my ear
just to say hey yo

see too much asked of me through his lips
so i attempted to be all that dreams suggest
to the ego and promise the soul
i tried to be all he had ever told
of the interchangeable face and physicality
and mentality she she as closely near
he summoned all my tears and abandoned we
i lived alone for years
no longer knowing who exactly is me me eheh
as i began the punishment for his perfection
my vision nearly lost the direction
my return to innocence was lost
and his id you see i forgot and
instead i saw protection through judgment
now angels and devils look alike to me
but sometimes quiet sounds like lonely to me

bridge marsha natalie
my my angel i stopped breathing for you
if my life was possible without air yeah yeah
to be sure of love yeah yeah
im needing more than just a casual affair
but the pain runs deep internally
but clearly seen when youre not there
chorus marsha
its better that it hurts that it hurts
its better that it feels this way to me
i cant be too comfortable comfortable no no no
cause loving you is not my destiny destiny
its better that it hurts that it hurts
its better that it feels this way to me to me ay
i cant be too comfortable comfortable loving you is not
cause loving you is not my destiny destiny yeah
