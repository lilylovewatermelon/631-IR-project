when i was a curlyheaded baby
my daddy sat me down upon his knee
he said boy you go to school and learn your letters
dont you be a dirty miner like me

chorus
i was born and raised in the mouth of the hazard hollow
coal cars rambled past my door
now theyre standing in a rusty row all empty
and the l and n dont stop here anymore

verse 2
i used to think my daddy was a black man
with script enough to buy the company store
now he goes downtown with empty pockets
and his face is white as a february snow

chorus
i was born and raised in the mouth of the hazard hollow
coal cars rambled past my door
now theyre standing in a rusty row all empty
and the l and n dont stop here anymore

last night i dreamed i went down to the coal yard
to draw my pay like i always did before
but them old kudzu vines were coming through the windows
and leaves and grass were growing through the floor

chorus
i was born and raised in the mouth of the hazard hollow
coal cars rambled past my door
now theyre standing in a rusty row all empty
and the l and n dont stop here anymoreembed"
