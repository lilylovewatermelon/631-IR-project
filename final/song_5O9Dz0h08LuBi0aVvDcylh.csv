i am a nation i am a million faces
formed together made for relevation
i am a soldier i wont surrender
faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
whos gonna stand up whos gonna fight
the voice of the unheard
whos gonna break these chains and lies
love is the answer
i gotta speak it believe it thats how i feel inside
i i cant cant sit here quiet

prechorus jen ledger
you can take my heart you can take my breath
when you pry it from my cold dead chest

chorus john cooper
this is how we rise up
heavy as a hurricane louder than a freight train
this is how we rise up
heart is beating faster feels like thunder
magic static call me a fanatic
its our world they can never have it
this is how we rise up
its our resistance you cant resist us

hey can you hear me hey are you listening
sleeping in the shadows could be making history
walk through the fire walk on the water
used to be a slave but now you are a conqueror

prechorus jen ledger
they can take my heart they can take my breath
when they pry it from my cold dead chest

chorus john cooper
this is how we rise up
heavy as a hurricane louder than a freight train
this is how we rise up
heart is beating faster feels like thunder
magic static call me a fanatic
its our world they can never have it
this is how we rise up
its our resistance you cant resist us

love is the answer
rising up up up up up
were rising up up up up up
love is the answer
this is how we rise up
its our resistance you cant resist us
chorus john cooper
this is how we rise up
heavy as a hurricane louder than a freight train
this is how we rise up
heart is beating faster feels like thunder
magic static call me a fanatic
its our world they can never have it

its our resistance you cant resist us22embed"
