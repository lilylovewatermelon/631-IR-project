i could never earn your heart
i could never reach that far
but you have pulled me close
youve never let me go
im safe forever in your arms
your promises i can not break
and i know you will never change

your love is your love is your love is loyal
your love is your love is your love is loyal
more faithful than the rising sun
this grace for me i cant outrun
your love is your love is your love is loyal

verse 2
you are always there for me
you listen every time i speak
you look into my eyes
you see the things i hide
and say that you will never leave
your promises i can not break
and i know you will never change

chorus
your love is your love is your love is loyal
your love is your love is your love is loyal
more faithful than the rising sun
this grace for me i cant outrun
your love is your love is your love is loyal
