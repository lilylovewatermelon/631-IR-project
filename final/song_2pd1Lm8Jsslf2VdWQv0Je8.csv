privileged a chosen few
blessed with our time in hell
witness a divine vision
the day we all fell still
rapture of the dying age
a shattered hourglass
wrath of the warring gods
and so this too shall pass

verse 2
its only getting worse
not worth a moments regret
each dawn another curse
every breath a twisting blade
what will be left behind
in the ashes of the wake

verse 3
an ill wind blows this way
the edge of the envelope burns
forbearance and my vengeance
payment for your intent
fear and death in the wings
in thrall of those fallen from grace
petty is as petty does
witness the mass disgrace
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likebridge
fear and death in the wings
in thrall of those fallen from grace
petty is as petty does
witness the mass disgrace

verse 4
god forbid you read the signs
watch for meanings between the lines
gehenna has now arrived
no hindsight for the blind
your trust has been misplaced
believed the lies told to your face
became another casualty
and now its too late

verse 5
you finally made it home
draped in the flag that you fell for
and so it goes
the ashes of the wake

outro
its only getting worse
its only getting worse
its only getting worse
its only getting worse
its only getting worse2embed"
