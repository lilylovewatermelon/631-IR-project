do my hair up real real nice
and syncopate my skin to your heart beating

verse 3 aap rocky
hold on take a minute love
cause i aint trying to fuck your image up
like we mess around in triple cuffs
stumble round town pull your zipper up
pants sag like i dont give a
i aint trying to fuck your business up
and i aint trying to get you into stuff
but the way you touchin on me in the club
rubbin on my miniature
john hancock fuck the signature
any time i hit it know she finna fall through
and every time we get up always end up on the news
aint worried bout no press and aint worried bout the next bitch
they love the way you dress and aint got shit up on you
jackpot hit the jackpot
just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
you look good girl you know you did good dont you
you look good girl bet it feel good dont it
chorus selena gomez
cause i just wanna look good for you good for you
baby let me be good to you good to you
let me show you how proud i am to be yours
leave this dress a mess on the floor
and still look good for you good for you
