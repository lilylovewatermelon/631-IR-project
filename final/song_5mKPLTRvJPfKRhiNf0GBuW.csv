two three

verse 1
i i am as ugly as i seem
worse than all your dreams
could ever make me out to be
and it makes me want to scream
when its halloween
and the kids are laughing
the rogue is a bank hes never broke
but worth as much as a joke
that no one is laughing at

instrumental chorus

verse 2
can you believe some things are not
appealing and theres a spot
on the ceiling of my childhood bedroom
and can these dreams you cant imagine
no never match the vision
that you had decided for me
you are to take away from me
things that are mine and its not your right
i bet you wouldnt expect a fight oh
can it be that i dont want what you want
and the only thing i could care for
is a place in a home that is safe and warm safe and warm
safe and warm safe and warm

instrumental chorus

verse 3
judge yourself if you feel the need
just let me known to be
in search of the truth myself
there is a drop of blood on the ground
and it seems to me that its not my kind
and i cant be sure if its yours or mine

outro
i am as ugly as i seem
worse than all your dreams
could ever make me
could ever make me
could ever make me
could ever make me2embed"
