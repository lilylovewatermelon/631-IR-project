what if staying with me isnt the best way to keep you happy
and if letting you go is the best way to show that i love you i will

but wont hold you if its wrong

you know i wont force you to stay
dont want you to go but ill be okay
and ill love you always

prechorus
ill be broken when youre gone
but someday well both be moving on

chorus
i dont care what people say
you know i wont force you to stay
dont want you to go but ill be okay
and ill love you
