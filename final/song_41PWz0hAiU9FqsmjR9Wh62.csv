sometime wanna be your lover sometime wanna be your friend
sometime wanna hug you hold hands slow dance while the record spins
opened up your heart cause you said i made you feel so comfortable
used to play back then now you all grown up like rudy huxtable
i could be your bud you could beat me up
play fight in the dark then we both make up
id do anything just to feel your butt
why you got me so messed up
i dont know but you gotta stop tripping
be a good girl now turn around and get these whippings
you know you like it like that

and ill be setting separate plays
so on all these separate days
your legs can go they separate ways
