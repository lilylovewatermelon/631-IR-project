how come you dont make time for me anymore
thats the last thing she said to you
and now when you call she dont answer anymore
or the line is busy and you cant get through

chorus
in the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
in the time it would take to dial the phone
in the time it will take you to realize her greatness
shell be gone shes moved on
to someone who takes the time

verse 2
her love wasnt a priority to you
you had other things on your mind
and now that its much to little and so far too late
the busy signals all thats left behind
youre all alone

chorus
in the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
in the time it would take to dial the phone
in the time it will take you to realize her greatness
shell be gone shes moved on
to someone who takes the time

hey no one knows what they have until they dont
and by then it doesnt matter anymore
youre all alone

chorus
in the time it would take you to learn from your mistakes
in the time it would take to dial the phone
and the time it would take you to realize her greatness
shell be gone shell be gone
in the time it will take you to realize her greatness
shell be gone shes moved on
hang up the phone1embed"
