one look sends it coursin through the veins oh how the feelin races
back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
they dont want to say hello like i want to say hello
well the heartbeats at its peak when youre coming up to speak

hook 1
and oh im so tense never tenser could all go a bit frank spencer
and im talkin gibberish tip of the tongue but i cant deliver it
properly oh its all gettin on top of me
and if it werent this dark youd see how red my face has gone yeah

verse 2
everybodys tryin to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
those that claim that theyre not showin off are drownin in denial
but theyre not half as bad as me say anything and ill agree
cause when it comes to acting up im sure i could write the book

hook 2
and now that youre more than a part in the play
its slightly easier to think what to say
you had us all standin on our heads
doing our best tricks yeah

outro
never again well never again no
will there be another one quite as desirable as you
one look sends it coursin through the veins oh how the feeling races
back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid facesyou might also like8embed"
