i guess that i was scared of what i was before us
i guess that i was scared of who i was before love

prechorus
but now that i found it again
finding myself in the wreckage
wondering where i have been
guess you were my only blemish
and now i see the things that i tried to hide
and now i see the things that bring me to life

chorus
and for the first time i dont mind
that you found somebody else
and for the first time im totally fine being by myself
and for the first time i dont mind
that you found somebody else
and for the first time im totally fine being by myself

verse 2
i guess i thought i was my best when i was with you
i guess that lonely was my only way to break through

prechorus
but now that i found it again
finding myself in the wreckage
wondering where i have been
guess you were my only blemish
and now i see the things that i tried to hide
and now i see the things that bring me to life
