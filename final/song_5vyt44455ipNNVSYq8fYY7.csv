hallelujah
the young king sings a song for the lover the leaver the lonely alike
young love waits if i cant then ill meet you at the gate of saint peter when the fever takes my mind
my god she came singing my name sounded like rain on the mountain where i burn alive
young flame burn soft as a candle lit between our two hearts just beats apart in the dark

chorus 1
spent my summer riding high high on the whiplash
head back
blowing through the leaves
growing up a preacher was all you ever dreamed

chorus 2
i got the holy roll
i got the holy roll
i felt the fever grip when i needed it close and
im at the fever pitch
not quite but nearing it
cant feed the fever yet im saving up my daily measurement

verse 2
im at the grocery store
im buying eggs and toast
im looking at you and not where i walk bout broke my nose facing doors
dont let the fever get you
got got already
lost my soul in the seventh heaven making out on aisle eleven

spent my summer riding high high on the whiplash
head back
blowing through the leaves
growing up a preacher was always just a dream
all you ever needed were lines you could believe
sing them to me sweetly
only just a dream

well i know you cant walk
with them heels in the dark

let me get to know you
well i dont know nothin

i think i could get you in a minute or two
