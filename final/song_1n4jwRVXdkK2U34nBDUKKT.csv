is it wickedness
is it weakness
you decide
are we gonna live or die

verse kendrick lamar
so i was takin a walk the other day
and i seen a woman—a blind woman
pacin up and down the sidewalk
she seemed to be a bit frustrated
as if she had dropped somethin and
havin a hard time findin it
so after watchin her struggle for a while
i decide to go over and lend a helping hand you know
hello maam can i be of any assistance
it seems to me that you have lost something
i would like to help you find it
she replied oh yes you have lost something
youve lost… your life
gunshot

bridge bēkon
