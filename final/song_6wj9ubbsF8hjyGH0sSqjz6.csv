im the serpent here to test you with forbidden fruit
i love the look on your face when im tempting you
this is a part of me you begged to let you see
a part of me thatll do anything to get what i need
maybe im sick maybe im already dead
cause im not really scared of what comes next
maybe im sick maybe im fucked in the head
cause im not really scared of the consequence

chorus
play with fire and youll get burned
everybody rolls the dice and its your turn
you put the gun to your head all i did was pull the trigger
so dont ask for my pity when im not the only sinner

verse 2
its a trick its a trap the evils not in my head
id like to think that its my ugly human nature instead
because i dont feel remorse for the things that i did
but i pray i have the chance to do them all again

interlude
the path to god led me astray
so the devil came and lit the way yeah

im the reason you dont trust im the reason you dont feel right
i tore you apart and i still sleep just fine
im the reason you dont trust im the reason you dont feel right
i tore you apart and i still sleep just fine
yeah i still sleep just fine

chorus
play with fire and youll get burned
everybody rolls the dice and its your turn
you put the gun to your head all i did was pull the trigger
so dont ask for my pity when im not the only sinner
play with fire and youll get burned
everybody rolls the dice and its your turn
you put the gun to your head all i did was pull the trigger
so dont ask for my pity when im not the only sinner cunt3embed"
