i want what i want how i want when i want it
i’ma keep it a hunnid i’m blunted
i don’t give a damn i don’t give a fuck about another man
fuck a brother man
i’ma make it make it rain like the weather man
old girl shoulda shoulda got a better man
ass fat lookin good in my letterman
in the hood i’m a better man
wish a mothafucka would would
whole life i been up to no good
change it all if i could
rearrange my heart the beat good but i can’t
i’m a sinner not a saint
layers to my life no i can’t
cover it up with paint
keep on livin livin
livin on money and women
as soon as i’m in em i’m out
now the truth never come out my mouth
speak life when i come in her mouth like

refrain
i’m a dirty mothafucka a waste of life a waste of skin
wanna repent don’t know where to begin
next of kin don’t give a damn bout me
i know god don’t give a damn bout me
people try but don’t know bout me
but the devil said that he want my soul
but the devil said that he want my soul
give it to me right now

verse 2
i’d rather be a different man in another world
than work for the man in my universe
wonder what it feel like to take flight
momma told me everything gon be alright
i mean my life can’t be off right
but come to think about it
everybody runnin the world seem to be all white
can you mothafuckas see alright
i mean i need it i want it i gotta have it
every day tragic
if you’re from where i’m from everyday ain’t magic
on this i know
i been telling everybody i’ma give it a go i know
i been there before feel it in my soul oh i know
love it or hate it i made it
i did it i lived it
while the whole world lookin at the boy like whoa
baptized in a ocean of hennessey
really wonder what the remedy
tell me how the world gon remember me
got me feelin like the enemy
like i ain’t got no energy
i been lookin for an entity
feelin like i need to chill like i need a new amenity
fuck all that
refrain
i’m a dirty mothafucka a waste of life
a waste of skin
wanna repent don’t know where to begin
next of kin don’t give a damn bout me
i know god don’t give a damn bout me
people try but don’t know bout me
but the devil said that he want my soul
but the devil said that he want my soul
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now

chorus
somebody save me
i need you to save me
to wash away my sins on high

bridge
i know my life was lived the wrong way
i know i did you wrong in my own way
but it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
that hypnotized the only
part of me you loved
part of me that had the strength to rise above
part of me you know
part of me you love more than to let it go
outro killer mike
dear god i just wanna know why
why do you put us here
why do you put us below
why do you put us subservient
why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers
and then we crawl and we scratch our way out
we betray each other
we lie we take from one another
and we told you gon forgive us at the end
but the state dont forgive us
im locked up and half my friends
and then when i get out or i make it out
im expected to somehow give back
to people who never wanted to see me escape
im startin to hate the man in the mirror
and its gettin clearer
that society was designed to keep me on the bottom
so if you real if youre out there for real
please explain to me why
why do we suffer why do we die
and why do the people
who go against everything you ever said always get ahead
ive done so much wrong i dont know if i can ever be right
but tonight i am in this church
asking you to show yourself to reveal yourself to me
because im tired and i dont know what else to do
so black im blue so brown im down
i done been everywhere but up and when i finally get up
i am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
and all i wanna do is believe in you
the darker you are the closer you are to dirt
and they make sure it hurts
and i am tired of hurtin man
im tired of bein looked at second guessed doubted feared
so if you out there do something about this
cause i cant take it no more
