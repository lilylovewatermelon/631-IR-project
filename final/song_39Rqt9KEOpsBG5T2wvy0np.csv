i found a way i could catch that feel good
skies been turnin fires been burnin since 93
wait just a moment i can drop my values
skies been turnin fires been burnin since 17

chorus
travelin so far to get there
all just to be here again
all just to see what they saw back then

verse 2
i think its time that you crawl back home son
fires still scorchin youve been scorned and you look abused
did you get out all of that angry passion
is it still formin has it started to torture you

chorus
travelin so far to get there
all just to be here again
all just to see what they saw back then

bridge
well you could put it all on me
oh you could put it all on me
oh you could put it all on me
