verse 1
now i done grew up round some people livin their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feel some people wanna kill their sorrow
some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
i was in a dark room loud tunes lookin to make a vow soon
that ima get fucked up fillin up my cup i see the crowd mood
changin by the minute and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

chorus
nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots
ima show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
pool full of liquor then you dive in it
i wave a few bottles then i watch em all flock
all the girls wanna play baywatch
i got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
popool full of liquor ima dive in it

i think that im feelin the vibe i see the love in her eyes
i see the feelin the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived

by what you are doin i thought i was doin the most til someone said to me

verse 3
all i—all i—all i—
all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane tell me do that sound familiar
if it do then youre like me makin excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open i release everything that corrode inside of me
i see you jokin why you laugh dont you feel bad i probly sleep
and never ever wake up never ever wake up never ever wake up
in god i trust but just when i thought i had enough

skit
they stomped the homie out over a bitch
kdot you good blood
now we can drop ye we can drop you back off
that niggas straight man that nigga aint trippin
we gon do the same ol shit
ima pop a few shots they gon ru—they run opposite way
fall right in s lap
and he gon tear they ass up simple as that
and i hope that bitch that set him up out there
we gon pop that bitch too
wait hold up ayy i see somebody
car door opens and gunshots are fired
aha got them niggas kdot you good
