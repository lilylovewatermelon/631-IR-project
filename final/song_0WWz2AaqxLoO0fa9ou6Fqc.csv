when i was a young boy i tried to listen
and i wanna feel like that
little white shadows blink and miss them
part of a system i am

verse 2
if you ever feel like somethings missing
things youll never understand
little white shadows sparkle and glisten
part of a system a plan

prechorus
all this noise im waking up
all this space im taking up
all this sound is breaking up
ohhhhhhhh

chorus
maybe youll get what you wanted
maybe youll stumble upon it
everything you ever wanted
in a permanent state
maybe youll know when you see it
maybe if you say it youll mean it
and when you find it youll keep it
in a permanent state a permanent state

outro
swimming on a sea of faces tide of the human races
