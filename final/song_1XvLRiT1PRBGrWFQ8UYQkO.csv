verse 1 jayz
if i shoot you im brainless
different toilet same shit and im sick of explainin this
im waitin on arraignment my nigga is the plaintiff
yeah i know what you thinkin  fucked up aint it
i shoulda known better and i planned to
but dog they be takin me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle
i sat back and watched it put the gats back in the closet
they tried to tie my hands like an iraqi hostage
let niggas take shots at me no response
i just flip and pop my collar like the fonz
you give a nigga a foot hell take you one step beyond
hell try to play you twice the third time is the charm
you wanna conversate with the writer of the quran
or old testament dont test him then
i know what yall thinkin dick pause

i know when youre schemin i feel when you plottin

verse 2 jayz
you see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin
and i only use his waist to keep my glock in
but when shit goes down you know whos doing the poppin
and if you dont know guess whos doin the droppin
s dot again yall got him in a bad mood
bad move thats bad news
how many times have i got to prove
how many loved ones have you got to lose
before you realize that its probably true
whatever jigga say jigga probably do
shit i paid my dues i made the news
i came in the door for dolo blazed the crews
and the streets say jigga cant go back home
you know when i heard that when i was back home
im comfortable dog brooklyn to rome
on any martin luther dont part with your future
dont ever question if i got the heart to shoot ya
the answer is simply too dark for the user
and as a snotnose they said that he got flows
but will he be able to drop those before the cops close in
fore the shots froze him and hes dead and gone
from what the block has spoken my god
everybody stressin whos his babys moms
who he got pregnant let me tell you ahh
chorus jayz

verse 3 jayz
i seen my first murder in the hall if you must know
i lost my pops when i was eleven mmm twelve years old
hes probably somewhere where the liquor is takin its toll
but i aint mad at you dad holla at your lad
i grew up pushin snowflake to niggas that was probase
the stressll take a young nigga give him a old face
all i did was smoke joke think and drink
copped caine and complained front row watch game
i seen niggas before me with a chance to write they own script
slip up and change the story
i seen young niggas go out in a blaze of glory
before reachin puberty scared a nigga truthfully
i took trips with so much shit in the whip
that if the cops pulled us over the dogd get sick sniff
smell me nigga the real me nigga minus the rumors
holla if you feel me nigga
verse 4 beanie sigel
the streets is not only watchin but they talkin now
shit they got me circlin the block before im parkin now
dont get it twisted i aint bitchin im just cautious now
sub under the parka extra cartridge now
hit his click sig up you fell at it youre dense
i get word to the street like bell atlantic and sprint
i feel the vibes and i hear the rumors
but fuck it im still alive and im still in jumuah i know stafallah
niggas wanna press me put my back to the wall
but pressure bust pipes i know i spat it to yall
to know mes to love me you see me cant be me hate this
fuck you i got guns like neo in matrix
cross the family think macs sweet like karo
or soft like playdoh get knocked off like fredo corleone
they find you with a hole in your dome
i roll with niggas thatll follow you and go to your home
thought you ball but nigga you fall to my defense
catch you while you reachin
clip you then i cross you then im leavin
apply full court pressure
like 44 taurus get you out of here pull pressure
to the trigger bullets fly in threes
you forever rest under bullshit dirt lies and leaves
i do bullshit dirt tell lies then leave
look in my eyes realize its beans
niggas wanna despise the team til i play head coach
and straight up divide they team
trade they man for some pies and a couple of things
til the bullet ah motherfuckers yeah2embed"
