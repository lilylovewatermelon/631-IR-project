tomorrow im gonna leave here
im gonna let you go and walk away
like every day i said i would
and tomorrow im gonna listen
to that voice of reason inside my head
telling me that were no good

chorus
but tonight im gonna give in one last time
rock you strong in these arms of mine
forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
were like fire and gasoline
im no good for you youre no good for me
we only bring each other tears and sorrow
but tonight im gonna love you like theres no

verse 2
tomorrow ill be stronger
im not gonna break down and call you up
when my heart cries out for you
and tomorrow you wont believe it
but when i pass your house i wont stop
no matter how bad i want to

chorus
but tonight im gonna give in one last time
rock you strong in these arms of mine
forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
were like fire and gasoline
im no good for you youre no good for me
we only bring each other tears and sorrow
but tonight im gonna love you like theres no
