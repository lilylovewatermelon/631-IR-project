we drank our beer in the basement
so no one would know
we didnt care where the days went
had nowhere to go center point road
when everything was about a kiss
and clouds just looked like battleships
helmets crashin on the field
and we thought every love was real

chorus thomas rhett
we wrote our own destiny
in parkin lots and empty streets
yeah we got high on you and me
jumped over cracks beneath our feet
and we thought it would never end
then watched it go like summer wind
when growin up was just a dream
and friday night was everything

verse 2 kelsea ballerini
yeah we didnt worry bout nothin
we had it all yeah
and bein the fastest was somethin
runnin the halls breakin the law
life was about the party the party yeah
who you are and who youre with
drinkin til your head was sorry
oh and dancin for the hell of it yeah
