paranoia is in bloom the pr transmissions will resume
theyll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
and hope that we will never see the truth around
so come on

verse 2
another promise another seed
another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
and all the green belts wrapped around our minds
and endless red tape to keep the truth confined
so come on

chorus
they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
and we will be victorious
so come on

verse 3
interchanging mind control
come let the revolution take its toll
if you could flick a switch and open your third eye
youd see that we should never be afraid to die
so come on

rise up and take the power back
its time the fat cats had a heart attack
you know that their times coming to an end
we have to unify and watch our flag ascend
so come on

chorus
they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
and we will be victorious
so come on
