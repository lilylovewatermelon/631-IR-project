heaven knows that im born too late
for these ghosts that i chase
with these dreams i inflate painted skies in my brain
every day im carl sagan in space
to escape this old world this old world
some days i lie wide awake til the sun hits my face
and i fade elevate from the earth
far away to a place where im free from the weight
this old world this old world

prechorus
i dont trust anything
or anyone below the sun
and i dont feel anything
at all

chorus
im king of the clouds of the clouds
i get lifted i get lifted
king of the clouds of the clouds
i get lifted i get lifted

verse 2
some only live to die im alive to fly higher
than angels in outfields inside of my mind
im ascendin these ladders im climbin say goodbye
this old world this old world
and when i fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
in the backbone of night im combustible
dust in the fire when i cant sleep a wink im too tired
this old world this old world

chorus
im king of the clouds of the clouds
i get lifted i get lifted
king of the clouds of the clouds

im lost but i better find it alone
king of the clouds of the clouds
i get lifted i get lifted
