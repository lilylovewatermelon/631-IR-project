motivation is lacking the point starts to fade
i look to the bottom still empty still the same
im waiting for something to show me the way

to the path that i should take its just too real to go ahead and fake
every step that i make
name your price i would give anything i would give anything
i i want to start over again

what do i want i have nothing to say
whatever it is i want it today
do we choose our own ground do we choose to stay
well ive seen too many throw it away

do i see just one small chance to be myself to try to make it last
every step that i make
name your price i would give anything i would give anything
i i want to start over again

name your price cause i dont feel so lucky
am i the only one

why dont you show me
why dont you show me
see trapt liveget tickets as low as 36you might also liketo the path that i should take its just to real to go ahead and fake
every step that i make
name your price i would give anything i would give anything
i i want to start over again

name your price cause i dont feel so right
am i the only one

name your price cause i dont feel so right
am i the only oneembed"
