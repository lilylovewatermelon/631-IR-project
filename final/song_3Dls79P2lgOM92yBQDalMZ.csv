your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started to sink
dragged further away from the shore
and deeper into the drink

verse 2
sat on the bottom of the ocean
a stern and stubborn rock
your songs remind me of swimming
but somehow i forgot

verse 3
i was sinking and now im sunk
i was drinking and now im drunk
your songs remind me of swimming
but somehow i forgot

verse 4
i tried to remember the chorus
i cant remember the verse
cause that song that sent me a swimming
is now the life jacket that burst

verse 5
rotting like a wreck on the ocean floor
sinkin like a siren that cant swim any more
your songs remind me of swimming
but i cant swim anymore

pull me out the water cold and blue
i open my eyes and see that its you
so ill dive straight back in the ocean
yes ill dive straight back in the ocean

verse 7
take a deep breath suck the water in my chest
take a deep breath suck the water in my chest
then cross my fingers
and hope for the best

bridge
then all of a sudden i heard a note
it started in my chest and ended in my throat oh
then i realised
then i realised
then i realised
i was swimming
yes i was swimming
and now im swimming
yes i am swimming

outro
your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started to sink
your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started to sink
oh your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started
your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started
to sink11embed"
