learned how to rap as a little boy
took a lot of crap as a little boy
always had to fight back as a little boy
always under attack as a little boy
never got good grades as a little boy
i was locked in a cage as a little boy
still i never was afraid as a little boy
i was feeling my rage as a little boy
its time to blow their minds

verse 2
learned how to lose as an older man
sang a lot of blues as an older man
but i saw it all through as an older man
put together my crew as an older man
felt a lot of pain as an older man
i established my name as an older man
people piss on my game as an older man
aint nothin gonna change as an older man

prechorus

verse 3
got treated like a clown as a little boy
kept my feet on the ground as a little boy
when youre living in a dream as a little boy
aint nothin like it seems as a little boy
i was hatin on the world as a little boy
i was lovin all the girls as a little boy
i was into punk rock as a little boy
i was breaking nonstop as a little boy
its time to blow their minds

verse 4
got treated like a chump as an older man
mixing rock with the funk as an older man
learned what a girl was as an older man
now i know how to love as an older man
but im still a big kid as an older man
and id much rather give as an older man
still im singing in the rain as an older man
aint nothin gonna change as an older man
