intro just blaze
and the prophecy read
that one day like the phoenix arose from the ashes
that a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
this boy will go on to use the knowledge he gained
while fighting for survival in the streets
to become a great leader
and in time that boy will grow to become
king

verse 1 ti
i welcome you to get acquainted with the youngest in charge
respected from east to west like he was running the mob
dictating aint taking orders from no one but god
i know you niggas is broke cause i know what you charge
you niggas wishing for a phantom its one in my garage
its black as legary right next to the platinum ferrari
you niggas aint getting money off of rapping im sorry
fucked the rent up went and spent up 60 large on a harley
is where you stay 10000 square feet not hardly
now you see that we aint able to compete now are we
ayy pardon me—im giving you the west side story
of the a where i stay niggas stay down for me
wanna play at your gate niggas lay down for me
and get a order for killers to spray rounds for me ayy ayy

and thatll bring you up to speed nigga

verse 2 ti
who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
im number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
wishing to be in positions that you found that im in
since you niggas do what i say im worldrenowned as simon
if jay handled the clay and around the time
i deliver a bad day when fourfives is firing
i care the least about polices and the firemans siren
ambulances aint gon stand a chance at reviving hey
doa—that mean you be deceased upon em arriving
paramedics yell clear and your flatline silent
you aint ready for out here cause the lifestyle violent
think you is you must be living on fantasy island
you make us mad get your ass wiped out like thailand
hit for four like i went up and drained the three while you fouling
to say you want it with mes to go to war with the finest
need you be reminded want it with your highness
