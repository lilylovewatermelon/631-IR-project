called you on the phone today
just to ask you how you were
all i did was speak normally
somehow i still struck a nerve
you got me fucked up in the head boy
never doubted myself so much
like am i pretty am i fun boy
i hate that i give you power over that kinda stuff
chorus
cause its always one step forward and three steps back
im the love of your life until i make you mad
its always one step forward and three steps back
do you love me want me hate me
boy i dont understand
no i dont understand

verse 2
and maybe in some masochistic way
i kind of find it all exciting
like which lover will i get today
will you walk me to the door or send me home crying
chorus
its one step forward and three steps back
im the love of your life until i make you mad
its always one step forward and three steps back
do you love me want me hate me
boy i dont understand

no its back and forth did i say something wrong
its back and forth going over everything i said
its back and forth did i do something wrong
its back and forth maybe this is all your fault instead
chorus
its one step forward and three steps back
and id leave you but the rollercoasters all ive ever had
yeah its one step forward and three steps back
do you love me want me hate me
boy i dont understand
no i dont understand80embed"
