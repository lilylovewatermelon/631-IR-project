   to admit you to the little nucleus the little group the little clan at the verdurins one condition sufficed but that one was indispensable you must give tacit adherence to a creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist whom mme verdurin had taken under her patronage that year and of whom she said really it oughtnt to be allowed to play wagner as well as that left both planté and rubinstein sitting while dr cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than potain each new recruit whom the verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people in other houses than theirs were as dull as ditchwater saw himself banished forthwith women being in this respect more rebellious than men more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawingrooms might not sometimes be as entertaining and the verdurins feeling moreover that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might by their contagion prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church they had been obliged to expel one after another all those of the faithful who were of the female sex

   apart from the doctors young wife they were reduced almost exclusively that season for all that mme verdurin herself was a thoroughly good woman and came of a respectable middleclass family excessively rich and wholly undistinguished with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection to a young woman almost of a certain class a mme de crécy whom mme verdurin called by her christian name odette and pronounced a love and to the pianists aunt who looked as though she had at one period answered the bell ladies quite ignorant of the world who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the princesse de sagan and the duchesse de guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches in order to have anyone at their dinnerparties that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames the old doorkeeper and the woman of easy virtue would have contemptuously declined

   the verdurins never invited you to dinner you had your place laid there there was never any programme for the evenings entertainment the young pianist would play but only if he felt inclined for no one was forced to do anything and as m verdurin used to say were all friends here liberty hall you know

   if the pianist suggested playing the ride of the valkyries or the prelude to tristan mme verdurin would protest not that the music was displeasing to her but on the contrary that it made too violent an impression then you want me to have one of my headaches you know quite well its the same every time he plays that i know what im in for tomorrow when i want to get up—nothing doing if he was not going to play they talked and one of the friends—usually the painter who was in favour there that year—would spin as m verdurin put it a damned funny yarn that made em all split with laughter and especially mme verdurin for whom—so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions—dr cottard who was then just starting in general practice would really have to come one day and set her jaw which she had dislocated with laughing too much

   evening dress was barred because you were all good pals and didnt want to look like the boring people who were to be avoided like the plague and only asked to the big evenings which were given as seldom as possible and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known the rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little clan

   but just as the good pals came to take a more and more prominent place in mme verdurins life so the bores the nuisances grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her that made them sometimes plead previous engagements the mother of one the professional duties of another the little place in the country of a third if dr cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill i dont know mme verdurin would say im sure it will do him far more good if you dont go disturbing him again this evening he will have a good night without you tomorrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured from the beginning of december it would make her quite ill to think that the faithful might fail her on christmas and new years days the pianists aunt insisted that he must accompany her on the latter to a family dinner at her mothers

   you dont suppose shell die your mother exclaimed mme verdurin bitterly if you dont have dinner with her on new years day like people in the provinces

   her uneasiness was kindled again in holy week now you doctor youre a sensible broadminded man youll come of course on good friday just like any other day she said to cottard in the first year of the little nucleus in a loud and confident voice as though there could be no doubt of his answer but she trembled as she waited for it for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone

   i shall come on good friday—to say goodbye to you for we are going to spend the holidays in auvergne

   in auvergne to be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures a fine lot of good that will do you and after a solemn pause if you had only told us we would have tried to get up a party and all gone there together comfortably

   and so too if one of the faithful had a friend or one of the ladies a young man who was liable now and then to make them miss an evening the verdurins who were not in the least afraid of a womans having a lover provided that she had him in their company loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company would say very well then bring your friend along and he would be put to the test to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from mme verdurin whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the little clan if he failed to pass the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress but if the test proved satisfactory the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the faithful and so when in the course of this same year the courtesan told m verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman m swann and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come m verdurin carried the request at once to his wife he never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the faithful generally which he did with boundless ingenuity

   my dear mme de crécy has something to say to you she would like to bring one of her friends here a m swann what do you say
   why as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that be quiet no one asked your opinion i tell you that you are a piece of perfection

   just as you like replied odette in an affected tone and then went on you know im not fishing for compliments

   very well bring your friend if hes nice

   now there was no connection whatsoever between the little nucleus and the society which swann frequented and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while when occupying so exceptional a position in the world to seek an introduction to the verdurins but swann was so ardent a lover that once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy once they had taught him all that there was to learn he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers almost a patent of nobility which the faubourg saintgermain had bestowed upon him save as a sort of negotiable bond a letter of credit with no intrinsic value which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country or in some obscure quarter of paris where the goodlooking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy for at such times desire or love itself would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life although it was no doubt the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment with a brilliance which the name of swann by itself did not emit and he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and bounders that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated threefourths of the mental ingenuity displayed of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish have been aimed at inferiors and swann who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess would tremble for fear of being despised and would instantly begin to pose were he to meet her graces maid

   unlike so many people who either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death and are content in the end to describe as pleasures for want of any better those mediocre distractions that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming and these were as often as not women whose beauty was of a distinctly common type for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively and without reason were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters depth of character or a melancholy expression on a womans face would freeze his senses which would however immediately melt at the sight of healthy abundant rosy human flesh

   if on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know but among whom a woman caught his eye adorned with a special charm that was new to him to remain on his high horse and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if instead of visiting the country where he was he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at views of paris he did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations but had made of them so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless however enviable it might appear to others how often had his credit with a duchess built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her in an indiscreetly worded message for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread indeed when it was too late he would laugh at himself for it for there was in his nature redeemed by many rare refinements an element of clownishness then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness and who seek consolation and perhaps an excuse in the idea which their idleness offers to their intelligence of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning the idea that life contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written so at least he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world notably the baron de charlus whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him such as when he had met a woman in the train and had taken her home with him before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch in whose hands were gathered at that moment all the threads of european politics of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion or when in the complexity of circumstances it depended upon the choice which the conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebodys cook

   it was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers generals and academicians to whom he was bound by such close ties that swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders all his friends were accustomed to receive from time to time letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction with a diplomatic adroitness which persisting throughout all his successive affairs and using different pretexts revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest i used often to recall to myself when many years later i began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which in wholly different respects it offered to my own how when he used to write to my grandfather though not at the time we are now considering for it was about the date of my own birth that swanns great affair began and made a long interruption in his amatory practices the latter recognising his friends handwriting on the envelope would exclaim here is swann asking for something on guard and either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every sunday and whom they were obliged whenever swann mentioned her to pretend that they no longer saw although they would be wondering all through the week whom they could invite to meet her and often failed in the end to find anyone sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted

   occasionally a couple of my grandparents acquaintance who had been complaining for some time that they never saw swann now would announce with satisfaction and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be and was never out of their house my grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion but would look at my grandmother as he hummed the air of

              what is this mystery
              i cannot understand it

   or of

              vision fugitive
              in matters such as this
             tis best to close ones eyes

   a few months later if my grandfather asked swanns new friend what about swann do you still see as much of him as ever the others face would lengthen never mention his name to me again
   but i thought that you were such friends

   he had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother dining almost every evening at their house suddenly and without any warning he ceased to appear they supposed him to be ill and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when in her kitchen she found a letter in his hand which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book in this he announced that he was leaving paris and would not be able to come to the house again the cook had been his mistress and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform

   but when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society or at least one whose birth was not so lowly nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in society then for her sake he would return to it but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her no good depending on swann for this evening people would say dont you remember its his americans night at the opera he would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawingrooms to those houses where he himself went regularly for weekly dinners or for poker every evening after a slight wave imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle and then thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk whom he always treated exactly as he pleased would when he met them there lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary but whose substance pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst seemed to him beautiful and rare now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love

   but while each of these attachments each of these flirtations had been the realisation more or less complete of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which swann had spontaneously and without effort on his part found charming it was quite another matter when one day at the theatre he was introduced to odette de crécy by an old friend of his own who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction she had struck swann not certainly as being devoid of beauty but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent which aroused in him no desire which gave him indeed a sort of physical repulsion as one of those women of whom every man can name some and each will name different examples who are the converse of the type which our senses demand to give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp her skin too delicate her cheekbones too prominent her features too tightly drawn her eyes were fine but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask swann whether she might see his collections which would interest her so much she an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his home where she imagined him to be so comfortable with his tea and his books although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town which must be so depressing and was not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man and when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile but at the time of life tinged already with disenchantment which swann was approaching when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return this linking of hearts if it is no longer as in early youth the goal towards which love of necessity tends still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first in his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves later the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her and 50 at an age when it would appear—since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure—that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation love may come into being love of the most physical order without any foundation in desire at this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love it no longer evolves by itself obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws before his passive and astonished heart we come to its aid we falsify it by memory and by suggestion recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest since we possess its hymn engraved on our hearts in its entirety there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires for us to remember all that follows and if she begin in the middle where it sings of our existing henceforward for one another only we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner without hesitation at the first pause in her voice

   odette de crécy came again to see swann her visits grew more frequent and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval not remembering it as either so expressive or in spite of her youth so faded he used to regret while she was talking to him that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired it must be remarked that odettes face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks a single and almost plane surface were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period drawn forward in a fringe raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears while as for her figure and she was admirably built it was impossible to make out its continuity on account of the fashion then prevailing and in spite of her being one of the bestdressed women in paris for the corset jetting forwards in an arch as though over an imaginary stomach and ending in a sharp point beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts gave a woman that year the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together to such an extent did the frills the flounces the inner bodice follow in complete independence controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material the line which led them to the knots of ribbon falls of lace fringes of vertically hanging jet or carried them along the bust but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature who according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own found herself either straitlaced to suffocation or else completely buried

   but after odette had left him swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again he remembered the anxious timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long and the way in which she had looked at him then fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw tied with strings of black velvet and wont you she had ventured come just once and take tea with me he had pleaded pressure of work an essay—which in reality he had abandoned years ago—on vermeer of delft i know that i am quite useless she had replied a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you i should be like the frog in the fable and yet i should so much like to learn to know things to be initiated what fun it would be to become a regular bookworm to bury my nose in a lot of old papers she had gone on with that selfsatisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up without fear of soiling her fingers to some unclean task such as cooking the dinner with her hands right in the dish itself you will only laugh at me but this painter who stops you from seeing me she meant vermeer i have never even heard of him is he alive still can i see any of his things in paris so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard that head which i feel sure is always puzzling away about things just to be able to say there thats what hes thinking about what a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work

   he had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion you are afraid of falling in love how funny that is when i go about seeking nothing else and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere she had said so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched some woman must have made you suffer and you think that the rest are all like her she cant have understood you you are so utterly different from ordinary men thats what i liked about you when i first saw you i felt at once that you werent like everybody else

   and then besides theres yourself—— he had continued i know what women are you must have a whole heap of things to do and never any time to spare

   i why i have never anything to do i am always free and i always will be free if you want me at whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me just send for me and i shall be only too delighted to come will you do that do you know what i should really like—to introduce you to mme verdurin where i go every evening just fancy my finding you there and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone

   no doubt in thus remembering their conversations in thinking about her thus when he was alone he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams but if thanks to some accidental circumstance or even perhaps without that assistance for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state hitherto latent makes itself felt may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state the image of odette de crécy came to absorb the whole of his dreams if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance nor would the conformity of her body more or less than any other to the requirements of swanns taste since having become the body of her whom he loved it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish

   it so happened that my grandfather had known—which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance—the family of these verdurins but he had entirely severed his connection with what he called young verdurin taking a general view of him as one who had fallen—though without losing hold of his millions—among the riffraff of bohemia one day he received a letter from swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the verdurins on guard on guard he exclaimed as he read it i am not at all surprised swann was bound to finish up like this a nice lot of people i cannot do what he asks because in the first place i no longer know the gentleman in question besides there must be a woman in it somewhere and i dont mix myself up in such matters ah well we shall see some fun if swann begins running after the little verdurins

   and on my grandfathers refusal to act as sponsor it was odette herself who had taken swann to the house

   the verdurins had had dining with them on the day when swann made his first appearance dr and mme cottard the young pianist and his aunt and the painter then in favour while these were joined in the course of the evening by several more of the faithful
   dr cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest and so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious but as he must also be prepared to face the alternative he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask do you really mean that he was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street or indeed in life generally than he was in a drawingroom and he might be seen greeting passersby carriages and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety since it proved if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion that he was well aware of that and that if he had assumed a smile the jest was a secret of his own

   on all those points however where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible the doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education

   so it was that following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it

   as regards figures of speech he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case he would want to know what exactly was intended by those which he most frequently heard used devilish pretty blue blood a cat and dog life a day of reckoning a queen of fashion to give a free hand to be at a deadlock and so forth and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation failing these he would adorn it with puns and other plays upon words which he had learned by rote as for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone which he thought would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek

   as the critical faculty on the universal application of which he prided himself was in reality completely lacking that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way without expecting to be believed that it is really yourself that is obliged to him was wasted on cottard who took everything that he heard in its literal sense however blind she may have been to his faults mme verdurin was genuinely annoyed though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever when after she had invited him to see and hear sarah bernhardt from a stage box and had said politely it is very good of you to have come doctor especially as im sure you must often have heard sarah bernhardt and besides im afraid were rather too near the stage the doctor who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle replied to be sure we are far too near the stage and one is getting sick of sarah bernhardt but you expressed a wish that i should come for me your wish is a command i am only too glad to be able to do you this little service what would one not do to please you you are so good and he went on sarah bernhardt thats what they call the voice of god aint it you see often too that she sets the boards on fire thats an odd expression aint it in the hope of an enlightening commentary which however was not forthcoming

   dyou know mme verdurin had said to her husband i believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the doctor he is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence he knows nothing himself of what things are worth and he accepts everything that we say as gospel

   i never dared to mention it m verdurin had answered but ive noticed the same thing myself and on the following new years day instead of sending dr cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs and pretending that it was a mere trifle m verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match

   when mme verdurin had announced that they were to see m swann that evening swann the doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything and seeing that no one answered him swann who on earth is swann he shouted in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as mme verdurin had explained why odettes friend whom she told us about

   ah good good thats all right then answered the doctor at once mollified as for the painter he was overjoyed at the prospect of swanns appearing at the verdurins because he supposed him to be in love with odette and was always ready to assist at lovers meetings nothing amuses me more than matchmaking he confided to cottard i have been tremendously successful even with women

   in telling the verdurins that swann was extremely smart odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another bore when he arrived however he made an excellent impression an indirect cause of which though they did not know it was his familiarity with the best society he had indeed one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others even men of intelligence and refinement who have never gone into society namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination but regard it as quite unimportant their good nature freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly grown independent in fact has the ease the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body the simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him and when he bows discreetly before the ambassador to whom he is being introduced had gradually pervaded without his being conscious of it the whole of swanns social deportment so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own such as the verdurins and their friends he instinctively shewed an assiduity and made overtures with which by their account any of their bores would have dispensed he chilled though for a moment only on meeting dr cottard for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile before they had yet spoken to one another a grimace which cottard styled letting em all come swann supposed that the doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere probably in some house of illfame though these he himself very rarely visited never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love regarding such an allusion as in bad taste especially before odette whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse swann assumed his most icy manner but when he learned that the lady next to the doctor was mme cottard he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately in his wifes hearing have made any allusion to amusements of that order and so ceased to interpret the doctors expression in the sense which he had at first suspected the painter at once invited swann to visit his studio with odette and swann found him very pleasant perhaps you will be more highly favoured than i have been mme verdurin broke in with mock resentment of the favour perhaps you will be allowed to see cottards portrait for which she had given the painter a commission take care master biche she reminded the painter whom it was a timehonoured pleasantry to address as master to catch that nice look in his eyes that witty little twinkle you know what i want to have most of all is his smile thats what ive asked you to paint—the portrait of his smile and since the phrase struck her as noteworthy she repeated it very loud so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again swann begged to be introduced to everyone even to an old friend of the verdurins called saniette whose shyness simplicity and goodnature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography his large fortune and the distinguished family to which he belonged when he spoke his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown all the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable by asking to be made known to m saniette swann made m verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction saying in fact with emphasis on the distinction m swann pray let me present to you our friend saniette but he aroused in saniette himself a warmth of gratitude which however the verdurins never disclosed to swann since saniette rather annoyed them and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends on the other hand the verdurins were extremely touched by swanns next request for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianists aunt she wore a black dress as was her invariable custom for she believed that a woman always looked well in black and that nothing could be more distinguished but her face was exceedingly red as it always was for some time after a meal she bowed to swann with deference but drew herself up again with great dignity as she was entirely uneducated and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous blurred expectoration out of which would emerge at rare intervals those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with m verdurin who however was not at all amused

   she is such an excellent woman he rejoined i grant you that she is not exactly brilliant but i assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her

   i am sure she can swann hastened to conciliate him all i meant was that she hardly struck me as distinguished he went on isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone and after all that is something of a compliment

   wait a moment said m verdurin now this will surprise you she writes quite delightfully you have never heard her nephew play it is admirable eh doctor would you like me to ask him to play something m swann

   i should count myself most fortunate swann was beginning a trifle pompously when the doctor broke in derisively having once heard it said and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously as the word fortunate had been used just now by swann he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic and if moreover the same word happened to occur also in what he called an old tag or saw however common it might still be in current usage the doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point although in reality it had never entered his mind

   most fortunate for france he recited wickedly shooting up both arms with great vigour m verdurin could not help laughing

   what are all those good people laughing at over there theres no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner shouted mme verdurin you dont suppose i find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance she went on peevishly like a spoiled child

   mme verdurin was sitting upon a high swedish chair of waxed pinewood which a violinist from that country had given her and which she kept in her drawingroom although in appearance it suggested a school form and swore as the saying is at the really good antique furniture which she had besides but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her faithful were in the habit of making her from time to time so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house she tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets which had at least the merit of mortality but she was never successful and the house was gradually filled with a collection of footwarmers cushions clocks screens barometers and vases a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects

   from this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the faithful and would revel in all their fun but since the accident to her jaw she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumbshow which signified without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way that she was laughing until she cried at the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a bore or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of bores—and to the utter despair of m verdurin who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife but who since his laughter was the real thing was out of breath in a moment and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry shut tight her little birdlike eyes which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract and quickly as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow burying her face in her hands which completely engulfed it and prevented her from seeing anything at all she would appear to be struggling to suppress to eradicate a laugh which were she to give way to it must inevitably leave her inanimate so stupefied with the gaiety of the faithful drunken with comradeship scandal and asseveration mme verdurin perched on her high seat like a cagebird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine would sit aloft and sob with fellowfeeling

   meanwhile m verdurin after first asking swanns permission to light his pipe no ceremony here you understand were all pals went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano

   leave him alone dont bother him he hasnt come here to be tormented cried mme verdurin i wont have him tormented

   but why on earth should it bother him rejoined m verdurin im sure m swann has never heard the sonata in f sharp which we discovered he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement

   no no no not my sonata she screamed i dont want to be made to cry until i get a cold in the head and neuralgia all down my face like last time thanks very much i dont intend to repeat that performance you are all very kind and considerate it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed for a week

   this little scene which was reenacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play never failed to delight the audience as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time as a proof of the seductive originality of the mistress as she was styled and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical ear those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room by their cries of hear hear which as in parliamentary debates shewed that something worth listening to was being said and next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening and would assure them that the little scene had never been so amusingly done

   well all right then said m verdurin he can play just the andante

   just the andante how you do go on cried his wife as if it werent just the andante that breaks every bone in my body the master is really too priceless just as though in the ninth he said we need only have the finale or just the overture of the meistersinger

   the doctor however urged mme verdurin to let the pianist play not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states—but from his habit common to many doctors of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise what seemed to him far more important the success of some social gathering at which he was present and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor

   you wont be ill this time youll find he told her seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze and if you are ill we will cure you

   will you really mme verdurin spoke as though with so great a favour in store for her there was nothing for it but to capitulate perhaps too by dint of saying that she was going to be ill she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot occasionally that it was all only a little scene and regarded things quite sincerely from an invalids point of view for it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing although they are always ill after doing it provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which without putting them to the least inconvenience can and will by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid set them once again upon their feet

   odette had gone to sit on a tapestrycovered sofa near the piano saying to mme verdurin i have my own little corner havent i

   and mme verdurin seeing swann by himself upon a chair made him get up youre not at all comfortable there go along and sit by odette you can make room for m swann there cant you odette

   what charming beauvais said swann stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it and wishing to be polite

   i am glad you appreciate my sofa replied mme verdurin and i warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once they never made any more like it and these little chairs too are perfect marvels you can look at them in a moment the emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair you know you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them—i can promise you a delightful time i assure you just look at the little border around the edges here look the little vine on a red background in this one the bear and the grapes isnt it well drawn what do you say i think they knew a thing or two about design doesnt it make your mouth water this vine my husband makes out that i am not fond of fruit because i eat less than he does but not a bit of it i am greedier than any of you but i have no need to fill my mouth with them when i can feed on them with my eyes what are you all laughing at now pray ask the doctor he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge some people go to fontainebleau for cures i take my own little beauvais cure here but m swann you mustnt run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs isnt it an exquisite surface no no not with your whole hand like that feel them property

   if mme verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes said the painter we shant get any music tonight

   be quiet you wretch and yet we poor women she went on are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this there is no flesh in the world as soft as these none when m verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous come you might at least be polite dont say that you never have been jealous

   but my dear i have said absolutely nothing look here doctor i call you as a witness did i utter a word

   swann had begun out of politeness to finger the bronzes and did not like to stop

   come along you can caress them later now it is you that are going to be caressed caressed in the ear youll like that i think heres the young gentleman who will take charge of that

   after the pianist had played swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests for the following reason

   the year before at an evening party he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin at first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted and it had been a source of keen pleasure when below the narrow ribbon of the violinpart delicate unyielding substantial and governing the whole he had suddenly perceived where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound the mass of the pianopart multiform coherent level and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight but at a given moment without being able to distinguish any clear outline or to give a name to what was pleasing him suddenly enraptured he had tried to collect to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony—he knew not which—that had just been played and had opened and expanded his soul just as the fragrance of certain roses wafted upon the moist air of evening has the power of dilating our nostrils perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression one of those that are notwithstanding our only purely musical impressions limited in their extent entirely original and irreducible into any other kind an impression of this order vanishing in an instant is so to speak an impression sine materia presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume to trace arabesque designs to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity stability or caprice but the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us and this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge barely discernible to plunge again and disappear and drown recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil impossible to describe to recollect to name ineffable—if our memory like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves did not by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow and so hardly had the delicious sensation which swann had experienced died away before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript summary it is true and provisional but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued so effectively that when the same impression suddenly returned it was no longer uncapturable he was able to picture to himself its extent its symmetrical arrangement its notation the strength of its expression he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music but rather design architecture thought and which allowed the actual music to be recalled this time he had distinguished quite clearly a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound it had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures of whose existence before hearing it he had never dreamed into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him and he had been filled with love for it as with a new and strange desire

   with a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here there everywhere towards a state of happiness noble unintelligible yet clearly indicated and then suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it after pausing for a moment abruptly it changed its direction and in a fresh movement more rapid multiform melancholy incessant sweet it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown then it vanished he hoped with a passionate longing that he might find it again a third time and reappear it did though without speaking to him more clearly bringing him indeed a pleasure less profound but when he was once more at home he needed it he was like a man into whose life a woman whom he has seen for a moment passing by has brought a new form of beauty which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already although he knows nothing of her not even her name

   indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed in the first few months to be bringing into swanns life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation he had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions that he had come to believe though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself that he would remain all his life in that condition which death alone could alter more than this since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals he had ceased to believe in although he could not have expressly denied their reality he had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance and that afterwards if he did not actually call he must at least leave cards upon his hostess so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves and excused him from shewing how much he really knew he would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish the dates of a painters birth and death and the titles of his works sometimes in spite of himself he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art or of some ones interpretation of life but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying but now like a confirmed invalid whom all of a sudden a change of air and surroundings or a new course of treatment or as sometimes happens an organic change in himself spontaneous and unaccountable seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility hitherto beyond all hope of starting to lead—and better late than never—a wholly different life swann found in himself in the memory of the phrase that he had heard in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him to see whether he might not perhaps discover his phrase among them the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe but to which as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence he was conscious once again of a desire almost indeed of the power to consecrate his life but never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening he had been unable to procure a copy and finally had forgotten the quest he had indeed in the course of the next few days encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him and had questioned them but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played some had indeed been in the house but had gone into another room to talk and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest as for his hosts they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play but as these last were now on tour somewhere swann could learn nothing further he had of course a number of musical friends but vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him and could see still before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air and so at last he ceased to think of it

   but tonight at mme verdurins scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when suddenly after a high note held on through two whole bars swann saw it approaching stealing forth from underneath that resonance which was prolonged and stretched out over it like a curtain of sound to veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised secret whispering articulate the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved and it was so peculiarly itself it had so personal a charm which nothing else could have replaced that swann felt as though he had met in a friends drawingroom a woman whom he had seen and admired once in the street and had despaired of ever seeing her again finally the phrase withdrew and vanished pointing directing diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance leaving upon swanns features a reflection of its smile but now at last he could ask the name of his fair unknown and was told that it was the andante movement of vinteuils sonata for the piano and violin he held it safe could have it again to himself at home as often as he would could study its language and acquire its secret

   and so when the pianist had finished swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted mme verdurin

   isnt he charming she asked swann doesnt he just understand it his sonata the little wretch you never dreamed did you that a piano could be made to express all that upon my word theres everything in it except the piano im caught out every time i hear it i think im listening to an orchestra though its better really than an orchestra more complete

   the young pianist bent over her as he answered smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram you are most generous to me

   and while mme verdurin was saying to her husband run and fetch him a glass of orangeade its well earned swann began to tell odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase when their hostess who was a little way off called out well it looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you odette she replied yes very nice and he found her simplicity delightful then he asked for some information about this vinteuil what else he had done and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata—what meaning the little phrase could have had for him that was what swann wanted most to know

   but none of these people who professed to admire this musician when swann had said that the sonata was really charming mme verdurin had exclaimed i quite believe it charming indeed but you dont dare to confess that you dont know vinteuils sonata you have no right not to know it—and the painter had gone on with ah yes its a very fine bit of work isnt it not of course if you want something obvious something popular but i mean to say it makes a very great impression on us artists none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions for none of them was able to reply

   even to one or two particular remarks made by swann on his favourite phrase dyou know thats a funny thing i had never noticed it i may as well tell you that i dont much care about peering at things through a microscope and pricking myself on pinpoints of difference no we dont waste time splitting hairs in this house why not well its not a habit of ours thats all mme verdurin replied while dr cottard gazed at her with openmouthed admiration and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one steppingstone to another of her stock of readymade phrases both he however and mme cottard with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin would always take care not to express an opinion or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other once they were safely at home that they no more understood than they could understand the art of master biche inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm the beauty even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions so m and mme cottard typical in this respect of the public were incapable of finding either in vinteuils sonata or in biches portraits what constituted harmony for them in music or beauty in painting it appeared to them when the pianist played his sonata as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas when on one of these they were able to distinguish a human form they always found it coarsened and vulgarised that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people—real living people who passed them in the streets and devoid of truth as though m biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed or that a womans hair was not ordinarily purple

   and yet when the faithful were scattered out of earshot the doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed and so while mme verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of vinteuils sonata like a wouldbe swimmer who jumps into the water so as to learn but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on yes indeed hes what they call a musiciandi primo cartello he exclaimed with a sudden determination

   swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of vinteuils sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians but that it was still unknown to the general public

   i know some one quite well called vinteuil said swann thinking of the old musicmaster at combray who had taught my grandmothers sisters

   perhaps thats the man cried mme verdurin

   oh no swann burst out laughing if you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldnt put the question

   then to put the question is to solve the problem the doctor suggested

   but it may well be some relative swann went on that would be bad enough but after all there is no reason why a genius shouldnt have a cousin who is a silly old fool and if that should be so i swear theres no known or unknown form of torture i wouldnt undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata starting with the torture of the old fools company which would be ghastly

   the painter understood that vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment and that dr potain despaired of his life

   what cried mme verdurin do people still call in potain

   ah mme verdurin cottard simpered you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues—i should say one of my masters

   the painter had heard somewhere that vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason and he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata this remark did not strike swann as ridiculous rather it puzzled him for since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences the interruption or confusion of which in spoken or written language is a proof of insanity so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse although instances may be observed of these

   dont speak to me about your masters you know ten times as much as he does mme verdurin answered dr cottard in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her anyhow you dont kill your patients

   but madame he is in the academy the doctor smiled with bitter irony if a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the princes of science it is far more smart to be able to say yes i have potain

   oh indeed more smart is it said mme verdurin so there are fashions nowadays in illness are there i didnt know that oh you do make me laugh she screamed suddenly burying her face in her hands and here was i poor thing talking quite seriously and never seeing that you were pulling my leg

   as for m verdurin finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her atalantaflights across the field of mirth

   dyou know we like your friend so very much said mme verdurin later when odette was bidding her good night he is so unaffected quite charming if theyre all like that the friends you want to bring here by all means bring them

   m verdurin remarked that swann had failed all the same to appreciate the pianists aunt

   i dare say he felt a little strange poor man suggested mme verdurin you cant expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes like cottard who has been one of our little clan now for years the first time doesnt count its just for looking round and finding out things odette he understands all right hes to join us tomorrow at the châtelet perhaps you might call for him and bring him no he doesnt want that

   oh very well just as you like provided he doesnt fail us at the last moment

   greatly to mme verdurins surprise he never failed them he would go to meet them no matter where at restaurants outside paris not that they went there much at first for the season had not yet begun and more frequently at the play in which mme verdurin delighted one evening when they were dining at home he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds and say how useful it would be to them at firstnights and gala performances at the opera and what a nuisance it had been not having one on the day of gambettas funeral swann never spoke of his distinguished friends but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental whom therefore he thought it snobbish and in not very good taste to conceal while he frequented the faubourg saintgermain he had come to include in the latter class all his friends in the official world of the third republic and so broke in without thinking ill see to that all right you shall have it in time for the danicheff revival i shall be lunching with the prefect of police tomorrow as it happens at the elysée

   whats that the elysée dr cottard roared in a voice of thunder

   yes at m grévys replied swann feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced

   are you often taken like that the painter asked cottard with mockseriousness

   as a rule once an explanation had been given cottard would say ah good good thats all right then after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion but this time swanns last words instead of the usual calming effect had that of heating instantly to boilingpoint his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table a man who had no official position no honours or distinction of any sort was on visiting terms with the head of the state

   whats that you say m grévy do you know m grévy he demanded of swann in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace when a stranger has come up and asked to see the president of the republic until guessing from his words and manner what as the newspapers say it is a case of he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary

   i know him slightly we have some friends in common swann dared not add that one of these friends was the prince of wales anyhow he is very free with his invitations and i assure you his luncheonparties are not the least bit amusing theyre very simple affairs too you know never more than eight at table he went on trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the president in a light too dazzling for the doctors eyes

   whereupon cottard at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what swann was saying decided that invitations from m grévy were very little sought after were sent out in fact into the highways and hedgerows and from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that swann or anyone else was always at the elysée he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheonparties which he himself admitted were a bore

   ah good good thats quite all right then he said in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now but after hearing your explanations stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage

   i can well believe you dont find them amusing those parties indeed its very good of you to go to them said mme verdurin who regarded the president of the republic only as a bore to be especially dreaded since he had at his disposal means of seduction and even of compulsion which if employed to captivate her faithful might easily make them fail it seems hes as deaf as a post and eats with his fingers

   upon my word then it cant be much fun for you going there a note of pity sounded in the doctors voice and then struck by the number—only eight at table—are these luncheons what you would describe as intimate he inquired briskly not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal

   but so great and glorious a figure was the president of the french republic in the eyes of dr cottard that neither the modesty of swann nor the spite of mme verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression and he never sat down to dinner with the verdurins without asking anxiously dyou think we shall see m swann here this evening he is a personal friend of m grévys i suppose that means hes what youd call a gentleman he even went to the length of offering swann a card of invitation to the dental exhibition

   this will let you in and anyone you take with you he explained but dogs are not admitted im just warning you you understand because some friends of mine went there once who hadnt been told and there was the devil to pay

   as for m verdurin he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken

   if no arrangement had been made to go anywhere it was at the verdurins that swann would find the little nucleus assembled but he never appeared there except in the evenings and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner in spite of odettes entreaties

   i could dine with you alone somewhere if youd rather she suggested

   but what about mme verdurin

   oh thats quite simple i need only say that my dress wasnt ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse

   how charming of you

   but swann said to himself that if he could make odette feel by consenting to meet her only after dinner that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety besides as he infinitely preferred to odettes style of beauty that of a little working girl as fresh and plump as a rose with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her knowing that he was sure to see odette later on for the same reason he would never allow odette to call for him at his house to take him on to the verdurins the little girl used to wait not far from his door at a street corner rémi his coachman knew where to stop she would jump in beside him and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the verdurins he would enter the drawingroom and there while mme verdurin pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning said i am furious with you and sent him to the place kept for him by the side of odette the pianist would play to them—for their two selves and for no one else—that little phrase by vinteuil which was so to speak the national anthem of their love he began always with a sustained tremolo from the violin part which for several bars was unaccompanied and filled all the foreground until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside and—just as in those interiors by pieter de hooch where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a halfopened door—infinitely remote in colour quite different velvety with the radiance of some intervening light the little phrase appeared dancing pastoral interpolated episodic belonging to another world it passed with simple and immortal movements scattering on every side the bounties of its grace smiling ineffably still but swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment it seemed to be aware how vain how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way in its airy grace there was indeed something definitely achieved and complete in itself like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret but little did that matter to him he looked upon the sonata less in its own light—as what it might express had in fact expressed to a certain musician ignorant that any swann or odette anywhere in the world existed when he composed it and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come—than as a pledge a token of his love which made even the verdurins and their little pianist think of odette and at the same time of himself—which bound her to him by a lasting tie and at that point he had whimsically entreated by odette abandoned the idea of getting some professional to play over to him the whole sonata of which he still knew no more than this one passage why do you want the rest she had asked him our little bit thats all we need he went farther agonised by the reflection at the moment when it passed by him so near and yet so infinitely remote that while it was addressed to their ears it knew them not he would regret almost that it had a meaning of its own an intrinsic and unalterable beauty foreign to themselves just as in the jewels given to us or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love we find fault with the water of a stone or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a lass unparalleled

   it would happen as often as not that he had stayed so long outside with his little girl before going to the verdurins that as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist swann would discover that it was almost time for odette to go home he used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the rue la pérouse behind the arc de triomphe and it was perhaps on this account and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours that he sacrificed the pleasure not so essential to his wellbeing of seeing her earlier in the evening of arriving with her at the verdurins to the exercise of this other privilege for which she was grateful of their leaving together a privilege which he valued all the more because thanks to it he had the feeling that no one else would see her no one would thrust himself between them no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit after he had left her for the night

   and so night after night she would be taken home in swanns carriage and one night after she had got down and while he stood at the gate and murmured till tomorrow then she turned impulsively from him plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand he held it pressed to his lips during the drive home and when in due course the flower withered locked it away like something very precious in a secret drawer of his desk

   he would escort her to her gate but no farther twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony—of such vital importance in her life—of afternoon tea the loneliness and emptiness of those short streets consisting almost entirely of lowroofed houses selfcontained but not detached their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute the snow which had lain on the gardenbeds or clung to the branches of the trees the careless disarray of the season the assertion in this manmade city of a state of nature had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth the flowers the luxury which he had found inside

   passing by on his lefthand side and on what although raised some way above the street was the ground floor of the house odettes bedroom which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls from which hung oriental draperies strings of turkish beads and a huge japanese lantern suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling which last however so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of western civilisation was lighted by a gasjet inside to the two drawingrooms large and small these were entered through a narrow lobby the wall of which chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls only gilded was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed as though in a hothouse a row of large chrysanthemums at that time still uncommon though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow swann was irritated as a rule by the sight of these flowers which had then been the rage in paris for about a year but it had pleased him on this occasion to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons odette had received him in a teagown of pink silk which left her neck and arms bare she had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of chinese porcelain or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon she had said at once youre not comfortable there wait a minute ill arrange things for you and with a titter of laughter the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of japanese silk which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches and regardless of their value but when her footman began to come into the room bringing one after another the innumerable lamps which contained mostly in porcelain vases burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars rekindling in the twilight already almost nocturnal of this winter afternoon the glow of a sunset more lasting more roseate more human—filling perhaps with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight—she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it she felt that if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be the general effect of her drawingroom would be destroyed and that her portrait which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush would not catch the light and so with feverish impatience she followed the mans clumsy movements scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots which she made a point of always tidying herself in case the plants should be knocked over—and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers she found something quaint in the shape of each of her chinese ornaments and also in her orchids the cattleyas especially these being with chrysanthemums her favourite flowers because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers but of being made apparently out of scraps of silk or satin it looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak she said to swann pointing to an orchid with a shade of respect in her voice for so smart a flower for this distinguished unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her so far removed from her in the scale of existence and yet so delicate so refined so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawingroom as she drew his attention now to the fierytongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a firescreen now to a fleshy cluster of orchids now to a dromedary of inlaid silverwork with ruby eyes which kept company upon her mantelpiece with a toad carved in jade she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity now blushing at the indecency of the flowers now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary calling them darlings and these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes notably her devotion to our lady of the laghetto who had once when odette was living at nice cured her of a mortal illness and whose medal in gold she always carried on her person attributing to it unlimited powers she poured out swanns tea inquired lemon or cream and on his answering cream please went on smiling a cloud and as he pronounced it excellent you see i know just how you like it this tea had indeed seemed to swann just as it seemed to her something precious and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which on the contrary would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing that when he left her at seven oclock to go and dress for the evening all the way home sitting bolt upright in his brougham unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoons adventure had filled him he kept on repeating to himself what fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding what one never can be certain of finding a really good cup of tea an hour or so later he received a note from odette and at once recognised that florid handwriting in which an affectation of british stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters significant perhaps to less intimate eyes than his of an untidiness of mind a fragmentary education a want of sincerity and decision swann had left his cigarettecase at her house why she wrote did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back

   more important perhaps was a second visit which he paid her a little later on his way to the house as always when he knew that they were to meet he formed a picture of her in his mind and the necessity if he was to find any beauty in her face of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots plunged him in acute depression as proving that ones ideal is always unattainable and ones actual happiness mediocre he was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see she was not very well she received him wearing a wrapper of mauve crêpe de chine which draped her bosom like a mantle with a richly embroidered web as she stood there beside him brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair bending one knee in what was almost a dancers pose so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture at which she was gazing with bended head out of those great eyes which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of zipporah jethros daughter which is to be seen in one of the sistine frescoes he had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the old masters not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation the individual features of men and women whom he knew as for instance in a bust of the doge loredan by antonio rizzo the prominent cheekbones the slanting eyebrows in short a speaking likeness to his own coachman rémi in the colouring of a ghirlandaio the nose of m de palancy in a portrait by tintoretto the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker the broken nose the penetrating stare the swollen eyelids of dr du boulbon perhaps because he had always regretted in his heart that he had confined his attention to the social side of life had talked always rather than acted he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life a modern almost a topical savour perhaps also he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed today perhaps on the other hand he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them uprooted and disembodied in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original whom it was not intended to represent however that might be and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he for some time past had been receiving—though indeed they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music—had enriched his appetite for painting as well it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct that swann remarked odettes resemblance to the zipporah of that alessandro de mariano to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname now that botticelli suggests not so much the actual work of the master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency he no longer based his estimate of the merit of odettes face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks and the softness and sweetness—as of carnationpetals—which he supposed would greet his lips there should he ever hazard an embrace but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads which his gazing eyes collected and wound together following the curving line from the skein to the ball where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids as though from a portrait of herself in which her type was made clearly intelligible

   he stood gazing at her traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs and these he tried incessantly afterwards to recapture both when he was with odette and when he was only thinking of her in her absence and albeit his admiration for the florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her the similarity enhanced her beauty also and rendered her more precious in his sight swann reproached himself with his failure hitherto to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great sandro would have adored and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic he told himself that in choosing the thought of odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness he was not as he had until then supposed falling back merely upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art he failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring odette into the category of women whom he found desirable simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste the words florentine painting were invaluable to swann they enabled him gave him as it were a legal title to introduce the image of odette into a world of dreams and fancies which until then she had been debarred from entering and where she assumed a new and nobler form and whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face her figure the whole of her beauty used to cool the ardour of his love those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could reerect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles while the kiss the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood coming as now they came to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery must it seemed prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural

   and when he was tempted to regret that for months past he had done nothing but visit odette he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art cast for once in a new a different an especially charming metal in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble spiritual disinterested mind of an artist at another with the pride the selfishness the sensual thrill of a collector

   on his study table at which he worked he had placed as it were a photograph of odette a reproduction of jethros daughter he would gaze in admiration at the large eyes the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks and adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful on aesthetic grounds to the idea of a living woman he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might ultimately possess the vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art now that he knew the type in warm flesh and blood of jethros daughter became a desire which more than compensated thenceforward for that with which odettes physical charms had at first failed to inspire him when he had sat for a long time gazing at the botticelli he would think of his own living botticelli who seemed all the lovelier in contrast and as he drew towards him the photograph of zipporah he would imagine that he was holding odette against his heart

   it was not only odettes indifference however that he must take pains to circumvent it was also not infrequently his own feeling that since odette had had every facility for seeing him she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet he was afraid lest the manner—at once trivial monotonous and seemingly unalterable—which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover and so to alter to give a fresh moral aspect to that odette of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary he wrote suddenly a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinnertime he knew that she would be frightened and that she would reply and he hoped that when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter and he was right—by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had so far written him one of them which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the maison dorée—it was the day of the parismurcie fête given for the victims of the recent floods in murcia beginning my dear my hand trembles so that i can scarcely write—— and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum or else if she had not had time to write when he arrived at the verdurins she would come running up to him with an ive something to say to you and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart

   even as he drew near to the verdurins door and caught sight of the great lamplit spaces of the drawingroom windows whose shutters were never closed he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see as he entered the room basking in that golden light here and there the figures of the guests stood out sharp and black between lamp and window shutting off the light like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen whose other panes are mere transparencies he would try to make out odette and then when he was once inside without thinking his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that m verdurin said to the painter hm seems to be getting warm indeed her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess a sort of tactual sense a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart

   and so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism namely the little clan were transformed for swann into a series of daily encounters with odette and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her or even a desire not to see her in doing which he incurred no very great risk since even although he had written to her during the day he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home

   but one evening when irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together he had taken his other little girl all the way to the bois so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the verdurins he was so late in reaching them that odette supposing that he did not intend to come had already left seeing the room bare of her swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate having always hitherto had that certainty of finding it whenever he would which as in the case of all our pleasures reduced if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions

   did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasnt here m verdurin asked his wife i think we may say that hes hooked

   the face he pulled exploded dr cottard who having left the house for a moment to visit a patient had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing

   dyou mean to say you didnt meet him on the doorstep—the loveliest of swanns

   no m swann has been here

   just for a moment we had a glimpse of a swann tremendously agitated in a state of nerves you see odette had left

   you mean to say that she has gone the whole hog with him that she has burned her boats inquired the doctor cautiously testing the meaning of his phrases

   why of course not theres absolutely nothing in it in fact between you and me i think shes making a great mistake and behaving like a silly little fool which she is incidentally

   come come come said m verdurin how on earth do you know that theres nothing in it we havent been there to see have we now

   she would have told me answered mme verdurin with dignity i may say that she tells me everything as she has no one else at present i told her that she ought to live with him she makes out that she cant she admits she was immensely attracted by him at first but hes always shy with her and that makes her shy with him besides she doesnt care for him in that way she says its an ideal love platonic you know shes afraid of rubbing the bloom off—oh i dont know half the things she says how should i and yet hes exactly the sort of man she wants

   i beg to differ from you m verdurin courteously interrupted i am only half satisfied with the gentleman i feel that he poses

   mme verdurins whole body stiffened her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to pose in her house and therefore that there were people in the world who mattered more than herself

   anyhow if there is nothing in it i dont suppose its because our friend believes in her virtue and yet you never know he seems to believe in her intelligence i dont know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about vinteuils sonata i am devoted to odette but really—to expound theories of aesthetic to her—the man must be a prize idiot

   look here i wont have you saying nasty things about odette broke in mme verdurin in her spoiled child manner she is charming

   theres no reason why she shouldnt be charming we are not saying anything nasty about her only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect after all he turned to the painter does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not you cant tell she might be a great deal less charming if she were

   on the landing swann had run into the verdurins butler who had been somewhere else a moment earlier when he arrived and who had been asked by odette to tell swann but that was at least an hour ago that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at prévosts on her way home swann set off at once for prévosts but every few yards his carriage was held up by others or by people crossing the street loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels were it not that a policeman fumbling with a notebook would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian he counted the minutes feverishly adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure and so possibly exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at prévosts in time and of finding her still there and then in a moment of illumination like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dreamshapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the verdurins that odette had left how novel the heartache from which he was suffering but of which he was only now conscious as though he had just woken up what all this disturbance simply because he would not see odette now till tomorrow exactly what he had been hoping not an hour before as he drove toward mme verdurins he was obliged to admit also that now as he sat in the same carriage and drove to prévosts he was no longer the same man was no longer alone even—but that a new personality was there beside him adhering to him amalgamated with him a creature from whom he might perhaps be unable to liberate himself towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady and yet during this last moment in which he had felt that another a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own life had seemed somehow more interesting

   it was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at prévosts the tension of waiting for which so ravished stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing not one idea not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose would probably after all should it take place be much the same as all their meetings of no great importance as on every other evening once he was in odettes company once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference he would cease to be able even to think of her so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately and to assure himself without betraying his concern that he would find her again next evening at the verdurins pretexts that is to say which would enable him to prolong for the time being and to renew for one day more the disappointment the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman whom he might approach yet never dared embrace

   she was not at prevosts he must search for her then in every restaurant upon the boulevards to save time while he went in one direction he sent in the other his coachman rémi rizzos doge loredan for whom he presently—after a fruitless search—found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him it did not appear and swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment as one in which rémi would say to him sir the lady is there or as one in which rémi would say to him sir the lady was not in any of the cafés and so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening—a thing uniform and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering odette or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her

   the coachman returned but as he drew up opposite him swann asked not did you find the lady but remind me tomorrow to order in some more firewood i am sure we must be running short perhaps he had persuaded himself that if rémi had at last found odette in some café where she was waiting for him still then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation begun already in his mind of a night of joy and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place which would not escape his grasp again but it was also by the force of inertia there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who when the moment comes to avoid a collision to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame or to perform any other such necessary movement take their time as the saying is begin by remaining for a moment in their original position as though seeking to find in it a startingpoint a source of strength and motion and probably if the coachman had interrupted him with i have found the lady he would have answered oh yes of course thats what i told you to do i had quite forgotten and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure

   the coachman came back however with the report that he could not find her anywhere and added the advice as an old and privileged servant i think sir that all we can do now is to go home

   but the air of indifference which swann could so lightly assume when rémi uttered his final unalterable response fell from him like a castoff cloak when he saw rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest

   certainly not he exclaimed we must find the lady it is most important she would be extremely put out—its a business matter—and vexed with me if she didnt see me

   but i do not see how the lady can be vexed sir answered rémi since it was she that went away without waiting for you sir and said she was going to prévosts and then wasnt there

   meanwhile the restaurants were closing and their lights began to go out under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to swann murmured a few words in his ear asked him to take her home and left him shuddering anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes as though among the phantoms of the dead in the realms of darkness he had been searching for a lost eurydice

   among all the methods by which love is brought into being among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which now and then sweeps over the human spirit for then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment her lot is cast her fate and ours decided that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love it is not necessary that she should have pleased us up till then any more or even as much as others all that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive and that condition is fulfilled so soon as—in the moment when she has failed to meet us—for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire whose object is the creature herself an irrational absurd desire which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage—the insensate agonising desire to possess her

   swann made rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open it was the sole hypothesis now of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly he no longer concealed his agitation the price he set upon their meeting and promised in case of success to reward his coachman as though by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own he could bring it to pass by a miracle that odette—assuming that she had long since gone home to bed—might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards he pursued the quest as far as the maison dorée burst twice into tortonis and still without catching sight of her was emerging from the café anglais striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage which was waiting for him at the corner of the boulevard des italiens when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction it was odette she explained later that there had been no room at prévosts that she had gone instead to sup at the maison dorée and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her and that she was now looking for her carriage

   she had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm as for him he had ransacked the streets of paris not that he supposed it possible that he should find her but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt but now the joy which his reason had never ceased to assure him was not that evening at least to be realised was suddenly apparent and more real than ever before for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities—it remained integral and external to himself there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth—twas from itself that there emanated twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him that truth upon which he had supported nay founded albeit unconsciously his vision of bliss so will a traveller who has come down on a day of glorious weather to the mediterranean shore and is doubtful whether they still exist those lands which he has left let his eyes be dazzled rather than cast a backward glance by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet

   he climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting and ordered his own to follow

   she had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas and swann could see beneath the film of lace that covered her head more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume she was wearing under her cloak a flowing gown of black velvet caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt with an insertion also of white silk in the cleft of her lownecked bodice in which were fastened a few more cattleyas she had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of swann had given her when some obstacle made the horse start to one side they were thrown forward from their seats she uttered a cry and fell back quivering and breathless

   its all right he assured her dont be frightened and he slipped his arm round her shoulder supporting her body against his own then went on whatever you do dont utter a word just make a sign yes or no or youll be out of breath again you wont mind if i put the flowers straight on your bodice the jolt has loosened them im afraid of their dropping out im just going to fasten them a little more securely

   she was not used to being treated with so much formality by men and smiled as she answered no not at all i dont mind in the least

   but he chilled a little by her answer perhaps also to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been exclaimed no no you mustnt speak you will be out of breath again you can easily answer in signs i shall understand really and truly now you dont mind my doing this look there is a little—i think it must be pollen spilt over your dress—may i brush it off with my hand thats not too hard im not hurting you am i im tickling you perhaps a little but i dont want to touch the velvet in case i rub it the wrong way but dont you see i really had to fasten the flowers they would have fallen out if i hadnt like that now if i just push them a little farther down seriously im not annoying you am i and if i just sniff them to see whether theyve really lost all their scent i dont believe i ever smelt any before may i tell the truth now

   still smiling she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly as who should say youre quite mad you know very well that i like it

   he slipped his other hand upwards along odettes cheek she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old florentines paintings in whose faces he had found the type of hers swimming at the brink of her fringed lids her brilliant eyes large and finely drawn as theirs seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears she bent her neck as all their necks may be seen to bend in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural and although her attitude was doubtless habitual and instinctive one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments and was careful not to forget to assume she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards swanns and swann it was who before she allowed her face as though despite her efforts to fall upon his lips held it back for a moment longer at a little distance between his hands he had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her bodys movements to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves perhaps moreover swann himself was fixing upon these features of an odette not yet possessed not even kissed by him on whom he was looking now for the last time that comprehensive gaze with which on the day of his departure a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return

   but he was so shy in approaching her that after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender whether from fear of chilling her or from reluctance to appear even retrospectively to have lied or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this which could always be repeated since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion he resorted to the same pretext on the following days if she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice he would say it is most unfortunate the cattleyas dont need tucking in this evening theyve not been disturbed as they were the other night i think though that this one isnt quite straight may i see if they have more scent than the others or else if she had none oh no cattleyas this evening then theres nothing for me to arrange so that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening when he had started by touching her throat with his fingers first and then with his lips but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration and long afterwards when the arrangement or rather the ritual pretence of an arrangement of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude the metaphor do a cattleya transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession in which paradoxically the possessor possesses nothing survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang and yet possibly this particular manner of saying to make love had not the precise significance of its synonyms however disillusioned we may be about women however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience every detail of which is known and can be described in advance it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be—or be thought to be—so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them as was originally for swann the arrangement of the cattleyas he trembled as he hoped that evening but odette he told himself if she were deceived by his stratagem could not guess his intention that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals and the pleasure which he already felt and which odette tolerated he thought perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself seemed to him for that reason—as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise—a pleasure which had never before existed which he was striving now to create a pleasure—and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity—entirely individual and new

   the ice once broken every evening when he had taken her home he must follow her into the house and often she would come out again in her dressinggown and escort him to his carriage and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman saying what on earth does it matter what people see and on evenings when he did not go to the verdurins which happened occasionally now that he had opportunities of meeting odette elsewhere when—more and more rarely—he went into society she would beg him to come to her on his way home however late he might be the season was spring the nights clear and frosty he would come away from an evening party jump into his victoria spread a rug over his knees tell the friends who were leaving at the same time and who insisted on his going home with them that he could not that he was not going in their direction then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders knowing quite well where he had to go his friends would be left marvelling and as a matter of fact swann was no longer the same man no one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman he had ceased to pay any attention to women and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met in a restaurant or in the country his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which only a few days earlier his friends would have recognised him that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own to such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible on the other hand there was one thing that was now invariable namely that wherever swann might be spending the evening he never failed to go on afterwards to odette the interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend by an irresistible gravitation the steep slope of life itself to be frank as often as not when he had stayed late at a party he would have preferred to return home at once without going so far out of his way and to postpone their meeting until the morrow but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her while he guessed that his friends as he left them were saying to one another he is tied hand and foot there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a loveaffair and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm then though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration the certainty that she was waiting for him that she was not anywhere or with anyone else that he would see her before he went home drew the sting from that anguish forgotten it is true but latent and ever ready to be reawakened which he had felt on the evening when odette had left the verdurins before his arrival an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which odette had since assumed in his life other people are as a rule so immaterial to us that when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves that person seems at once to belong to a different universe is surrounded with poetry makes of our lives a vast expanse quick with sensation on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact swann could not without anxiety ask himself what odette would mean to him in the years that were to come sometimes as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets he would think of that other face gleaming and faintly roseate like the moons which had one day risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed if he arrived after the hour at which odette sent her servants to bed before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden he would go round first into the other street over which at the groundlevel among the windows all exactly alike but darkened of the adjoining houses shone the solitary lighted window of her room he would rap upon the pane and she would hear the signal and answer before running to meet him at the gate he would find lying open on the piano some of her favourite music the valse des roses the pauvre fou of tagliafico which according to the instructions embodied in her will was to be played at her funeral but he would ask her instead to give him the little phrase from vinteuils sonata it was true that odette played vilely but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano the little phrase was associated still in swanns mind with his love for odette he felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself he realised too that odettes qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company and often when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure but the little phrase as soon as it struck his ear had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it the proportions of swanns soul were altered a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for odette to any external object and yet was not like his enjoyment of that love purely individual but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things this thirst for an untasted charm the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it with the result that those parts of swanns soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests those human considerations which affect all men alike were left bare by it blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of odette moreover where odettes affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing the little phrase would come to supplement it to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence watching swanns face while he listened to the phrase one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply and the pleasure which the music gave him which was shortly to create in him a real longing was in fact closely akin at such moments to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence to which we may attain by way of one sense only deep repose mysterious refreshment for swann—for him whose eyes although delicate interpreters of painting whose mind although an acute observer of manners must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life—to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity blinded deprived of his logical faculty almost a fantastic unicorn a chimaeralike creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone and as notwithstanding he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason and make it pass unattended through the straining vessel down into the dark filter of sound he began to reckon up how much that was painful perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase and yet to him it brought no suffering what matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting when his love was so strong he played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused he felt it stealing over him but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness he would make odette play him the phrase again ten twenty times on end insisting that while she played she must never cease to kiss him every kiss provokes another ah in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life how closely in their abundance are they pressed one against another until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour as to count the flowers in a meadow in may then she would pretend to stop saying how do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me i cant do everything at once make up your mind what you want am i to play the phrase or do you want to play with me then he would become annoyed and she would burst out with a laugh which was transformed as it left her lips and descended upon him in a shower of kisses or else she would look at him sulkily and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in botticellis life of moses he would place it there giving to odettes neck the necessary inclination and when he had finished her portrait in distemper in the fifteenth century on the wall of the sixtine the idea that she was none the less in the room with him still by the piano at that very moment ready to be kissed and won the idea of her material existence of her being alive would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her he would fling himself upon this botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks and then as soon as he had left the house not without returning to kiss her once again because he had forgotten to take away with him in memory some detail of her fragrance or of her features while he drove home in his victoria blessing the name of odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits which although they could not he felt bring any great happiness to her still by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy—by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heartsickness which had manifested itself in him that evening when he had failed to find her at the verdurins—might help him to arrive without any recurrence of those crises of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life hours almost enchanted in the same manner as these other following hours in which he drove through a deserted paris by the light of the moon noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position relatively to his own and was almost touching the horizon feeling that his love also was obedient to these immutable laws of nature he asked himself whether this period upon which he had entered was to last much longer whether presently his minds eye would cease to behold that dear countenance save as occupying a distant and diminished position and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm for swann was finding in things once more since he had fallen in love the charm that he had found when in his adolescence he had fancied himself an artist with this difference that what charm lay in them now was conferred by odette alone he could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life but they all bore now the reflection the stamp of a particular being and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home alone with his convalescent spirit he became gradually himself again but himself in thraldom to another

   he went to her only in the evenings and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day any more than he knew of her past so little indeed that he had not even the tiny initial clue which by allowing us to imagine what we do not know stimulates a desire foreknowledge and so he never asked himself what she might be doing or what her life had been only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how some years earlier when he still did not know her some one had spoken to him of a woman who if he remembered rightly must certainly have been odette as of a tart a kept woman one of those women to whom he still attributed having lived but little in their company the entire set of characteristics fundamentally perverse with which they had been for many years endowed by the imagination of certain novelists he would say to himself that one has as often as not only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly when with such a character he contrasted that of odette so good so simple so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that when he had once begged her so that they might dine together alone to write to mme verdurin saying that she was unwell the next day he had seen her face to face with mme verdurin who asked whether she had recovered blushing stammering and in spite of herself revealing in every feature how painful what a torture it was to her to act a lie and while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness seeming to ask pardon by her suppliant look and her stricken accents for the obvious falsehood of her words

   on certain days however though these came seldom she would call upon him in the afternoon to interrupt his musings or the essay on vermeer to which he had latterly returned his servant would come in to say that mme de crécy was in the small drawingroom he would go in search of her and when he opened the door on odettes blushing countenance as soon as she caught sight of swann would appear—changing the curve of her lips the look in her eyes the moulding of her cheeks—an allabsorbing smile once he was left alone he would see again that smile and her smile of the day before another with which she had greeted him sometime else the smile which had been her answer in the carriage that night when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas and the life of odette at all other times since he knew nothing of it appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background like those sheets of sketches by watteau upon which one sees here and there in every corner and in all directions traced in three colours upon the buff paper innumerable smiles but once in a while illuminating a chink of that existence which swann still saw as a complete blank even if his mind assured him that it was not so because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it some friend who knew them both and suspecting that they were in love had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance would describe odettes figure as he had seen her that very morning going on foot up the rue abbattucci in a cape trimmed with skunks wearing a rembrandt hat and a bunch of violets in her bosom this simple outline reduced swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment as though in all the colourless life—a life almost nonexistent since she was then invisible to him—of his mistress there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself namely her walking abroad beneath a rembrandt hat with a bunch of violets in her bosom

   except when he asked her for vinteuils little phrase instead of the valse des roses swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred nor in literature any more than in music to correct the manifold errors of her taste he fully realised that she was not intelligent when she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse in the style of the vicomte de borelli only even more moving as for vermeer of delft she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman if it was a woman that had inspired him and once swann had told her that no one knew she had lost all interest in that painter she would often say im sure poetry well of course thered be nothing like it if it was all true if the poets really believed the things they said but as often as not youll find theres no one so mean and calculating as those fellows i know something about poetry i had a friend once who was in love with a poet of sorts in his verses he never spoke of anything but love and heaven and the stars oh she was properly taken in he had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before hed finished if then swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting after a minute or two she would cease to listen saying yes i never thought it would be like that and he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her assuring her that what he had said was nothing that he had only touched the surface that he had not time to go into it all properly that there was more in it than that then she would interrupt with a brisk more in it what do tell me but he did not tell her for he realised how petty it would appear to her and how different from what she had expected less sensational and less touching he was afraid too lest disillusioned in the matter of art she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love

   with the result that she found swann inferior intellectually to what she had supposed youre always so reserved i cant make you out she marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money at his courtesy to everyone alike at the delicacy of his mind and indeed it happens often enough to a greater man than swann ever was to a scientist or artist when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas—for those are entirely beyond them—but by their respect for what they term his good qualities there was also the respect with which odette was inspired by the thought of swanns social position although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail perhaps indeed she feared lest merely by speaking of her to his friends he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind the fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name her reason for not wishing to go into society was she had told him a quarrel which she had had long ago with another girl who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her but swann objected surely people dont all know your friend yes dont you see its like a spot of oil people are so horrid swann was unable frankly to appreciate this point on the other hand he knew that such generalisations as people are so horrid and a word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil were generally accepted as true there must therefore be cases to which they were literally applicable could odettes case be one of these he teased himself with the question though not for long for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father whenever he was faced by a difficult problem in any event that world of society which concealed such terrors for odette inspired her probably with no very great longing to enter it since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it at the same time while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity she had for instance kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker now retired from business up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day she still thirsted to be in the fashion though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people for the latter fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders who project it to a considerable distance—with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre—over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends whose names form a sort of tabulated index people in society know this index by heart they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste of tact so automatic in its operation that swann for example without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been just as a man of letters merely by reading a phrase can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author but odette was one of those persons an extremely numerous class whatever the fashionable world may think and to be found in every section of society who do not share this knowledge but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong but has the special characteristic—common alike to the fashion of which odette used to dream and to that before which mme cottard bowed—of being directly accessible to all the other kind the fashion of fashionable people is it must be admitted accessible also but there are inevitable delays odette would say of some one he never goes to any place that isnt really smart

   and if swann were to ask her what she meant by that she would answer with a touch of contempt smart places why good heavens just fancy at your age having to be told what the smart places are in paris what do you expect me to say well on sunday mornings theres the avenue de limpératrice and round the lake at five oclock and on thursdays the edenthéâtre and the hippodrome on fridays then there are the balls

   what balls

   why silly the balls people give in paris the smart ones i mean wait now herbinger you know who i mean the fellow whos in one of the jobbers offices yes of course you must know him hes one of the bestknown men in paris that great big fairhaired boy who wears such swagger clothes he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a lightcoloured overcoat with a fold down the back he goes about with that old image takes her to all the firstnights very well he gave a ball the other night and all the smart people in paris were there i should have loved to go but you had to shew your invitation at the door and i couldnt get one anywhere after all im just as glad now that i didnt go i should have been killed in the crush and seen nothing still just to be able to say one had been to herbingers ball you know how vain i am however you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories but i am surprised that you werent there a regular tiptopper like you

   swann made no attempt however to modify this conception of fashion feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth was just as fatuous devoid of all importance he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress with the result that after a few months she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at racemeetings or firstnights at the theatre she hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the marquise de villeparisis in the street wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings

   but she looks like a pewopener like an old charwoman darling that a marquise goodness knows im not a marquise but youd have to pay me a lot of money before youd get me to go about paris rigged out like that

   nor could she understand swanns continuing to live in his house on the quai dorléans which though she dared not tell him so she considered unworthy of him

   it was true that she claimed to be fond of antiques and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day rummaging in secondhand shops hunting for bricàbrac and things of the right date although it was a point of honour to which she obstinately clung as though obeying some old family custom that she should never answer any questions never give any account of what she did during the daytime she spoke to swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited and had found that everything in it was of the period swann could not get her to tell him what period it was only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was mediaeval by which she meant that the walls were panelled some time later she spoke to him again of her friend and added in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere at dinner the night before of whom one had never heard until then but whom ones hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that ones listener will know quite well who is meant and will be duly impressed her diningroom is eighteenth century incidentally she had thought it hideous all bare as though the house were still unfinished women looked frightful in it and it would never become the fashion she mentioned it again a third time when she shewed swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the diningroom and whom she wanted to send for when she had enough money to see whether he could not do one for her too not one like that of course but one of the sort she used to dream of one which unfortunately her little house would not be large enough to contain with tall sideboards renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the château at blois it was on this occasion that she let out to swann what she really thought of his abode on the quai dorléans he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged not in the louis xvi style for he went on although that was not of course done still it might be made charming but in the shamantique

   you wouldnt have her live like you among a lot of brokendown chairs and threadbare carpets she exclaimed the innate respectability of the middleclass housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the light woman

   people who enjoyed pickingup things who admired poetry despised sordid calculations of profit and loss and nourished ideals of honour and love she placed in a class by themselves superior to the rest of humanity there was no need actually to have those tastes provided one talked enough about them when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age since he was not concerned about the things that interested it and that he belonged to another generation altogether she would come home saying why hes an adorable creature so sensitive i had no idea and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship but on the other hand men who like swann had these tastes but did not speak of them left her cold she was obliged of course to admit that swann was most generous with his money but she would add pouting its not the same thing you see with him and as a matter of fact what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness but its vocabulary

   feeling that often he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion which all the same he loved as he could not help loving everything that came from her which even fascinated him for were they not so many more of those characteristic features by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged and were made visible and so when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the reine topaze or when her eyes grew serious troubled petulant if she was afraid of missing the flowershow or merely of not being in time for tea with muffins and toast at the rue royale tearooms where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable and set the seal upon a womans certificate of smartness swann enraptured as all of us are at times by the natural behaviour of a child or by the likeness of a portrait which appears to be on the point of speaking would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips oh then so little odette wants us to take her to the flowershow does she she wants to be admired does she very well we will take her there we can but obey her wishes as swanns sight was beginning to fail he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles which he wore at home when working while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass as being less disfiguring the first time that she saw it in his eye she could not contain herself for joy i really do think—for a man that is to say—it is tremendously smart how nice you look with it every inch a gentleman all you want now is a title she concluded with a tinge of regret in her voice he liked odette to say these things just as if he had been in love with a breton girl he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts always until then as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common he would take a little servantgirl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed or to an exhibition of impressionist painting with the conviction moreover that an educated society woman would have understood them no better but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily but now that he was in love with odette all this was changed to share her sympathies to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked and did find a pleasure not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions which was all the deeper because as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence they suggested to him nothing except that love for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own if he went again to serge panine if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch olivier métra conducting it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in odettes mind of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes this charm of drawing him closer to her which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places which appealed to him by their beauty but without recalling her besides having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint until his scepticism as a finished man of the world had gradually penetrated them unawares he held or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes and consists in a series of fashions the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined and as he had decided that the importance which odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the prince of wales so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for montecarlo or for the righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for holland which she imagined as ugly and for versailles which bored her to tears and so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her

   like everything else that formed part of odettes environment and was no more in a sense than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often he enjoyed the society of the verdurins with them since at the heart of all their entertainments dinners musical evenings games suppers in fancy dress excursions to the country theatre parties even the infrequent big evenings when they entertained bores there were the presence of odette the sight of odette conversation with odette an inestimable boon which the verdurins by inviting him to their house bestowed on swann he was happier in the little nucleus than anywhere else and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life never daring to whisper to himself lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion that he would always be in love with odette at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the verdurins a proposition which a priori raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence he saw himself for the future continuing to meet odette every evening that did not perhaps come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her but for the moment while he was in love with her to feel that he would not one day cease to see her was all that he could ask what a charming atmosphere he said to himself how entirely genuine life is to these people they are far more intelligent far more artistic surely than the people one knows mme verdurin in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd has a sincere love of painting and music what a passion for works of art what anxiety to give pleasure to artists her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong possibly i make no great intellectual demands upon conversation but i am perfectly happy talking to cottard although he does trot out those idiotic puns and as for the painter if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical still he has one of the finest brains that i have ever come across besides what is most important one feels quite free there one does what one likes without constraint or fuss what a flow of humour there is every day in that drawingroom certainly with a few rare exceptions i never want to go anywhere else again it will become more and more of a habit and i shall spend the rest of my life among them

   and as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the verdurin character were no more really than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for odette those qualities became more serious more profound more vital as that pleasure increased since mme verdurin gave swann now and then what alone could constitute his happiness since on an evening when he felt anxious because odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another and in a spasm of irritation would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home mme verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation odette youll see m swann home wont you since when the summer holidays came and after he had asked himself uneasily whether odette might not leave paris without him whether he would still be able to see her every day mme verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country swann unconsciously allowing gratitude and selfinterest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas went so far as to proclaim that mme verdurin was a great and noble soul should any of his old fellowpupils in the louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist id a hundred times rather he would reply have the verdurins and with a solemnity of diction which was new in him they are magnanimous creatures and magnanimity is after all the one thing that matters the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth look you there are only two classes of men the magnanimous and the rest and i have reached an age when one has to take sides to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike to stick to the people one likes and to make up for the time one has wasted with the others never to leave them again as long as one lives very well he went on with the slight emotion which a man feels when even without being fully aware of what he is doing he says something not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else the die is now cast i have elected to love none but magnanimous souls and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity you ask me whether mme verdurin is really intelligent i can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart of a loftiness of soul to which no one could possibly attain—how could they—without a corresponding loftiness of mind without question she has a profound understanding of art but it is not perhaps in that that she is most admirable every little action ingeniously exquisitely kind which she has performed for my sake every friendly attention simple little things quite domestic and yet quite sublime reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy

     

   he might have reminded himself all the same that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the verdurins companions of his early days who were just as fond of art that he knew other greathearted creatures and that nevertheless since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity the arts and magnanimity he had entirely ceased to see them but these people did not know odette and if they had known her would never have thought of introducing her to him

   and so there was probably not in the whole of the verdurin circle a single one of the faithful who loved them or believed that he loved them as dearly as did swann and yet when m verdurin said that he was not satisfied with swann he had not only expressed his own sentiments he had unwittingly discovered his wifes doubtless swann had too particular an affection for odette as to which he had failed to take mme verdurin daily into his confidence doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the verdurins hospitality refraining often from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some bore or other doubtless also and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society—doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with swann but the real the fundamental reason was quite different what had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door a reserved impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the princesse de sagan was not grotesque and that cottards jokes were not amusing in a word and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all or revolted from their dogmas they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him of entirely converting him to their faith the like of which they had never come across in anyone before they would have forgiven his going to the houses of bores to whom as it happened in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the verdurins and all their little nucleus had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those bores in the presence of the faithful but that was an abjuration which as they well knew they were powerless to extort

   what a difference was there in a newcomer whom odette had asked them to invite although she herself had met him only a few times and on whom they were building great hopes—the comte de forcheville it turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brotherinlaw of saniette a discovery which filled all the faithful with amazement the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior socially to their own and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family of course forcheville was enormously the swell which swann was not or had quite ceased to be of course he would never dream of placing as swann now placed the verdurin circle above any other but he lacked that natural refinement which prevented swann from associating himself with the criticisms too obviously false to be worth his notice that mme verdurin levelled at people whom he knew as for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged the bagmans pleasantries which cottard used to hazard—whereas swann who liked both men sincerely could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them forcheville on the other hand was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified amazed by the invective without in the least understanding what it all was about and to be frankly delighted by the wit and the very first dinner at the verdurins at which forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of swann

   there was at this dinner besides the usual party a professor from the sorbonne one brichot who had met m and mme verdurin at a wateringplace somewhere and if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare would gladly have come to them more often for he had that curiosity that superstitious outlook on life which combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies earn for men of intelligence whatever their profession for doctors who do not believe in medicine for schoolmasters who do not believe in latin exercises the reputation of having broad brilliant and indeed superior minds he affected when at mme verdurins to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day when he spoke of philosophy or history principally because he regarded those sciences as no more really than a preparation for life itself and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the little clan what hitherto he had known only from books and also perhaps because having had drilled into him as a boy and having unconsciously preserved a feeling of reverence for certain subjects he thought that he was casting aside the scholars gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung

   early in the course of the dinner when m de forcheville seated on the right of mme verdurin who in the newcomers honour had taken great pains with her toilet observed to her quite original that white dress the doctor who had never taken his eyes off him so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a de and was on the lookout for an opportunity of attracting his attention so as to come into closer contact with him caught in its flight the adjective blanche and his eyes still glued to his plate snapped out blanche blanche of castile then without moving his head shot a furtive glance to right and left of him doubtful but happy on the whole while swann by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile testified that he thought the pun absurd forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety and that he was a man of the world by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed mme verdurin

   what are you to say of a scientist like that she asked forcheville you cant talk seriously to him for two minutes on end is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital she went on turning to the doctor they must have some pretty lively times there if thats the case i can see that i shall have to get taken in as a patient

   i think i heard the doctor speak of that wicked old humbug blanche of castile if i may so express myself am i not right madame brichot appealed to mme verdurin who swooning with merriment her eyes tightly closed had buried her face in her two hands from between which now and then escaped a muffled scream

   good gracious madame i would not dream of shocking the reverentminded if there are any such around this table sub rosa i recognise moreover that our ineffable and athenian—oh how infinitely athenian—republic is capable of honouring in the person of that obscurantist old shecapet the first of our chiefs of police yes indeed my dear host yes indeed he repeated in his ringing voice which sounded a separate note for each syllable in reply to a protest by m verdurin the chronicle of saint denis and the authenticity of its information is beyond question leaves us no room for doubt on that point no one could be more fitly chosen as patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a saint who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides as suger says and other great st bernards of the sort for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased

   who is that gentleman forcheville asked mme verdurin he seems to speak with great authority

   what do you mean to say you dont know the famous brichot why hes celebrated all over europe

   oh thats bréchot is it exclaimed forcheville who had not quite caught the name you must tell me all about him he went on fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity its always interesting to meet wellknown people at dinner but i say you ask us to very select parties here no dull evenings in this house im sure

   well you know what it is really said mme verdurin modestly they feel safe here they can talk about whatever they like and the conversation goes off like fireworks now brichot this evening is nothing ive seen him dont you know when hes been with me simply dazzling youd want to go on your knees to him well with anyone else hes not the same man hes not in the least witty you have to drag the words out of him hes even boring

   thats strange remarked forcheville with fitting astonishment

   a sort of wit like brichots would have been regarded as outandout stupidity by the people among whom swann had spent his early life for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence and the intelligence of the professors vigorous and wellnourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to swann but these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence including that annex to social existence which belongs strictly speaking to the domain of intelligence namely conversation that swann could not see anything in brichots pleasantries to him they were merely pedantic vulgar and disgustingly coarse he was shocked too being accustomed to good manners by the rude almost barrackroom tone which this studentinarms adopted no matter to whom he was speaking finally perhaps he had lost all patience that evening as he watched mme verdurin welcoming with such unnecessary warmth this forcheville fellow whom it had been odettes unaccountable idea to bring to the house feeling a little awkward with swann there also she had asked him on her arrival what do you think of my guest

   and he suddenly realising for the first time that forcheville whom he had known for years could actually attract a woman and was quite a good specimen of a man had retorted beastly he had certainly no idea of being jealous of odette but did not feel quite so happy as usual and when brichot having begun to tell them the story of blanche of castiles mother who according to him had been with henry plantagenet for years before they were married tried to prompt swann to beg him to continue the story by interjecting isnt that so m swann in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the fear of god into a trooper swann cut his story short to the intense fury of their hostess by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in blanche of castile as he had something that he wished to ask the painter he it appeared had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist also a friend of mme verdurin who had recently died and swann wished to find out from him for he valued his discrimination whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions

   from that point of view it was extraordinary but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call elevated said swann with a smile

   elevated to the height of an institute interrupted cottard raising his arms with mock solemnity the whole table burst out laughing

   what did i tell you said mme verdurin to forcheville its simply impossible to be serious with him when you least expect it out he comes with a joke

   but she observed that swann and swann alone had not unbent for one thing he was none too well pleased with cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of forcheville but the painter instead of replying in a way that might have interested swann as he would probably have done had they been alone together preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend

   i went up to one of them he began just to see how it was done i stuck my nose into it yes i dont think impossible to say whether it was done with glue with soap with sealingwax with sunshine with leaven with excrem

   and one make twelve shouted the doctor wittily but just too late for no one saw the point of his interruption

   it looks as though it were done with nothing at all resumed the painter no more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the night watch or the regents and its even bigger work than either rembrandt or hals ever did its all there—and yet no ill take my oath it isnt

   then just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto he had to be satisfied with murmuring smiling the while as if after all there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting it smells all right it makes your head go round it catches your breath you feel ticklish all over—and not the faintest clue to how its done the mans a sorcerer the things a conjuringtrick its a miracle bursting outright into laughter its dishonest then stopping solemnly raising his head pitching his voice on a doublebass note which he struggled to bring into harmony he concluded and its so loyal

   except at the moment when he had called it bigger than the night watch a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from mme verdurin who regarded the night watch as the supreme masterpiece of the universe conjointly with the ninth and the samothrace and at the word excrement which had made forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was all right before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile all the party save swann had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter

   i do so love him when he goes up in the air like that cried mme verdurin the moment that he had finished enraptured that the tabletalk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that forcheville was dining with them for the first time hallo you she turned to her husband whats the matter with you sitting there gaping like a great animal you know though dont you she apologised for him to the painter that he can talk quite well when he chooses anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you if you had only seen him while you were speaking he was just drinking it all in and tomorrow he will tell us everything you said without missing a word

   no really im not joking protested the painter enchanted by the success of his speech you all look as if you thought i was pulling your legs that it was just a trick ill take you to see the show and then you can say whether ive been exaggerating ill bet you anything you like youll come away more up in the air than i am

   but we dont suppose for a moment that youre exaggerating we only want you to go on with your dinner and my husband too give m biche some more sole cant you see his has got cold were not in any hurry youre dashing round as if the house was on fire wait a little dont serve the salad just yet

   mme cottard who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom was not lacking for all that in selfassurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth she felt that it would be well received the thought gave her confidence and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself as of helping her husband on in his career and so she did not allow the word salad which mme verdurin had just uttered to pass unchallenged

   its not a japanese salad is it she whispered turning towards odette

   and then in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by dumas she broke down in a charming girlish laugh not very loud but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it

   who is that lady she seems devilish clever said forcheville

   no it is not but we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on friday

   you will think me dreadfully provincial sir said mme cottard to swann but do you know i havent been yet to this famous francillon that everybodys talking about the doctor has been i remember now he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there and i must confess i dont see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me when hes seen the play already of course an evening at the théâtrefrançais is never wasted really the actings so good there always but we have some very nice friends mme cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name but restricted herself to some friends of ours or one of my friends as being more distinguished speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses who often have a box and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to and so im certain to see this francillon sooner or later and then i shall know what to think but i do feel such a fool about it i must confess for whenever i pay a call anywhere i find everybody talking—its only natural—about that wretched japanese salad really and truly ones beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it she went on seeing that swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic i must admit though that its sometimes quite amusing the way they joke about it ive got a friend now who is most original though shes really a beautiful woman most popular in society goes everywhere and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these japanese salads putting in everything that young m dumas says youre to put in in the play then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it i was not among the favoured few im sorry to say but she told us all about it on her next day it seems it was quite horrible she made us all laugh till we cried i dont know perhaps it was the way she told it mme cottard added doubtfully seeing that swann still looked grave

   and imagining that it was perhaps because he had not been amused by francillon well i daresay i shall be disappointed with it after all i dont suppose its as good as the piece mme de crécy worships serge panine theres a play if you like so deep makes you think but just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the théâtrefrançais now serge panine— but then its like everything that comes from the pen of m georges ohnet its so well written i wonder if you know the maître des forges which i like even better than serge panine

   pardon me said swann with polite irony but i can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces

   really now thats very interesting and what dont you like about them wont you ever change your mind perhaps you think hes a little too sad well well what i always say is one should never argue about plays or novels everyone has his own way of looking at things and what may be horrible to you is perhaps just what i like best

   she was interrupted by forchevilles addressing swann what had happened was that while mme cottard was discussing francillon forcheville had been expressing to mme verdurin his admiration for what he called the little speech of the painter your friend has such a flow of language such a memory he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill ive seldom seen anything like it hed make a firstrate preacher by jove i wish i was like that what with him and m bréchot youve drawn two lucky numbers tonight though im not so sure that simply as a speaker this one doesnt knock spots off the professor it comes more naturally with him less like reading from a book of course the way he goes on he does use some words that are a bit realistic and all that but thats quite the thing nowadays anyhow its not often ive seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that hold the spittoon as we used to say in the regiment where by the way we had a man he rather reminds me of you could take anything you liked—i dont know what—this glass say and hed talk away about it for hours no not this glass thats a silly thing to say im sorry but something a little bigger like the battle of waterloo or anything of that sort hed tell you things you simply wouldnt believe why swann was in the regiment then he must have known him

   do you see much of m swann asked mme verdurin

   oh dear no he answered and then thinking that if he made himself pleasant to swann he might find favour with odette he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends but speaking as a man of the world himself in a tone of goodnatured criticism and not as though he were congratulating swann upon some undeserved good fortune isnt that so swann i never see anything of you do i—but then where on earth is one to see him the creature spends all his time shut up with the la trémoïlles with the laumes and all that lot the imputation would have been false at any time and was all the more so now that for at least a year swann had given up going to almost any house but the verdurins but the mere names of families whom the verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence m verdurin dreading the painful impression which the mention of these bores especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion and in front of all the faithful was bound to make on his wife cast a covert glance at her instinct with anxious solicitude he saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice to have escaped contact altogether with the news which had just been addressed to her not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting should we appear to have heard it without protesting or when some one utters the name of an enemy the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden mme verdurin so that her silence should have the appearance not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve had suddenly emptied her face of all life of all mobility her rounded forehead was nothing now but an exquisite study in high relief which the name of those la trémoïlles with whom swann was always shut up had failed to penetrate her nose just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown exposed to view two dark cavities that were surely modelled from life you would have said that her halfopened lips were just about to speak it was all no more however than a wax cast a mask in plaster the sculptors design for a monument a bust to be exhibited in the palace of industry where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the verdurins as opposed to that of the la trémoïlles or laumes whose equals if not indeed their betters they were and the equals and betters of all other bores upon the face of the earth had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone but the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didnt do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a collidor

   youd need to pay me a lot of money before id let any of that lot set foot inside my house mme verdurin concluded gazing imperially down on swann

   she could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianists aunt who at once exclaimed to think of that now what surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them im sure i should be afraid one cant be too careful how can people be so common as to go running after them

   but he might at least have replied like forcheville gad shes a duchess there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing which would at least have permitted mme verdurin the final retort and a lot of good may it do them instead of which swann merely smiled in a manner which shewed quite clearly that he could not of course take such an absurd suggestion seriously m verdurin who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife could see with regret and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a grand inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy and so in the hope of bringing swann round to a retractation for the courage of ones opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the other side he broke in

   tell us frankly now what you think of them yourself we shant repeat it to them you may be sure

   to which swann answered why im not in the least afraid of the duchess if it is of the la trémoïlles that youre speaking i can assure you that everyone likes going to see her i dont go so far as to say that shes at all deep— he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music had inclined him temporarily to discard so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth—but i am quite sincere when i say that she is intelligent while her husband is positively a bookworm they are charming people

   his explanation was terribly effective mme verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her little nucleus from ever attaining to complete unanimity and was unable to restrain herself in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her but cried aloud from the depths of her tortured heart you may think so if you wish but at least you need not say so to us

   it all depends upon what you call intelligence forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant come now swann tell us what you mean by intelligence

   there cried odette thats one of the big things i beg him to tell me about and he never will

   oh but protested swann

   oh but nonsense said odette

   a waterbutt asked the doctor

   to you pursued forcheville does intelligence mean what they call clever talk you know the sort of people who worm their way into society

   finish your sweet so that they can take your plate away said mme verdurin sourly to saniette who was lost in thought and had stopped eating and then perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness it doesnt matter take your time about it theres no hurry i only reminded you because of the others you know it keeps the servants back

   there is began brichot with a resonant smack upon every syllable a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist fénelon

   just listen to this mme verdurin rallied forcheville and the doctor hes going to give us fénelons definition of intelligence thats interesting its not often you get a chance of hearing that

   but brichot was keeping fénelons definition until swann should have given his own swann remained silent and by this fresh act of recreancy spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which mme verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to forcheville

   you see its just the same as with me odette was peevish im not at all sorry to see that im not the only one he doesnt find quite up to his level

   these de la trémouailles whom mme verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired inquired brichot articulating vigorously are they by any chance descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob sévigné said she was delighted to know because it was so good for her peasants true the marquise had another reason which in her case probably came first for she was a thorough journalist at heart and always on the lookout for copy and in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter it was mme de la trémouaille kept wellinformed through all her grand connections who supplied the foreign politics

   oh dear no im quite sure they arent the same family said mme verdurin desperately

   saniette who ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler had been plunged once more in silent meditation emerged finally to tell them with a nervous laugh a story of how he had once dined with the duc de la trémoïlle the point of which was that the duke did not know that george sand was the pseudonym of a woman swann who really liked saniette felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the dukes culture which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible but suddenly he stopped short he had realised as he was speaking that saniette needed no proof but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it the worthy man suffered acutely from the verdurins always finding him so dull and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing at least once before the end of dinner he surrendered so quickly looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins and replied in so craven a tone to swann appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous all right all right anyhow even if i have made a mistake thats not a crime i hope that swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny the doctor who had been listening had an idea that it was the right moment to interject se non è vero but he was not quite certain of the words and was afraid of being caught out

   after dinner forcheville went up to the doctor she cant have been at all bad looking mme verdurin anyhow shes a woman you can really talk to thats all i want of course shes getting a bit broad in the beam but mme de crécy theres a little woman who knows whats what all right upon my word and soul you can see at a glance shes got the american eye that girl has we are speaking of mme de crécy he explained as m verdurin joined them his pipe in his mouth i should say that as a specimen of the female form—

   id rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder the words came tumbling from cottard who had for some time been waiting in vain until forcheville should pause for breath so that he might get in his hoary old joke a chance for which might not he feared come again if the conversation should take a different turn and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness and the slight flutter of emotion inseparable from a prepared recitation forcheville knew and saw the joke and was thoroughly amused as for m verdurin he was unsparing of his merriment having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol different from his wifes but equally simple and obvious scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was shaking with laughter than he would begin also to cough as though in laughing too violently he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe and by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumbshow of suffocation and hilarity so he and mme verdurin who at the other side of the room where the painter was telling her a story was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands resembled two masks in a theatre each representing comedy but in a different way

   m verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth for cottard having occasion to leave the room for a moment murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question i must just go and see the duc daumale for a minute so drolly that m verdurins cough began all over again

   now then take your pipe out of your mouth cant you see youll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that counselled mme verdurin as she came round with a tray of liqueurs

   what a delightful man your husband is he has the wit of a dozen declared forcheville to mme cottard thank you thank you an old soldier like me can never say no to a drink

   m de forcheville thinks odette charming m verdurin told his wife

   why do you know she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon we must arrange it but dont on any account let swann hear about it he spoils everything dont you know i dont mean to say that youre not to come to dinner too of course we hope to see you very often now that the warm weathers coming were going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can that wont bore you will it a quiet little dinner now and then in the bois splendid splendid that will be quite delightful

   arent you going to do any work this evening i say she screamed suddenly to the little pianist seeing an opportunity for displaying before a newcomer of forchevilles importance at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the faithful

   m de forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you mme cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room and he still following up the idea of forchevilles noble birth which had obsessed him all through dinner began again with i am treating a baroness just now baroness putbus werent there some putbuses in the crusades anyhow theyve got a lake in pomerania thats ten times the size of the place de la concorde i am treating her for dry arthritis shes a charming woman mme verdurin knows her too i believe

   which enabled forcheville a moment later finding himself alone with mme cottard to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with hes an interesting man too you can see that he knows some good people gad but they get to know a lot of things those doctors

   dyou want me to play the phrase from the sonata for m swann asked the pianist

   what the devils that not the sonatasnake i hope shouted m de forcheville hoping to create an effect but dr cottard who had never heard this pun missed the point of it and imagined that m de forcheville had made a mistake he dashed in boldly to correct it no no the word isnt serpentàsonates its serpentàsonnettes he explained in a tone at once zealous impatient and triumphant

   forcheville explained the joke to him the doctor blushed

   youll admit its not bad eh doctor

   oh ive known it for ages

   then they were silenced heralded by the waving tremolo of the violinpart which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it—and as in a mountainous country against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent one may distinguish two hundred feet below the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley—the little phrase had just appeared distant but graceful protected by the long gradual unfurling of its transparent incessant and sonorous curtain and swann in his heart of hearts turned to it spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love as to a friend of odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this forcheville

   ah youve come too late mme verdurin greeted one of the faithful whose invitation had been only to look in after dinner weve been having a simply incomparable brichot you never heard such eloquence but hes gone isnt that so m swann i believe its the first time youve met him she went on to emphasize the fact that it was to her that swann owed the introduction isnt that so wasnt he delicious our brichot

   swann bowed politely

   no you werent interested she asked dryly

   oh but i assure you i was quite enthralled he is perhaps a little too peremptory a little too jovial for my taste i should like to see him a little less confident at times a little more tolerant but one feels that he knows a great deal and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow

   the party broke up very late cottards first words to his wife were i have rarely seen mme verdurin in such form as she was tonight

   what exactly is your mme verdurin a bit of a bad hat eh said forcheville to the painter to whom he had offered a lift odette watched his departure with regret she dared not refuse to let swann take her home but she was moody and irritable in the carriage and when he asked whether he might come in replied i suppose so with an impatient shrug of her shoulders when they had all gone mme verdurin said to her husband did you notice the way swann laughed such an idiotic laugh when we spoke about mme la trémoïlle

   she had remarked more than once how swann and forcheville suppressed the particle de before that ladys name never doubting that it was done on purpose to shew that they were not afraid of a title she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take moreover the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism she still said instinctively the de la trémoïlles or rather by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of musichall singers and the writers of the captions beneath caricatures who elide the de the dla trémoïlles but she corrected herself at once to madame la trémoïlle—the duchess as swann calls her she added ironically with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting and would not herself accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd

   i dont mind saying that i thought him extremely stupid

   m verdurin took it up hes not sincere hes a crafty customer always hovering between one side and the other hes always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds what a difference between him and forcheville there at least you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks either you agree with him or you dont not like the other fellow whos never definitely fish or fowl did you notice by the way that odette seemed all out for forcheville and i dont blame her either and then after all if swann tries to come the man of fashion over us the champion of distressed duchesses at any rate the other man has got a title hes always comte de forcheville he let the words slip delicately from his lips as though familiar with every page of the history of that dignity he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value in relation to others of the sort

   i dont mind saying mme verdurin went on that he saw fit to utter some most venomous and quite absurd insinuations against brichot naturally once he saw that brichot was popular in this house it was a way of hitting back at us of spoiling our party i know his sort the dear good friend of the family who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as hes going away

   didnt i say so retorted her husband hes simply a failure a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything thats at all big

   had the truth been known there was not one of the faithful who was not infinitely more malicious than swann but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries with little sparks of emotion and cordiality while the least indication of reserve on swanns part undraped in any such conventional formula as of course i dont want to say anything— to which he would have scorned to descend appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery there are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least freedom of speech is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used it was by the same process that swann infuriated m verdurin in his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs

   swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the verdurins and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light through the admiring eyes of love

   as a rule he made no appointments with odette except for the evenings he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit even for an hour the place that he held in her thoughts and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention in any way that would not be displeasing to her if in a florists or a jewellers window a plant or an ornament caught his eye he would at once think of sending them to odette imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt also by her and would increase her affection for himself and he would order them to be taken at once to the rue la pérouse so as to accelerate the moment in which as she received an offering from him he might feel himself in a sense transported into her presence he was particularly anxious always that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the verdurins might even—for all he knew—if the shopkeeper made haste bring him a letter from her before dinner or herself in person upon his doorstep come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks as in an earlier phase when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings which she had never yet revealed

   often she was embarrassed by lack of money and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance he enjoyed this as he enjoyed everything which could impress odette with his love for herself or merely with his influence with the extent of the use that she might make of him probably if anyone had said to him at the beginning its your position that attracts her or at this stage its your money that shes really in love with he would not have believed the suggestion nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him that people felt them to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth but even if he had accepted the possibility it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that odettes love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him on a sound commercial interest an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end for the moment while he lavished presents upon her and performed all manner of services he could rely on advantages not contained in his person or in his intellect could forego the endless killing effort to make himself attractive and this delight in being a lover in living by love alone of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful the price which in the long run he must pay for it as a dilettante in immaterial sensations enhanced its value in his eyes—as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable become convinced that they are as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed

   one day when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of odette as of a kept woman and when once again he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification the kept woman—an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities embroidered as in some fantasy of gustave moreau with poisondripping flowers interwoven with precious jewels—with that odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer resentment of an act of injustice gratitude for an act of kindness which he had seen in earlier days on his own mothers face and on the faces of friends that odette whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone his collections his room his old servant his banker who kept all his titledeeds and bonds—the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly to draw some money and indeed if during the current month he were to come less liberally to the aid of odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before when he had given her five thousand francs if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline that gratitude which had made him so happy and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer had itself diminished and then suddenly he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by keeping a woman as if in fact that idea of keeping could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life such as that thousandfranc note a familiar and domestic object torn in places and mended with gummed paper which his valet after paying the household accounts and the rent had locked up hi a drawer in the old writingdesk whence he had extracted it to send it with four others to odette and whether it was not possible to apply to odette since he had known her for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else before that title which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her of kept woman he could not explore the idea further for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was with him congenital intermittent and providential happened at that moment to extinguish every particle of light in his brain as instantaneously as at a later period when electric lighting had been everywhere installed it became possible merely by fingering a switch to cut off all the supply of light from a house his mind fumbled for a moment in the darkness he took off his spectacles wiped the glasses passed his hands over his eyes but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea the realisation that he must endeavour in the coming month to send odette six or seven thousandfranc notes instead of five simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure

   in the evening when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet odette at the verdurins or rather at one of the openair restaurants which they liked to frequent in the bois and especially at saintcloud he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which at one time he had been a constant guest he did not wish to lose touch with people who for all that he knew might be of use some day to odette and thanks to whom he was often in the meantime able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure besides he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that side by side with his contempt there had grown up also a desperate need for it with the result that when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort he had the same regard—to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected—for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats straight upstairs to the fifth floor and the door on the left as for the princesse de parme who gave the most splendid parties in paris but he had not the feeling of being actually at the ball when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house while the spectacle of washhandstands covered over with towels and of beds converted into cloakrooms with a mass of hats and greatcoats sprawling over their counterpanes gave him the same stifling sensation that nowadays people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed if he were dining out he would order his carriage for halfpast seven while he changed his clothes he would be wondering all the time about odette and in this way was never alone for the constant thought of odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side he would get into his carriage and drive off but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee like a pet animal which he might take everywhere and would keep with him at the dinnertable unobserved by his fellowguests he would stroke and fondle it warm himself with it and as a feeling of languor swept over him would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils—a new experience this—as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole he had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy especially since odette had brought forcheville to the verdurins and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country but he could never summon up courage to leave paris even for a day while odette was there the weather was warm it was the finest part of the spring and for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned near combray where at four in the afternoon before coming to the asparagusbed thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from méséglise he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond fringed with forgetmenot and iris and where when he sat down to dinner trained and twined by the gardeners skilful hand there ran all about his table currantbush and rose

   after dinner if he had an early appointment in the bois or at saintcloud he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly—especially if it threatened to rain and so to scatter the faithful before their normal time—that on one occasion the princesse des laumes at whose house dinner had been so late that swann had left before the coffee came in to join the verdurins on the island in the bois observed

   really if swann were thirty years older and had diabetes there might be some excuse for his running away like that he seems to look upon us all as a joke

   he persuaded himself that the springtime charm which he could not go down to combray to enjoy he would find at least on the he des cygnes or at saintcloud but as he could think only of odette he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves or if the moon had been shining he would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata played in the garden on the restaurant piano if there was none in the garden the verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself not because swann was now restored to favour far from it but the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one even for some one whom they disliked would stimulate them during the time spent in its preparation to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky but the state of excitement into which odettes presence never failed to throw him added to a feverish ailment which for some time now had scarcely left him robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature

   one evening when swann had consented to dine with the verdurins and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend next day the annual banquet of an old comrades association odette had at once exclaimed across the table in front of everyone in front of forcheville who was now one of the faithful in front of the painter in front of cottard

   yes i know you have your banquet tomorrow i shant see you then till i get home dont be too late

   and although swann had never yet taken offence at all seriously at odettes demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the faithful he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow before them all with that calm immodesty the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening his privileged position in her house and her own preference for him which it implied it was true that swann had often reflected that odette was in no way a remarkable woman and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the faithful but since he had observed that to several other men than himself odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart and he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings when he held her upon his knee made her tell him what she thought about this or that and counted over that treasure to which alone of all his earthly possessions he still clung and so after this dinner drawing her aside he took care to thank her effusively seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable from the assaults of jealousy

   when he came away from his banquet the next evening it was pouring rain and he had nothing but his victoria a friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage and as odette by the fact of her having invited him to come had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else he could with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart rather than set off thus in the rain have gone home and to bed but perhaps if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening without exception in her company she might grow careless and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it

   it was after eleven when he reached her door and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier she complained that it was indeed very late the storm had made her unwell her head ached and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour that at midnight she would send him away a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep

   no cattleya then tonight he asked and ive been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya

   but she was irresponsive saying nervously no dear no cattleya tonight cant you see im not well

   it might have done you good but i wont bother you

   she begged him to put out the light before he went he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her but when he was in his own house again the idea suddenly struck him that perhaps odette was expecting some one else that evening that she had merely pretended to be tired that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night he looked at his watch it was about an hour and a half since he had left her he went out took a cab and stopped it close to her house in a little street running at right angles to that other street which lay at the back of her house and along which he used to go sometimes to tap upon her bedroom window for her to let him in he left his cab the streets were all deserted and dark he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows the lights in which had long since been put out he saw one and only one from which overflowed between the slats of its shutters dosed like a winepress over its mysterious golden juice the light that filled the room within a light which on so many evenings as soon as he saw it far off as he turned into the street had rejoiced his heart with its message she is there—expecting you and now tortured him with she is there with the man she was expecting he must know who he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing he could hear only in the silence of the night the murmur of conversation what agony he suffered as he watched that light in whose golden atmosphere were moving behind the closed sash the unseen and detested pair as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure the perfidy of odette and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger

   and yet he was not sorry that he had come the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty now that odettes other life of which he had had at that first moment a sudden helpless suspicion was definitely there almost within his grasp before his eyes in the full glare of the lamplight caught and kept there an unwitting prisoner in that room into which when he would he might force his way to surprise and seize it or rather he would tap upon the shutters as he had often done when he had come there very late and by that signal odette would at least learn that he knew that he had seen the light and had heard the voices while he himself who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked now it was he that saw them confident and persistent in their error tricked and trapped by none other than himself whom they believed to be a mile away but who was there in person there with a plan there with the knowledge that he was going in another minute to tap upon the shutter and perhaps what he felt almost an agreeable feeling at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt at the soothing of a pain was an intellectual pleasure if since he had fallen in love things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago—though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought a memory of odette—now it was another of the faculties prominent in the studious days of his youth that odette had quickened with new life the passion for truth but for a truth which too was interposed between himself and his mistress receiving its light from her alone a private and personal truth the sole object of which an infinitely precious object and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty was odette—odette in her activities her environment her projects and her past at every other period in his life the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to swann if gossip about such things were repeated to him he would dismiss it as insignificant and while he listened it was only the lowest the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired but in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged so deepened that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself to know the least details of a womans daily occupation was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history and all manner of actions from which until now he would have recoiled in shame such as spying tonight outside a window tomorrow for all he knew putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses bribing servants listening at doors seemed to him now to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts the weighing of evidence the interpretation of old monuments that was to say so many different methods of scientific investigation each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth

   as his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that odette would now know that he had suspected her that he had returned that he had posted himself outside her window she had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men of lovers who spied what he was going to do would be extremely awkward and she would detest him for ever after whereas now for the moment for so long as he refrained from knocking perhaps even in the act of infidelity she loved him still how often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to ones impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification but his desire to know the truth was stronger and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her he knew that the true story of certain events which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full was to be read within that window streaked with bars of light as within the illuminated golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved he yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief fleeting precious transcript on that translucent page so warm so beautiful and besides the advantage which he felt—which he so desperately wanted to feel—that he had over them lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew he drew himself up on tiptoe he knocked they had not heard he knocked again louder their conversation ceased a mans voice—he strained his ears to distinguish whose among such of odettes friends as he knew the voice could be—asked

   whos that

   he could not be certain of the voice he knocked once again the window first then the shutters were thrown open it was too late now to retire and since she must know all so as not to seem too contemptible too jealous and inquisitive he called out in a careless hearty welcoming tone

   please dont bother i just happened to be passing and saw the light i wanted to know if you were feeling better

   he looked up two old gentlemen stood facing him in the window one of them with a lamp in his hand and beyond them he could see into the room a room that he had never seen before having fallen into the habit when he came late to odette of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike he had been misled this time by the light and had knocked at the window beyond hers in the adjoining house he made what apology he could and hurried home overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact and that having feigned for so long when in odettes company a sort of indifference he had not now by a demonstration of jealousy given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which in a pair of lovers fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough he never spoke to her of this misadventure he ceased even to think of it himself but now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved would startle it into life thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness and leave him aching with a sharp farrooted pain as though this had been a bodily pain swanns mind was powerless to alleviate it in the case of bodily pain however since it is independent of the mind the mind can dwell upon it can note that it has diminished that it has momentarily ceased but with this mental pain the mind merely by recalling it created it afresh to determine not to think of it was but to think of it still to suffer from it still and when in conversation with his friends he forgot his sufferings suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb when he came away from odette he was happy he felt calm he recalled the smile with which in gentle mockery she had spoken to him of this man or of that a smile which was all tenderness for himself he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall as though against her will upon his lips as she had done on that first evening in the carriage her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders as though shrinking from the cold

   but then at once his jealousy as it had been the shadow of his love presented him with the complement with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening—with which now perversely she was mocking swann while she tendered her love to another—of that lowering of her head but lowered now to fall on other lips and but bestowed upon a stranger of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him and all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were as one might say but so many sketches rough plans like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline enabling swann to form an idea of the various attitudes aflame or faint with passion which she was capable of adopting for others with the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company every new caress that he invented and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was every fresh charm that he found in her for he knew that a moment later they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torturechamber

   a fresh turn was given to the screw when swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted a few days earlier and for the first time in odettes eyes it was after dinner at the verdurins whether it was because forcheville aware that saniette his brotherinlaw was not in favour with them had decided to make a butt of him and to shine at his expense or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which saniette had made to him although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellowguest who knew rather too much about him and whom he knew to be so niceminded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room forcheville replied to saniettes tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse going out of his way to insult him emboldened the louder he shouted by the fear the pain the entreaties of his victim that the poor creature after asking mme verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes odette had looked on impassive at this scene but when the door had closed behind saniette she had forced the normal expression of her face down as the saying is by several pegs so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as forcheville her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime which so clearly implied thats finished him off or im very much mistaken did you see what a fool he looked he was actually crying that forcheville when his eyes met hers sobered in a moment from the anger or pretended anger with which he was still flushed smiled as he explained he need only have made himself pleasant and hed have been here still a good scolding does a man no harm at any time

   one day when swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see it occurred to him to go instead to odette at an hour when although he never went to her house then as a rule he knew that she was always at home resting or writing letters until teatime and would enjoy seeing her for a moment if it did not disturb her the porter told him that he believed odette to be in swann rang the bell thought that he heard a sound that he heard footsteps but no one came to the door anxious and annoyed he went round to the other little street at the back of her house and stood beneath her bedroom window the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing he knocked loudly upon the pane he shouted still no one came he could see that the neighbours were staring at him he turned away thinking that after all he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else after waiting for an hour he returned he found her at home she told him that she had been in the house when he rang but had been asleep the bell had awakened her she had guessed that it must be swann and had run out to meet him but he had already gone she had of course heard him knocking at the window swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars when taken by surprise console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent thinking that it can be safely incorporated and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude it was true that when odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart but as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie she became uneasy all her ideas melted like wax before a flame her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed she might ransack her brain but would find only a void still she must say something and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal which being the truth was the one thing that had remained she broke off from it a tiny fragment of no importance in itself assuring herself that after all it was the best thing to do since it was a detail of the truth and less dangerous therefore than a falsehood at any rate this is true she said to herself thats always something to the good he may make inquiries he will see that this is true it wont be this anyhow that will give me away but she was wrong it was what gave her away she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not be made to fit in except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it edges which whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it would continue to shew by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill that its proper place was elsewhere

   she admits that she heard me ring and then knock that she knew it was myself that she wanted to see me swann thought to himself but that doesnt correspond with the fact that she did not let me in

   he did not however draw her attention to this inconsistency for he thought that if left to herself odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth she spoke he did not interrupt her he gathered up with an eager and sorrowful piety the words that fell from her lips feeling and rightly feeling since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke that like the veil of a sanctuary they kept a vague imprint traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and alas undiscoverable truth—what she had been doing that afternoon at three oclock when he had called—a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications illegible and divine traces a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value but would never yield it up to him it was true that he had now and then a strong suspicion that odettes daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale naturally in a universal sense or for every rational being a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide he realised at such moments that that interest that gloom existed in him only as a malady might exist and that once he was cured of the malady the actions of odette the kisses that she might have bestowed would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women but the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important and to take every possible step to satisfy it swann had in fact reached an age the philosophy of which—supported in his case by the current philosophy of the day as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life the group that surrounded the princesse des laumes in which ones intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of ones disbelief in everything and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered except the individual tastes of each of its members—is no longer that of youth but a positive almost a medical philosophy the philosophy of men who instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent and with which they will deliberately arrange before anything else that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what odette had done just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring with regard to the daily occupations of odette information the lack of which would make him unhappy just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected at least before he had fallen in love such as his taste for collecting things or for good cooking

   when he proposed to take leave of odette and to return home she begged him to stay a little longer and even detained him forcibly seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go but he gave no thought to that for among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation it is inevitable that we should pass without noticing anything that arouses our interest by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed she kept on saying what a dreadful pity you never by any chance come in the afternoon and the one time you do come then i miss you he knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit but as she was a goodnatured woman anxious to give him pleasure and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him he found it quite natural that she should be sorry on this occasion that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company which was so very great a pleasure if not to herself at any rate to him all the same it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him she reminded him even more than was usual of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the primavera she had at that moment their downcast heartbroken expression which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne when they are merely allowing the infant jesus to play with a pomegranate or watching moses pour water into a trough he had seen the same sorrow once before on her face but when he could no longer say then suddenly he remembered it it was when odette had lied in apologising to mme verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness but really so that she might be alone with swann surely even had she been the most scrupulous of women she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie but the lies which odette ordinarily told were less innocent and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends and so when she lied smitten with fear feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence unconfident of success she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion as children weep sometimes when they have not slept she knew also that her lie as a rule was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence and when she had to tell an insignificant social lie its hazardous associations and the memories which it recalled would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing

   what depressing lie was she now concocting for swanns benefit to give her that pained expression that plaintive voice which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make and to plead for pardon he had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him but something more immediate something possibly which had not yet happened but might happen now at any time and when it did would throw a light upon that earlier event at that moment he heard the frontdoor bell ring odette never stopped speaking but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan her regret at not having seen swann that afternoon at not having opened the door to him had melted into a universal despair

   he could hear the gate being closed and the sound of a carriage as though some one were going away—probably the person whom swann must on no account meet—after being told that odette was not at home and then when he reflected that merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted almost to distress but since he was in love with odette since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only and murmured poor darling when finally he left her she took up several letters which were lying on the table and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her he walked along to the postoffice took the letters from his pocket and before dropping each of them into the box scanned its address they were all to tradesmen except the last which was to forcheville he kept it in his hand if i saw what was in this he argued i should know what she calls him what she says to him whether there really is anything between them perhaps if i dont look inside i shall be lacking in delicacy towards odette since in this way alone i can rid myself of a suspicion which is perhaps a calumny on her which must in any case cause her suffering and which can never possibly be set at rest once the letter is posted

   he left the postoffice and went home but he had kept the last letter in his pocket he lighted a candle and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open at first he could distinguish nothing but the envelope was thin and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able through the transparent paper to read the concluding words they were a coldly formal signature if instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to forcheville it had been forcheville who had read a letter addressed to swann he might have found words in it of another a far more tender kind he took a firm hold of the card which was sliding to and fro the envelope being too large for it and then by moving it with his finger and thumb brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled through which alone it was possible to read

   in spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly not that it mattered for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance and had nothing at all to do with love it was something to do with odettes uncle swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line i was right but did not understand what odette had been right in doing until suddenly a word which he had not been able at first to decipher came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible i was right to open the door it was my uncle to open the door then forcheville had been there when swann rang the bell and she had sent him away hence the sound that swann had heard

   after that he read the whole letter at the end she apologised for having treated forcheville with so little ceremony and reminded him that he had left his cigarettecase at her house precisely what she had written to swann after one of his first visits but to swann she had added why did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back to forcheville nothing of that sort no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them and really he was obliged to admit that in all this business forcheville had been worse treated than himself since odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle from which it followed that he swann was the man to whom she attached importance and for whose sake she had sent the other away and yet if there had been nothing between odette and forcheville why not have opened the door at once why have said i was right to open the door it was my uncle right if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door for a time swann stood still there heartbroken bewildered and yet happy gazing at this envelope which odette had handed to him without a scruple so absolute was her trust in his honour through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn a fragment of the life of odette seen as through a narrow luminous incision cut into its surface without her knowledge then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery as though that jealousy had had an independent existence fiercely egotistical gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality even at the expense of swann himself now it had food in store and swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening over the visits that odette had received about five oclock and could seek to discover where forcheville had been at that hour for swanns affection for odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it from the beginning by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination he was not jealous at first of the whole of odettes life but of those moments only in which an incident which he had perhaps misinterpreted had led him to suppose that odette might have played him false his jealousy like an octopus which throws out a first then a second and finally a third tentacle fastened itself irremovably first to that moment five oclock in the afternoon then to another then to another again but swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings they were only the memory the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without

   from without however everything brought him fresh suffering he decided to separate odette from forcheville by taking her away for a few days to the south but he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel and that she coveted them in return and so he who in old days when he travelled used always to seek out new people and crowded places might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him and how could he not have turned misanthrope when in every man he saw a potential lover for odette thus his jealousy did even more than the happy passionate desire which he had originally felt for odette had done to alter swanns character completely changing in the eyes of the world even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible

   a month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read odettes letter to forcheville swann went to a dinner which the verdurins were giving in the bois as the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between mme verdurin and several of her guests and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at chatou now he swann had not been invited to any party

   the verdurins had spoken only in whispers and in vague terms but the painter perhaps without thinking shouted out there must be no lights of any sort and he must play the moonlight sonata in the dark for us to see by

   mme verdurin seeing that swann was within earshot assumed that expression in which the twofold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve oneself an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener is neutralised in an intense vacuity in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made odette seemed suddenly to be in despair as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life and swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which after leaving the restaurant while he drove her home he would be able to ask for an explanation to make her promise either that she would not go to chatou next day or that she would procure an invitation for him also and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him at last the carriages were ordered mme verdurin said to swann

   goodbye then we shall see you soon i hope trying by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile to prevent him from noticing that she was not saying as she would always have until then

   tomorrow then at chatou and at my house the day after m and mme verdurin made forcheville get into their carriage swanns was drawn up behind it and he waited for theirs to start before helping odette into his own

   odette well take you said mme verdurin weve kept a little corner specially for you beside m de forcheville

   yes mme verdurin said odette meekly

   what i thought i was to take you home cried swann flinging discretion to the winds for the carriagedoor hung open time was precious and he could not in his present state go home without her

   but mme verdurin has asked me

   thats all right you can quite well go home alone weve left you like this dozens of times said mme verdurin

   but i had something important to tell mme de crécy

   very well you can write it to her instead

   goodbye said odette holding out her hand

   he tried hard to smile but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected

   what do you think of the airs that swann is pleased to put on with us mme verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home i was afraid he was going to eat me simply because we offered to take odette back it really is too bad that sort of thing why doesnt he say straight out that we keep a disorderly house i cant conceive how odette can stand such manners he positively seems to be saying all the time you belong to me i shall tell odette exactly what i think about it all and i hope she will have the sense to understand me a moment later she added inarticulate with rage no but dont you see the filthy creature using unconsciously and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself—like françoise at combray when the chicken refused to die—the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life and when mme verdurins carriage had moved on and swanns took its place his coachman catching sight of his face asked whether he was unwell or had heard bad news

   swann sent him away he preferred to walk and it was on foot through the bois that he came home he talked to himself aloud and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the little nucleus and extolling the magnanimity of the verdurins but just as the conversation the smiles the kisses of odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming if they were diverted to others than himself so the verdurins drawingroom which not an hour before had still seemed to him amusing inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy now that it was another than himself whom odette was going to meet there to love there without restraint laid bare to him all its absurdities its stupidity its shame

   he drew a fanciful picture at which he shuddered in disgust of the party next evening at chatou imagine going to chatou of all places like a lot of drapers after closing time upon my word these people are sublime in their smugness they cant really exist they must all have come out of one of labiches plays

   the cottards would be there possibly brichot could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures hanging on to one another like that theyd imagine they were utterly lost upon my soul they would if they didnt all meet again tomorrow at chatou alas there would be the painter there also the painter who enjoyed matchmaking who would invite forcheville to come with odette to his studio he could see odette in a dress far too smart for the country for she is so vulgar in that way and poor little thing she is such a fool

   he could hear the jokes that mme verdurin would make after dinner jokes which whoever the bore might be at whom they were aimed had always amused him because he could watch odette laughing at them laughing with him her laughter almost a part of his now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make odette laugh what a fetid form of humour he exclaimed twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar how in gods name can a creature made in his image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms the least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations it is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellowcreature who has loyally held out his hand to her she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible with the best will in the world ever to rescue her i dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities that i cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a verdurin he cried tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body god knows that i have honestly attempted to pull odette out of that sewer and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air but human patience has its limits and mine is at an end he concluded as though this sacred mission to tear odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might perchance be directed at himself and might have the effect of detaching odette from him

   he could see the pianist sitting down to play the moonlight sonata and the grimaces of mme verdurin in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by beethovens music idiot liar he shouted and a creature like that imagines that shes fond of art she would say to odette after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for forcheville as she had so often done for himself you can make room for m de forcheville there cant you odette in the dark codfish pander pander was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence to dream together to gaze in each others eyes to feel for each others hands he felt that there was much to be said after all for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts such as plato adopted and bossuet and the old school of education in france

   in a word the life which they led at the verdurins which he had so often described as genuine seemed to him now the worst possible form of life and their little nucleus the most degraded class of society it really is he repeated beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder the nethermost circle of dante beyond a doubt the august words of the florentine refer to the verdurins when one comes to think of it surely people in society and though one may find fault with them now and then still after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them what a sound intuition there is in that noli me tangere motto of the faubourg saintgermain

   he had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the bois he had almost reached his own house and still for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief or his whim of insincerity but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation the artificial sonority of his own voice he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night people in society have their failings as no one knows better than i but after all they are people to whom some things at least are impossible soandso a fashionable woman whom he had known was far from being perfect but after all one did find in her a fundamental delicacy a loyalty in her conduct which made her whatever happened incapable of a felony which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like verdurin verdurin what a name oh theres something complete about them something almost fine in their trueness to type theyre the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class thank god it was high time that i stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy such dung

   but just as the virtues which he had still attributed an hour or so earlier to the verdurins would not have sufficed even although the verdurins had actually possessed them if they had not also favoured and protected his love to excite swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity an intoxication which even when disseminated through the medium of other persons could have come to him from odette alone—so the immorality had it really existed which he now found in the verdurins would have been powerless if they had not invited odette with forcheville and without him to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their infamy doubtless swanns voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the verdurins and their circle and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it save in an artificial and rhetorical tone and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts the latter in fact while he abandoned himself to invective were probably though he did not know it occupied with a wholly different matter for once he had reached his house no sooner had he closed the frontdoor behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead and making his servant open the door again dashed out into the street shouting in a voice which this time was quite natural i believe i have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at chatou tomorrow but it must have been a bad way for m swann was not invited dr cottard who having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country had not seen the verdurins for some days and had been prevented from appearing at chatou said on the evening after this dinner as he sat down to table at their house

   why arent we going to see m swann this evening he is quite what you might call a personal friend i sincerely trust that we shant cried mme verdurin heaven preserve us from him hes too deadly for words a stupid illbred boor

   on hearing these words cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate and merely replied oh—oh—oh—oh—oh traversing in an orderly retirement of his forces into the depths of his being along a descending scale the whole compass of his voice after which there was no more talk of swann at the verdurins

                                

   and so that drawingroom which had brought swann and odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting she no longer said to him as she had said in the early days of their love we shall meet anyhow tomorrow evening theres a supperparty at the verdurins but we shant be able to meet tomorrow evening theres a supperparty at the verdurins or else the verdurins were taking her to the opéracomique to see une nuit de cléopâtre and swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go which but a little time before he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress but which now exasperated him yet im not really angry he assured himself when i see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony im disappointed not for myself but for her disappointed to find that after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for victor massé more than that to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so she ought to have the sense to say i shall not go if it were only from policy since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all and having persuaded himself that it was solely after all in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of odettes spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the opéracomique he adopted the same line of reasoning with her with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself or even with a degree more for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own selfesteem

   i swear to you he told her shortly before she was to leave for the theatre that in asking you not to go i should hope were i a selfish man for nothing so much as that you should refuse for i have a thousand other things to do this evening and i shall feel that i have been tricked and trapped myself and shall be thoroughly annoyed if after all you tell me that you are not going but my occupations my pleasures are not everything i must think of you also a day may come when seeing me irrevocably sundered from you you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which i felt that i was going to pass judgment on you one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist you see your nuit de cléopâtre what a title has no bearing on the point what i must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure for if you are such how could anyone love you for you are not even a person a definite imperfect but at least perceptible entity you are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon a fish devoid of memory incapable of thought which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself a hundred times a day against a wall of glass always mistaking it for water do you realise that your answer will have the effect—i do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you that goes without saying but of making you less attractive to my eyes when i realise that you are not a person that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher obviously i should have preferred to ask you as though it had been a matter of little or no importance to give up your nuit de cléopâtre since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name in the hope that you would go to it none the less but since i had resolved to weigh you in the balance to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer i considered it more honourable to give you due warning

   meanwhile odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her without paying any heed to the words that were uttered to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love that from the moment when they were in love it was superfluous to obey them since they would only be more in love later on and so she would have heard swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would never as she told him with a fond smile obstinate but slightly abashed get there in time for the overture

   on other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which more than anything else would make him cease to love her would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying even from the point of view of coquetry pure and simple he had told her cant you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying by a frank admission—how many faults you might redeem really you are far less intelligent than i supposed in vain however did swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity but odette had no such system she contented herself merely whenever she wished swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done with not telling him of it so that a lie was to her something to be used only as a special expedient and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which too was of a special and contingent order namely the risk of swanns discovering that she had not told him the truth

   physically she was passing through an unfortunate phase she was growing stouter and the expressive sorrowful charm the surprised wistful expressions which she had formerly had seemed to have vanished with her first youth with the result that she became most precious to swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less goodlooking he would gaze at her for hours on end trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again and yet the knowledge that within this new and strange chrysalis it was still odette that lurked still the same volatile temperament artful and evasive was enough to keep swann seeking with as much passion as ever to captivate her then he would look at photographs of her taken two years before and would remember how exquisite she had been and that would console him a little for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account

   when the verdurins took her off to saintgermain or to chatou or to meulan as often as not if the weather was fine they would propose to remain there for the night and not go home until next day mme verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist whose aunt had remained in paris she will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day how on earth could she be anxious when she knows youre with us anyhow ill take you all under my wing she can put the blame on me

   if this attempt failed m verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger after first finding out which of the faithful had anyone whom they must warn but odette would thank him and assure him that she had no message for anyone for she had told swann once and for all that she could not possibly send messages to him before all those people without compromising herself sometimes she would be absent for several days on end when the verdurins took her to see the tombs at dreux or to compiègne on the painters advice to watch the sun setting through the forest—after which they went on to the château of pierrefonds

   to think that she could visit really historic buildings with me who have spent ten years in the study of architecture who am constantly bombarded by people who really count to take them over beauvais or saintloupdenaud and refuse to take anyone but her and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest the most brutally degraded of creatures to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of louisphilippe and violletleduc one hardly needs much knowledge of art i should say to do that though surely even without any particularly refined sense of smell one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations

   but when she had set off for dreux or pierrefonds—alas without allowing him to appear there as though by accident at her side for as she said that would create a dreadful impression—he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lovers library the railway timetable from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon in the evening even in the morning the ways more than that the authority the right to join her for after all the timetable and the trains themselves were not meant for dogs if the public were carefully informed by means of printed advertisements that at eight oclock in the morning a train started for pierrefonds which arrived there at ten that could only be because going to pierrefonds was a lawful act for which permission from odette would be superfluous an act moreover which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see odette since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines

   so it came to this that she could not prevent him from going to pierrefonds if he chose to do so now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do and would at that moment be doing were he like the travelling public not acquainted with odette for a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of violletleducs work as a restorer and the weather being what it was he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of compiègne

   it was indeed a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him today today why if he went down there in defiance of her prohibition he would be able to see her that very day but then whereas if she had met at pierrefonds some one who did not matter she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure what you here and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the verdurins if on the other hand it was himself swann that she encountered there she would be annoyed would complain that she was being followed would love him less in consequence might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him so then i am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere she would reproach him on her return whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go

   he had had the sudden idea so as to contrive to visit compiègne and pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet odette of securing an invitation from one of his friends the marquis de forestelle who had a country house in that neighbourhood this friend to whom swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose was beside himself with joy he did not conceal his astonishment at swanns consenting at last after fifteen years to come down and visit his property and since he did not he told him wish to stay there promised to spend some days at least in taking him for walks and excursions in the district swann imagined himself down there already with m de forestelle even before he saw odette even if he did not succeed in seeing her there what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where not knowing the exact spot in which at any moment she was to be found he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing in the courtyard of the château now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it in all the streets of the town which struck him as romantic down every ride of the forest roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset—innumerable and alternative hidingplaces to which would fly simultaneously for refuge in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes his happy vagabond and divided heart we mustnt on any account he would warn m de forestelle run across odette and the verdurins i have just heard that they are at pierrefonds of all places today one has plenty of time to see them in paris it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldnt go a yard without meeting them and his host would fail to understand why once they had reached the place swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour inspect the diningrooms of all the hotels in compiègne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them although he had found no trace anywhere of the verdurins seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid and would in fact avoid the moment he found it for if he had come upon the little group he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference satisfied that he had seen odette and she him especially that she had seen him when he was not apparently thinking about her but no she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there and when m de forestelle came to fetch him and it was time to start he excused himself no im afraid not i cant go to pierrefonds today you see odette is there and swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he alone among mortals had not the right to go to pierrefonds that day it was because he was in fact for odette some one who differed from all other mortals her lover and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would was but one of the many forms of that slavery that love which was so dear to him decidedly it was better not to risk a quarrel with her to be patient to wait for her return he spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of compiègne as though it had been that of the pays du tendre he surrounded himself with photographs of the château of pierrefonds when the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return he opened the timetable again calculated what train she must have taken and should she have postponed her departure what trains were still left for her to take he did not leave the house for fear of missing a telegram he did not go to bed in case having come by the last train she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit yes the frontdoor bell rang there seemed some delay in opening the door he wanted to awaken the porter he leaned out of the window to shout to odette if it was odette for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home it was only a servant coming in he noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages to which he had never before paid any attention he could hear them one after another a long way off coming nearer passing his door without stopping and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him he waited all night to no purpose for the verdurins had returned unexpectedly and odette had been in paris since midday it had not occurred to her to tell him not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre had long since gone home to bed and was peacefully asleep

   as a matter of fact she had never given him a thought and such moments as these in which she forgot swanns very existence were of more value to odette did more to attach him to her than all her infidelities for in this way swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love on the night when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins and had hunted for her all evening and he did not have as i had afterwards at combray in my childhood happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night for his days swann must pass them without odette and as he told himself now and then to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street in this mood he would scowl furiously at the passersby as though they were so many pickpockets but their faces—a collective and formless mass—escaped the grasp of his imagination and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy the effort exhausted swanns brain until passing his hand over his eyes he cried out heaven help me as people after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world or that of the immortality of the soul afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith but the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of swanns daily life—when he took his meals opened his letters went for a walk or to bed—by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her like those initials of philibert the fair which in the church of brou because of her grief her longing for him margaret of austria intertwined everywhere with her own on some days instead of staying at home he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off to which he had been attracted some time before by the excellence of its cookery but to which he now went only for one of those reasons at once mystical and absurd which people call romantic because this restaurant which by the way still exists bore the same name as the street in which odette lived the lapérouse sometimes when she had been away on a short visit somewhere several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to paris and then she would say quite simply without taking as she would once have taken the precaution of covering herself at all costs with a little fragment borrowed from the truth that she had just at that very moment arrived by the morning train what she said was a falsehood at least for odette it was a falsehood inconsistent lacking what it would have had if true the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying while she said it by the contradictory picture in her mind of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train in swanns mind however these words meeting no opposition settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen odette swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour since his version did not agree with the words uttered by odette these words had never appeared to him false except when before hearing them he had suspected that they were going to be for him to believe that she was lying an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable it was also however sufficient given that everything that odette might say appeared to him suspect did she mention a name it was obviously that of one of her lovers once this supposition had taken shape he would spend weeks in tormenting himself on one occasion he even approached a firm of inquiry agents to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad and who he ultimately learned was an uncle of odette and had been dead for twenty years

   although she would not allow him as a rule to meet her at public gatherings saying that people would talk it happened occasionally that at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited—at forchevilles at the painters or at a charity ball given in one of the ministries—he found himself in the same room with her he could see her but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company pleasures which—while he drove home in utter loneliness and went to bed as anxiously as i myself was to go to bed some years later on the evenings when he came to dine with us at combray—seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end and once or twice he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated to call peaceful since it consists in a pacifying of the mind he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painters studio and was getting ready to go home he was leaving behind him odette transformed into a brilliant stranger surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety which were not for him seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere possibly at the bal des incohérents to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards which made swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union since it was more difficult to imagine he was opening the door to go when he heard himself called back in these words which by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect made odettes return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible but tender and familiar a thing that kept close to his side like a part of his own daily life in his carriage a thing that stripped odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures a disguise of which she had already wearied—in these words which odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold cant you wait a minute for me im just going well drive back together and you can drop me it was true that on one occasion forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time but when on reaching odettes gate he had begged to be allowed to come in too she had replied with a finger pointed at swann ah that depends on this gentleman you must ask him very well you may come in just for a minute if you insist but you mustnt stay long for i warn you he likes to sit and talk quietly with me and hes not at all pleased if i have visitors when hes here oh if you only knew the creature as i know him isnt that so my love theres no one that really knows you is there except me

   and swann was perhaps even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus in front of forcheville not only in these tender words of predilection but also with certain criticisms such as i feel sure you havent written yet to your friends about dining with them on sunday you neednt go if you dont want to but you might at least be polite or now have you left your essay on vermeer here so that you can do a little more to it tomorrow what a lazybones im going to make you work i can tell you which proved that odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work that they had indeed a life in common and as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his

   and then while she was making them some orangeade suddenly just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object on the wall beyond it huge and fantastic shadows which in time contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes he had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in odettes house in the lamplight was perhaps after all not an artificial hour invented for his special use with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it an hour of odettes real life of her life when he was not there looking on with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits but was perhaps a genuine hour of odettes life that if he himself had not been there she would have pulled forward the same armchair for forcheville would have poured out for him not any unknown brew but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both that the world inhabited by odette was not that other world fearful and supernatural in which he spent his time in placing her—and which existed perhaps only in his imagination but the real universe exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom comprising that table at which he might sit down presently and write and this drink which he was being permitted now to taste all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude for if in absorbing his dreams they had delivered him from an obsession they themselves were in turn enriched by the absorption they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies and they interested his mind they took shape and grew solid beforehis eyes and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart ah had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with odette so that in her house he should be in his own if when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon it had been odettes bill of fare that he had learned from the reply if when odette wished to go for a walk in the morning along the avenue du boisdeboulogne his duty as a good husband had obliged him though he had no desire to go out to accompany her carrying her cloak when she was too warm and in the evening after dinner if she wished to stay at home and not to dress if he had been forced to stay beside her to do what she asked then how completely would all the trivial details of swanns life which seemed to him now so gloomy simply because they would at the same time have formed part of the life of odette have taken on—like that lamp that orangeade that armchair which had absorbed so much of his dreams which materialised so much of his longing—a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity

   and yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm a peace which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love when odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent regretted imagined when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata but constant affection and gratitude when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness then no doubt the actions of odettes daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest—as he had several times already felt that they might be on the day for instance when he had read through its envelope her letter to forcheville examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects he told himself that when he was cured of it what odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him but in his morbid state to tell the truth he feared death itself no more than such a recovery which would in fact amount to the death of all that he then was

   after these quiet evenings swanns suspicions would be temporarily lulled he would bless the name of odette and next day in the morning would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude or the desire to see them repeated or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet

   but at other times grief would again take hold of him he would imagine that odette was forchevilles mistress and that when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the verdurins landau in the bois on the evening before the party at chatou to which he had not been invited while he implored her in vain with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed to come home with him and then turned away solitary crushed—she must have employed to draw forchevilles attention to him while she murmured do look at him storming the same glance brilliant malicious sidelong cunning as on the evening when forcheville had driven saniette from the verdurins

   at such times swann detested her but ive been a fool too he would argue im paying for other mens pleasures with my money all the same shed better take care and not pull the string too often for i might very well stop giving her anything at all at any rate wed better knock off supplementary favours for the time being to think that only yesterday when she said she would like to go to bayreuth for the season i was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the king of bavaria has there for the two of us however she didnt seem particularly keen she hasnt said yes or no yet lets hope that shell refuse good god think of listening to wagner for a fortnight on end with her who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples it will be fun and his hatred like his love needing to manifest itself in action he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further because thanks to the perfidies with which he charged odette he detested her still more and would be able if it turned out—as he tried to convince himself—that she was indeed guilty of them to take the opportunity of punishing her emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath in this way he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her in which she would ask him for money to take the house at bayreuth but with the warning that he was not to come there himself as she had promised forcheville and the verdurins to invite them oh how he would have loved it had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity what joy he would have in refusing in drawing up that vindictive reply the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud as though he had actually received her letter

   the very next day her letter came she wrote that the verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of wagner and that if he would be so good as to send her the money she would be able at last after going so often to their house to have the pleasure of entertaining the verdurins in hers of him she said not a word it was to be taken for granted that their presence at bayreuth would be a bar to his

   then that annihilating answer every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight without venturing to hope that it could ever be used he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her alas he felt only too certain that with the money which she had or could easily procure she would be able all the same to take a house at bayreuth since she wished to do so she who was incapable of distinguishing between bach and clapisson let her take it then she would have to live in it more frugally that was all no means as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousandfranc notes of organising each evening in her hired castle those exquisite little suppers after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim which it was possible had never yet seized her of falling into the arms of forcheville at any rate this loathsome expedition it would not be swann who had to pay for it ah if he could only manage to prevent it if she could sprain her ankle before starting if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent no matter how great the bribe to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion that perfidious woman her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for forcheville which was what odette had become for swann in the last fortyeight hours

   but she was never that for very long after a few days the shining crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity that picture of an execrable odette saying to forcheville look at him storming began to grow pale and to dissolve then gradually reappeared and rose before him softly radiant the face of the other odette of that odette who alo turned with a smile to forcheville but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for swann when she said you mustnt stay long for this gentleman doesnt much like my having visitors when hes here oh if you only knew the creature as i know him that same smile with which she used to thank swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life when she could turn to him alone

   then to this other odette he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter of which probably until then she had never supposed him capable a letter which must have lowered him from the high from the supreme place which by his generosity by his loyalty he had won for himself in her esteem he would become less dear to her since it was for those qualities which she found neither in forcheville nor in any other that she loved him it was for them that odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities

   now that after this swing of the pendulum odette had naturally returned to the place from which swanns jealousy had for the moment driven her in the angle in which he found her charming he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness with a look of consent in her eyes and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching kindly glance as strong as though she had really looked thus at him and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire

   what distress he must have caused her certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment if he had not so passionately loved her had he not nourished grievances just as serious against other women to whom he would none the less render willing service today feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them if the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to odette he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious unpardonable in this desire after all so natural a desire springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature to be able in her turn when an occasion offered to repay the verdurins for their hospitality and to play the hostess in a house of her own

   he returned to the other point of view—opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity and in order to make allowance for different eventualities—from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of odette based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her that she was to him just a woman like other women that her life had not been whenever he himself was not present different a texture woven in secret apart from him and warped against him

   wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements at bayreuth as in paris if it should happen that forcheville thought of him at all it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of odette some one for whom he was obliged to make way when they met in her house if forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there whereas if he had approved of her plan which for that matter was quite defensible she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel she would have felt herself sent there housed there by him and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness

   and if—instead of letting her go off thus at crosspurposes with him without having seen him again—he were to send her this money if he were to encourage her to take this journey and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her she would come running to him happy grateful and he would have the joy—the sight of her face—which he had not known for nearly a week a joy which none other could replace for the moment that swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love that love once again became more than anything a taste for the sensations which odettes person gave him for the pleasure which he found in admiring as one might a spectacle or in questioning as one might a phenomenon the birth of one of her glances the formation of one of her smiles the utterance of an intonation of her voice and this pleasure different from every other had in the end created in him a need of her which she alone by her presence or by her letters could assuage almost as disinterested almost as artistic as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in swanns life when the sereness the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance without his knowing to what he owed this unlookedfor enrichment of his life any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger puts on flesh and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery—this other need which too developed in him independently of the visible material world was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it

   and so by the chemical process of his malady after he had created jealousy out of his love he began again to generate tenderness pity for odette she had become once more the old odette charming and kind he was full of remorse for having treated her harshly he wished her to come to him and before she came he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile

   so too odette certain of seeing him come to her in a few days as tender and submissive as before and plead with her for a reconciliation became inured was no longer afraid of displeasing him or even of making him angry and refused him whenever it suited her the favours by which he set most store

   perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel when he had told her that he would not send her any money but would do what he could to hurt her perhaps she did not realise either how sincere he still was if not with her at any rate with himself on other occasions when for the sake of their future relations to shew odette that he was capable of doing without her that a rupture was still possible between them he decided to wait some time before going to see her again

   sometimes several days had elapsed during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety and as from the next few visits which he would pay her he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure but more probably some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself he wrote to her that he was very busy and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested meanwhile a letter from her crossing his asked him to postpone one of those very meetings he asked himself why his suspicions his grief again took hold of him he could no longer abide in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm he would run to find her and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days and even if she had not written first if she merely acknowledged his letter it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her for upsetting all swanns calculations odettes acceptance had entirely changed his attitude like everyone who possesses something precious so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it he had detached the precious object from his mind leaving as he thought everything else in the same state as when it was there but the absence of one part from a whole is not only that it is not simply a partial omission it is a disturbance of all the other parts a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old

   but at other times—when odette was on the point of going away for a holiday—it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return giving the appearance and expecting the reward of a serious rupture which she would perhaps regard as final to a separation the greater part of which was inevitable since she was going away which in fact he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must at once he could imagine odette puzzled anxious distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her by calming his jealousy made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her at odd moments no doubt in the furthest recesses of his brain where his determination had thrust it away and thanks to the length of the interval the three weeks separation to which he had agreed it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see odette again on her return but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence it had lasted so far but three days a much shorter time than he had often before passed without seeing odette and without having as on this occasion he had premeditated a separation and yet there and then some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind or of weakness in his body—by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment one not to be governed by the rules one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose a holiday—suspended the action of his will which ceased to exert its inhibitive control or without that even the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask odette such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted or with regard to some investment whether they were ordinary or preference shares that she wished him to buy for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her but if after that the carriage had to be painted over again if the shares produced no dividend a fine lot of good he would have done—and suddenly like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open the idea of seeing her again from the remote point in time to which it had been attached sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities

   it sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance so irresistible in fact that swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching day by day of the fortnight which he must spend apart from odette than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy in which he recaptured a thousand times over to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection that idea of his meeting with odette which by so abrupt a repercussion at a moment when he supposed it so remote was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness the fact was that this idea no longer found as an obstacle in its course the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming which had ceased to have any place in swanns mind since having proved to himself—or so at least he believed—that he was so easily capable of resisting it he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would furthermore this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty a seductiveness armed with a virulence all of which long habit had enfeebled but which had acquired new vigour during this privation not of three days but of a fortnight for a period of abstinence may be calculated by anticipation as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it and had converted what had been until then a pleasure in store which could easily be sacrificed into an unlookedfor happiness which he was powerless to resist finally the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what odette might have thought might perhaps have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an odette almost unknown

   but she just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came now to ask her about the repainting of her carriage or the purchase of stock for she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism looking only to what she knew beforehand their necessary neverfailing and always identical termination an imperfect idea though possibly all the more profound in consequence if one were to judge it from the point of view of swann who would doubtless have considered that odette failed to understand him just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive each persuaded that he has been thrown back one by some outside event at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies mere disguises according to him assumed so as to be perceptible by his patients by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health and as a matter of fact swanns love had reached that stage at which the physician and in the case of certain affections the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable or indeed possible

   certainly of the extent of this love swann had no direct knowledge when he sought to measure it it happened sometimes that he found it diminished shrunken almost to nothing for instance the very moderate liking amounting almost to dislike which in the days before he was in love with odette he had felt for her expressive features her faded complexion returned on certain days really i am making distinct headway he would tell himself on the morrow when i come to think it over carefully i find out that i got hardly any pleasure last night out of being in bed with her its an odd thing but i actually thought her ugly and certainly he was sincere but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire odettes person indeed no longer held any great place in it when his eyes fell upon the photograph of odette on his table or when she came to see him he had difficulty in identifying her face either in the flesh or on the pasteboard with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind he would say to himself almost with astonishment it is she as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached externalised form one of our own maladies and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering she—he tried to ask himself what that meant for it is something like love like death rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies a thing which one repeatedly calls in question in order to make oneself probe further into it in the fear that the question will find no answer that the substance will escape our grasp—the mystery of personality and this malady which was swanns love had so far multiplied was so closely interwoven with all his habits with all his actions with his thoughts his health his sleep his life even with what he hoped for after his death was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him as surgeons say his case was past operation

   by this love swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion reminding himself that his social relations like a beautifully wrought setting although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth might still add a little to his own value in odettes eyes as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself which for odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself he would feel there simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class just as at home he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants liveries the soundness of his investments with the same relish as when he read in saintsimon who was one of his favourite authors of the machinery of daily life at versailles what mme de maintenon ate and drank or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of lulli and in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute the reason for this new pleasure which swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain in this respect the personality with which my greataunt endowed him of young swann as distinct from the more individual personality of charles swann was that in which he now most delighted once when because it was the birthday of the princesse de parme and because she could often be of use indirectly to odette by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing he had decided to send her a basket of fruit and was not quite sure where or how to order it he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who delighted to be doing a commission for him had written to him laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place but the grapes from crapote whose speciality they were the straw berries from jauret the pears from chevet who always had the best am soon every fruit visited and examined one by one by myself and ii the sequel by the cordiality with which the princess thanked him hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears but most of all that every fruit visited and examinee one by one by myself had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited although it was his by right as the heir of a rich and respectable middleclass family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the right places and the art of ordering things from shops

   of a truth he had too long forgotten that he was young swann not to feel when he assumed that part again for a moment a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times—when indeed he was grown sick of pleasure and if the friendliness of the middleclass people for whom he had never been anything else than young swann was less animated than that of the aristocrats though more flattering for all that since in the middleclass mind friendship is inseparable from respect no letter from a royal personage offering him some princely entertainment could ever be so attractive to swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents some of whom had kept up with him like my grandfather who the year before these events had invited him to my mothers wedding while others barely knew him by sight but were they thought in duty bound to shew civility to the son to the worthy successor of the late m swann

   but by virtue of his intimacy already timehonoured with so many of them the people of fashion in a certain sense were also a part of his house his service and his family he felt when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections the same external support the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate the fine silver the fine tablelinen which had come down to him from his forebears and the thought that if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the duc de chartres the prince de reuss the duc de luxembourg and the baron de charlus brought him the same consolation as our old françoise derived from the knowledge that she would one day be buried in her own fine clothes marked with her name not darned at all or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced ones idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress a shroud from the constant image of which in her minds eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense if not actually of wealth and prosperity at any rate of selfesteem but most of all—since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to odette swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was perhaps not less dear but at least less welcome to her than anyone even the most wearisome of the verdurins faithful—when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste a man whom no pains were spared to attract whom people were genuinely sorry not to see he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life almost to feel an appetite for it as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round sicily

   if he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to odette he still paid them asking himself at the end of each month whether seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience and had certainly gone rather often to see her it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs and for each visit he found a pretext a present that he had to bring her some information which she required m de charlus whom he had met actually going to her house and who had insisted upon swanns accompanying him and failing any excuse he would beg m de charlus to go to her at once and to tell her as though spontaneously in the course of conversation that he had just remembered something that he had to say to swann and would she please send a message to swanns house asking him to come to her then and there but as a rule swann waited at home in vain and m de charlus informed him later in the evening that his device had not proved successful with the result that if she was now frequently away from paris even when she was there he scarcely saw her that she who when she was in love with him used to say i am always free and what can it matter to me what other people think now whenever he wanted to see her appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement when he spoke of going to a charity entertainment or a private view or a firstnight at which she was to be present she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public that he was treating her like a woman off the streets things came to such a pitch that in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere swann remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my greatuncle adolphe whose friend he himself also had been went one day to see him in his little flat in the rue de bellechasse to ask him to use his influence with odette as it happened she invariably adopted when she spoke to swann about my uncle a poetical tone saying ah he he is not in the least like you it is an exquisite thing a great a beautiful thing his friendship for me hes not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public this was embarrassing for swann who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of odette to my uncle he began by alluding to her excellence a priori the axiom of her seraphic superhumanity the revelation of her inexpressible virtues no conception of which could possibly be formed i should like to speak to you about her he went on you who know what a woman supreme above all women what an adorable being what an angel odette is but you know also what life is in paris everyone doesnt see odette in the light in which you and i have been privileged to see her and so there are people who think that i am behaving rather foolishly she wont even allow me to meet her out of doors at the theatre now you in whom she has such enormous confidence couldnt you say a few words for me to her just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her

   my uncle advised swann not to see odette for some days after which she would love him all the more he advised odette to let swann meet her everywhere and as often as he pleased a few days later odette told swann that she had just had a rude awakening she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men he had tried to take her by assault she calmed swann who at first was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again he regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped if he had met my uncle adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that odette had led in the old days at nice for my uncle adolphe used to spend the winter there and swann thought that it might indeed have been there perhaps that he had first known odette the few words which some one had let fall in his hearing about a man who it appeared had been odettes lover had left swann dumbfounded but the very things which he would before knowing them have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe were once he knew them incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow he admitted them he could no longer have understood their not existing only each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress at one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral lightness of which he would never have suspected odette was perfectly well known and that at baden or nice when she had gone in the past to spend several months in one or the other place she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety he attempted in order to question them to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp but these were aware that he knew odette and besides he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads of setting them once more upon her track but he to whom up till then nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of baden or of nice now that he learned that odette had perhaps led a gay life once in those pleasurecities although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which thanks to himself she no longer felt or from some capricious instinct which might at any moment revive in her he would lean in impotent anguish blinded and dizzy over the bottomless abyss into which had passed in which had been engulfed those years of his own early in macmahons septennat in which one spent the winter on the promenade des anglais the summer beneath the limes of baden and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity such as a poet might have lent to them and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the côte dazur in those days if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of odette more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenthcentury florence so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the primavera the fair vanna or the venus of botticelli he would sit often without saying a word to her only gazing at her and dreaming and she would comment you do look sad it was not very long since from the idea that she was an excellent creature comparable to the best women that he had known he had passed to that of her being kept and yet already by an inverse process he had returned from the odette de crécy perhaps too well known to the holidaymakers to the ladies men of nice and baden to this face the expression on which was so often gentle to this nature so eminently human he would ask himself what does it mean after all to say that everyone at nice knows who odette de crécy is reputations of that sort even when theyre true are always based upon other peoples ideas he would reflect that this legend—even if it were authentic—was something external to odette was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her there she was often tired her face left blank for the nonce by that eager feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made swann suffer she would push back her hair with both hands her forehead her whole face would seem to grow larger then suddenly some ordinary human thought some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when in a moment of rest or meditation they are free to express themselves would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold and immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape swathed in clouds which suddenly are swept away and the dull scene transfigured at the moment of the suns setting the life which occupied odette at such times even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding swann could have shared with her no evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them rare as they became those moments did not occur in vain by the process of memory swann joined the fragments together abolished the intervals between them cast as in molten gold the image of an odette compact of kindness and tranquillity for whom he was to make later on as we shall see in the second part of this story sacrifices which the other odette would never have won from him but how rare those moments were and how seldom he now saw her even in regard to their evening meetings she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him for reckoning on his being always free she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her she would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance and if even after she had made swann come to her house any of her friends asked her halfway through the evening to join them at some theatre or at supper afterwards she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed as her toilet progressed every movement that she made brought swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her when she would fly off with irresistible force and when at length she was ready and plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well smeared a little salve on her lips fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow and called for her cloak of skyblue silk with golden tassels swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him so that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute and i thought i was being so nice to you well i shall know better another time sometime at the risk of annoying her he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with forcheville who might perhaps have been able to tell him but anyhow when he knew with whom she was spending the evening it was very seldom that he could not discover among all his innumerable acquaintance some one who knew—if only indirectly—the man with whom she had gone out and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him and while he was writing to one of his friends asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation it is true that swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive to know a thing does not enable us always to prevent its happening but after all the things that we know we do hold if not in our hands at any rate in our minds where we can dispose of them as we choose which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them he was quite happy whenever m de charlus was with odette he knew that between m de charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen that when m de charlus went anywhere with her it was out of friendship for himself and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done sometimes she had declared so emphatically to swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing that swann attached a very real importance to the fact that m de charlus was free to accompany her next day without daring to put many questions to m de charlus he would force him by appearing not quite to understand his first answers to give him more after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved for he very soon learned that odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations

   but what do you mean my dear mémé i dont quite understand you didnt go straight from her house to the musée grévin surely you went somewhere else first no that is very odd you dont know how amusing you are my dear mémé but what an odd idea of hers to go on to the chat noir afterwards it was her idea i suppose no yours thats strange after all it wasnt a bad idea she must have known dozens of people there no she never spoke to a soul how extraordinary then you sat there like that just you and she all by yourselves i can picture you sitting there you are a worthy fellow my dear mémé im exceedingly fond of you

   swann was now quite at ease to him who had so often happened when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love friends to whom he hardly listened to hear certain detached sentences as for instance i saw mme de crécy yesterday she was with a man i didnt know sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state grew hard as stalagmites and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable—how charming by way of contrast were the words she didnt know a soul she never spoke to a soul how freely they coursed through him how fluid they were how vaporous how easy to breathe and yet a moment later he was telling himself that odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company and their very insignificance though it reassured him pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery

   even when he could not discover where she had gone it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt for which odettes presence the charm of her company was the sole specific a specific which in the long run served like many other remedies to aggravate the disease but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings it would have sufficed had odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out to wait there until that hour of her return into whose stillness and peace would flow to be mingled and lost there all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery some cursed spell had made him imagine as somehow different from the rest but she would not he must return home he forced himself on the way to form various plans ceased to think of odette he even reached the stage while he undressed of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind it was with a light heart buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow that he jumped into bed and turned out the light but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep relaxing a selfcontrol of which he was not even conscious so habitual had it become than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs he did not wish to know why but dried his eyes saying with a smile this is delightful im becoming neurasthenic after which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that next day he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what odette had been doing must use all his influence to contrive to see her this compulsion to an activity without respite without variety without result was so cruel a scourge that one day noticing a swelling over his stomach he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had perhaps a tumour which would prove fatal that he need not concern himself with anything further that it was his malady which was going to govern his life to make a plaything of him until the notdistant end if indeed at this period it often happened that though without admitting it even to himself he longed for death it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle

   and yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her when she would have no reason for lying to him when at length he might learn from her whether on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon she had or had not been in the arms of forcheville often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of forcheville making it almost immaterial to him like those new developments of a continuous state of illhealth which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors there were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion he fancied that he was cured but next morning when he awoke he felt in the same place the same pain a sensation which the day before he had as it were diluted in the torrent of different impressions but it had not stirred from its place indeed it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him

   since odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them his brain would become a void then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass and would cease altogether to think there emerged however from this unexplored tract certain occupations which reappeared from time to time vaguely connected by odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him seemed to swann to compose the necessary unalterable setting of her life because of the tone in which she referred from time to time to the day when i go with my friend to the hippodrome if when he felt unwell and had thought perhaps odette would be kind and come to see me he remembered suddenly that it was one of those very days he would correct himself with an oh no its not worth while asking her to come i should have thought of it before this is the day when she goes with her friend to the hippodrome we must confine ourselves to what is possible no use wasting our time in proposing things that cant be accepted and are declined in advance and this duty that was incumbent upon odette of going to the hippodrome to which swann thus gave way seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it if when odette in the street had acknowledged the salute of a passerby which had aroused swanns jealousy she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him if for instance she said thats a gentleman who was in my friends box the other day the one i go to the hippodrome with that explanation would set swanns suspicions at rest it was after all inevitable that this friend should have other guests than odette in her box at the hippodrome but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them oh how he would have loved to know her that friend who went to the hippodrome how he would have loved her to invite him there with odette how readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing odette were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop he would have taken more trouble incurred more expense for them than for queens would they not have supplied him out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of odette with the one potent anodyne for his pain with what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom odette kept up friendly relations either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature how willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house where odette went but never took him and where if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker whose lover he would readily have pretended to be he would have been visited by odette almost daily in those regions that were almost slums what a modest existence abject if you please but delightful nourished by tranquillity and happiness he would have consented to lead indefinitely

   it sometimes happened again that when after meeting swann she saw some man approaching whom he did not know he could distinguish upon odettes face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while forcheville was there but this was rare for on the days when in spite of all that she had to do and of her dread of what people would think she did actually manage to see swann the predominant quality in her attitude now was selfassurance a striking contrast perhaps an unconscious revenge for perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which in the early days of their friendship she had felt in his presence and even in his absence when she began a letter to him with the words my dear my hand trembles so that i can scarcely write so at least she pretended and a little of that emotion must have been sincere or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it so swann had been pleasing to her then our hands do not tremble except for ourselves or for those whom we love when they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful how easy how bold do we become in their presence in speaking to him in writing to him now she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her creating opportunities for saying my and mine when she referred to him you are all that i have in the world it is the perfume of our friendship i shall keep it nor spoke to him of the future of death itself as of a single adventure which they would have to share in those early days whatever he might say to her she would answer admiringly you know you will never be like other people—she would gaze at his long slightly bald head of which people who know only of his successes used to think hes not regularly goodlooking if you like but he is smart that tuft that eyeglass that smile and with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress she would sigh

   i do wish i could find out what there is in that head of yours

   but now whatever he might say she would answer in a tone sometimes of irritation sometimes indulgent ah so you never will be like other people

   she would gaze at his head which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties though people now thought of it by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme or the likenesses in a child whose family one has known hes not positively ugly if you like but he is really rather absurd that eyeglass that tuft that smile realising in their imagination fed by suggestion the invisible boundary which divides at a few months interval the head of an ardent lover from a cuckolds and would say

   oh i do wish i could change you put some sense into that head of yours

   always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped if it was only odettes way of behaving to him that left room for doubt he would fling himself greedily upon her words you can if you like he would tell her

   and he tried to explain to her that to comfort him to control him to make him work would be a noble task to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves though it is only fair to add that in those other womens hands the noble task would have seemed to swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action if she didnt love me just a little he told himself she would not wish to have me altered to alter me she will have to see me more often and so he was able to trace in these faults which she found in him a proof at least of her interest perhaps even of her love and in fact she gave him so little now of the last that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which every now and then she forbade him to do one day she announced that she did not care for his coachman who she thought was perhaps setting swann against her and anyhow did not shew that promptness and deference to swanns orders which she would have liked to see she felt that he wanted to hear her say dont have him again when you come to me just as he might have wanted her to kiss him so being in a good temper she said it and he was deeply moved that evening when talking to m de charlus with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now even to people who had never heard of her had always some sort of reference to odette he said to him

   i believe all the same that she loves me she is so nice to me now and she certainly takes an interest in what i do

   and if when he was starting off for her house getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way his friend said hullo that isnt loredan on the box with what melancholy joy would swann answer him

   oh good heavens no i can tell you i darent take loredan when i go to the rue la pérouse odette doesnt like me to have loredan she thinks he doesnt suit me what on earth is one to do women you know women my dear fellow she would be furious oh lord yes ive only to take rémi there i should never hear the last of it

   these new manners indifferent listless irritable which odette now adopted with swann undoubtedly made him suffer but he did not realise how much he suffered since it had been with a regular progression day after day that odette had chilled towards him it was only by directly contrasting what she was today with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place now this change was his deep his secret wound which pained him day and night and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly he might say to himself in a vague way there was a time when odette loved me more but he never formed any definite picture of that time just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage and the letters in which she said why did you not forget your heart also i should never have let you have that back and at whatever hour of the day or night you may need me just send me a word and dispose of me as you please so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near forcing them if need be to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it the place in which lingered his memories of happy days

   but his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party

   it was at the marquise de sainteuvertes on the last for that season of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve later on for her charity concerts swann who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn but had never been able to make up his mind received while he was dressing for this party a visit from the baron de charlus who came with an offer to go with him to the marquises if his company could be of any use in helping swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there to be a little less unhappy but swann had thanked him with

   you cant conceive how glad i should be of your company but the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see odette you know what a splendid influence you have over her i dont suppose shell be going anywhere this evening unless she goes to see her old dressmaker and im sure she would be delighted if you went with her there in any case youll find her at home before then try to keep her amused and also to give her a little sound advice if you could arrange something for tomorrow which would please her something that we could all three do together try to put out a feeler too for the summer see if theres anything she wants to do a cruise that we might all three take anything you can think of i dont count upon seeing her tonight myself still if she would like me to come or if you find a loophole youve only to send me a line at mme de sainteuvertes up till midnight after that i shall be here ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me—you know what i feel about you

   his friend promised to go and do as swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the sainteuverte house where he arrived soothed by the thought that m de charlus would be spending the evening in the rue la pérouse but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve odette and in particular to the details of fashionable life a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which being no longer an object of our desire appears to us in its own guise on alighting from his carriage in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of balzacs tigers—now grooms— who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad but now hatted and booted were posted out of doors in front of the house on the gravelled drive or outside the stables as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flowerbeds the peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here but in a more positive and more general form it was society as a whole now that he was detached from it which presented itself to him in a series of pictures in the cloakroom into which in the old days when he was still a man of fashion he would have gone in his overcoat to emerge from it in evening dress but without any impression of what had occurred there his mind having been during the minute or two that he had spent in it either still at the party which he had just left or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered he now noticed for the first time roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests until pointing their noble greyhound profiles they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him

   one of them of a particularly ferocious aspect and not unlike the headsman in certain renaissance pictures which represent executions tortures and the like advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his things but the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves so effectively that as he approached swann he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat he took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost overfastidious and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength then he passed it to one of his satellites a novice and timid who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity

   a few feet away a strapping great lad in livery stood musing motionless statuesque useless like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of mantegnas paintings lost in dreams leaning upon his shield while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about swann he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene which he followed vaguely with his cruel greenish eyes as if it had been the massacre of the innocents or the martyrdom of saint james he seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race—if indeed it ever existed save in the reredos of san zeno and the frescoes of the eremitani where swann had come in contact with it and where it still dreams—fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the masters paduan models or of albert duerers saxons and the locks of his reddish hair crinkled by nature but glued to his head by brilliantine were treated broadly as they are in that greek sculpture which the mantuan painter never ceased to study and which if in its creators purpose it represents but man manages at least to extract from mans simple outlines such a variety of richness borrowed as it were from the whole of animated nature that a head of hair by the glossy undulation and beaklike points of its curls or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed a brood of fledgling doves a bed of hyacinths and a serpents writhing back others again no less colossal were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility was made worthy to be named like that godcrowned ascent in the palace of the doges the staircase of the giants and on which swann now set foot saddened by the thought that odette had never climbed it ah with what joy would he on the other hand have raced up the dark evilsmelling breakneck flights to the little dressmakers in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stagebox at the opera for the right to spend the evening there when odette came and other days too for the privilege of talking about her of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there and who on that account seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew whereas upon that pestilential enviable staircase to the old dressmakers since there was no other no service stair in the building one saw in the evening outside every door an empty unwashed milkcan set out in readiness for the morning round upon the doormat on the despicable enormous staircase which swann was at that moment climbing on either side of him at different levels before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porters lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled and doing homage for them to the guests a gatekeeper a majordomo a steward worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semiindependence in their own domains dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers and might tomorrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease stood each in the arcade of his doorway their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic goodfellowship like saints in their niches and a gigantic usher dressed swiss guard fashion like the beadle in a church struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him coming to the top of the staircase up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head like one of goyas sacristans or a tabellion in an old play swann passed by an office in which the lackeys seated like notaries before their massive registers rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name he next crossed a little hall which—just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art from which they take their name and in their studied bareness contain nothing else besides—displayed to him as he entered it like some priceless effigy by benvenuto cellini of an armed watchman a young footman his body slightly bent forward rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire timidity and zeal who as he pierced the aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous vigilant desperate gaze appeared with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith—an allegory of alarums incarnation of alertness commemoration of a riot—to be looking out angel or sentinel from the tower of dungeon or cathedral for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of judgment swann had now only to enter the concertroom the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city but he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been if odette had but permitted and the remembered glimpse of an empty milkcan upon a doormat wrung his heart

   he speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when on the other side of the tapestry curtain the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests but even this ugliness of faces which of course were mostly familiar to him seemed something new and uncanny now that their features—instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after boredoms to be avoided or courtesies to be acknowledged—were at rest measurable by aesthetic coordinates alone in the autonomy of their curves and angles and in these men in the thick of whom swann now found himself packed there was nothing even to the monocle which many of them wore and which previously would at the most have enabled swann to say that soandso wore a monocle which no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit the same in all of them did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each perhaps because he did not regard general de froberville and the marquis de bréaute who were talking together just inside the door as anything more than two figures in a picture whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the jockey club and had supported him in duels the generals monocle stuck like a shellsplinter in his common scarred victorious overbearing face in the middle of a forehead which it left halfblinded like the singleeyed flashing front of the cyclops appeared to swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose while that which m de bréaute wore as a festive badge with his pearlgrey gloves his crush hat and white tie substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses as swann himself did when he went out to places bore glued to its other side like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings the delightfulness of parties the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments

   hallo you here why its ages since ive seen you the general greeted swann and noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away went on youre looking well old man while m de bréauté turned with my dear fellow what on earth are you doing here to a society novelist who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character and who now replied with an air of mystery and importance rolling the r—i am observing

   the marquis de forestelles monocle was minute and rimless and by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable it gave to his face a melancholy refinement and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love but that of m de saintcandé girdled like saturn with an enormous ring was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss and then behind him m de palancy who with his huge carps head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to swann a fervent admirer of giottos vices and virtues at padua that injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair

   swann had gone forward into the room under pressure from mme de sainteuverte and in order to listen to an aria from orfeo which was being rendered on the flute and had taken up a position in a corner from which unfortunately his horizon was bounded by two ladies of uncertain age seated side by side the marquise de cambremer and the vicomtesse de franquetot who because they were cousins used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter hunting for one another like people at a railway station and could never be at rest until they had reserved by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs two adjacent chairs mme de cambremer since she knew scarcely anyone being all the more glad of a companion while mme de franquetot who on the contrary was extremely popular thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common filled with ironical melancholy swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo liszts saint francis preaching to the birds which came after the flute and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight mme de franquetot anxiously her eyes starting from her head as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes from any one of which he might come crashing a hundred feet to the ground stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion as who should say it isnt possible i would never have believed that a human being could do all that mme de cambremer as a woman who had received a sound musical education beating time with her head—transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain nor anxious to master it and says merely i cant help it so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion on the other side and a little way in front of mme de franquetot was the marquise de gallardon absorbed in her favourite meditation namely upon her own kinship with the guermantes family from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman or because she was a scandalous old woman or because she came of an inferior branch of the family or very possibly for no reason at all when she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know as she was at this moment next to mme de franquetot she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which in the mosaics in byzantine churches placed one beneath another inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some sacred personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering at this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation or even call from her young cousin the princesse des laumes during the six years that had already elapsed since the latters marriage the thought filled her with anger—and with pride for by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at mme des laumess that it was because of the risk of meeting the princesse mathilde there—a degradation which her own family the truest and bluest of legitimists would never have forgiven her she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin she remembered it is true that she had several times inquired of mme des laumes how they might contrive to meet but she remembered it only in a confused way and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring after all it isnt for me to take the first step i am at least twenty years older than she is and fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust while her head which lay almost horizontally upon them made one think of the stuckon head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance since she was obliged in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the guermantes to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body and had given her a sort of bearing which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding and even kindled at times a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs had anyone subjected mme de gallardons conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message he would at once have remarked that no expression not even the commonest forms of speech occurred in it nearly so often as at my cousins the guermantess at my aunt guermantess elzéar de guermantess health my cousin guermantess box if anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage she would reply that although she was not personally acquainted with him she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt guermantess but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone with such a hollow sound that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us extend so as to develop the expansion of our chests

   at this moment the princesse des laumes who had not been expected to appear at mme de sainteuvertes that evening did in fact arrive to shew that she did not wish any special attention in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension to be paid to her superior rank she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through no one attempting to get past her staying purposely at the back with the air of being in her proper place like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming and strictly limiting her field of vision—so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due—to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest and from which as she very well knew a cry of rapture from mme de sainteuverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed next to mme de cambremer whom however she did not know she observed the dumbshow by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music but she refrained from copying it this was not to say that for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in mme de sainteuvertes house the princesse des laumes would not have wished so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might so to speak count double to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible but she had a natural horror of what she called exaggerating and always made a point of letting people see that she simply must not indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her by virtue of that spirit of imitation akin to timidity which is developed in the most selfconfident persons by contact with an unfamiliar environment even though it be inferior to their own she began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not perhaps be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played a piece which it might be was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house with the result that in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulderstraps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel frosted with tiny diamonds which formed its simple but effective ornament studying with a cold interest her impassioned neighbour while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan but so as not to forfeit her independence she would beat a different time from the pianists when he had finished the liszt intermezzo and had begun a prelude by chopin mme de cambremer turned to mme de franquetot with a tender smile full of intimate reminiscence as well as of satisfaction that of a competent judge with the performance she had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those longnecked sinuous creatures the phrases of chopin so free so flexible so tactile which begin by seeking their ultimate restingplace somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started the point which one might have expected them to reach phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately—with a more premeditated reaction with more precision as on a crystal bowl which if you strike it will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish—to clutch at ones heart

   brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors hardly ever invited to a ball she had fuddled her mind in the solitude of her old manorhouse over setting the pace now crawlingslow now passionate whirling breathless for all those imaginary waltzing couples gathering them like flowers leaving the ballroom for a moment to listen where the wind sighed among the pinetrees on the shore of the lake and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are a slender young man whose voice was resonant and strange and false in white gloves but nowadays the oldfashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale having forfeited some years back the esteem of really musical people it had lost its distinction and its charm and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess mme de cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her she knew that her young daughterinlaw full of respect for her new and noble family except in such matters as related to the intellect upon which having got as far as harmony and the greek alphabet she was specially enlightened despised chopin and fell quite ill when she heard him played but finding herself free from the scrutiny of this wagnerian who was sitting at some distance in a group of her own contemporaries mme de cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations the princesse des laumes was touched also though without any natural gift for music she had received some fifteen years earlier the instruction which a musicmistress of the faubourg saintgermain a woman of genius who had been towards the end of her life reduced to penury had started at seventy to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils this lady was now dead but her method an echo of her charming touch came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre had given up music and hardly ever opened a piano and so mme des laumes could let her head sway to and fro fully aware of the cause with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this prelude since she knew it by heart the closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips and she murmured how charming it is with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed like the petals of a beautiful budding flower that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze meanwhile mme de gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the princesse des laumes for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow she did not know that her cousin was in the room a movement of mme franquetots head disclosed the princess at once mme de gallardon dashed towards her upsetting all her neighbours although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself any day cheek by jowl with the princesse mathilde and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not of her generation she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some noncommittal remark which would justify her overture and would force the princess to engage in conversation and so when she reached her cousin mme de gallardon with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to force a card began with how is your husband in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the prince had been seriously ill the princess breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes answered why hes never been better in his life and she went on laughing

   mme de gallardon then drew herself up and chilling her expression still further perhaps because she was still uneasy about the princes health said to her cousin

   oriane at once mme des laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised mme de gallardon to use her christian name i should be so pleased if you would look in just for a minute tomorrow evening to hear a quintet with the clarinet by mozart i should like to have your opinion of it

   she seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour and to want the princesss opinion of the mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge

   but i know that quintet quite well i can tell you now—that i adore it

   you know my husband isnt at all well its his liver he would like so much to see you mme de gallardon resumed making it now a corporal work of charity for the princess to appear at her party

   the princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away—by the sudden arrival of her husbands mother by an invitation from his brother by the opera by some excursion to the country—from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going in this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them that she would gladly have come to their houses and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment and then as she belonged to that witty guermantes set—in which there survived something of the alert mentality stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments which dated from mérimée and found its final expression in the plays of meilhac and halévy—she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise to approximate itself to the plain truth she would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come

   listen and ill explain she began to mme de gallardon tomorrow evening i must go to a friend of mine who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages if she takes us to the theatre afterwards then i cant possibly come to you much as i should love to but if we just stay in the house i know there wont be anyone else there so i can slip away

   tell me have you seen your friend m swann

   no my precious charles i never knew he was here where is he i must catch his eye

   its a funny thing that he should come to old sainteuvertes mme de gallardon went on oh i know hes very clever meaning by that very cunning but that makes no difference fancy a jew here and she the sister and sisterinlaw of two archbishops

   i am ashamed to confess that i am not in the least shocked said the princesse des laumes

   i know hes a converted jew and all that and his parents and grandparents before him but they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones that its all just a pretence is that true dyou think

   i can throw no light at all on the matter

   the pianist who was down to play two pieces by chopin after finishing the prelude had at once attacked a polonaise but once mme de gallardon had informed her cousin that swann was in the room chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without mme des laumess paying him the slightest attention she belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does as with many women of the faubourg saintgermain the presence in any room in which she might find herself of another member of her set even although she had nothing in particular to say to him would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration from that moment in the hope that swann would catch sight of her the princess could do nothing but like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away turn her face in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying chopins music in the direction where swann was and if he moved divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile

   oriane dont be angry with me resumed mme de gallardon who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable people do say about your m swann that hes the sort of man one cant have in the house is that true

   why you of all people ought to know that its true replied the princesse des laumes for you must have asked him a hundred times and hes never been to your house once

   and leaving her cousin mortified afresh she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music but attracted the attention of mme de sainteuverte who had stayed out of politeness near the piano and caught sight of the princess now for the first time mme de sainteuverte was all the more delighted to see mme des laumes as she imagined her to be still at guermantes looking after her fatherinlaw who was ill

   my dear princess you here

   yes i tucked myself away in a corner and ive been hearing such lovely things

   what youve been in the room quite a time

   oh yes quite a long time which seemed very short it was only long because i couldnt see you

   mme de sainteuverte offered her own chair to the princess who declined it with

   oh please no why should you it doesnt matter in the least where i sit and deliberately picking out so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady a low seat without a back there now that hassock thats all i want it will make me keep my back straight oh good heavens im making a noise again theyll be telling you to have me chucked out

   meanwhile the pianist having doubled his speed the emotion of the musiclovers was reaching its climax a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver and was making the spoons rattle and as on every other partynight mme de sainteuverte was making signs to him which he never saw to leave the room a recent bride who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored was smiling vigorously trying to catch her hostesss eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the others having thought of her in connection with so delightful an entertainment and yet although she remained more calm than mme de franquetot it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers what alarmed her being not the pianists fate but the pianos on which a lighted candle jumping at each fortissimo threatened if not to set its shade on fire at least to spill wax upon the ebony at last she could contain herself no longer and running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce but scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when on a final chord the piece finished and the pianist rose to his feet nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it produced an impression that was favourable on the whole

   did you see what that girl did just now princess asked general de froberville who had come up to mme des laumes as her hostess left her for a moment odd wasnt it is she one of the performers

   no shes a little mme de cambremer replied the princess carelessly and then with more animation i am only repeating what i heard just now myself i havent the faintest notion who said it it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of mme de sainteuverte in the country but i dont believe anyone knows them really they must be country cousins by the way i dont know whether youre particularly wellup in the brilliant society which we see before us because ive no idea who all these astonishing people can be what do you suppose they do with themselves when theyre not at mme de sainteuvertes parties she must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food universal providers you know you must admit theyre rather splendid general but can she really have the courage to hire the same supers every week it isnt possible

   oh but cambremer is quite a good name old too protested the general

   i see no objection to its being old the princess answered dryly but whatever else it is its not euphonious she went on isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas a little affectation to which the guermantes set were addicted

   you think not eh shes a regular little peach though said the general whose eyes never strayed from mme de cambremer dont you agree with me princess

   she thrusts herself forward too much i think in so young a woman thats not very nice—for i dont suppose shes my generation replied mme des laumes the last word being common it appeared to gallardon and guermantes and then seeing that m de froberville was still gazing at mme de cambremer she added half out of malice towards the lady half wishing to oblige the general not very nice for her husband i am sorry that i do not know her since she seems to attract you so much i might have introduced you to her said the princess who if she had known the young woman would most probably have done nothing of the sort and now i must say good night because one of my friends is having a birthday party and i must go and wish her many happy returns she explained modestly and with truth reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme but at which she was obliged to be present and there would be something touching about her appearance besides i must pick up basin while ive been here hes gone to see those friends of his—you know them too im sure—who are called after a bridge—oh yes the iénas

   it was a battle before it was a bridge princess it was a victory said the general i mean to say to an old soldier like me he went on wiping his monocle and replacing it as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath while the princess instinctively looked away that empire nobility well of course its not the same thing but after all taking it as it is its very fine of its kind they were people who really did fight like heroes

   but i have the deepest respect for heroes the princess assented though with a faint trace of irony if i dont go with basin to see this princesse diéna it isnt for that at all its simply because i dont know them basin knows them he worships them oh no its not what you think hes not in love with her ive nothing to set my face against besides what good has it ever done when i have set my face against them she queried sadly for the whole world knew that ever since the day upon which the prince des laumes had married his fascinating cousin he had been consistently unfaithful to her anyhow it isnt that at all theyre people he has known for ever so long they do him very well and that suits me down to the ground but i must tell you what hes told me about their house its quite enough can you imagine it all their furniture is empire

   but my dear princess thats only natural it belonged to their grandparents

   i dont quite say it didnt but that doesnt make it any less ugly i quite understand that people cant always have nice things but at least they neednt have things that are merely grotesque what do you say i can think of nothing more devastating more utterly smug than that hideous style—cabinets covered all over with swans heads like bathtaps

   but i believe all the same that theyve got some lovely things why they must have that famous mosaic table on which the treaty of

   oh i dont deny they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view but things like that cant ever be beautiful  because theyre simply horrible ive got things like that myself that came to basin from the montesquious only theyre up in the attics at guermantes where nobody ever sees them but after all thats not the point i would fly to see them with basin i would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses if i knew them but—i dont know them dyou know i was always taught when i was a little girl that it was not polite to call on people one didnt know she assumed a tone of childish gravity and so i am just doing what i was taught to do cant you see those good people with a totally strange woman bursting into their house why i might get a most hostile reception

   and she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips by giving to her blue eyes which were fixed on the general a gentle dreamy expression

   my dear princess you know that theyd be simply wild with joy

   no why she inquired with the utmost vivacity either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in france or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the general tell her so why how can you tell perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen i know nothing about them but if theyre anything like me i find it quite boring enough to see the people i do know im sure if i had to see people i didnt know as well even if they had fought like heroes i should go stark mad besides except when its an old friend like you whom one knows quite apart from that im not sure that heroism takes one very far in society its often quite boring enough to have to give a dinnerparty but if one had to offer ones arm to spartacus to let him take one down really no it would never be vercingetorix i should send for to make a fourteenth i feel sure i should keep him for really big crushes and as i never give any

   ah princess its easy to see youre not a guermantes for nothing you have your share of it all right the wit of the guermantes

   but people always talk about the wit of the guermantes i never could make out why do you really know any others who have it she rallied him with a rippling flow of laughter her features concentrated yoked to the service of her animation her eyes sparkling blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches—even if the princess had to make them herself—as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty look theres swann talking to your cambremer woman over there beside old sainteuverte dont you see him ask him to introduce you but hurry up he seems to be just going

   did you notice how dreadfully ill hes looking asked the general

   my precious charles ah hes coming at last i was beginning to think he didnt want to see me

   swann was extremely fond of the princesse des laumes and the sight of her recalled to him guermantes a property close to combray and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit so as not to be separated from odette slipping into the manner halfartistic halfamorous—with which he could always manage to amuse the princess—a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere and wishing also to express in words for his own satisfaction the longing that he felt for the country

   ah he exclaimed or rather intoned in such a way as to be audible at once to mme de sainteuverte to whom he spoke and to mme des laumes for whom he was speaking behold our charming princess see she has come up on purpose from guermantes to hear saint francis preach to the birds and has only just had time like a dear little titmouse to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair there are even some drops of dew upon them still a little of the hoarfrost which must be making the duchess down there shiver it is very pretty indeed my dear princess

   what the princess came up on purpose from guermantes but thats too wonderful i never knew im quite bewildered mme de sainteuverte protested with quaint simplicity being but little accustomed to swanns way of speaking and then examining the princesss headdress why youre quite right it is copied from what shall i say not chestnuts no—oh its a delightful idea but how can the princess have known what was going to be on my programme the musicians didnt tell me even

   swann who was accustomed when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand did not condescend to explain to mme de sainteuverte that he had been speaking metaphorically as for the princess she was in fits of laughter both because swanns wit was highly appreciated by her set and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing

   indeed im delighted charles if my little hips and haws meet with your approval but tell me why did you bow to that cambremer person are you also her neighbour in the country

   mme de sainteuverte seeing that the princess seemed quite happy talking to swann had drifted away

   but you are yourself princess

   i why they must have countries everywhere those creatures dont i wish i had

   no not the cambremers her own people she was a legrandin and used to come to combray i dont know whether you are aware that you are comtesse de combray and that the chapter owes you a due

   i dont know what the chapter owes me but i do know that im touched for a hundred francs every year by the curé which is a due that i could very well do without but surely these cambremers have rather a startling name it ends just in time but it ends badly she said with a laugh

   it begins no better swann took the point

   yes that double abbreviation

   some one very angry and very proper who didnt dare to finish the first word

   but since he couldnt stop himself beginning the second hed have done better to finish the first and be done with it we are indulging in the most refined form of humour my dear charles in the very best of taste—but how tiresome it is that i never see you now she went on in a coaxing tone i do so love talking to you just imagine i could not make that idiot froberville see that there was anything funny about the name cambremer do agree that life is a dreadful business its only when i see you that i stop feeling bored

   which was probably not true but swann and the princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life—the effect if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation this similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices but if one took the trouble to imagine swanns utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them of the moustache from under which they emerged one found that they were the same phrases the same inflexions that they had the tone of the guermantes set on important matters swann and the princess had not an idea in common but since swann had become so melancholy and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime and when he heard the princess say that life was a dreadful business he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of odette

   yes life is a dreadful business we must meet more often my dear friend what is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful we could spend a most pleasant evening together

   im sure we could why not come down to guermantes my motherinlaw would be wild with joy its supposed to be very ugly down there but i must say i find the neighborhood not at all unattractive i have a horror of picturesque spots

   i know it well its delightful replied swann its almost too beautiful too much alive for me just at present its a country to be happy in its perhaps because i have lived there but things there speak to me so as soon as a breath of wind gets up and the cornfields begin to stir i feel that some one is going to appear suddenly that i am going to hear some news and those little houses by the waters edge i should be quite wretched

   oh my dearest charles do take care theres that appalling rampillon woman shes seen me hide me somewhere do tell me again quickly what it was that happened to her i get so mixed up shes just married off her daughter or her lover i never can remember—perhaps both—to each other oh no i remember now shes been dropped by her prince pretend to be talking so that the poor old berenice shant come and invite me to dinner anyhow im going listen my dearest charles now that i have seen you once in a blue moon wont you let me carry you off and take you to the princesse de parmes who would be so pleased to see you you know and basin too for that matter hes meeting me there if one didnt get news of you sometimes from mémé remember i never see you at all now

   swann declined having told m de charlus that on leaving mme de sainteuvertes he would go straight home he did not care to run the risk by going on now to the princesse de parmes of missing a message which he had all the time been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen during the party and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter at home

   poor swann said mme des laumes that night to her husband he is always charming but he does look so dreadfully unhappy you will see for yourself for he has promised to dine with us one of these days i do feel that its really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind who isnt even interesting for they tell me shes an absolute idiot she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who not being in love themselves feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus

   swann now wished to go home but just as he was making his escape general de froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to mme de cambremer and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her

   i say swann id rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages what do you say

   the words killed by savages pierced swanns aching heart and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation ah he began some fine lives have been lost in that way there was you remember that explorer whose remains dumont durville brought back la pérouse and he was at once happy again as though he had named odette he was a fine character and interests me very much does la pérouse he ended sadly

   oh yes of course la pérouse said the general its quite a wellknown name theres a street called that

   do you know anyone in the rue la pérouse asked swann excitedly

   only mme de chanlivault the sister of that good fellow chaussepierre she gave a most amusing theatreparty the other evening thats a house that will be really smart some day youll see

   oh so she lives in the rue la pérouse its attractive i like that street its so sombre

   indeed it isnt you cant have been in it for a long time its not at all sombre now theyre beginning to build all round there

   when swann did finally introduce m de froberville to the young mme de cambremer since it was the first time that she had heard the generals name she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never in the whole of her life heard anything else for as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family whenever anyone was presented to her she assumed that he must be one of them and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard such a lot about him since her marriage she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it and so her parentsinlaw whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in france declared that she was an angel all the more that they preferred to appear in marrying her to their son to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune

   its easy to see that youre a musician heart and soul madame said the general alluding to the incident of the candle

   meanwhile the concert had begun again and swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number he suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since being ignorant of his love incapable had they known of it of taking any interest or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke or deplore it as an act of insanity they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone whose reality there was nothing external to confirm he suffered overwhelmingly to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry from having to prolong his exile in this place to which odette would never come in which no one nothing was aware of her existence from which she was entirely absent

   but suddenly it was as though she had entered and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart what had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes on which it rested as though expecting something an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival to welcome it before itself expired to keep the way open for a moment longer with all its remaining strength that the stranger might enter in as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close and before swann had had time to understand what was happening to think it is the little phrase from vinteuils sonata i mustnt listen all his memories of the days when odette had been in love with him which he had succeeded up till that evening in keeping invisible in the depths of his being deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love whose sun they supposed had dawned again had awakened from their slumber had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears without pity for his present desolation the forgotten strains of happiness

   in place of the abstract expressions the time when i was happy the time when i was loved which he had often used until then and without much suffering for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar volatile essence of that lost happiness he could see it all the snowy curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage which he had kept pressed to his lips the address maison dorée embossed on the notepaper on which he had read my hand trembles so as i write to you the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly you wont let it be very long before you send for me he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while loredan went to fetch the little working girl could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring the icecold homeward drive in his victoria by moonlight all the network of mental habits of seasonable impressions of sensory reactions which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes by which his body now found itself inextricably held at that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone he had supposed that he could stop there that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also how small a thing the actual charm of odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing of not possessing her wholly at all times and in all places alas he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed but i can see you at any time i am always free—she who was never free now the interest the curiosity that she had shewn in his life her passionate desire that he should do her the favour—of which it was he who then had felt suspicious as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements—of granting her access to his study how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the verdurins and when he did allow her to come to him once a month how she had first before he would let himself be swayed had to repeat what a joy it would be to her that custom of their seeing each other daily for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction for which since that time she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it while it had become for him so insatiable so dolorous a need little had he suspected how truly he spoke when on their third meeting as she repeated but why dont you let me come to you oftener he had told her laughing and in a vein of gallantry that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion now alas it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel on paper which bore a printed address but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart written from the hôtel vouillemont what on earth can she have gone there for with whom what happened there he remembered the gasjets that were being extinguished along the boulevard des italiens when he had met her when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed and swann could distinguish standing motionless before that scene of happiness in which it lived again a wretched figure which filled him with such pity because he did not at first recognise who it was that he must lower his head lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears it was himself

   when he had realised this his pity ceased he was jealous now of that other self whom she had loved he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said without much suffering perhaps shes in love with them now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving in which there is no love for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the letterheading of the maison dor for they were full of love and then his anguish becoming too keen he passed his hand over his forehead let the monocle drop from his eye and wiped its glass and doubtless if he had caught sight of himself at that moment he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified this one which he removed like an importunate worrying thought from his head while from its misty surface with his handkerchief he sought to obliterate his cares

   there are in the music of the violin—if one does not see the instrument itself and so cannot relate what one hears to its form which modifies the fullness of the sound—accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra one raises ones eyes one sees only the wooden case magical as a chinese box but at moments one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the siren at times too one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit struggling in the darkness of its masterful box a box quivering with enchantment like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water sometimes again it is in the air at large like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear as it passes its invisible message

   as though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure and to prolong for a few moments the miracle of its apparition swann who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultraviolet light who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it swann felt that it was present like a protective goddess a confidant of his love who so as to be able to come to him through the crowd and to draw him aside to speak to him had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound and as she passed him light soothing as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower telling him what she had to say every word of which he closely scanned sorry to see them fly away so fast he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing as it went by him the harmonious fleeting form

   he felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she who addressed herself to him spoke to him in a whisper of odette for he had no longer as of old the impression that odette and he were not known to the little phrase had it not often been the witness of their joys true that as often it had warned him of their frailty and indeed whereas in that distant time he had divined an element of suffering in its smile in its limpid and disillusioned intonation tonight he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay of those sorrows of which the little phrase had spoken to him then which he had seen it—without his being touched by them himself—carry past him smiling on its sinuous and rapid course of those sorrows which were now become his own without his having any hope of being ever delivered from them it seemed to say to him as once it had said of his happiness what does all that matter it is all nothing and swanns thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that vinteuil towards that unknown exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly what could his life have been from the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that godlike strength that unlimited power of creation

   when it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which but a little while back had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance twas because the little phrase unlike them whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul saw in them something not as everyone else saw less serious than the events of everyday life but on the contrary so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it those graces of an intimate sorrow twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate to create anew and even their essence for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them the little phrase had captured had rendered visible so much so that it made their value be confessed their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers—provided only that they were in any sense musical—who the next moment would ignore would disown them in real life in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements but ever since more than a year before discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul the love of music had been born and for a time at least had dwelt in him swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas of another world of another order ideas veiled in shadows unknown impenetrable by the human mind which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another unequal among themselves in value and in significance when after that first evening at the verdurins he had had the little phrase played over to him again and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that like a perfume or a caress it swept over and enveloped him he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid a contracted sweetness but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself but merely upon certain equivalents substituted for his minds convenience for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware before ever he knew the verdurins at that earlier party when for the first time he had heard the sonata played he knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes but an immeasurable keyboard still almost all of it unknown on which here and there only separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts some few among the millions of keys keys of tenderness of passion of courage of serenity which compose it each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found of shewing us what richness what variety lies hidden unknown to us in that great black impenetrable night discouraging exploration of our soul which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void vinteuil had been one of those musicians in his little phrase albeit it presented to the minds eye a clouded surface there was contained one felt a matter so consistent so explicit to which the phrase gave so new so original a force that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasurechamber of their minds swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the princesse de clèves or of rené should either of those titles occur to him even when he was not thinking of the little phrase it existed latent in his mind in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent such as our notions of light of sound of perspective of bodily desire the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned perhaps we shall lose them perhaps they will be obliterated if we return to nothing in the dust but so long as we are alive we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object than we can for example doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness in that way vinteuils phrase like some theme say in tristan which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment has espoused our mortal state had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough its destiny was linked for the future with that of the human soul of which it was one of the special the most distinctive ornaments perhaps it is notbeing that is the true state and all our dream of life is without existence but if so we feel that it must be that these phrases of music these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream are nothing either we shall perish but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate and death in their company is something less bitter less inglorious perhaps even less certain

   so swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did really exist human as it was from this point of view it belonged none the less to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen but whom in spite of that we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours this was what vinteuil had done for the little phrase swann felt that the composer had been content with the musical instruments at his disposal to draw aside its veil to make it visible following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving so prudent so delicate and so sure that the sound altered at every moment blunting itself to indicate a shadow springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection and one proof that swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had vinteuil endowed with less power to see and to render its forms sought to dissemble by adding a line here and there of his own invention the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand

   the phrase had disappeared swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement after a long passage which mme verdurins pianist always skipped there were in this passage some admirable ideas which swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata and which he now perceived as if they had in the cloakroom of his memory divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism he was assisting at the mystery of its birth audacity he exclaimed to himself as inspired perhaps as a lavoisiers or an amperes the audacity of a vinteuil making experiment discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern how charming the dialogue which swann now heard between piano and violin at the beginning of the last passage the suppression of human speech so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled as one might have thought had eliminated it altogether never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity never had it known questions so pertinent such obvious replies at first the piano complained alone like a bird deserted by its mate the violin heard and answered it as from a neighbouring tree it was as at the first beginning of the world as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth or rather in this world closed against all the rest so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves the world of this sonata was it a bird was it the soul not yet made perfect of the little phrase was it a fairy invisibly somewhere lamenting whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came marvellous bird the violinist seemed to wish to charm to tame to woo to win it already it had passed into his soul already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a mediums the body of the violinist possessed indeed swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again and his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face once more with the phrase convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us not when we are alone but when we repeat one or the other to a friend in whom we see ourselves reflected like a third person whose probable emotion softens him it reappeared but this time to remain poised in the air and to sport there for a moment only as though immobile and shortly to expire and so swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered it was still there like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken as a rainbow when its brightness fades seems to subside then soars again and before it is extinguished is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now chords shot with every hue in the prism and made them sing swann dared not move and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence supernatural delicious frail that would so easily vanish but no one as it happened dreamed of speaking the ineffable utterance of one solitary man absent perhaps dead swann did not know whether vinteuil were still alive breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed it followed that when the phrase at last was finished and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place if swann at first was annoyed to see the comtesse de monteriender famed for her imbecilities lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions before even the sonata had come to an end he could not refrain from smiling and perhaps also found an underlying sense which she was incapable of perceiving in the words that she used dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers the comtesse exclaimed to swann its astonishing i have never seen anything to beat it but a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion she added the reservation anything to beat it since the tableturning

   from that evening swann understood that the feeling which odette had once had for him would never revive that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now and the days on which by a lucky chance she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him or if she had paid him any attention he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude the desperate joy that people reveal who when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady relate as significant facts of infinite value yesterday he went through his accounts himself and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up he ate an egg today and seemed quite to enjoy it if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet tomorrow—although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death no doubt swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving paris for ever he would have had the courage to remain there but he had not the courage to go

   he had often thought of going now that he was once again at work upon his essay on vermeer he wanted to return for a few days at least to the hague to dresden to brunswick he was certain that a toilet of diana which had been acquired by the mauritshuis at the goldschmidt sale as a nicholas maes was in reality a vermeer and he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot so as to strengthen his conviction but to leave paris while odette was there and even when she was not there—for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit we refresh we revive an old pain—was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect but it would happen that while he was asleep the intention to travel would reawaken in him without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible and would be realised one night he dreamed that he was going away for a year leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also the train began to move he awoke in alarm and remembered that he was not going away that he would see odette that evening and next day and almost every day and then being still deeply moved by his dream he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent thanks to which he could remain in odettes vicinity and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes and counting over the list of his advantages his social position—his fortune from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture having even so people said an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her—his friendship with m de charlus which it must be confessed had never won him any very great favour from odette but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem—and even his own intelligence the whole of which he employed in weaving every day a fresh plot which would make his presence if not agreeable at any rate necessary to odette—he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking he thought that if he had been like so many other men poor and humble without resources forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him or tied down by parents or by a wife he might have been obliged to part from odette that that dream the terror of which was still so recent might well have been true and he said to himself people dont know when they are happy theyre never so unhappy as they think they are but he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever that he would sacrifice his work his pleasures his friends in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which when it occurred would bring him no happiness and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams—his own departure and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy that they were never so happy as they supposed

   sometimes he hoped that she would die painlessly in some accident she who was out of doors in the streets crossing busy thoroughfares from morning to night and as she always returned safe and sound he marvelled at the strength at the suppleness of the human body which was able continually to hold in check to outwit all the perils that environed it which to swann seemed innumerable since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path and so allowed its occupant the soul to abandon itself day after day and almost with impunity to its career of mendacity to the pursuit of pleasure and swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that mahomet ii whose portrait by bellini he admired who on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives stabbed her in order as his venetian biographer artlessly relates to recover his spiritual freedom then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of odettes very life

   since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged and his love would perhaps have died and from the moment when she did not wish to leave paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go as he knew that her one prolonged absence every year was in august and september he had abundant opportunity several months in advance to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation and which consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing floated in a cold transparency in his mind which it saddened and depressed though without causing him any intolerable pain but that conception of the future that flowing stream colourless and unconfined a single word from odette sufficed to penetrate through all swanns defences and like a block of ice immobilised it congealed its fluidity made it freeze altogether and swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder for odette had said casually watching him with a malicious smile forcheville is going for a fine trip at whitsuntide hes going to egypt and swann had at once understood that this meant i am going to egypt at whitsuntide with forcheville and in fact if a few days later swann began about that trip that you told me you were going to take with forcheville she would answer carelessly yes my dear boy were starting on the 19th well send you a view of the pyramids then he was determined to know whether she was forchevilles mistress to ask her pointblank to insist upon her telling him he knew that there were some perjuries which being so superstitious she would not commit and besides the fear which had hitherto restrained his curiosity of making odette angry if he questioned her of making himself odious had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her

   one day he received an anonymous letter which told him that odette had been the mistress of countless men several of whom it named among them forcheville m de bréauté and the painter and women and that she frequented houses of illfame he was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life he wondered who it could be but he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people those which had no visible connection with what they said and when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of m de charlus or of m des laumes or of m dorsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth as none of these men had ever in conversation with swann suggested that he approved of anonymous letters and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest m de charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity but he was fundamentally good and kind m des laumes was a trifle dry but wholesome and straight as for m dorsan swann had never met anyone who even in the most depressing circumstances would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance would act more properly or with more discretion so much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to m dorsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement for a moment swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light until he had the courage to return to those other reflections but then after not having been able to suspect anyone he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew after all m de charlus might be most fond of him might be most goodnatured but he was a neuropath tomorrow perhaps he would burst into tears on hearing that swann was ill and today from jealousy or in anger or carried away by some sudden idea he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury really that kind of man was the worst of all the prince des laumes was certainly far less devoted to swann than was m de charlus but for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him and besides his was a nature which though no doubt it was cold was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellowfeeling that he could not in the last resort answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own as was so far as the heart went that of m de charlus the mere thought of causing swann so much distress would have been revolting to him but with a man who was insensible of another order of humanity as was the prince des laumes how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature to have a good heart was everything and m de charlus had one but m dorsan was not lacking in that either and his relations with swann—cordial but scarcely intimate arising from the pleasure which as they held the same views about everything they found in talking together—were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of m de charlus who was apt to be led into passionate activity good or evil if there was anyone by whom swann felt that he had always been understood and with delicacy loved it was m dorsan yes but the life he led it could hardly be called honourable swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours that he himself had admitted jestingly that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy or of respect as when he was in thoroughly detrimental society it is not for nothing he now assured himself that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour their finding is based upon his actions it is those alone that are significant and not at all what we say or what we think charlus and des laumes may have this or that fault but they are men of honour orsan perhaps has not the same faults but he is not a man of honour he may have acted dishonourably once again then he suspected rémi who it was true could only have inspired the letter but he now felt himself for a moment to be on the right track to begin with loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to odette and then how were we not to suppose that our servants living in a situation inferior to our own adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class he also suspected my grandfather on every occasion when swann had asked him to do him any service had he not invariably declined besides with his ideas of middleclass respectability he might have thought that he was acting for swanns good he suspected in turn bergotte the painter the verdurins paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible were perhaps even openly avowed as excellent jokes but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those bohemians and contrasted them with the life of expedients often bordering on fraudulence to which the want of money the craving for luxury the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy in a word this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths—which no strange eye might explore—of the warm heart rather than the cold the artists rather than the businessmans the nobles rather than the flunkeys what criterion ought one to adopt in order to judge ones fellows after all there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not in certain circumstances prove capable of a shameful action must he then cease to see them all his mind grew clouded he passed his hands two or three times across his brow wiped his glasses with his handkerchief and remembering that after all men who were as good as himself frequented the society of m de charlus the prince des laumes and the rest he persuaded himself that this meant if not that they were incapable of shameful actions at least that it was a necessity in human life to which everyone must submit to frequent the society of people who were perhaps not incapable of such actions and he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had possibly been seeking to drive him to despair as for the actual contents of the letter they did not disturb him for in not one of the charges which it formulated against odette could he see the least vestige of fact like many other men swann had a naturally lazy mind and was slow in invention he knew quite well as a general truth that human life is full of contrasts but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was he imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed at such times as he spent with odette if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which swann had always heard expressed by his own parents and to which he himself had remained loyal and then she would arrange her flowers would sip her tea would shew an interest in his work so swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart if anyone had portrayed her to him as she was or rather as she had been for so long with himself but had substituted some other man he would have been distressed for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike but to suppose that she went to bad houses that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject the most contemptible of mortals—would be an insane wandering of the mind for the realisation of which thank heaven the chrysanthemums that he could imagine the daily cups of tea the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place only now and again he gave odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did and making opportune use of some detail—insignificant but true—which he had accidentally learned as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow in spite of himself to pass his lips out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters which in reality he neither knew nor suspected for if he often adjured odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth that was only whether he realised it or no in order that odette should tell him everything that she did no doubt as he used to assure odette he loved sincerity but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress moreover his love of sincerity not being disinterested had not improved his character the truth which he cherished was that which odette would tell him but he himself in order to extract that truth from her was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation in a word he lied as much as did odette because while more unhappy than she he was no less egotistical and she when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done would stare at him with a look of distrust and at all hazards of indignation so as not to appear to be humiliated and to be blushing for her actions one day after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the princesse des laumes having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played the sight of the title—les filles de marbre by théodore barrière—struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away illuminated as though by a row of footlights in the new surroundings in which it now appeared that word marble which he had lost the power to distinguish so often had it passed in print beneath his eyes had suddenly become visible once again and had at once brought back to his mind the story which odette had told him long ago of a visit which she had paid to the salon at the palais dindustrie with mme verdurin who had said to her take care now i know how to melt you all right youre not made of marble odette had assured him that it was only a joke and he had not attached any importance to it at the time but he had had more confidence in her then than he had now and the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper he opened it turned the page so as not to see again the words filles de marbre and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces there had been a storm in the channel and damage was reported from dieppe cabourg beuzeval suddenly he recoiled again in horror

   the name of beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district beuzeville which carried also bound to it by a hyphen a second name to wit bréauté which he had often seen on maps but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend m de bréauté whom the anonymous letter accused of having been odettes lover after all when it came to m de bréauté there was nothing improbable in the charge but so far as mme verdurin was concerned it was a sheer impossibility from the fact that odette did occasionally tell a lie it was not fair to conclude that she never by any chance told the truth and in these bantering conversations with mme verdurin which she herself had repeated to swann he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice women often utter thereby certifying their own innocence who—as for instance odette—would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another whereas on the other hand the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being for a moment in his mind by her story fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes the temperament of his mistress but at that moment by an inspiration of jealousy analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher who has nothing so far but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation the idea or the natural law which will give power mastery to his work swann recalled for the first time a remark which odette had made to him at least two years before oh mme verdurin she wont hear of anything just now but me im a love if you please and she kisses me and wants me to go with her everywhere and call her by her christian name so far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations intended to create an atmosphere of vice which odette had since repeated to him he had welcomed them as a proof of mme verdurins warmhearted and generous friendship but now this old memory of her affection for odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation he could no longer separate them in his mind and he saw them blended in reality the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which in return spoiled the affection of its innocence he went to see odette he sat down keeping at a distance from her he did not dare to embrace her not knowing whether in her in himself it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke he sat there silent watching their love expire suddenly he made up his mind

   odette my darling he began i know i am being simply odious but i must ask you a few questions you remember what i once thought about you and mme verdurin tell me was it true have you with her or anyone else ever

   she shook her head pursing her lips together a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going because it would bore them to go when some one has asked are you coming to watch the procession go by or will you be at the review but this shake of the head which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past furthermore it suggests reasons of personal convenience rather than any definite repudiation any moral impossibility when he saw odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false he realised that it was quite possibly true

   i have told you i never did you know quite well she added seeming angry and uncomfortable

   yes i know all that but are you quite sure dont say to me you know quite well say i have never done anything of that sort with any woman

   she repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote and as though she hoped thereby to be rid of him i have never done anything of that sort with any woman

   can you swear it to me on your laghetto medal

   swann knew that odette would never perjure herself on that

   oh you do make me so miserable she cried with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question have you nearly done what is the matter with you today you seem to have made up your mind that i am to be forced to hate you to curse you look i was anxious to be friends with you again for us to have a nice time together like the old days and this is all the thanks i get

   however he would not let her go but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it

   you are quite wrong in supposing that i bear you the least illwill in the world odette he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness i never speak to you except of what i already know and i always know a great deal more than i say but you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people my anger with you is never due to your actions—i can and do forgive you everything because i love you—but to your untruthfulness the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which i know to be true how can you expect that i shall continue to love you when i see you maintain when i hear you swear to me a thing which i know to be false odette do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both if you are willing to end it at once you shall be free of it for ever tell me upon your medal yes or no whether you have ever done those things

   how on earth can i tell she was furious perhaps i have ever so long ago when i didnt know what i was doing perhaps two or three times

   swann had prepared himself for all possibilities reality must therefore be something which bears no relation to possibilities any more than the stab of a knife in ones body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead since those words two or three times carved as it were a cross upon the living tissues of his heart a strange thing indeed that those words two or three times nothing more than a few words words uttered in the air at a distance could so lacerate a mans heart as if they had actually pierced it could sicken a man like a poison that he had drunk instinctively swann thought of the remark that he had heard at mme de sainteuvertes i have never seen anything to beat it since the tableturning the agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed not only because in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil but because even when he did imagine that offence it remained vague uncertain was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words perhaps two or three times was not armed with that specific cruelty as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time and yet this odette from whom all this evil sprang was no less dear to him was on the contrary more precious as if in proportion as his sufferings increased there increased at the same time the price of the sedative of the antidote which this woman alone possessed he wished to pay her more attention as one attends to a disease which one discovers suddenly to have grown more serious he wished that the horrible thing which she had told him she had done two or three times might be prevented from occurring again to ensure that he must watch over odette people often say that by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her because he does not believe you yet how much more so if he does but swann asked himself how could he manage to protect her he might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman but there were hundreds of other women and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun on the evening when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins to desire the possession—as if that were ever possible—of another person happily for swann beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians there lay a natural foundation older more placid and silently laborious like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements these older these autochthonous indwellers in his soul absorbed all swanns strength for a while in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence or after an operation this time it was not so much—as it ordinarily was—in swanns brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect it was rather in his heart but all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur and like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was apparently ended upon swanns heart spared for a moment only the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again he remembered those moonlit evenings when leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the rue la pérouse he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear but all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart to draw breath again and to contrive to smile so as to dissemble his torment already he had begun to put further questions for his jealousy which had taken an amount of trouble such as no enemy would have incurred to strike him this mortal blow to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound like an evil deity his jealousy was inspiring swann was thrusting him on towards destruction it was not his fault but odettes alone if at first his punishment was not more severe

   my darling he began again its all over now was it with anyone i know

   no i swear it wasnt besides i think i exaggerated i never really went as far as that

   he smiled and resumed with just as you like it doesnt really matter but its unfortunate that you cant give me any name if i were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again i say it for your own sake because then i shouldnt bother you any more about it its so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in ones mind what is really terrible is what one cannot imagine but youve been so sweet to me i dont want to tire you i do thank you with all my heart for all the good that you have done me ive quite finished now only one word more how many times

   oh charles cant you see youre killing me its all ever so long ago ive never given it a thought anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again and then youd be a lot better off she concluded with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice

   i only wished to know whether it had been since i knew you its only natural did it happen here ever you cant give me any particular evening so that i can remind myself what i was doing at the time you understand surely that its not possible that you dont remember with whom odette my love

   but i dont know really i dont i think it was in the bois one evening when you came to meet us on the island you had been dining with the princesse des laumes she added happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail which testified to her veracity at the next table there was a woman whom i hadnt seen for ever so long she said to me come along round behind the rock there and look at the moonlight on the water at first i just yawned and said no im too tired and im quite happy where i am thank you she swore thered never been anything like it in the way of moonlight ive heard that tale before i said to her you see i knew quite well what she was after odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke either because it appeared to her to be quite natural or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance or else so as not to appear ashamed but catching sight of swanns face she changed her tone and

   you are a fiend she flung at him you enjoy tormenting me making me tell you lies just so that youll leave me in peace

   this second blow struck at swann was even more excruciating than the first never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it not in a past which he had never known but in evenings which he so well remembered which he had lived through with odette of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate such an exhaustive knowledge and which now assumed retrospectively an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty in the midst of them parted suddenly a gaping chasm that moment on the island in the bois de boulogne without being intelligent odette had the charm of being natural she had recounted she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that swann as he gasped for breath could vividly see it odette yawning the rock there he could hear her answer—alas how lightheartedly—ive heard that tale before he felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening that no further revelation was to be expected for the present he was silent for a time then said to her

   my poor darling you must forgive me i know i am hurting you dreadfully but its all over now i shall never think of it again

   but she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know and on that past era of their love monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague and now rent as with a swordwound by the news of that minute on the island in the bois by moonlight while he was dining with the princesse des laumes but he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting—of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it—that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time he was saying to himself life is indeed astonishing and holds some fine surprises it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe here is a woman in whom i had absolute confidence who looks so simple so honest who in any case even allowing that her morals are not strict seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations i receive a most improbable accusation i question her and the little that she admits reveals far more than i could ever have suspected but he could not confine himself to these detached observations he sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often and was likely to do them again he repeated her words to himself i knew quite well what she was after two or three times ive heard that tale before but they did not reappear in his memory unarmed each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh for a long time like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting every minute to make the movement that he knows will hurt him he kept on murmuring to himself im quite happy where i am thank you ive heard that tale before but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop he was amazed to find that actions which he had always hitherto judged so lightly had dismissed indeed with a laugh should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal he knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on odette but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence not to say to him with a smile you jealous monster wanting to rob other people of their pleasure by what trapdoor suddenly lowered had he who had never found in the old days in his love for odette any but the most refined of pleasures been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape poor odette he wished her no harm she was but half to blame had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her when she was still little more than a child at nice to a wealthy englishman but what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of alfred de vignys journal dun poète which he had previously read without emotion when one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman one ought to say to oneself what are her surroundings what has been her life all ones future happiness lies in the answer swann was astonished that such simple phrases spelt over in his mind as ive heard that tale before or i knew quite well what she was after could cause him so much pain but he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while odette was telling her story for it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh it was no good his knowing now—indeed it was no good as time went on his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence—whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before odette began to speak ignorant trustful his merciless jealousy placed him once again so that he might be effectively wounded by odettes admission in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him like a sudden revelation he marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory it was only by the weakening of that generative force whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments but as soon as the power that any one of odettes sentences had to make swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted lo and behold another one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention almost a new sentence came to relieve the first and to strike at him with undiminished force the memory of the evening on which he had dined with the princesse des laumes was painful to him but it was no more than the centre the core of his pain that radiated vaguely round about it overflowing into all the preceding and following days and on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest it was the whole of that season during which the verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the island in the bois that sprang back to hurt him so violently that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it he recognised that all the period of odettes life which had elapsed before she first met him a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see but had consisted of so many definite dated years each crowded with concrete incidents but were he to learn more of them he feared lest her past now colourless fluid and supportable might assume a tangible an obscene form with individual and diabolical features and he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it not any longer now from laziness of mind but from fear of suffering he hoped that some day he might be able to hear the island in the bois or the princesse des laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences with the names of more places and people and of different events which when his malady was still scarcely healed would make it break out again in another form

   but often enough the things that he did not know that he dreaded now to learn it was odette herself who spontaneously and without thought of what she did revealed them to him for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which swann had believed and often still believed his mistress to lead was far wider than she knew a vicious person always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices has no register no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life in the course of their cohabitation in odettes mind with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from swann her other her innocuous actions were gradually coloured infected by these without her being able to detect anything strange in them without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live but when she related them to swann he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed one day he was trying—without hurting odette—to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses he was as a matter of fact convinced that she had not the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind but in a purely mechanical way it had been received there with no credulity but it had for all that remained there and swann wishing to be rid of the burden—a dead weight but none the less disturbing—of this suspicion hoped that odette would now extirpate it for ever

   oh dear no not that they dont simply persecute me to go to them her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to swann there was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday said she would give me any money i asked it seems theres an ambassador who said to her ill kill myself if you dont bring her to me—meaning me they told her id gone out but she waited and waited and in the end i had to go myself and speak to her before shed go away i do wish you could have seen the way i tackled her my maid was in the next room listening and told me i shouted fit to bring the house down—but when you hear me say that i dont want to the idea of such a thing i dont like it at all i should hope im still free to do as i please and when i please and where i please if i needed the money i could understand the porter has orders not to let her in again he will tell her that i am out of town oh i do wish i could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while i was talking to her i know youd have been pleased my dear theres some good in your little odette you see after all though people do say such dreadful things about her

   besides her very admissions—when she made any—of faults which she supposed him to have discovered rather served swann as a startingpoint for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old for her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts in vain might odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part there would remain in the accessories something which swann had never yet imagined which crushed him anew and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy and these admissions he could never forget his spirit carried them along cast them aside then cradled them again in its bosom like corpses in a river and they poisoned it

   she spoke to him once of a visit that forcheville had paid her on the day of the parismurcie fête what you knew him as long ago as that oh yes of course you did he corrected himself so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact and suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that on the day of the parismurcie fête when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved she had been having luncheon perhaps with forcheville at the maison dor she swore that she had not still the maison dor reminds me of something or other which i knew at the time wasnt true he pursued hoping to frighten her yes that i hadnt been there at all that evening when i told you i had just come from there and you had been looking for me at prévosts she replied judging by his manner that he knew with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity a fear of crossing swann which her own selfrespect made her anxious to conceal and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose and so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe and yet could not be charged with cruelty since she was quite unconscious of hurting him she even began to laugh though this may perhaps it is true have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed at all or confused its quite true i hadnt been to the maison dorée i was coming away from forchevilles i had really been to prévosts—that wasnt a story—and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints but some one else came to see him i told you that i was coming from the maison dor because i was afraid you might be angry with me it was rather nice of me really dont you see i admit i did wrong but at least im telling you all about it now ant i what have i to gain by not telling you straight that i lunched with him on the day of the parismurcie fête if it were true especially as at that time we didnt know one another quite so well as we do now did we dear

   he smiled back at her with the sudden craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him and so even in the months of which he had never dared to think again because they had been too happy in those months when she had loved him she was already lying to him besides that moment that first evening on which they had done a cattleya when she had told him that she was coming from the maison dorée how many others must there have been each of them covering a falsehood of which swann had had no suspicion he recalled how she had said to him once i need only tell mme verdurin that my dress wasnt ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse from himself too probably many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting those moments must have hidden without his having the least inkling of it at the time an engagement that she had had with some other man some man to whom she had said i need only tell swann that my dress wasnt ready or that my cab came late there is always some excuse and beneath all his most pleasant memories beneath the simplest words that odette had ever spoken to him in those old days words which he had believed as though they were the words of a gospel beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him beneath the most ordinary places her dressmakers flat the avenue du bois the hippodrome he could feel dissembled there by virtue of that temporal superfluity which after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent always leaves something over that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious his happiest evenings the rue la pérouse itself which odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the maison dorée and like the obscene creatures in the desolation of nineveh shattering stone by stone the whole edifice of his past if now he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the maison dorée it was because that name recalled to him no longer as such a little time since at mme de sainteuvertes party the good fortune which he long had lost but a misfortune of which he was now first aware then it befell the maison dorée as it had befallen the island in the bois that gradually its name ceased to trouble him for what we suppose to be our love our jealousy are neither of them single continuous and individual passions they are composed of an infinity of successive loves of different jealousies each of which is ephemeral although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity the illusion of unity the life of swanns love the fidelity of his jealousy were formed out of death of infidelity of innumerable desires innumerable doubts all of which had odette for their object if he had remained for any length of time without seeing her those that died would not have been replaced by others but the presence of odette continued to sow in swanns heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion

   on certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come he must instantly accompany her home to do a cattleya and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden so inexplicable so imperious the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar that this brutal and unnatural fondness made swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action one evening when he had thus in obedience to her command gone home with her and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words in strange contrast to her habitual coldness he thought suddenly that he heard a sound he rose searched everywhere and found nobody but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side whereupon she in a towering rage broke a vase with i never can do anything right with you you impossible person and he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room whose jealousy she had wished to wound or else to inflame his senses

   sometimes he repaired to gay houses hoping to learn something about odette although he dared not mention her name i have a little thing here youre sure to like the manageress would greet him and he would stay for an hour or so talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further one of them who was still quite young and attractive said to him once of course what i should like would be to find a real friend then he might be quite certain i should never go with any other men again indeed do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a mans being in love with her and never to be unfaithful to him asked swann anxiously why surely it all depends on their characters swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the princesse des laumes to the one who was in search of a friend he said with a smile but how nice of you youve put on blue eyes to go with your sash and you too youve got blue cuffs on what a charming conversation we are having for a place of this sort im not boring you am i or keeping you no ive nothing to do thank you if you bored me i should say so but i love hearing you talk i am highly flattered arent we behaving prettily he asked the manageress who had just looked in why yes thats just what i was saying to myself how sensibly theyre behaving but thats how it is people come to my house now just to talk the prince was telling me only the other day that hes far more comfortable here than with his wife it seems that nowadays all the society ladies are like that a perfect scandal i call it but ill leave you in peace now i know when im not wanted she ended discreetly and left swann with the girl who had the blue eyes but presently he rose and said goodbye to her she had ceased to interest him she did not know odette

   the painter having been ill dr cottard recommended a seavoyage several of the faithful spoke of accompanying him the verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in paris so first of all hired and finally purchased a yacht thus odette was constantly going on a cruise whenever she had been away for any length of time swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her but as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them whenever he heard that odette had returned to paris he could not rest without seeing her once when they had gone away as everyone thought for a month only either they succumbed to a series of temptations or else m verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand to please his wife and disclosed his plans to the faithful only as time went on anyhow from algiers they flitted to tunis then to italy greece constantinople asia minor they had been absent for nearly a year and swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy albeit m verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and dr cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them and that in any event it was most rash to allow mme cottard to return to paris where mme verdurin assured him a revolution had just broken out he was obliged to grant them their liberty at constantinople and the painter came home with them one day shortly after the return of these four travellers swann seeing an omnibus approach him labelled luxembourg and having some business there had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite mme cottard who was paying a round of visits to people whose day it was in full review order with a plume in her hat a silk dress a muff an umbrella which do for a parasol if the rain kept off a cardcase and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners wearing these badges of rank she would in fine weather go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood but when she had to proceed to another district would make use of a transferticket on the omnibus for the first minute or two until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctorswife not being certain either whether she ought to mention the verdurins before swann she produced quite naturally in her slow and awkward but not unattractive voice which every now and then was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon

   i neednt ask you m swann whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the mirlitons to see the portrait by machard that the whole of paris is running after well and what do you think of it whose camp are you in those who bless or those who curse its the same in every house in paris now no one will speak of anything else but machards portrait you arent smart you arent really cultured you arent uptodate unless you give an opinion on machards portrait

   swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait mme cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission

   oh thats quite all right at least you have the courage to be quite frank about it you dont consider yourself disgraced because you havent seen machards portrait i do think that so nice of you well now i have seen it opinion is divided you know there are some people who find it rather laboured like whipped cream they say but i think its just ideal of course shes not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend biche paints thats quite clear but i must tell you perfectly frankly youll think me dreadfully oldfashioned but i always say just what i think that i dont understand his work i can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband oh dear me yes and its certainly less odd than most of what he does but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache but machard just listen to this now the husband of my friend i am on my way to see at this very moment which has given me the very great pleasure of your company has promised her that if he is elected to the academy he is one of the doctors colleagues he will get machard to paint her portrait so shes got something to look forward to i have another friend who insists that shed rather have leloir im only a wretched philistine and ive no doubt leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than machard but i do think that the most important thing about a portrait especially when its going to cost ten thousand francs is that it should be like and a pleasant likeness if you know what i mean

   having exhausted this topic to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume the monogram on her cardcase the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner and the difficulty of speaking to swann about the verdurins mme cottard seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the rue bonaparte where the conductor was to set her down listened to the promptings of her heart which counselled other words than these

   your ears must have been burning she ventured while we were on the yacht with mme verdurin we were talking about you all the time

   swann was genuinely astonished for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the verdurins presence

   you see mme cottard went on mme de crécy was there need i say more when odette is anywhere its never long before she begins talking about you and you know quite well it isnt nasty things she says what you dont believe me she went on noticing that svrann looked sceptical and carried away by the sincerity of her conviction without putting any evil meaning into the word which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends why she adores you no indeed im sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about one would soon be taught ones place whatever we might be doing if we were looking at a picture for instance she would say if only we had him here hes the man who could tell us whether its genuine or not theres no one like him for that and all day long she would be saying what can he be doing just now i do hope hes doing a little work its too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy forgive me wont you i can see him this very moment hes thinking of us hes wondering where we are indeed she used an expression which i thought very pretty at the time m verdurin asked her how in the world can you see what hes doing when hes a thousand miles away and odette answered nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend

   no i assure you im not saying it just to flatter you you have a true friend in her such as one doesnt often find i can tell you besides in case you dont know it that youre the only one mme verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them one talks more freely dont you know before a parting i dont say that odette isnt fond of us but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what swann might say oh mercy theres the conductor stopping for me here have i been chatting away to you and would have gone right past the rue bonaparte and never noticed will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight

   and mme cottard withdrew from her muff to offer it to swann a whitegloved hand from which there floated with a transierticket an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid and swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her as well as to mme verdurin and almost to odette for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain was scarcely even to be described now as love while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes as she gallantly threaded her way along the rue bonaparte her plume erect her skirt held up in one hand while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her cardcase so that its monogram could be seen her muff dancing in the air before her as she went

   to compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that swann had for odette mme cottard a wiser physician in this case than ever her husband would have been had grafted among them others more normal feelings of gratitude of friendship which in swanns mind were to make odette seem again more human more like other women since other women could inspire the same feelings in him were to hasten her final transformation back into that odette loved with an undisturbed affection who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painters to drink orangeade with forcheville that odette with whom swann had calculated that he might live in happiness

   in former times having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with odette he had determined to keep a sharp lookout and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him to cling tightly to it and to hold it back but now to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover for a man cannot change that is to say become another person while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be occasionally the name if it caught his eye in a newspaper of one of the men whom he supposed to have been odettes lovers reawakened his jealousy but it was very slight and inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered—though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy—and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse stealthily and at a distance of its beauties this jealousy gave him if anything an agreeable thrill as to the sad parisian when he has left venice behind him and must return to france a last mosquito proves that italy and summer are still not too remote but as a rule with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging when he made an effort if not to remain in it at least to obtain while still he might an uninterrupted view of it he discovered that already it was too late he would have looked back to distinguish as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear that love from which he had departed but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess that very soon the clouds gathering in his brain he could see nothing he would abandon the attempt would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little that there would be time enough later on and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railwaycarriage that is drawing him he feels faster and faster out of the country in which he has lived for so long and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell indeed like the same traveller if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in france when swann happened to alight close at hand upon something which proved that forcheville had been odettes lover he discovered that it caused him no pain that love was now utterly remote and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever and just as before kissing odette for the first time he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss so he could have wished—in thought at least—to have been in a position to bid farewell while she still existed to that odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy to that odette who had caused him so to suffer and whom now he would never see again he was mistaken he was destined to see her once again a few weeks later it was while he was asleep in the twilight of a dream he was walking with mme verdurin dr cottard a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify the painter odette napoleon iii and my grandfather along a path which followed the line of the coast and overhung the sea now at a great height now by a few feet only so that they were continually going up and down those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing what little daylight yet remained was failing and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them now and then the waves dashed against the cliff and swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray odette told him to wipe this off but he could not and felt confused and helpless in her company as well as because he was in his nightshirt he hoped that in the darkness this might pass unnoticed mme verdurin however fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment in which he saw her face change its shape her nose grow longer while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache he turned away to examine odette her cheeks were pale with little fiery spots her features drawn and ringed with shadows but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once suddenly odette turned her wrist glanced at a tiny watch and said i must go she took leave of everyone in the same formal manner without taking swann aside without telling him where they were to meet that evening or next day he dared not ask he would have liked to follow her he was obliged without turning back in her direction to answer with a smile some question by mme verdurin but his heart was frantically beating he felt that he now hated odette he would gladly have crushed those eyes which a moment ago he had loved so dearly have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks he continued to climb with mme verdurin that is to say that each step took him farther from odette who was going downhill and in the other direction a second passed and it was many hours since she had left him the painter remarked to swann that napoleon iii had eclipsed himself immediately after odette they had obviously arranged it between them he added they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff but they wouldnt say goodbye together it might have looked odd she is his mistress the strange young man burst into tears swann endeavoured to console him after all she is quite right he said to the young man drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease ive advised her to do that myself a dozen times why be so distressed he was obviously the man to understand her so swann reasoned with himself for the young man whom he had failed at first to identify was himself also like certain novelists he had distributed his own personality between two characters him who was the first person in the dream and another whom he saw before him capped with a fez

   as for napoleon iii it was to forcheville that some vague association of ideas then a certain modification of the barons usual physiognomy and lastly the broad ribbon of the legion of honour across his breast had made swann give that name but actually and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him it was indeed forcheville for from an incomplete and changing set of images swann in his sleep drew false deductions enjoying at the same time such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division like certain lower organisms with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious he brought about sudden vicissitudes which by a chain of logical sequences would produce at definite points in his dream the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake in an instant night grew black about him an alarum rang the inhabitants ran past him escaping from their blazing houses he could hear the thunder of the surging waves and also of his own heart which with equal violence was anxiously beating in his breast suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled he felt a pain a nausea that were inexplicable a peasant dreadfully burned flung at him as he passed come and ask charlus where odette spent the night with her friend he used to go about with her and she tells him everything it was they that started the fire it was his valet come to awaken him and saying—

   sir it is eight oclock and the barber is here i have told him to call again in an hour

   but these words as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which swann was submerged did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light at the bottom of a bowl of water into another sun just as a moment earlier the sound of the doorbell swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum had engendered the episode of the fire meanwhile the scenery of his dreamstage scattered in dust he opened his eyes heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea grown very distant he touched his cheek it was dry and yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray and the taste of salt on his lips he rose and dressed himself he had made the barber come early because he had written the day before to my grandfather to say that he was going that afternoon to combray having learned that mme de cambremer—mlle legrandin that had been—was spending a few days there the association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave paris for a while as the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people but overlapping them may occur before love has begun and may be repeated after love is ended the earliest appearances in our life of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication a warning a presage it was in this fashion that swann had often carried back his mind to the image of odette encountered in the theatre on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again—and that he now recalled the party at mme de sainteuvertes at which he had introduced general de froberville to mme de cambremer so manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that on a single occasion the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering and no doubt that might have occurred to swann elsewhere than at mme de sainteuvertes who indeed can say whether in the event of his having gone that evening somewhere else other happinesses other griefs would not have come to him which later would have appeared to have been inevitable but what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to mme de sainteuvertes that evening because his mind anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time such as to discover what actually had been most to be wished for came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening and the pleasures at that time unsuspected which were already being brought to birth—the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish—were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity

   but while an hour after his awakening he was giving instructions to the barber so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey he thought once again of his dream he saw once again as he had felt them close beside him odettes pallid complexion her too thin cheeks her drawn features her tired eyes all the things which—in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her—he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy days to which doubtless while he slept his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things and with that old intermittent fatuity which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy and lowered at the same time the average level of his morality he cried out in his heart to think that i have wasted years of my life that i have longed for death that the greatest love that i have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me who was not in my style1embed"
