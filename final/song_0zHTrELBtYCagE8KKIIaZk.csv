young money nigga ima rep to the death
you can see the ym tatted on my neck
all my niggas wild choppers on deck
stomp a nigga out demand i respect

and its cash on delivery so hand me my check
nigga i dont talk much but when i do bitch pay me
big money heavyweight you can ask baby
birdman schooled me wayne told me do me
and stack big paper up no need for loose leaf
my rubberband stacks cant fold into knots
i decapitate the top with two hoes in the drop
im counting up the money till my hands get blisters
told my bitch to come help me we can count it up quicker nigga

free my nigga weezy and free my nigga gucci
