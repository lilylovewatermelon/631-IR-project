summertime is finally here
that old ballpark man is back in gear
out on 49
man i can see the lights

schools out and the nights roll in
man just like a long lost friend
you aint seen in a while
and cant help but smile

prechorus
and its two bare feet on the dashboard
young love and an old ford
cheap shades and a tattoo
and a yoohoo bottle on the floorboard

chorus
perfect song on the radio
sing along cause its one we know
its a smile its a kiss
its a sip of wine its summertime
sweet summertime

verse 2
temperature says 93
down at the deposit and guarantee
but that swimming hole
its nice and cold
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebikini bottoms underneath
but the boys hearts still skip a beat
when them girls shimmy off
them old cutoffs

prechorus
and its two bare feet on the dashboard
young love and an old ford
cheap shades and a tattoo
and a yoohoo bottle on the floorboard

chorus
perfect song on the radio
sing along cause its one we know
its a smile its a kiss
its a sip of wine its summertime
sweet summertime

bridge
the more things change
the more they stay the same
dont matter how old you are
when you know what im talking bout
yeah baby when you got

prechorus
two bare feet on the dashboard
young love and an old ford
cheap shades and a tattoo
and a yoohoo bottle rollin on the floorboard
chorus
perfect song on the radio
sing along cause its one we know
its a smile its a kiss
its a sip of wine its summertime
sweet summertime2embed"
