heres how it goes
boy meets girl girl leaves boy
thats all i know
all ive done all my life

prechorus
cause throughout my history
ive only been with jerks
who couldnt take it
but you see the picket fence
a swing on the front porch
with us two on it

chorus
when i believe that nothing lasts forever
you stay with me keeping us together
and make me feel like i never ever wanna give you up
til now ive always been a quitter

verse 2
you rescued me
saved my life just in time
saw past all my issues and scars
and made me try
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likeprechorus 2
cause oh the way youre kissing me
makes it hard to breathe
but i still like it
ohoh it truly feels like a dream
you know exactly how i want it

chorus
when i believe that nothing lasts forever
you stay with me keeping us together
and make me feel like i never ever wanna give you up
til now ive always been a quitter

bridge
ive always been a quitter

chorus
when i believe that nothing lasts forever
you stay with me keeping us together
and make me feel like i never ever wanna give you up
til now ive always been a quitter

outro
ive always been a quitter1embed"
