verse 1 snoop dogg
every time i try to get my life together someone seems
whatcha doing tryna ruin my hopes and my dreams
push away and always go get away
and keep some grams in my pants have a hit a day

on my own cop a zone what it feeling like
transition crimination whatch you call it mack upon
do my thang with my gang put your back up on
recollect and reflect on how i used to be
im probably the same way cud cause im goin keep it g

verse 2 wiz khalifa
uh growing up i aint know as much
i was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for i was old enough
getting every dollar and fold it up
putin all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know its us
every party we showing up baggy full of prerolls
light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my rollie face filled with carrots
and niggas think they are but they know that they aint comparing
and they aint doing no harm but i dont think im really caring
i keep making deposits and no way no interference
from your broke ass i just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
and rolling weed you smell the chronic when i go past
you look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
yeah im kinda high but you should know that
