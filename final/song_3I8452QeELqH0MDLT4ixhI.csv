how many times are you gonna take it
look in my eyes
help me make this make sense
night after night night after night you sat up and cried
wondering when youre gonna see this clearer
you dont even realize
that at this very moment
youre talking to yourself in the mirror

chorus
its true
so you think im strong but youre feeling that youre weak
baby im you
but were one in the same so youre just as strong as me
baby im you
and we deserve better its time for us to leave
you know what to do
cause im not a fool
so neither are you
baby im you

verse 2
oh youre not crazy
but they finally realized that you and i is all the help you need
so why are we sitting here on the floor listen to me
we aint crying no more
i am your soul
i am your heart
my strength is yours oh my strength is yours

baby its true
so you think im strong but youre feeling that youre weak
baby im you
but were one in the same so youre just as strong as me
baby im you
and we deserve better its time for us to leave

cause im not a fool
so neither are you
baby im you

bridge
so pick yourself up right now
weve been here too long
weve overstated the love
that might have been
its been a long time gone gone
so wipe away the tears
aint nothing for us here
the time has come to move on oh
baby we deserve better
and were far too strong
to let this go on
baby im you
chorus
so you think im strong but youre feeling that youre weak

you know what to do
cause im not a fool
so neither are you
