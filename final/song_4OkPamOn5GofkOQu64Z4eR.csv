theyve sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
theyve sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry sunshine it doesnt exist
it wasnt in the top 100 list

chorus turner
and its the thousandth time that its even bolder
dont be surprised when you get bent over
they told you but you were dying for it

postchorus helders
she saw it and she grabbed it and it wasnt what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it whatever that means

verse 2 turner
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
dyou reckon that they do it for a joke
dyou reckon that they make em take an oath
that says that we are defenders of any poser
or professional pretender around

and when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced a kiss
dont concern us with your bollocks i dont want your prayer
save it for the morning after

chorus turner
and its the thousandth time that its even bolder
dont be surprised when you get bent over
they told you but you were gagging for it

bridge turner
lets have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough can i have it quicker
already thick and youre getting thicker
lets have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough can i have it quicker
already thick and youre getting thicker

outro turner
presuming that all things are equal
whod want to be men of the people
when theres people like you49embed"
