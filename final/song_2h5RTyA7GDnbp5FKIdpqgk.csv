wake up in the morning
long way from home
alarm clock is a warning
im still alone
set up for a letdown
open my eyes
new name for the same town
its no surprise

chorus
that its another rough day alright
but i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight
i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight

verse 2
wake up in the morning
another day
grey skies bring the storm in
things never change
stare out of the window
through tired eyes
so hard just to let go
its no surprise

chorus
that its another rough day alright
but i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight
i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight
you might also likebridge
tonight ill get up on that stage
and all my problems seem to go away
tonight ill get up in those lights
and i will sing my best for you tonight

chorus
no i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight
i cant wait til tonight tonight tonight tonight
i cant wait til tonightembed"
