sittin on the front porch pickin and singin
talkin all about them good ol days
back when we was just some kids
nobody gave a damn what we had to say

verse 2
well hey brother would ya look at us tonight
playin these shows to a soldout crowd
just tryin to make mom and daddy proud
they wouldnt have it any other way

chorus
seems everybody these days is blowin smoke
keep your 15 minutes give me somethin more
somethin bigger than you and me
gonna do right by our family
put a score on the board for the humble folk
all right now

verse 3
one of these days im gonna head my ass back home
and tell you that i love you gotta let you know

owe everything i have to the humble folks
gonna give it all back to the humble folks
