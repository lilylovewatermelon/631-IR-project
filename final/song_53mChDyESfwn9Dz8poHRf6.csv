verse 1
i dont really know if she cares or not
all i know is she left a lot of
stuff in my apartment
shes never getting back
as her smell on my pillow fades
her cigarettes might stay
like a roman coliseum
a dry and worthless monument to our love

chorus
ooh i still have your lighter
ooh i still have your book
ooh i still have everything you brought
but you never took
you know where to find me
and i know where to look
im not a crook

verse 2
and i dont really know if she knows or not
but i left some things in her jewelry box
and shes wearing down my rings
taking the compliments meant for me
and although i think ill miss them
at least theres proof of my existence
a captive little soldier on her fingers
deep behind enemy lines

chorus
ooh i still have your lighter
ooh i still have your book
ooh i still have everything you brought
but you never took
you know where to find me
and i know where to look
im not a crook

interlude
my copy of gravitys rainbow
that she probably didnt read
and how about my laura nyro record
she probably threw away when she moved
and how about the half box of lentils
from when i cooked her food that she probably didnt use
i wanna dedicate this jam
to all those things i left behind in girls apartments
and various domiciles over the years
sometimes you gotta leave in a hurry man what can i say
except i didnt forget about any of it
im taking it all back
