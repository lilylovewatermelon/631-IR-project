every single day i walk down the street
i hear people say baby’s so sweet
ever since puberty
everybody stares at me
boys girls i can’t help it baby
so be kind
and don’t lose your mind
just remember that i’m your baby

take me for what i am
who i was meant to be
and if you give a damn
take me baby
or leave me
take me baby or leave me

a tiger in a cage can never see the sun
this diva needs her stage baby let’s have fun
you are the one i choose
folks would kill to fill your shoes
you love the limelight too now baby
so be mine
and don’t waste my time
crying oh honey bear are you still my my my baby don’t you dare
you might also liketake me for what i am
who i was meant to be
and if you give a damn
take me baby or leave me

no way
can i be what i’m not
but hey
don’t you want your girl hot
don’t fight
don’t lose you head
cause every night who’s in your bed
who
who’s in your bed
kiss pookie

joanne
it won’t work
i look before i leap
i love margins and discipline
i make lists in my sleep baby
what’s my sin
never quit i follow through
i hate mess but i love you
what to do with my impromptu baby
so be wise
cause this girl satisfies
you got a prize so don’t compromise
you’re one lucky baby
joanne maureen
take me for what i am control freak
who i was meant to be a snob yet over attentive
and if you give a damn lovable droll geek
take me baby or leave me anal retentive

both
that’s it

joanne
the straw that breaks my back

both
i quit

joanne
unless you take it back

both
women

maureen
what is it about them

both
can’t live
with them or without them
take me for what i am
who i was meant to be who i was meant to be
and if you give a damn and if you give a damn
take me baby oh take me baby
or leave me take me or leave me
take me baby
or leave me

guess i’m leaving
i’m gone5embed"
