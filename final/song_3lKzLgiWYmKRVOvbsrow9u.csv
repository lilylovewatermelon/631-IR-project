ohhhhh
last night you said you wanted to talk wit me
i was at work and you know how my job can be
so then you said it could wait until later on
cause it wasnt really all that important
so i guess we can talk when you get home
so then you got me thinking about what ive done
wondering if i did something wrong something wrong
but then again and within this time i thought that you were mad
it couldve been something that youre just afraid to ask me

chorus
if theres anything that you want you need
dont be afraid to ask cause youre my girl
if theres anything that you want you need
dont be afraid to ask cause youre my girl

verse 2
girl dont you know my whole world stops for you
in this relationship you are the person i run to
and i appreciate how you respect my space
but on the real im there for you anytime of day
you should never start to wonder where you stand
cause each and everyday i want to show you that im your man
