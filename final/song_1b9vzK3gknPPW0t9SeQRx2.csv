if you pass a trailer with a concrete donkey in the yard and tires up on the roof
and if you see a woman in a moomoo reading tarot cards and palms down by the road
thats how you know thats how you know youre in my neighborhood

in my neighborhood theres nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
in my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
a word to the wise when they turn out the lights its a free for all yall every saturday night
but everybody treats everybody the way they should
in my neighborhood

when the wind is just right you can tell theyre making paper at the mill on champion lane
when mabel johnson goes to frying rocky mountain oysters you can smell em from a mile away
you might hear the church bells playing sweet home alabame cause the preacher loves rock and roll
thats how you know thats how you know youre in my neighborhood

in my neighborhood theres nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
in my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
a word to the wise when they turn out the lights its a free for all yall every saturday night
but everybody treats everybody the way they should
in my neighborhood

in my neighborhood theres nothing ordinary bout the regular folk
in my neighborhood we make our own wine outta berries we grow
a word to the wise when they turn out the lights its a free for all yall every saturday night
but everybody treats everybody the way they should
