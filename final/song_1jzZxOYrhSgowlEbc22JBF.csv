verse 1
im from the home of the redd foxx ced the entertainer
jettin off with brian cox ill see you later
maybe not cause i got somethin hot
in the navigator waitin in the parkin lot
a bad boy on a ride rougher than the lox
i keep em both cocked nina and sabrina
now tell me boys have you seen her have you seen her
uh nine millimeter makin niggas believers
hop out the twoseater in a vokal wife beater
levis fresh from the cleaners
heavy starch with the cuff like fuck it leave it to beaver
catch me in the galleria plaza or chesterfield
rollin down hanley hills in a black sedan deville
i used to love it when they hit me for a rocker
maybe a bopper i kept it proper
a nonstopper around the clocker
now its cool to pull up the benz and helicopter uh

wouldnt have me in a hooptie now you see me in a coupie
in front of utopia im hopin ya

thanksgiving round these parts yo we roastin ya
and when the heat come down get ghostin ya god bless us
