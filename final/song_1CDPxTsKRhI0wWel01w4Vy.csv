more than i ever did yeah thats great

verse 1
listen why they always tryna hurt me
why they always tryna burn me
i swear to god shoulda never even happened in the first place
only time you hit mes on my birthday
wish that i could tell you that i got a lot of love for you
wish that i could tell you i got trust for you
once you put some money in the bank you understand that the money aint enough for you
yeah look what its done to you
everyones your friend when the music start buzzin
im closer to the people that were there when i was nothin
tryna talk about the past but you always changin subject
i aint good at shakin hands but im good at holdin grudges
why you always frontin huh always tryna play wit me woo
yeah whatchu gotta say to me

why you actin shady on me
why you always tryna
why you always tryna play i aint got a clue right now
everything i ever wanted was someone im watching them go

verse 2
yeah you said im scared for you
lemme say a prayer for you
hope you never make it to the top just to find out there aint nothing there for you
and now the people tryna tell you that they care for you never cared for you
first time that you ever told me that you loved me i know that was probably weird for you
cause i didnt say it back im so caught up in the past and i know i wasnt fair to you woo
maybe i dont see the world like im sposed to
maybe im just living in a nightmare
maybe all the people that i thought that i was close to
wouldnt be around if it wasnt for my career
yeah this third record doesnt pop off how many people bout to drop off
i know how it works if the record doesnt work then its my fault
im in a room full of fans singin my thoughts my god woo
