yes im gonna stay with him tonight
i’ll see you in the mornin
no of course he wont drink and drive
can you say bye to mom for me
oh you’ll like him hes really kind
and hes funny like you sometimes
and i found someone i really like
maybe for the first time

prechorus
no i dont need a jacket
its not that cold tonight
and you worry i get it
but hes waitin outside

i swear on my heart that hes a good man
i know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
you held me so tight now someone else can
but you were the first man that really loved me

with tears in your eyes maybe he deserves me

that you were the first man that really loved me
