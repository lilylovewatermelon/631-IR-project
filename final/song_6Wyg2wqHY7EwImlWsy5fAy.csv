im out on the highway
just about a mile away
meet me out in the driveway
im gonna be there soon
ill swing by and pick you up
dont bother getting fixed up
me and you and this old truck
will find something to do

prechorus
no i aint got no plan in mind
its such a perfect night
so i just thought
that we could go get lost

chorus
lost down some old back road
lost in a song on the radio
lost in your deep blue eyes
i dont care if we spend all night
lost by the river cross the turnpike
somewhere near nowhere
is my favorite thing to do
wont you say girl me and you
go get a little lost
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likeverse 2
come on baby lets go
when we get there well know
no bars on the cellphone
sounds good to me
we can find us a place to park
by the water underneath the stars
and do a little fishin in the dark
if you know what i mean

prechorus
well all we needs a tank a gas
so grab that gps
and turn it off
lets go get lost

chorus
lost down some old back road
lost in a song on the radio
lost in your deep blue eyes
i dont care if we spend all night
lost by the river cross the turnpike
somewhere near nowhere
is my favorite thing to do
wont you say girl me and you
go get a little lost
bridge
no i aint got no plan in mind
and its such a perfect night
so i just thought we could get

chorus
lost down some old back road
lost in a song on the radio
lost in your deep blue eyes
i dont care if we spend all night
lost by the river cross the turnpike
somewhere near nowhere
is my favorite thing to do
wont you say girl me and you
go get a little lostembed"
