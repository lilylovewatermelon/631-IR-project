chorus
you said im stubborn and i never give in
i think youre stubborn cept youre always softening
you say im selfish i agree with you on that
i think youre giving nothing way too much in fact
i say weve only known each other a year
you say pfft ive known you longer my dear
you like to be so close i like to be alone
i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
walking with each other think well never match at all
but we do but we do dododo
but we do but we do dododo dodododo

verse
i thought i knew myself somehow you know me more
ive never known this never before

youre so adventurous im so very cautious combining
youd think we wouldnt we do but we do dododo
but we do but we do dododo dodododo
