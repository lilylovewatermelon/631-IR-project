they came along and washed my soul so easy
high above myself but i could hear them anyway
the wind is taking them away so feathery
to show them all the places they can reach
and its not too far for them to go and leave
me all alone like there is no guarantee for such a dream
and they bequeath me a black feather on the way
and i thought yes i am a dreamer and these feathers
they wont stay

chorus
and i will try
try to hold you
with my arms around your heart
even though love is going to kill me
i will try
