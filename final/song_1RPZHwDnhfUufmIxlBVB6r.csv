im no stranger to shame
ive got little to blame
you sent for me and so i came
ill come runnin when you call my name
cuz im no stranger im no stranger to shame
i said im no stranger im no stranger to shame

i might stagger and i might sway
i might stutter just a bit but thats ok
im not walkin too good thats true
i got a broke ass limp thatll pull me through
i might appear to be a pile of rags
but im a stack of hundreds in a paper bag
ive been around this world and back
i made a million bucks and put it all on black

so if you see me stumble you dont have to look away
its not the first time its not the last
you can leave me where i lay because

repeat chorus

ive been known to wake up in some dirty places
the sun only shines in deserving faces
the mind erases forget the stars
see each and every city has a corner bar
thats where i am in a world so grim
the lights are as bright as the day is dim
see im priceless in a class of my own
i used to stay out late but now i dont go home
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeso if you see me stumble you dont have to look away
its not the first time its not the last
you can leave me where i lay because

how do you feel when the birds are chirpin
when youre in bed and everybody is workin
are you down with the nonbelievers
make the slackers look like overachievers
the dogs scratchin on the door again
the cats out but he dont wanna come in
you got a bed and you got a floor
but the couch is closer to your front door

so if you see me stumble you dont have to look away
its not the first time its not the last
you can leave me where i lay because

repeat chorusembed"
