you are red and blue and green
living like a living computer glitch
you could change to anything
all you gotta do is just hit the switch
you are muscle flesh and bone
living in the land of automobiles
if you ever lose your shoes
all you gotta do is just click your heels

chorus
symmetrys overrated methinks
look at the scars all over the sphinx

bridge
do you know that when you blink
each eye winks slightly out of sync

chorus
symmetrys overrated methinks
look at the scars all over the sphinx
even the planet spins with a tilt
everybodys built like a quilt

verse 2
have you heard the awful truth
cursed asymmetricals go to hell
if you trip and lose a tooth
you gotta knock the other side out as well
gouge both eyes out and youll see
empty sockets everywhere self abyss
fill them up with mercury
so that i can see myself when we kiss
you might also likechorus
symmetrys overrated methinks
look at the scars all over the sphinx
even the planet spins with a tilt
everybodys built like a quilt

bridge
trees in the forest fall to the side
everybodys got something to hide
except for me and my suitcase full of imperfections
if the court has no objections…

chorus
symmetrys overrated methinks
look at the scars all over the sphinx
i am lopsided and so are you
nothing worth loving isnt askew4embed"
