sit around until i find something better to spend my time
but nothings appealin
nothing really lasts that long for me to realize im still alone
and youre not with me
i wonder whats inside your mind but you seem pretty occupied
so ill leave it alone
if only i could do the same share your ways and ill change the name
and make it my own

chorus
will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me
will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me

verse 2
i tried to eat i tried to sleep but everything seems boring to me
i dont know what to do
got two friends that i could see but they got two jobs and a baby
i just wanna see you
dependin on our time apart thе better the distractions arе
and there isnt a lot
only took a couple times without you here to realize
but i figured it out

will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me
will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me
will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me
will you will you will you will you
will you will you be with me
