theyll laugh as they watch us fall
the lucky dont care at all
no chance for fate
its unnatural selection
i want the truth

verse 1
i am hungry for some unrest
i want to push it beyond a peaceful protest
i wanna speak in a language that theyll understand
dedication to a new age
is this the end of destruction and rampage
another chance to erase it then repeat it again

prechorus
counter balance this commotion
were not droplets in the ocean
ocean

chorus 1
theyll laugh as they watch us fall
the lucky dont care at all
no hey chance hey for fate hey
its unnatural selection
i want the truth

prechorus
counter balance this commotion
were not droplets in the ocean

chorus 2
theyll laugh as they watch us crawl
the lucky dont share at all

instrumental break

bridge 1
try to ride out the storm
whilst theyll make you believe
that they are the special ones
we have not been chosen
guitar solo

bride 2
injustice is the norm
you wont be the first and you know you wont be the last

counter balance this commotion
were not droplets in the ocean

theyll laugh as they watch us fall
and the lucky they dont care at all
no hey chance hey for fate hey
