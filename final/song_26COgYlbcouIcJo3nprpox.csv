no one laughs at god in a hospital
no one laughs at god in a war
no ones laughing at god
when theyre starving or freezing or so very poor
no one laughs at god
when the doctor calls after some routine tests
no ones laughing at god
when its gotten real late
and their kids not back from the party yet
no one laughs at god
when their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake
no ones laughing at god
when they see the one they love hand in hand with someone else
and they hope that theyre mistaken
no one laughs at god
when the cops knock on their door and say we got some bad news sir
no ones laughing at god
when theres a famine a fire or a flood

chorus
but god can be funny
at a cocktail party when listening to a good godthemed joke or
or when the crazies say he hates us
and they get so red in the head you think theyre bout to choke
god can be funny
when told hell give you money if you just pray the right way
and when presented like a genie who does magic like houdini
or grants wishes like jiminy cricket and santa claus
god can be so hilarious

no one laughs at god in a hospital
no one laughs at god in a war
no ones laughing at god
when theyve lost all theyve got
and they dont know what for
no one laughs at god on the day they realize
that the last sight theyll ever see is a pair of hateful eyes
no ones laughing at god when theyre saying their goodbyes

chorus
but god can be funny
at a cocktail party when listening to a good godthemed joke or

and when presented like a genie who does magic like houdini

no one laughs at god in a hospital
