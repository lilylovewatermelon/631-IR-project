verse 1
feels like were floating
sail boating
and now the stars are glowing
were only knowing
but this is just a space town
soon we gotta come down

verse 2
we aint never felt this way no gravity
just a weightless sway
feels like the love we make
out on this cosmic lake
well this is just a space town
soon we gotta come down
