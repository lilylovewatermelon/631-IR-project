ill pack my things and go
if it happens again
therell be no looking back
and i wont say i told you so
i wont say i told you so

you did what you were told
and you took the strain
been left out in the cold
got yourself to blame
but believe me
if it happens again im leaving
if it stays the same im gone
when youre stabbed in the back
and theres salt in the wound
then its time to move along

if it happens again im leaving
ill pack my things and go
if it happens again
therell be no looking back
and i wont say i told you so
i wont say i told you so

no more spanners in the works
all the works been done
had your face rubbed in the dirt
on show for every one
but believe me
if it happens again im leaving
if it stays the same im gone
when compromise is the song that you sing
its been going on too long

ill pack my things and go
if it happens again
