took my officer’s life” police board proceedings 113089 pp 1925

84 on december 24 1990 the city council held christmas eve hearings chaired by finance committee chairman ed burke on the question of police torture at area 2 during which several witnesses presented numerous allegations of police torture at area 2 city council hearing 122490

85 at the chicago city council hearings held in december 24 1990 counsel for andrew wilson tendered the committee and its counsel a 21 page document entitled “fact sheet evidence of police torture by commander jon burge and his men”

86 the “fact sheet evidence of police torture by commander jon burge and his
men” which was tendered by counsel for andrew wilson to the committee and its counsel at the chicago city council hearings held on december 24 1990 listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at area 2 including aaron patterson madison hobley stanley howard and leroy orange

87 at the christmas eve hearing evidence that sa daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by superintendent brzeczek was presented and daley responded publicly with his office stating that “andrew wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations” chicago tribune 122590 “hearing examines brutality charges” chicago sun times 122590 “davis urges new review of police brutality cases”

88 the “fact sheet evidence of police torture by commander jon burge and his
men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at area 2 including aaron patterson madison hobley stanley howard and leroy orange was tendered by counsel for andrew wilson to superintendent leroy martin on or about december 19 1990

89 in a letter dated january 9 1991 ops director gayle shines wrote to counsel for andrew wilson that “superintendent martin has referred to me your letter of 19 december and the attached fact sheet”

90 the city council or its finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the december 24th torture hearings

91 on january 28 1991 amnesty international issued a report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984” and in response the spokesman for mayor daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever’” chicago sun times 12891 “police torture probe sought here”

92 on or about november 2 1990 ops director gayle shines approved as
“compelling” and forwarded to superintendent martin the 25 page report and findings made by ops investigator michael goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at area 2 this report included the following findings
as to the matter of alleged physical abuse the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic the time span involved covers more than ten years the type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture the evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to area 2 engaged in methodical abuse 20 the number of incidents in which an area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end this conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse
ops special project conclusion reports and findings and cover letter shines to martin dated november 2 1990 goldston report

93 in her forwarding memo of november 2 1990 ops director shines while
approving the conclusions of goldston and sanders further informed superintendent martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling” 11290 cover memo shines to martin with ops special project conclusion reports and findings enclosed

94 on or about november 2 1990 ops director gayle shines approved “as
compelling” and forwarded to superintendent martin the 66 page report and conclusions of ops investigator francine sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against jon burge and john yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to mr andrew wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that burge “held mr wilson while handcuffed against a hot radiator causing burns to mr wilson’s face chest and thigh” chicago police office of professional standards ops special investigative report and findings october 26 1990 sanders report pp6266

95 martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of goldston’s conclusions martin memo to shines 111890

96 at no time from receiving the goldston report in november of 1990 until he left 21 office in april of 1992 did martin ops director shines or any other city policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the goldston report

97 instead martin after waiting three months wrote shines seeking “further
clarification” concerning the goldston and sanders reports memo martin to shines 2691

98 despite all of the torture evidence contained in the goldston and sanders reports in the fact sheet and that was previously presented to martin and the city council the city and martin did not seek the prosecution of burge and his confederates in the wilson case for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the goldston report or to prosecute burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the
evidence presented including the patterson and madison hobley cases

99 in her april 30 1991 memorandum to martin shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by martin and informed him that the ops findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation” shines memo 43091

100 with her april 30 1991 memorandum to superintendent martin ops director
shines included investigator goldston’s clarification memo in which goldston set forth that his investigation established that area 2 detectives and supervisors jon burge john byrne peter dignan charles grunhard john yucaitis thomas mckenna and patrick o’hara were “players”
whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse” goldston memo of 43091 attached to shines memo to martin of the same date

101 after waiting an additional seven months in november of 1991 superintendent leroy martin approved the findings set forth in the chicago police office of professional 22 standards ops special investigative report and findings dated october 26 1990 sanders report burge and yucaitis were administratively charged by the cpd for abusing andrew wilson in the manner found in the report and separation proceedings were initiated before the
chicago police board cr 123543 reopened

102 however after secret communications with corporation counsel kelly welch which the city still refuses to produce martin refused to accept or adopt the goldston findings open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of area 2 torture to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers but rather contacted the police foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by goldston in arriving at his findings martin letter to williams 11891 city privilege log

103 during this time period community groups including citizen’s alert by letters and in face to face meetings were demanding that martin release the results of the ops investigation into torture at area 2 powers letter to martin 81491

104 instead martin through his lawyers at the corporation counsel’s office fought production and public release of the goldston report and its findings see generally proceedings in fallon v dillon 90 c 6722

105 in november of 1991 after defendant martin and corporation counsel kelly
welsh had initiated proceedings before the police board to fire burge yucaitis and o’hara for torturing andrew wilson mayor daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982 explaining that   wilson refused to cooperate with his office at that time” chicago tribune 112691 “3 cops face hearing in torture case” 23

106 on or about february 7 1992 the goldston and sanders were publicly released over the city’s strenuous objection pursuant to the order of judge milton shadur in the case of fallon v dillon 90c6722

107 in an article which appeared in the february 8 1992 chicago tribune
superintendent leroy martin whgo was one of the previous area 2 commanders was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture chicago tribune “13 years of cop torture alleged” february 8 1992

108 in the same article mayor richard m daley was quoted as saying of the report “these are only allegations    not substantiated cases” as defending martin’s suppression of the report stating “it’s allegations rumors stories things like that” and of denying that the torture
at area 2 was “systematic” chicago tribune 2892 “13 years of cop torture alleged” los angeles times 2892 “chicago police used torture report says”

109 in their memorandum in opposition to motion to bar testimony concerning
other alleged victims of police misconduct filed on january 22 1992 before the police board in the matter of charges filed against respondents jon burge john yucaitis and patrick o’hara cases  185658 specially appointed city of chicago lawyers on behalf of chicago police superintendent leroy martin and the city of chicago made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at area ii
headquarters” the testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by andrew wilson the testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents burge yucaitis and o’hara to torture certain suspects often with substantial criminal records into confessing to crimes
or to condone such activity 24 memorandum in opposition to motion to bar testimony concerning other alleged victims of police misconduct p 1

110 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of superintendent leroy martin and the city of chicago identified the “seven
additional victims of torture tactics at area ii headquarters” as melvin jones anthony holmes
george powell donald white shadeed mumin leroy orange and lawrence poree id pp 7
14
111 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of martin and the city made the following judicial admission    that the similar acts
testimony of melvin jones anthony holmes george powell donald white shadeed mumin
leroy orange and lawrence poree
is highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects
to elicit statements respondents burge yucaitis and o’hara’s methods of torture
through electric shock bagging and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that
sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes in addition the
testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways
to elicit confessions to violent crimes
id p 17
112 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of martin and the city judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of melvin
jones anthony holmes george powell donald white shadeed mumin leroy orange and
lawrence poree
clearly establishes respondents’ burge yucaitis and o’hara’s motive and intent in
torturing or condoning the torture of wilson respondents generally engaged in these
similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime
id p 22 25
113 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of martin and the city judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of melvin
jones anthony holmes george powell donald white shadeed mumin leroy orange and
lawrence poree
shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at area ii prior to
and subsequent to wilson’s arrest and burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use
of the devices it is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the
bagging technique about which respondents deny knowing and the technique of putting
a gun to the head of a victim
id p 24
114 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of martin and the city made the following judicial admission
there is no question that the similarities between andrew wilson’s testimony
and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard
burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases and when he was
not the principal he was still involved in the case of all but one of the victims the
victim was picked up and taken to area ii where he was then interrogated regarding his
knowledge or involvement in a serious offense although donald white was taken
instead to area i he was taken there and interrogated by area ii detectives all of the
victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories
also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with
consequences if they refused to make a statement after an initial refusal the
punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the
refusals to speak persisted the most striking similarities however are found in the
methods of torture used on the suspects wilson was electro shocked by yucaitis using
the black box and by burge who used the black box and a curlingiron looking device
was “bagged” and beaten and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth jones
holmes poree powell and orange were similarly electro shocked by burge holmes
powell white and mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or
almost lost consciousness burge pointed a cocked gun at jones’s head hit poree in the
head with a pistol and placed a revolver containing one bullet at mumin’s head and
snapped it three times slowly white had a gun placed in his mouth additionally each
of the victims was slapped around and punched
burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar burge told both jones
and mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his as he did in relation
to wilson he referred to the absence of marks on mumin’s body he said “fun time” as 26
he approached wilson and poree with the black box and laughed when he bagged
mumin he told wilson he would “fry his black ass” and jones he would “blow his
black head off”
as the case law cited above aptly demonstrates these actions or the condoning of
these actions are overwhelming in their similarity
id pp 2526
115 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of chicago police superintendent leroy martin and the city of chicago made the
following judicial admission
given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the
similar victims will testify there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time
to be relevant to this case taking the offenses in sequence they reveal a pattern of
almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes
while the sequence spans twelve years each offense is close enough to the next to
connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior moreover melvin jones’ and donald
white’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before andrew
wilson was tortured
id p 28
116 in their memorandum in opposition specially appointed city of chicago lawyers
on behalf of leroy martin and the city of chicago judicially admitted
indeed as the testimony of the similar victims shows respondents burge yucaitis and
o’hara counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict
when they persisted in their pattern of torture
id p 28
117 in a document filed in the case of wilson v city of chicago jon burge patrick
o’hara and john yucaitis 86c2360 entitled “city of chicago’s memorandum in response
to plaintiff andrew wilson’s motion for summary judgment” the city through its lawyers
made the following judicial admission
plaintiff andrew wilson has testified that he was beaten kicked punched burned by
being harnessed to a radiator and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands face ears and 27
between his legs by defendant police officers plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that
this outrageous conduct unsanctioned and condemned by the city and for which
defendant officers were fired andor disciplined was within the defendants’ scope of
employment

118 in a document filed in the case of wilson v city of chicago 86c2360 entitled
“city of chicago’s memorandum in response to plaintiff andrew wilson’s motion for
summary judgment” the city through its lawyers made the following judicial admission
the instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant
officers were not in the scope of their employment plaintiff has failed to furnish any
evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him   the black
box device and the modified curling iron   were furnished by the city
id p 17
119 in its memorandum in response to plaintiff andrew wilson’s motion for
summary judgment” the city through its lawyers made the judicial admission that
burge “cruelly tortured” andrew wilson and “denied him necessary medical
assistance”
id p 19
120 in this memorandum the city through its lawyers made the following admission
concerning it change of position from defending burge for his alleged torture of andrew wilson
to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of burge’s
employment “the change in the city’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the
city in good faith and in the public interest” id p 12
121 on july 30 1992 almost two years after superintendent martin had first received
the goldston findings the police foundation submitted its report to superintendent of police
matt rodriguez after noting that because “hangings shockings ‘baggings’ beatings chokings
and beatings were alleged to occur many in the area 2 headquarters itself a thorough and
rigorous investigation seemed required” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture
alleged had in fact took place the report criticized goldston’s methodology police foundation 28

their roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while
assigned to detective division area 2 the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were

by accepting all cases even erring on the liberal side to be accommodative to the
public ops gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints the opposite
occurs the appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process
and endless unnecessary reviews for all actually operates to immunize police
from internal discipline increases their overtime leads to an enormous “paper storm”
and has institutionalized lying

360 in jones v city of chicago 856 f 2d 985 7th cir 1987 the seventh circuit 76
court of appeals affirmed a jury verdict against area 2 violent crimes detectives supervisors
and commanding officers including detectives james houtsma dennis mcguire john mccabe
and raymond mcnally sgt alvin palmer lt griffith and commander milton deas for
conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old george jones for a 1981 murder stating
we cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the
individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to
railroad george jones
jones v city of chicago 856 f 2d at 992
361 in jones v city of chicago the seventh circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the
city of chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of
18 year old george jones for a 1981 murder stating
the custom in question is the maintenance of the street files police
files withheld from the states attorney and therefore unavailable as a
source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute
or failing that would at least be available to defense counsel under
brady v maryland 373 us 83 10 l ed 2d 215 83 s ct 1194 1963 as
we noted recently information undermining the credibility of a government
witness is within the scope of bradys rule see united states v
herreramedina 853 f2d 564 slip op at 5 7th cir 1988
although the lawfulness of the streetfiles practice has never been
adjudicated the city which has abandoned the practice does not challenge
the jurys implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process
of law brady v maryland does not require the police to keep written
records of all their investigatory activities but attempts to circumvent
the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files
deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be
tolerated the city sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in
this court
there is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files
played a role in joness misfortunes cf harris v city of pagedale 821
f2d 499 507 8th cir 1987 if the states attorney had had 996
access to them he would have discovered memos by kelly and especially by
laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause alternatively defense 77
counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have
ended even sooner than it did the only question is whether this custom was
a custom of the city of chicago as the custom was departmentwide
and of long standing the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been
consciously approved at the highest policymaking level for decisions
involving the police department  the standard suggested by the recent
plurality opinion in city of st louis v praprotnik 485 us 112 108 s

587 in a letter dated august 2 1999 from citizens alert addressed to superintendent
terry hillard ops director callie baird and police board president demitrius carney the
signators wrote
we write as a group of public officials citizens and organizations concerned with
police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several
office of professional standards ops investigations into police torture and to open
investigations in numerous other torture cases where no ops investigations have been
conducted we further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the
obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain ops
and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the ops
august 2 1999 letter from citizens alert mary powers et al to hillard carney and baird
588 in the august 2 1999 letter the signators further wrote 113
recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the
ops reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior ops
findings that physical abuse of african american suspects at area 2 from 1973 to 1986
included psychological techniques and planned torture was systematic and
methodical and that area 2 command members particularly jon burge were aware
of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or
failing to take any action to bring it to an end goldston report pp 23 the now public
evidence further reveals that ops investigators tillman lawrence and cosey conducted
thorough investigations in each of these cases discovered new evidence not available
during the initial investigations and sustained findings in six of the cases the sustained
findings included findings that victims were electric shocked suffocated with a plastic
bag suspended in air by their handcuffs beaten and stomped and racially abused the
evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police
officers who were and are still chicago police officers in good standing most notably
lieutenant peter dignan who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him
in five of the six cases the evidence further reveals that these findings and the
investigative files were tendered to ops director gayle shines in 1994 for her review
and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995 at
the same time that peter dignan was nominated by the mayor and the department for
merit promotion to lieutenant ms shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500
sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as director she
overturned a total of 10 cases including these four against dignan
the evidence further shows that in the other two cases darrell cannon and stanley
howard ms shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture but
rather kept these files in her office for four years together with the other seven files
cannon who was on trial in a murder case and howard who is on death row sought
these files by subpoena but shines and the department failed to produce these files
which contained highly exculpatory evidence furthermore after ms shines left the ops
in 1998 counsel to the superintendent thomas needham obtained the nine torture files
from the ops and without consultation with the superintendent summarily reversed the
sustained findings and closed the cases needham who as a longtime assistant state’s
attorney was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims including
cannon admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on
the merits of the cases but rather on the fact that the files had languished in shines’
office for so long a period of time the superintendent never reviewed these cases on the
merits as he is required by police procedure to do and he only learned of his counsel’s
unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a february 1999 chicago tribune article
additionally the public evidence reveals that the ops failed to investigate numerous
additional documented cases of police torture against african american suspects in the
case of melvin jones mary powers of citizen’s alert specifically requested by a letter
dated july 26 1989 that the ops open an investigation into the recently revealed
allegations that jones was electric shocked at by jon burge and several other area 2
detectives who remain on the force to this day contrary to police and ops procedure no
investigation was ever opened despite the fact that the city has subsequently admitted in 114
official court papers that jones was in fact tortured similarly in the shadeed mumin
case an investigation was opened and ops investigators developed compelling new
evidence that he was tortured by burge and an unidentified detective just as the ops
investigator was about to identify this officer the ops discontinued the investigation
supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number
in numerous other cases including aaron patterson and nine other men who are
presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from
them the ops has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious
allegations
id
589 in the august 2 1999 letter the signators made the following demands
1 given ms shines’ clear misconduct lack of objectivity and failure to complete her
review of the cannon and howard sustained findings that new ops director callie
baird conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture
cases
2 if ms baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings that the
superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits as he is required by
police procedure to do
3 that counsel thomas needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or
otherwise participating in any torture investigations
4 that peter dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were
entered by ops investigators be suspended pending complete review
5 that the department and its ops open an investigation into the allegations that melvin
jones was electric shocked by jon burge and other still active detectives and consider
in making its findings that the city has admitted that jones was in fact tortured
6 that the department and its ops reopen and complete the shadeed mumin
investigation
7 that the department and its ops open investigations into the other numerous
documented cases of police torture as listed in the appendix attached hereto
including those allegations made by men on death row
8 that the department commission an independent investigation into the serious
violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and ops
officials including thomas needham and gayle shines
9 that the department and the ops director meet with representatives from the
undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the
progress of these investigations
10that these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny

facts   ” “city considered suing burge officials weighed their options to fight growing
uproar over torture allegations against the fired police commander” chicago tribune
42904
597 mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum given and
georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative
publicity about burge and the city’s role in the torture scandal id
598 given and georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide
variety of reasons including that some of burge’s men were still on the police force the
department had been embarrassed by needham’s unilateral shelving of the ops torture
investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings and that the tribune’s then recent
series on the continuing cpd practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention
on the issue and given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion
after a long public expensive and embarrassing discovery process” nbc5com chicago
tribune
599 instead of suing burge or otherwise distancing the city from him the city decided 117
to invest unlimited public funds in representing burge and at least thirtyfive other area 2
detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and
public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the city’s central role in the
torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the special prosecutor id
600 on august 27 2004 in his sworn testimony before the prisoner review board
former area 2 commander and superintendent leroy martin falsely denied that he did not have
contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against jon burge and other
area 2 detectives while he was commander tr of 82704 parole revocation hearing of darrell
cannon
601 in her concurring opinion in hinton v uchtman sub nomf 3d  7th cir
2005 seventh circuit court of appeals judge diane wood found
the claim hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the
high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant a
cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched    a mountain of
evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the area two station
of the chicago police department during the exact time period pertinent to
hintons case eventually as this sorry tale came to light the office of
professional standards investigation of the police department looked into the
allegations and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the
command of lt jon burge — the officer in charge of hintons case — had been a
regular part of the system for more than ten years and in language reminiscent
of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious abu ghraib facility in iraq
the report said that the type of abuse described was not limited to the usual
beating but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and
planned torture the report detailed specific cases such as the case of andrew
wilson who was taken to area two on february 14 1982 there a group led by
burge beat wilson stuffed a bag over his head handcuffed him to a radiator and
repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears nose and genitals see people

police though not until 1992 see in the matter of the charges filed against jon
burge no 911856 chicago police board february 11 1993 to this day
burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions though it appears that he

editorial hal dardick burge repeatedly takes 5th former police commander
stays mum on torture questions chi tribune sept 2 2004 noting allegations
that burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 black and latino suspects
between august 1972 and september 1991   
behavior like that attributed to burge imposes a huge cost on society it
creates distrust of the police generally despite the fact that most police officers
would abhor such tactics and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in
which the problem officer played a role indeed the alleged conduct is so
extreme that if proven it would fall within the prohibitions established by the
united nations convention against torture cat which defines torture as
any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession    thereby violating the fundamental
human rights principles that the united states is committed to uphold   embed"
