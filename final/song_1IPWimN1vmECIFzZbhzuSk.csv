and for what except for you do i feel love
do i press the extremest book of the wisest man
close to me hidden in me day and night
in the uncertain light of single certain truth
equal in living changingness to the light
in which i meet you in which we sit at rest
for a moment in the central of our being
the vivid transparence that you bring is peace

it must be abstract

i

begin ephebe by perceiving the idea
of this invention this invented world
the inconceivable idea of the sun

you must become an ignorant man again
and see the sun again with an ignorant eye
and see it clearly in the idea of it

never suppose an inventing mind as source
of this idea nor for that mind compose
a voluminous master folded in his fire
how clean the sun when seen in its idea
washed in the remotest cleanliness of a heaven
that has expelled us and our images   

the death of one god is the death of all
let purple phoebus lie in umber harvest
let phoebus slumber and die in autumn umber

phoebus is dead ephebe but phoebus was
a name for something that never could be named
there was a project for the sun and is

there is a project for the sun the sun
must bear no name gold flourisher but be
in the difficulty of what it is to be


ii

it is the celestial ennui of apartments
that sends us back to the first idea the quick
of this invention and yet so poisonous

are the ravishments of truth so fatal to
the truth itself the first idea becomes
the hermit in a poet’s metaphors
who comes and goes and comes and goes all day
may there be an ennui of the first idea
what else prodigious scholar should there be

the monastic man is an artist the philosopher
appoints man’s place in music say today
but the priest desires the philosopher desires

and not to have is the beginning of desire
to have what is not is its ancient cycle
it is desire at the end of winter when

it observes the effortless weather turning blue
and sees the myosotis on its bush
being virile it hears the calendar hymn

it knows that what it has is what is not
and throws it away like a thing of another time
as morning throws off stale moonlight and shabby sleep


iii

the poem refreshes life so that we share
for a moment the first idea    it satisfies
belief in an immaculate beginning
and sends us winged by an unconscious will
to an immaculate end we move between these points
from that everearly candor to its late plural

and the candor of them is the strong exhilaration
of what we feel from what we think of thought
beating in the heart as if blood newly came

an elixir an excitation a pure power
the poem through candor brings back a power again
that gives a candid kind to everything

we say at night an arabian in my room
with his damned hooblahooblahooblahow
inscribes a primitive astronomy

across the unscrawled fores the future casts
and throws his stars around the floor by day
the wooddove used to chant his hooblahoo

and still the grossest iridescence of ocean
howls hoo and rises and howls hoo and falls
life’s nonsense pierces us with strange relation


iv

the first idea was not our own adam
in eden was the father of descartes
and eve made air the mirror of herself

of her sons and of her daughters they found themselves
in heaven as in a glass a second earth
and in the earth itself they found a green—

the inhabitants of a very varnished green
but the first idea was not to shape the clouds
in imitation the clouds preceded us

there was a muddy centre before we breathed
there was a myth before the myth began
venerable and articulate and complete

from this the poem springs that we live in a place
that is not our own and much more not ourselves
and hard it is in spite of blazoned days

we are the mimics clouds are pedagogues
the air is not a mirror but bare board
coulisse brightdark tragic chiaroscuro

and comic color of the rose in which
abysmal instruments make sounds like pips
of the sweeping meanings that we add to them


v

the lion roars at the enraging desert
reddens the sand with his redcolored noise
defies red emptiness to evolve his match

master by foot and jaws and by the mane
most supple challenger the elephant
breaches the darkness of ceylon with blares

the glittergoes on surfaces of tanks
shattering velvetest faraway the bear
the ponderous cinnamon snarls in his mountain

at summer thunder and sleeps through winter snow
but you ephebe look from your attic window
your mansard with a rented piano you lie

in silence upon your bed you clutch the corner
of the pillow in your hand you writhe and press
a bitter utterance from your writhing dumb

yet voluble of dumb violence you look
across the roofs as sigil and as ward
and in your centre mark them and are cowed   

these are the heroic children whom time breeds
against the first idea—to lash the lion
caparison elephants teach bears to juggle


vi

not to be realized because not to
be seen not to be loved nor hated because
not to be realized weather by franz hals

brushed up by brushy winds in brushy clouds
wetted by blue colder for white not to
be spoken to without a roof without

first fruits without the virginal of birds
the darkblown ceinture loosened not relinquished
gay is gay was the gay forsythia

and yellow yellow thins the northern blue
without a name and nothing to be desired
if only imagined but imagined well

my house has changed a little in the sun
the fragrance of the magnolias comes close
false flick false form but falseness close to kin

it must be visible or invisible
invisible or visible or both
a seeing and unseeing in the eye

the weather and the giant of the weather
say the weather the mere weather the mere air
an abstraction blooded as a man by thought


vii

it feels good as it is without the giant
a thinker of the first idea perhaps
the truth depends on a walk around a lake

a composing as the body tires a stop
to see hepatica a stop to watch
a definition growing certain and

a wait within that certainty a rest
in the swags of pinetrees bordering the lake
perhaps there are times of inherent excellence

as when the cock crows on the left and all
is well incalculable balances
at which a kind of swiss perfection comes

and a familiar music of the machine
sets up its schwärmerei not balances
that we achieve but balances that happen

as a man and woman meet and love forthwith
perhaps there are moments of awakening
extreme fortuitous personal in which

we more than awaken sit on the edge of sleep
as on an elevation and behold
the academies like structures in a mist


viii

can we compose a castlefortresshome
even with the help of violletleduc
and see the maccullough there as major man

the first idea is an imagined thing
the pensive giant prone in violet space
may be the maccullough an expedient

logos and logic crystal hypothesis
incipit and a form to speak the word
and every latent double in the word

beau linguist but the maccullough is maccullough
it does not follow that major man is man
if maccullough himself lay lounging by the sea

drowned in its washes reading in the sound
about the thinker of the first idea
he might take habit whether from wave or phrase

or power of the wave or deepened speech
or a leaner being moving in on him
of greater aptitude and apprehension

as if the waves at last were never broken
as if the language suddenly with ease
said things it had laboriously spoken


ix

the romantic intoning the declaimed clairvoyance
are parts of apotheosis appropriate
and of its nature the idiom thereof

they differ from reason’s clickclack its applied
enflashings but apotheosis is not
the origin of the major man he comes

compact in invincible foils from reason
lighted at midnight by the studious eye
swaddled in revery the object of

the hum of thoughts evaded in the mind
hidden from other thoughts he that reposes
on a breast forever precious for that touch

for whom the good of april falls tenderly
falls down the cockbirds calling at the time
my dame sing for this person accurate songs

he is and may be but oh he is he is
this foundling of the infected past so bright
so moving in the manner of his hand

yet look not at his colored eyes give him
no names dismiss him form your images
the hot of him is purest in the heart


x

the major abstraction is the idea of man
and major man is its exponent abler
in the abstract than in his singular

more fecund as principle than particle
happy fecundity florabundant force
in being more than an exception part

though an heroic part of the commonal
the major abstraction is the commonal
the inanimate difficult visage who is it

what rabbi grown furious with human wish
what chieftain walking by himself crying
most miserable most victorious

does not see these separate figures one by one
and yet see only one in his old coat
his slouching pantaloons beyond the town

looking for what was where it used to be
cloudless the morning it is he the man
in that old coat those sagging pantaloons

it is of him ephebe to make to confect
the final elegance not to console
nor sanctify but plainly to propound



it must change

i

the old seraph parcelgilded among violets
inhaled the appointed odor while the doves
rose up like phantoms from chronologies

the italian girls wore jonquils in their hair
and these the seraph saw had seen long since
in the bandeaux of the mothers would see again

the bees came booming as if they had never gone
as if hyacinths had never gone we say
this changes and that changes thus the constant

violets doves girls bees and hyacinths
are inconstant objects of inconstant cause
in a universe of inconstancy this means

nightblue is an inconstant thing the seraph
is satyr in saturn according to his thoughts
it means the distaste we feel for this withered scene

is that it has not changed enough it remains
it is a repetition the bees come booming
as if—the pigeons clatter in the air

an erotic perfume half of the body half
of an obvious acid is sure what it intends
and the booming is blunt not broken in subtleties


ii

the president ordains the bee to be
immortal the president ordains but does
the body lift its heavy wing take up

again an inexhaustible being rise
over the loftiest antagonist
to drone the green phrases of its juvenal

why should the bee recapture a lost blague
find a deep echo in a horn and buzz
the bottomless trophy new hornsman after old

the president has apples on the table
and barefoot servants round him who adjust
the curtains to a metaphysical t

and the banners of the nation flutter burst
on the flagpoles in a redblue dazzle whack
at the halyards why then when in golden fury

spring vanishes the scraps of winter why
should there be a question of returning or
of death in memory’s dream is spring a sleep

this warmth is for lovers at last accomplishing
their love this beginning not resuming this
booming and booming of the newcome bee


iii

the great statue of the general du puy
rested immobile though neighboring catafalques
bore off the residents of its noble place

the right uplifted foreleg of the horse
suggested that at the final funeral
the music halted and the horse stood still

on sundays lawyers in their promenades
approached this stronglyheightened effigy
to study the past and doctors having bathed

themselves with care sought out the nerveless frame
of a suspension a permanence so rigid
that it made the general a bit absurd

changed his true flesh to an inhuman bronze
there never had been never could be such
a man the lawyers disbelieved the doctors

said that as keen illustrious ornament
as a setting for geraniums the general
the very place du puy in fact belonged

among our more vestigial states of mind
nothing had happened because nothing had changed
yet the general was rubbish in the end


iv

two things of opposite natures seem to depend
on one another as a man depends
on a woman day on night the imagined

on the real this is the origin of change
winter and spring cold copulars embrace
and forth the particulars of rapture come

music falls on the silence like a sense
a passion that we feel not understand
morning and afternoon are clasped together

and north and south are an intrinsic couple
and sun and rain a plural like two lovers
that walk away as one in the greenest body

in solitude the trumpets of solitude
are not of another solitude resounding
a little string speaks for a crowd of voices

the partaker partakes of that which changes him
the child that touches takes character from the thing
the body it touches the captain and his men

are one and the sailor and the sea are one
follow after o my companion my fellow my self
sister and solace brother and delight


v

on a blue island in a skywide water
the wild orange trees continued to bloom and to bear
long after the planter’s death a few limes remained

where his house had fallen three scraggy trees weighted
with garbled green these were the planter’s turquoise
and his orange blotches these were his zero green

a green baked greener in the greenest sun
these were his beaches his seamyrtles in
white sand his patter of the long seaslushes

there was an island beyond him on which rested
an island to the south on which rested like
a mountain a pineapple pungent as cuban summer

and làbas làbas the cool bananas grew
hung heavily on the great banana tree
which pierces clouds and bends on half the world

he thought often of the land from which he came
how that whole country was a melon pink
if seen rightly and yet a possible red

an unaffected man in a negative light
could not have borne his labor nor have died
sighing that he should leave the banjo’s twang


vi

bethou me said sparrow to the crackled blade
and you and you bethou me as you blow
when in my coppice you behold me be

ah ké the bloody wren the felon jay
kéké the jugthroated robin pouring out
bethou bethou bethou me in my glade

there was such idiot minstrelsy in rain
so many clappers going without bells
that these bethous compose a heavenly gong

one voice repeating one tireless chorister
the phrases of a single phrase kéké
a single text granite monotony

one sole face like a photograph of fate
glassblower’s destiny bloodless episcopus
eye without lid mind without any dream—

these are of minstrels lacking minstrelsy
of an earth in which the first leaf is the tale
of leaves in which the sparrow is a bird

of stone that never changes bethou him you
and you bethou him and bethou it is
a sound like any other it will end


vii

after a luster of the moon we say
we have not the need of any paradise
we have not the need of any seducing hymn

it is true tonight the lilacs magnify
the easy passion the everready love
of the lover that lies within us and we breathe

an odor evoking nothing absolute
we encounter in the dead middle of the night
the purple odor the abundant bloom

the lover sighs as for accessible bliss
which he can take within him on his breath
possess in his heart conceal and nothing known

for easy passion and everready love
are of our earthy birth and here and now
and where we live and everywhere we live

as in the topcloud of a may nightevening
as in the courage of the ignorant man
who chants by book in the heat of the scholar who writes

the book hot for another accessible bliss
the fluctuations of certainty the change
of degrees of perception in the scholar’s dark


viii

on her trip around the world nanzia nunzio
confronted ozymandias she went
alone and like a vestal longprepared

i am the spouse she took her necklace off
and laid it in the sand as i am i am
the spouse she opened her stonestudded belt

i am the spouse divested of bright gold
the spouse beyond emerald or amethyst
beyond the burning body that i bear

i am the woman stripped more nakedly
than nakedness standing before an inflexible
order saying i am the contemplated spouse

speak to me that which spoken will array me
in its own only precious ornament
set on me the spirit’s diamond coronal

clothe me entire in the final filament
so that i tremble with such love so known
and myself am precious for your perfecting

then ozymandias said the spouse the bride
is never naked a fictive covering
weaves always glistening form the heart and mind


ix

the poem goes from the poet’s gibberish to
the gibberish of the vulgate and back again
does it move to and fro or is it of both

at once is it a luminous flittering
or the concentration of a cloudy day
is there a poem that never reaches words

and one that chaffers the time away
is the poem both peculiar and general
there’s a meditation there in which there seems

to be an evasion a thing not apprehended or
not apprehended well does the poet
evade us as in a senseless element

evade this hot dependent orator
the spokesman at our bluntest barriers
exponent by a form of speech the speaker

of a speech only a little of the tongue
it is the gibberish of the vulgate that he seeks
he tries by a peculiar speech to speak

the peculiar potency of the general
to compound the imagination’s latin with
the lingua franca et jocundissima


x

a bench was his catalepsy theatre
of trope he sat in the park the water of
the lake was full of artificial things

like a page of music like an upper air
like a momentary color in which swans
were seraphs were saints were changing essences

the west wind was the music the motion the force
to which the swans curveted a will to change
a will to make iris frettings on the blank

there was a will to change a necessitous
and present way a presentation a kind
of volatile world too constant to be denied

the eye of a vagabond in metaphor
that catches our own the casual is not
enough the freshness of transformation is

the freshness of a world it is our own
it is ourselves the freshness of ourselves
and that necessity and that presentation

are rubbings of a glass in which we peer
of these beginnings gay and green propose
the suitable amours time will write them down

it must give pleasure

i

to sing jubilas at exact accustomed times
to be crested and wear the mane of a multitude
and so as part to exult with its great throat

to speak of joy and to sing of it borne on
the shoulders of joyous men to feel the heart
that is the common the bravest fundament

this is a facile exercise jerome
begat the tubas and the firewind strings
the golden fingers picking darkblue air

for companies of voices moving there
to find of sound the bleakest ancestor
to find of light a music issuing

whereon it falls in more than sensual mode
but the difficultest rigor is forthwith
on the image of what we see to catch from that

irrational moment its unreasoning
as when the sun comes rising when the sea
clears deeply when the moon hangs on the wall

of heavenhaven these are not things transformed
yet we are shaken by them as if they were
we reason about them with a later reason


ii

the blue woman linked and lacquered at her window
did not desire that feathery argentines
should be cold silver neither that frothy clouds

should foam be foamy waves should move like them
nor that the sexual blossoms should repose
without their fierce addictions nor that the heat

of summer growing fragrant in the night
should strengthen her abortive dreams and take
in sleep its natural form it was enough

for her that she remembered the argentines
of spring come to their places in the grape leaves
to cool their ruddy pulses the frothy clouds

are nothing but frothy clouds the frothy blooms
waste without puberty and afterward
when the harmonious heat of august pines

enters the room it drowses and is the night
it was enough for her that she remembered
the blue woman looked and from her window named

the corals of the dogwood cold and clear
cold coldly delineating being real
clear and except for the eye without intrusion


iii

a lasting visage in a lasting bush
a face of stone in an unending red
redemerald redslittedblue a face of slate

an ancient forehead hung with heavy hair
the channel slots of rain the redrosered
and weathered and the rubywaterworn

the vines around the throat the shapeless lips
the frown like serpents basking on the brow
the spent feeling leaving nothing of itself

redinred repetitions never going
away a little rusty a little rouged
a little roughened and ruder a crown

the eye could not escape a red renown
blowing itself upon the tedious ear
an effulgence faded dull cornelian

too venerably used that might have been
it might and might have been but as it was
a dead shepherd brought tremendous chords from hell

and bade the sheep carouse or so they said
children in love with them brought early flowers
and scattered them about no two alike


iv

we reason of these things with later reason
and we make of what we see what we see clearly
and have seen a place dependent on ourselves

there was a mystic marriage in catawba
at noon it was on the midday of the year
between a great captain and the maiden bawda

this was their ceremonial hymn anon
we loved but would no marriage make anon
the one refused the other one to take

foreswore the sipping of the marriage wine
each must the other take not for his high
his puissant front nor for her subtle sound

the shooshooshoo of secret cymbals round
each must the other take as sign short sign
to stop the whirlwind balk the elements

the great captain loved the everhill catawba
and therefore married bawda whom he found there
and bawda loved the captain as she loved the sun

they married well because the marriageplace
was what they loved it was neither heaven nor hell
they were love’s characters come face to face


v

we drank meursault ate lobster bombay with mango
chutney then the canon aspirin declaimed
of his sister in what a sensible ecstasy

she lived in her house she had two daughters one
of four and one of seven whom she dressed
the way a painter of pauvred color paints

but still she painted them appropriate to
their poverty a grayblue yellowed out
with ribbon a rigid statement of them white

with sunday pearls her widow’s gayety
she hid them under simple names she held
them closelier to her by rejecting dreams

the words they spoke were voices that she heard
she looked at them and saw them as they were
and what she felt fought off the barest phrase

the canon aspirin having said these things
reflected humming an outline of a fugue
of praise a conjugation done by choirs

yet when her children slept his sister herself
demanded of sleep in the excitements of silence
only the unmuddled self of sleep for them


vi

when at long midnight the canon came to sleep
and normal things had yawned themselves away
the nothingness was a nakedness a point

beyond which fact could not progress as fact
thereon the learning of the man conceived
once more night’s pale illuminations gold

beneath far underneath the surface of
his eye and audible in the mountain of
his ear the very material of his mind

so that he was the ascending wings he saw
and moved on them in orbits’ outer stars
descending to the children’s bed on which

they lay forth then with huge pathetic force
straight to the utmost crown of night he flew
the nothingness was a nakedness a point

beyond which thought could not progress as thought
he had to choose but it was not a choice
between excluding things it was not a choice

between but of he chose to include the things
that in each other are included the whole
the complicate the amassing harmony


vii

he imposes orders as he thinks of them
as the fox and snake do it is a brave affair
next he builds capitols and in their corridors

whiter than wax sonorous fame as it is
he establishes statues of reasonable men
who surpassed the most literate owl the most erudite

of elephants but to impose is not
to discover to discover an order as of
a season to discover summer and know it

to discover winter and know it well to find
not to impose not to have reasoned at all
out of nothing to have come on major weather

it is possible possible possible it must
be possible it must be that in time
the real will from its crude compoundings come

seeming at first a beast disgorged unlike
warmed by a desperate milk to find the real
to be stripped of every fiction except one

the fiction of an absolute—angel
be silent in your luminous cloud and hear
the luminous melody of proper sound


viii

what am i to believe if the angel in his cloud
serenely gazing at the violent abyss
plucks on his strings to pluck abysmal glory

leaps downward through evening’s revelations and
on his spredden wings needs nothing but deep space
forgets the gold centre the golden destiny

grows warm in the motionless motion of his flight
am i that imagine this angel less satisfied
are the wings his the lapishaunted air

is it he or is it i that experience this
is it i then that keep saying there is an hour
filled with expressible bliss in which i have

no need am happy forget need’s golden hand
am satisfied without solacing majesty
and if there is an hour there is a day

there is a month a year there is a time
in which majesty is a mirror of the self
i have not but i am and as i am i am

these external regions what do we fill them with
except reflections the escapades of death
cinderella fulfilling herself beneath the roof


ix

whistle aloud too weedy wren i can
do all that angels can i enjoy like them
like men besides like men in light secluded

enjoying angels whistle forced bugler
that bugles for the mate nearby the nest
cock bugler whistle and bugle and stop just short

red robin stop in your preludes practicing
mere repetitions these things at least comprise
an occupation an exercise a work

a thing final in itself and therefore good
one of the vast repetitions final in
themselves and therefore good the going round

and round and round the merely going round
until merely going round is a final good
the way wine comes at a table in a wood

and we enjoy like men the way a leaf
above the table spins its constant spin
so that we look at it with pleasure look

at it spinning its eccentric measure perhaps
the manhero is not the exceptional monster
but he that of repetition is most master


x

fat girl terrestrial my summer my night
how is it i find you in difference see you there
in a moving contour a change not quite completed

you are familiar yet an aberration
civil madam i am but underneath
a tree this unprovoked sensation requires

that i should name you flatly waste no words
check your evasions hold you to yourself
even so when i think of you as strong or tired

bent over work anxious content alone
you remain the more than natural figure you
become the softfooted phantom the irrational

distortion however fragrant however dear
that’s it the more than rational distortion
the fiction that results from feeling yes that

they will get it straight one day at the sorbonne
we shall return at twilight from the lecture
pleased that the irrational is rational

until flicked by feeling in a gildered street
i call you by name my green my fluent mundo
you will have stopped revolving except in crystal

soldier there is a war between the mind
and sky between thought and day and night it is
for that the poet is always in the sun

patches the moon together in his room
to his virgilian cadences up down
up down it is a war that never ends

yet it depends on yours the two are one
they are a plural a right and left a pair
two parallels that meet if only in

the meeting of their shadows or that meet
in a book in a barrack a letter from malay
but your war ends and after it you return

with six meats and twelve wines or else without
to walk another room    monsieur and comrade
the soldier is poor without the poet’s lines

his petty syllabi the sounds that stick
inevitably modulating in the blood
and war for war each has its gallant kind

how simply the fictive hero becomes the real
how gladly with proper words the soldier dies
if he must or lives on the bread of faithful speech3embed"
