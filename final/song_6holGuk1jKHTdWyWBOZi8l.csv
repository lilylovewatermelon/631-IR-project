if only we could fly
limp bizkit style
john otto take em to the mathews bridge
can you feel it
my gggeneration get up
my gggeneration are you ready

verse 1
do you know where you are
welcome to the jungle punk take a look around
its limp bizkit fuckin up your town
we downloaded the shockwave
for all the ladies in the cave to get your groove on
and maybe im the one
who flew over the cuckoos nest but guess whos next
generation x generation strange
sun dont even shine through our window pane

prechorus
so go ahead and talk shit talk shit about me
go ahead and talk shit about my gggeneration

chorus
cause we dont dont give a fuck and
we wont ever give a fuck until you
you give a fuck about me and my generation

hey kid take my advice
you dont want to step into a big pile of shit
captains drunk your world is titanic
floating on the funk so get your groove on
and maybe i am just a little fucked up
lifes just a little fucked up
generation x generation strange
sun dont even shine through our window pane

prechorus
so go ahead and talk shit talk shit about me
go ahead and talk shit about my gggeneration

chorus
cause we dont dont give a fuck and
we wont ever give a fuck until you

cause we dont dont give a fuck and
we wont ever give a fuck until you
you give a fuck about me and my generation
