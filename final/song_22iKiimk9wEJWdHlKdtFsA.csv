lay down your arms
i dont wanna fight anymore
rough seas will be calm
hold on while we weather the storm

prechorus
we fall down like dogs playing dead
but our loves not worth playing chicken with

chorus
im not discarding you like broken glass
there are no winners when the die is cast
theres only tears when its the final dance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance

verse 2
this too shall pass
were right where were meant to be
theres things i dont ask
what i dont know cant hurt me

prechorus
we fall down like dogs playing dead
but our loves not worth playing chicken with

im not discarding you like broken glass
there are no winners when the die is cast
theres only tears when its the final dance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
im not discarding you like broken glass
there are no winners when the die is cast
theres only tears when its the final dance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
im not discarding you like broken glass
there are no winners when the die is cast
theres only tears when its the final dance
so dont give up its just young lovers romance
dont give up its just young lovers romance
dont give up its just young lovers romance
