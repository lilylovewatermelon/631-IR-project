i called you again
i dont know why i keep on
thinking that were friends
cause we dont really talk anymore
and im sorry for that
honestly i never really loved you that bad

chorus
and i could be the end of it
but i never know when to stop talking
so i make my bed and sleep in it alone
cause i never know when were done talking
if i dont love you then why

verse 2
did i call you again
i think that i was lonely
and i missed having friends
now we dont really talk anymore
and its good for us both
cause i know you love me the most

chorus
and i should be the end of it
but i never know when to stop talking
so i make my bed and sleep in it alone
cause i never know when were done talking
and i should be the end of it
but i never know when to stop talking when to stop talking
so i make my bed and sleep in it alone
cause i never know when were done talking
youre better off on your own
you might also likebridge
but you called me again
i dont know why it never seems to end
now we dont really talk anymore
and it makes sense
cause all i do is hurt you
all i do is hurt you
all i do is cause you pain

outro
cause i called you againembed"
