many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs marijuana and alcohol
listen stop trying to be somebody else
dont try to be someone else
be yourself and know that thats good enough
dont try to be someone else
dont try to be like someone else dont try to act like someone else
be yourself be secure with yourself
rely and trust upon your own decisions
on your own beliefs
you understand the things that ive taught you
not to drink alcohol not to use drugs
dont use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive
when people become weedheads
they become sluggish lazy stupid and unconcerned
sluggish lazy stupid and unconcerned
thats all marijuana does to you okay this is mom
unless youre taking it under doctors um control
then its regulated
do not smoke marijuana do not consume alcohol
do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
this is mom call me byeyou might also like40embed"
