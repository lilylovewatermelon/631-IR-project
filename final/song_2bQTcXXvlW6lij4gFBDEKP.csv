in my ol common labor shoes
i turned the world all which a way
just because you asked me to

like unto no other feel
simple love is simple true
theres no end to what id do
just because you asked me to

let the world call me a fool
but if things are right with me and you
thats all that matters
and ill do anything you asked me to

knowing how much i love you
and after all that ive been through
id turn and walk away from you
just because you asked me to
lord i hope youll never do

let the world call me a fool
but if things are right with me and you
thats all that matters
and ill do anything you asked me toyou might also likeembed"
