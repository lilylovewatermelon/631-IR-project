for the love of god will you bite your tongue
before we make you swallow it
its moments like this where silence is golden golden
and then you speak
no one wants to hear you
no one wants to see you
so desperate and pathetic im begging you to spare me
the pleasure of your company

prechorus
when did the diamonds leave your bones

chorus
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake

postchorus

no one wants to hear you save your breath
no one wants to see you
so desperate and pathetic you think that no one sees this
i think its time you knew the truth yeah

chorus
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake

bridge
when did the diamonds leave your bones
leave your bones

breakdown
youre not a shepherd youre just a sheep
a combined effort of everyone you meet
youre all flesh with no bone
feed em to the sharks and throw em to the wolves
chorus
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake
im burning down every bridge we made
ill watch you choke on the hearts you break
im bleeding out every word you said
go to hell for heavens sake
