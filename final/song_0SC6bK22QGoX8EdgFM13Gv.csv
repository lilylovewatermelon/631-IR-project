and you be lovin on the wrong one wrong one wrong one

verse isaiah rashad
my daddy taught me how to drink my pain away
my daddy taught me how to leave somebody
my daddy taught me how to smoke my load and go
my daddy taught me you dont need nobody
so one time for the caged bird
and one time for the real niggas
and slow dance on the j√§ger
and one time for the little niggas

hook isaiah rashad
i aint eatin in the morn i be sippin on the henny henny
you been lookin for the wrong one wrong one wrong one
aint thinkin bout your love i be shittin on your feelings feelings
