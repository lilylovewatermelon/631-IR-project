and theres hundreds of mothers there waitin for me
i saw the mistress and her mate mate mate
but theres hundreds of lovers inside her body

and theres hundreds of mothers there to come and love me
i saw your reflection in my face face face so i scrubbed it all around until it erased

and theres hundreds of mothers there waitin for meyou might also likeembed"
