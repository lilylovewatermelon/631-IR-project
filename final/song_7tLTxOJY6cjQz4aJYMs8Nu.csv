im running low on serotonin
chemical imbalance got me twisting things
stabilize with medicine
theres no depth to these feelings
dig deep cant hide
from the corners of my mind
im terrified of whats inside

verse 1
i get intrusive thoughts
like cutting my hands off
like jumping in front of a bus
like how do i make this stop
when it feels like my therapist hates me
please dont let me go crazy
put me in a field with daisies
might not work but ill take a maybe
oh been breaking daily
but only me can save me
so im capitulating crying likе a fucking baby
i dont wanna miss it bada
i dont wanna be sick ahda
i dont labadehdehbadеh

verse 2
i get intrusive thoughts
like burning my hair off
like hurting somebody i love
like does it ever really stop
when theres control i lose it
incredibly impulsive
so scared im gonna end up doing something stupid
but i try to contain it
oh it gets so draining
its like my heart is failing
every night im contemplating
my inner voice is saying tough
so i try to brush it off
yeah i try to brush it off

chorus
im running low on serotonin
chemical imbalance got me twisting things
stabilize with medicine
but theres no depth to these feelings
dig deep cant hide
from the corners of my mind
im terrified of whats inside

jeg følte liksom flere ganger at hjertet mitt slutta å slå at og sånn at
eller som jeg fortalte at jeg ble helt sånn tung og rar i kroppen47embed"
