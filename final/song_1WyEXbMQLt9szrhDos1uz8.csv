brothers hands
this time it’s in brothers hands
baby are you satisfied
is this all that you had in mind

chorus
on the square
live a life that isnt there
square it up
call me once you’ve had enough

verse 2
brothers hands
feel the grip of brothers hands
maybe its been rectified
locked outside and left to die

chorus
on the square
live a life that isnt there
square it up
call me once youve had enough
on the square
live a life that isnt there
square it up
call me once youve had enoughyou might also like7embed"
