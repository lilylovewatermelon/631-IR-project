verse 1
alright sir
sure ill have another one its early
three olives shake it up i like it dirty dirty
tequila for my friend it makes her flirty flirty
trust me
im the instigator of underwear
showing up here and there uhoh oh no
im always on a mission from the get go get go
so what if its only one oclock in the afternoon
its never too soon to send out all the invitations to the last night of your life

chorus
lordy lordy lordy
i cant help it i like to party its genetic
its electrifying
wind me up and watch me go
where she stops nobody knows
a good excuse to be a bad influence on you
and you and you
and you and you
and you and you
and you and you
and you and you
and you and you
and you and you

alright maam maam
calm down i know your son said he was at my house my house
he was the captain of the football team but i turned him out
he wasnt the first and he wont be the last so tone it down
this happens all the time
im a story they tell the alibi
they wanna go home i ask them why
its daylight not night
they might need a break from all the real life get a life
it gets to be too much sometimes
its never too late to send out all the invitations to the last night of your life

chorus
lordy lordy lordy
i cant help it i like to party its genetic
its electrifying
