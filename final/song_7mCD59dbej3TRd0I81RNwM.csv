we used to spend our friday nights
underneath them downtown lights
you with your friends and me with mine
shooting shots and getting gone
well that all changed with that first kiss
yeah one of them things that you cant forget
settled on down and you moved in
it made this house more like a home

chorus
now its champagne kissing
while i spin you round the kitchen
its as good as good is getting kinda thing
now its sunday morning tangled up
under covers making love
in rhythm with the tin roof rain
there aint nothin nothin nothin
nothing bout loving you id change
change change

verse 2
these days wе dont go too far
got everything we need right whеre we are
went from yours to mine and now its ours
and i wouldnt trade it for nothing
even if i hardly see my friends
and they hit me up like where you been
im sorry guys im stayin in
and honestly i love it
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likechorus
now its champagne kissing
while i spin you round the kitchen
its as good as good is getting kinda thing
now its sunday morning tangled up
under covers making love
in rhythm with the tin roof rain
there aint nothin nothin nothin
nothing bout loving you id change
change change

instrumental break  guitar solo

bridge
there you were walking in
perfect strangers when we met
turned to lovers as the time moved on
we were wild we were crazy
we were reckless we were babies
now were out here raising one of our own

chorus
champagne kissing
while i spin you round the kitchen
its as good as good is getting kinda thing
now its sunday morning tangled up
under covers making love
in rhythm with the tin roof rain
there aint nothin nothin nothin
no there aint nothin nothin nothin
nothing bout loving you id change
change change ooh oohooh ooh
aint nothing bout loving you id change
change change
aint nothing bout loving you id changeembed"
