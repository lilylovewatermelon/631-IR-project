verse 1
for you there might be a brighter star
but through my eyes the light of you is all i see
for you there might be another song
but all my heart can hear is your melody

chorus
so long ago my heart without demanding
informed me that no other love could do
but listen did i not though understanding
fell in love with one who would break my heart in two

verse 2
for you love might bring a toast of wine
but with each sparkle know the best for you i pray
woah for you love might be for you to find
but i will celebrate our love of yesterday

chorus
so long ago my heart without demanding
informed me that no other love could do
but listen did i not though understanding
i fell in love with one who would break my heart in two woah woah
you might also likeverse 3
woah for you there might be another star
but through my eyes the light of you is all i see
woah for you there might be another song
but in my heart your melody will stay with me oh
