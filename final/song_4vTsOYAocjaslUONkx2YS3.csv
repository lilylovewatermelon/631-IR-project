i woke up to another mess in the living room
broken bottles all around my feet
they came again in the night under crescent moon
didnt wake me in my sleep

prechorus 1
cause they talk and drink and laugh bout things
and fall in love in my backyard
i hide and cower in the corner
conversations getting hard
cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
and nobody seems to care bout anything i think
and nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
in the background screaming everybody look at me

chorus
and im fading away you know i used to be on fire
and im fading away you know i used to be on fire
im standing in the ashes of who i used to be
and im fading away you know i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire fire

verse 2
i used to be a darling starlet like a centerpiece
had the whole world wrapped around my ring
i flew too closely to the sun thats setting in the east
and now im melting from my wings

cause id laugh and drink and talk bout things
and fall in love in my backyard
now it´s my own anxiety
that makes the conversation hard
cause nobody seems to ask about me anymore
and nobody ever cares bout anything i think
and nobody seems to recognize me in the crowd
in the background screaming everybody look at me

chorus
and im fading away you know i used to be on fire
and im fading away you know i used to be on fire
im standing in the ashes of who i used to be
but im fading away you know i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire
well i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire

outro
you know i used to be on fire
you know i used to be on fire fire24embed"
