but one thing i can count on
a friend is good when your backs against the wall
and ive known them for so long
if i never saw the light of tomorrow
i would hold no regrets
i wouldnt want any sadness or sorrow
this is as good as it getsid die for you
youd die for me

and you know id die for you
and i know you feel the same
after all that weve been through
in lifes fucked up games
and if i never breathed again
i wouldnt change a thing
cause you know i die for you
and i know you feel the sameverse
even when i feel i cant go on
and the worlds pushing me down
and all those time i knew that i was wrong
theyve picked me up off the cold ground
i cant explain what they all mean to me
to them im in debt
its not just bros its a fucking family
an that you can not forgetid die for you
youd die for me
you might also likeim thank full and grateful
that in this life that im able
to find a family other than my own
and to get though this life
and not to do it on my own
and if i never breathed again
i wouldnt change a thing
cause you know id die for youembed"
