raging in the spring
rushing down a mountain
fast as anything
well if you can picture that wild water
that would be her
only deeper

have you ever seen an eagle
soaring high above the trees
circling the world below
the epitamy of free
well you could imagine how i feel when im beside her
only higher

im flyin
im fallin
im floatin and all i wanna do is hold her
closer and spend every day that passes
thinkin of new ways to love her more
if youve never had a vision
of what a perfect love would be
just close your eyes and dream a dream that just gets sweeter
and that would be her
