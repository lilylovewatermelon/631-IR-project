we are the pain
we are the shame
weve gone insane
inside where no ones around

prechorus
i am to blame
for everything
i like this game that you all make me play

chorus
im done being there for others
they have their pain and so do i
dont need to feel it all over
i try to hold on and you bring me down

verse 2
we are estranged
we are deranged
i cant explain
how you all break me apart

prechorus
i am to blame
for everything
i like this game that you all make me play

im done being there for others
they have their pain and so do i
dont need to feel it all over
i try to hold on and you bring me down

bridge
we wait we hate
we try to get away
mistake my pain
it has been let astray
im looking around
i drop to the ground
why does this have to end this way
feeling numb so long
oh god its just everything
its everything
now i pray for all of them to go away

chorus
im done being there for others
they have their pain and so do i
dont need to feel it all over
i try to hold on and you bring me down1embed"
