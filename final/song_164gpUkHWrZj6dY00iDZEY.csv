i hit the horn and keep going
cause you niggas aint talkin bout shit

i cant wait to see if she loyal
cant wait to see if she a squirter
for you niggas that canâ€™t wait to rob me
i got niggas that cant wait to murder
king t im your highness
niggas dont wanna take it to violence
the same way i act out in public
is the same way i act while in private
i can not go to the club
if i cant get in with my fire
and 30 bottles of the finest
and watch the money get to flying

verse 2
when i wanna talk about nothing
take me a lil break from the money
ima come holler at yall
matter fact leave me your number
and when im tired thumbin through hunnids
when im sick of running up commas
ima come see what yall on ima let your bitch know when im coming
these niggas aint fucking with me
nigga that aint no money to me
nigga i blow all of that shit when i go it aint comin with me
i was in st louis aint talkin missouri and 2 had a hundred on me
thats a lil big homie touch em at two you wont make it to 3
i was with all of the shooters when i heard it was money on me
i was around the hitman when i found out it was money on me
either these niggas dont know what they doin or they scared to go for the kill
we know they know what they doin them niggas just know what it is
