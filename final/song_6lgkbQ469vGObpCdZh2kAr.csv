dont know why he does what he does
playing lost and found with your love
trying to confuse you use you
girl hes going to lose you sure enough
dont know why he says all those things
always shooting down all your dreams
he ought to know better than that
he ought to be watching his back
cause you know you know

chorus
girl id love to shine in your eyes
if only for just a moment
girl id be satisfied
if i could only touch your cheek
baby thats all id need
to make my life complete
girl i know i can make you smile
if you knew that i was here
wishing that i could just be your tear

verse 2
i dont know why he canâ€™t find the words
saying all those things you deserve
girl if it was me there i swear
you know you wouldnt have to feel so unsure
about what tomorrow would bring
dont you know id give everything
if i could just hold you like him
if i could be more than just friends
cause you know you know
