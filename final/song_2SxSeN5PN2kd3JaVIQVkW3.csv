i’m tired of pretending
gently you cut me the blade leaves a sting
the pain is unrelenting
there is nothing left beneath the skin
my heart bleeds underneath a skeleton

your voice in the breeze carries ominously
i need you to release me
suffering so deeply if only i could
disappear completely
there is nothing left beneath the skin
my heart bleeds underneath a skeleton
this wound’s too deep
if i sleep
will you think of me
this wound’s too deep
when you sleep
will you dream of meyou might also like1embed"
