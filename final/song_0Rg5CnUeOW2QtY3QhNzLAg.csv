verse 1
ive seen a man cry ive seen a man die inside
ive seen him say to me that he he is only mine
that he gotta do what is best for him
never let me in not even begin
to tell me im the one under his moon and sun
that i am the thing that revolves around him
but while on top of him i know whats best for him
ill show him how to win
