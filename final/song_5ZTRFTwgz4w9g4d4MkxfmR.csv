he hadnt told his kids he hadnt told his wife
made plans to leave it all leave it all behind that night
he had his car gassed up he had his suitcase packed
he planned to hit the road hit it hard and not look back
he made it 40 miles outta town
and turned on that radio and turned that car around

chorus
thats the power of a song
and it grabs you by the heart
its gonna find you when it wants to
no matter where you are
thats the miracle of music
loves the only thing as strong
that can move you when you hear it
thats the power the power of a song

verse 2
his voice inside her head said youre not strong enough
but in her heart she knows that love shouldnt hurt that much
knew what her future held like in the back of his hand
she tried a hundred times but she couldnt leave that man
she made it 40 miles out of town
and turned up that radio and never turned that car around
