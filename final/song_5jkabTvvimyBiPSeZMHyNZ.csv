odd one youre never alone
im here and i will reflect you
both of us basically unattached to anything or anyone
unless were pretending
you live your life in your head
some call it imagination
id rather focus instead on anything
except what im feeling
what im feeling
odd one

chorus
hey its gonna be okay
hey were gonna laugh at this one day

verse 2
odd one i wish i was you
youre never concerned with acceptance
we are all desperately seeking out and fitting in
with anyone who will accept us
but not you odd one

chorus
hey its gonna be okay
hey were gonna laugh at this one day
you might also likehey its gonna be okay
hey were gonna laugh at this one day

outro
dont let someone tell you youre no one
dont let someone tell you youre no one odd oneembed"
