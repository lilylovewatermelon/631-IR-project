you could say im a little bit crazy
you could call me insane
walking around with all these whispers
running around here in my brain
i just cant help but hear em
man i cant avoid it i hear voices
i hear voices

chorus
like my dad saying work that job
but dont work your life away
and momma telling me to drop some cash
into the offering plate on sunday
and granddad saying you can have a few
but dont ever cross that line
yeah i hear voices all the time

verse 2
turns out im pretty dang lucky
for all that good advice
those hard to find words of wisdom
hold up here in my mind
and just when i lost my way
or i got too many choices i hear voices
i hear voices
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
like my dad saying quit that team
and youll be a quitter for the rest of your life
and momma telling me to say a prayer
every time i lay down at night
and grandma saying if you find the one
you better treat her right
yeah i hear voices all the time

bridge
sometimes i try to ignore them
but i thank god for them
cause they made me who i am

chorus
my dad saying work that job
but dont work your life away
and momma telling me to drop some cash
in the offering plate on sunday
and granddad saying you can have a few
but dont ever cross that line
yeah i hear voices all the time

outro
yeah i hear voices all the time
all the timeembed"
