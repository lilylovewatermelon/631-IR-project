i cant help that i like to be kissed
and i wouldnt mind if my name changed to mrs
this is one side my conventional side
an attraction to tradition
my vintage disposition
my sincere architecture
and i want to cook him dinner
but im more indecisive than ever
and who believes in forever

chorus 1
who will be the one to marry me

verse 2
a girl in the world barking up the wrong tree
a creature conditioned to employ matrimony
crumbling continuity i pick up the pieces
the ceremony makes me zealous as the past quickly ceases
fear from being neutered
im now prude now defensive
quickly im altered and tempted by new love only rented

chorus 2
do you believe youll marry me
you might be the one to marry me
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likebridge
back looking back looking back at me
im not how i used to be im not how i used to be
take me back take me back into history
diamond ring tie me down tie me down just like it used to be
tie me down how it used to be
im not how i used to be
im not how i used to be

chorus 3
who will be the one to marry me
who will be the one to marry me

outro
looking back looking back at me how i used to be
im not how i used to be im not how i used to be
take me back back into history
diamond ring tie me down just like it used to be
marry me marry me
forever and ever and ever and ever
happily ever after happily ever after
happily ever after happily ever after
something old something new
something borrowed something blue
here comes the bride
all dressed in white
here comes the bride
all dressed in white
something old something new
something borrowed something blue
its pretty when im faithful
mmm and ever ever ever ever
forever and ever
forever and ever
forever and ever and ever and ever
happily ever after
happily ever afterembed"
