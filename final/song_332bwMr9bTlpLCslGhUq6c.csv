no one to help me
no one knows
not that anyone who knew would care

dangling
hanging from your tree
am i an ornament of longing
a seed trapped inside the shell that is me
nobody can save me
from this
from myself
hurricane of head space
spinning circle
stacking up the walls that hide you from myself
crumbling pieces of me
an offering to you
falling gifts from me to you
left nothing for myself
you had my cake and ate it too
and left nothing for me

fist
for breaking
these eyes
for seeing
right through
heart
for you to trample
confidence lost
nothing to lose
nothing to gain
from this loss
this right of passage denied
holding the headstone
tied to no one
loosen the knot
pulling the string
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likelosing
feels like im losing all my worth
no one to notice
no one would care
if they took the time to stop and stare

nobody has the time for me
for myself
blistering pieces of me
im giving them to you
these sweet whispers are from me to you
want nothing for myself

you hold my world inside your hands
and leave nothing for me

fist
for breaking
these eyes
for seeing
right through
heart
for you to trample
confidence lost
nothing to lose
nothing to gain
from this loss
this right of passage denied
holding the headstone
tied to no one
loosen the knot
pulling the string
so sorry
for whatever it was ive done
so im deserting
sincerely
me

got to just be
youve got to just know
ive got to leave
its time for me to go

so heres the note
ive left the key
i hope that when you find this
ive left you with a happy ending

goodbye
goodbye
goodbye

fist
for breaking
these eyes
for seeing
right through
heart
for you to trample
confidence lost
nothing to lose
nothing to gainembed"
