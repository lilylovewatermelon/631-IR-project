i never thought itd end this way
lost the passion got the pain
and every time i hear your name
it simply doesnt hit the same
what happens when the colors fade
butterflies they fly away
and every time i hear your name
it simply doesnt hit the same

verse 1
run it up
count up the bands and run it up
im out of love
i throw in the towel im out of love
we touchin the magic is gone
and i hatе all our favorite songs
i swear i tried singin along
but еverything bout it feels wrong

but i cant shake the way that im feeling
like when somethings droppin from the ceiling
like were broken dont know how to heal it
can you feel it can you feel it

and every time i hear your name oh
