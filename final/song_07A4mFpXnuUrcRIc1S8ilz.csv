she got a bad reputation
she takes the long way home
and all of my friends seen her naked
or so the story goes
mistakes we all make them
but they wont let it go oh no
cause shes got a bad reputation
but i know what they dont

chorus
and i dont care what they say about you baby
they dont know what youve been through
trust me i could be the one to treat you like a lady
let me see whats underneath
all i need is you

verse 2
she got a bad reputation
nobody gets too close
a sight of a soul when its breakin
makin my heart grow cold
and into the deeper shes sinkin
im beggin her please dont let go
shes got a bad reputation
but shes all that all i want though
