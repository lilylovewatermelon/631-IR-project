i woke up this mornin
and heard the tv sayin somethin
about disaster in the world and
it made me wonder where im goin

dont slip dont slip
cause a nigga might push up on it
dont really wanna lose this moment
why window shop
when you own this
dont play around
i wanna lay you down
i want you know ohhhhh

chorus chris brown  keri hilson

dont know what youre doing to me with your love
im feeling all superhuman you did that to me
a superhuman heart beats in me
nothing can stop me here with you
