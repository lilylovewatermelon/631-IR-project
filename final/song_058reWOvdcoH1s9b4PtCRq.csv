maybe i deserved it maybe not
well i pushed it all down and i tried to forget
but it hurts so much living with regret

i see your face in my dreams at night
i wake in tears and i cry with spite
woman you broke me in ways that youll never know
and everyone tells me to let it go

ive been holding on for so long
and i dont know how else to live
well i want to hate you still but god knows i never will
move on with my life unless i forgive

its easy to hold on to the pain you feel
forgiveness aint еasy but thats how you heal
bitterness promisеs relief through revenge
but love is medicine to make amends

ive been holding on for so long
and i dont know how else to live
well i want to hate you still but god knows i never will
move on with my life unless i forgive

ive been holding on for so long
and i dont know how else to live
