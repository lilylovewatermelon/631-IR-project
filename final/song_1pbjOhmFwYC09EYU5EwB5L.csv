verse 1
damn pretty girl you went and done it again
youve gone and turned your sexy all the way up to 10
ive never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
baby you rock hit the spot like a fireball shot
youve got me all high head spinning around and around
im down if youre down to burn down this town

chorus

radio edit version get your little fine self on the step shimmy up inside
just slide girl by my side girl
yeah we can run this town i can rock your world
we can roll em down fog em up cruise around get stuck
