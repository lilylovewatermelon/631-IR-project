and then i crashed into you
and i went up in flames
couldve been the death of me
but then you breathed your breath in me
and i crashed into you
like a runaway train
you will consume me but i cant walk away

i just wanted to know how it felt
too strong i couldnt hold on

out of how and why this happened
where were headed theres just no knowing
