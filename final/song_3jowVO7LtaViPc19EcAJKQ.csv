boys shine their trucks at the super wash station
spin them tire wet wheels on the pavement
done with that paycheck makin
twelveinch kickers get to shakin
them girls get to paintin on denim and makeup
pourin titos in a route 44 cup
in between city limit signs
on any given friday night

chorus
boys chase girls goin thirty miles an hour
circle up at the dairy queen
later on the wild gets louder
like a rural route movie scene
in the nowhere dust fallin in love underneath an endless sky
pick a map dot town thats how it goes down
on any given friday night

verse 2
rickys at the red light rockin that randall
suzies sittin shotgun drinkin out the handle
sight for sore small town eyes
on any given friday night

chorus
boys chase girls goin thirty miles an hour
circle up at the dairy queen
later on the wild gets louder
like a rural route movie scene
in the nowhere dust fallin in love underneath an endless sky
pick a map dot town thats how it goes down
on any given friday night
on friday night

bridge
theres a fire in a field a jack and a jill
holdin hands on a high hill side
some gas in a tank a jenny and a jake
on any given friday night

chorus
boys chase girls goin thirty miles an hour
circle up at the dairy queen
later on the wild gets louder
like a rural route movie scene
in the nowhere dust fallin in love underneath an endless sky
pick a map dot town thats how it goes down
on any given friday night
pick a map dot town thats how it goes down
on any given friday night
