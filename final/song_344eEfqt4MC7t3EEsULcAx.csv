leaving you all behind
and that ain’t no fuckin’ lie

i am the mastermind
it’s just a problem of mine
just like columbine

columbine
your time has come
kiss it all goodbye

what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus comin’ through the night
that’s right
this message cannot be denied

i am the mastermind
underline mastermind
until your pencil breaks

i am the mastermind
and just like a suicide
your credit has been denied
you might also likedenied
your time has come
kiss it all goodbye

what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus comin’ through the night
that’s right
this shit gonna turn your momma white
oh pennsylvania
i wish i never ever would

i am the mastermind
intelligent by design
it makes me wanna cry

i am the mastermind
and now that i’m satisfied
it’s time to say goodbye
goodbye
your time has come
kiss it all goodbye

what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus
what’s that ruckus comin’ through the night
that’s right
i will not apologizeembed"
