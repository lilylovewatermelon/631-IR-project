im full of regret
for all things that i have done and said
and i dont know
if itll ever be ok to show my face around here
sometimes i wonder if i disappear

prechorus
would you ever turn your head and look
see if im gone
cause i fear

chorus
there is nothing left to say to you
that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
i dont know how i got so tangled up

verse 2
youre just innocent
a helpless victim of a spiders web
and im an insect
goin after anything that i can get

prechorus
so you better turn your head and run
and dont look back
cause i fear

there is nothing left to say to you
that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful
oh
and ive done you so wrong
treated you bad
strung you along
oh shame on myself
i dont know how i got so tangled up

instrumental break

chorus
there is nothing left to say to you
that you wanna hear
that you wanna know
i think i should go
the things ive done are way too shameful
oh
and ive done you so wrong
treated you bad
strung you along
oh shame on myself
i dont know how i got so tangled upembed"
