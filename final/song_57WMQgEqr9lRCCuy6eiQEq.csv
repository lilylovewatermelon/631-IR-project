the ghosts have given up familiar haunts have had enough
too much thought will give you doubt now they found you
its safer in a cage they can tell you what to say
all your dreams come with a price so they own you
but what did you expect
was it too much to protect
did you understand they had selfish intentions
when they were pulling you in opposite directions

chorus
you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
we are the override
we are the override

verse 2
the dead dont know the dead are lonely a fascination fades
when this mercy execution says its over
you follow as preferred now their plans are undeterred
who can bring them in to supersede its over
even hate starts out as love
sometimes when its all you want
maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
when all thats left is the emotion you abandoned

you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
we are the override
we are the override

verse 3
you clawed out from nothing and i sent you back
fought to the metal and laws what you lacked
covered in sores you cannot be the one
you are the answer to why we have risen

bridge
you are not the way
you are judged to be afraid
you are simple and unchanged
we believe you should give up
give up give up give up give up
satisfaction will take you for granted
when all thats left is a life you abandoned

chorus
you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
you dont know the hell thats coming
everybody get on the ground
we are the override
we are the override
