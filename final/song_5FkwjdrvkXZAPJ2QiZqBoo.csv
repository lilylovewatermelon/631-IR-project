verse 1 thorough
well i was broke down and out sitting at the house
two blunts see wit the third blunt hanging out my mouth
thinking bout how these no clout niggas feel they got cash
and guess a nigga want smooth
get they ass but pass me the mass and the mag uh huh

he had plush pads from coast to coast
happy capping ass nigga who love to boast
so i post at the strip club the trick site
cause i know thats where he spend most of his nights
im right outside when this fool gonna leave the spot
430 in da morning we headed out the parking lot
trailed him up the block made a left at the stop sign
lame ass nigga rolling solo in a 99
at the red light i pulls up on the right
put two up in his heart hes another armed robbery

verse 2 gillie da kid
lets get this money run in the crib cock your hammer
nigga move then you pop your hammer

copped two bricks today from cous so we gonna have to git up
so i kicked the door in he had a hoe in fuck position
must be knowing about me cause wasnt no type resistence
told the bitch to shut the fuck up
handcuffed her boy must have wanted to fuck her cause he pulled out a rubber
i said no time for that smacked her wit the gat now we back on track
