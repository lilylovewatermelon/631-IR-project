you came here to welcome me
to what is the end
you said if we werent in love
wed still be best friends
we both tell the same jokes
over and over
wonder if well get married

and lets cheers to me

i like your songs even though
theyre not about me
sometimes im scared to show my dad
cause youre always cussing

chorus
and lets cheers to you
and lets cheers to me
and lets cheers to you
and lets cheers to me
