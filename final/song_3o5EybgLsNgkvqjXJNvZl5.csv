could you love somebody like that
could you attract someone like that
could you go where people cant see someone like me
could you do that

make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me

if youre hating me do it honestly

bringing out the green in your eyes
a perfect disguise for envy and pride

face me
make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me
you can judge me love me
if youre hating me do it honestly
