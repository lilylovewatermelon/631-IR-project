im finding out how hot an old flame can burn
youre a feeling i havent forgot a love i cant unlearn
youve become a memory i cant live without
youll always be a fire i cant put out

chorus
i dont know how to handle the dream you left behind
its like a lighted candle burning up my mind
at least im happy knowing what love is all about
youll always be a fire i cant put out

verse 2
embers to ashes thats how it should be
youd think by now my heart would know that it could set you free
the things ive tried the tears ive cried i guess theres no doubt
youll always be a fire i cant put out

chorus
i dont know how to handle the dream you left behind
its like a lighted candle burning up my mind
at least im happy knowing what love is all about
youll always be a fire i cant put out
