in a world thats full of hope why am i alone
had this feeling so long my serotonins gone
even when i get high why do i feel so low
never good at goodbyes i hold on
i hate the man i see when i see myself
a reflection of hell

chorus
i told myself it’s different it’s so hard to believe
i know that i won’t change so i sold another dream
all the lives i told are burning holes inside
and i don’t i don’t know why
i broke a promise to myself

verse 2
as i stand here again all covered in mud
and i’m drenched in my sins
what have i become
i said the last time that would be my last time
not good at goodbyes i hold on
if i jumped off this ledge would you catch my fall
would you care at all

chorus
i told myself it’s different it’s so hard to believe
i know that i won’t change so i sold another dream
all the lives i told are burning holes inside
and i don’t i don’t know why
i broke a promise to myself
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likebridge
all the stages of shaken
all the roads that i’ve taken
wondering if i can really make it
feeling so depressed i’ve been humbled and humiliated
all the truth i’ve mistaken for the things i thought saved me
it’s like nobody knows
at any given second i feel like i might explode

chorus
i told myself it’s different it’s so hard to believe
i know that i won’t change so i sold another dream
all the lives i told are burning holes inside
and i don’t i don’t know why
i broke a promise to myselfembed"
