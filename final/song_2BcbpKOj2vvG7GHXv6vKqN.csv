verse 1 kanye west
i met this girl when i was three years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she said excuse me little homie i know you dont know me but
my name is windy and i like to blow trees and
from that point id never blow her off
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to tow em off
and make em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown
in the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
i told her in my heart is where shell always be
she never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye keep makin that keep makin that platinum and gold for me

verse 2 kanye west
but if you really cared for her
then you wouldntve never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her
but when i talk to her it always seems like she talkin bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got til its gone
i guess thats why im here and i cant come back home
and guess when i heard that when i was back home
every interview im representin you makin you proud
reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
if you dont know by now im talkin bout chitown
