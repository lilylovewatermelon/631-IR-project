shes gone again
shes gone again no no

verse 1
every time she leaves its my heart that she taking from me oh
and i dont know if shes gone for good or returning in the morning oh
and i wait through the night cause i cant help the tossing and turning
i want you to know that our bed our sheets our pillows getting lonely on

chorus
yo side of the bed
yo side yo side yo side yo side
its lonely on yo side of the bed
yo side yo side yo side
its not the same without you here on yo side of the bed
all night i hold your pillow
its lonely on yo side of the bed
yo side yo side yo side
its so lonely there
and i dont wanna sleep if you aint here no

verse 2
i just wanna breathe your air watch you when you wrapping up your hair
gazing at the mirrors up there im reaching while imagining that youre there
i wait through the night girl tossing and turning and tossing and turning oh
our bed our sheets our pillows getting lonely on
