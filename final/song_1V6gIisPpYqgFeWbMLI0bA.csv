puttin my defenses up
cause i dont wanna fall in love
if i ever did that i think id have a heart attack

verse 1
never put my love out on the line
never said yes to the right guy
never had trouble getting what i want
but when it comes to you im never good enough
when i dont care
i can play em like a ken doll
wont wash my hair
then make em bounce like a basketball

prechorus
but you make me wanna act like a girl
paint my nails and wear high heels yes you
make me so nervous that i just cant hold your hand

chorus
you make me glow
but i cover up wont let it show
so im putting my defenses up up
cause i dont wanna fall in love love
if i ever did that i think id have a heart attack
i think id have a heart attack
i think id have a heart attack

never break a sweat for the other guys
when you come around i get paralyzed
and every time i try to be myself
it comes out wrong like a cry for help
its just not fair
pains more trouble than love is worth
i gasp for air
it feels so good but you know it hurts

prechorus
but you make me wanna act like a girl
paint my nails and wear perfume for you
make me so nervous that i just cant hold your hand

chorus
you make me glow
but i cover up wont let it show
so im putting my defenses up up
cause i dont wanna fall in love love
if i ever did that i think id have a heart attack
i think id have a heart attack
i think id have a heart attack

bridge
the feelings got lost in my lungs
theyre burning id rather be numb id rather be numb
and theres no one else to blame no one else to blame
so scared i take off and i run
im flying too close to the sun
and i burst into flames
chorus
you make me glow
but i cover up wont let it show
so im putting my defenses up up
cause i dont wanna fall in love love
if i ever did that i think id have a heart attack yeah
i think id have a heart attack heart attack
i think id have a heart attack tack
oh i think id have a heart attack tack
i think id have a heart attack214embed"
