why the fuck these niggas bitching blame it on some bitches
money on my mind and my mind on the riches
gotta watch my back cant let the devil get me
and i aint never been scared cause i know god with me
chris travis be a mortal angel god sent me
blunt in my hand with a shot of dark whiskey
imma let that bullshit slide
one hundred rounds in the trunk we will let it ride
nigga do you wanna die
or would you rather be paralyzed
lately i been fucked up mentally
please forgive me for hurting bitch niggas physically
fuck niggas cant get to me
your girl aint at home cause that bitch with me
let that bitch breathe
staying true to myself fuck everybody
staying true to my wealth i got everybody
staying true to myself fuck everybody
staying true to my wealth i got everybody
staying true to myself fuck everybody
staying true to my wealth i got everybody
staying true to myself fuck everybody
staying true to my wealth i got everybody

verse 2
never do you wrong always keep it real
is it right to die or is it right to kill
because i dont really know how to feel
under pressure all bitch niggas do is squeal
heart dropping eyes stopping thats a stand still
bitch nigga im on the kill
so nigga gon try your luck
one time well fuck you up
i leave your soul with the doves
now killing always aint the choice
but motherfucker i still wont show remorse
come and beat your ass while you on the porch
then light up my blunt with a torch
and speed off in my 99 ford
its all good cause i aint have to use my swordyou might also likeembed"
