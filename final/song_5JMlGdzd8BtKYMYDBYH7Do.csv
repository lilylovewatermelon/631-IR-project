verse 3 dizzee rascal
bitches not flexin aint much good
i should and i would keep clear if i could
but when i do i just cant get away
cause i gotta fuck all day every day
that leaves me vulnerable for real
all these chickenheads know about dyl
aint gotta do a lot to make me chill
find a good spot on the floor and kneel
know that my hearts in between my thighs
though i cant take when they look in my eyes
lookin for love thats no surprise
cum in her mouth thats family ties
then i hit it from the back all the way
slap that batty just like classe
not breeze out without no delay
girls in the chat i aint got shit to say
