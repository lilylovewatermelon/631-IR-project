hype beatz

chorus
in the wintertime i still cause hell
doin hard time in that jail cell
like what the fuck these streets done did to me what they did to me
tryna run it up tryna get them bands
tryna get my people to understand
but lately i been havin brazy dreams i been havin dreams
let me tell you i had a dream that my homeboy had switched up turned flaw
had a dream that my main bih was fucking on my dawg
i had a dream that my codefendant had snitched and told it all
i had a dream is it really what it seems
i dont know but i had a dream

verse 1
hard work pays off
in the studio aint no days off
had a dream i was with kodak in a limousine
but he locked up right now tell me what it seems
and the magazine on the clip was extended thirty clip
and the movie was a good one but it got ended
cause i woke up in that cell like damn man
let me get out let me go and run the campaign
and your bitch drink that dick call her danimal
i went to jailbroke hopped out and look i done ran it up
and these hoes want to fuck some cause we janitor
we clean up her block with that mop like a janitor
she off a perc im off a bean and she mellyposin mellyposin
then the crackers got behind us and they was patrollin
then it turned up that the car i was drivin was stolen
we gon pull up for real baby
put that glock to your grill baby
had a dream that i was cookin on the grill baby
i knew that that shit was a dream
cause bitch all i ever did was scheme
im not the type to get a job
