car rides to malibu
strawberry ice cream one spoon for two
and tradin jackets
laughin’ bout how small it looks on you
hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha
watching reruns of glee
bein annoying singin’ in harmony
i bet shes braggin to all her friends sayin youre so unique hmm

chorus
so when you gonna tell her that we did that too
she thinks its special but its all reused
that was our place i found it first
i made the jokes you tell to her when shes with you
do you get déjà vu when she’s with you
do you get déjà vu ah hmm
do you get déjà vu huh

verse 2
do you call her almost say my name
’cause lets be honest we kinda do sound the same
another actress
i hate to think that i was just your type
and i bet that she knows billy joel
’cause you played her uptown girl
youre singin it together
now i bet you even tell her how you love her
in between the chorus and the verse ooh i love you
see olivia rodrigo liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
so when you gonna tell her that we did that too
she thinks its special but it’s all reused
that was the show we talked about
played you the songs shes singing now when shes with you
do you get déjà vu when shes with you
do you get déjà vu ohoh
do you get déjà vu
bridge
strawberry ice cream in malibu
dont act like we didnt do that shit too
youre tradin jackets like we used to do
yeah everything is all reused
play her piano but she doesnt know oh oh
that i was the one who taught you billy joel oh
a different girl now but theres nothing new

i know you get déjà vu
i know you get déjà vu
i know you get déjà vu191embed"
