february and the flowers havent even wilted
its crazy how fast you tilted
the world that we were busy buildin
midnovember and im sippin on a halfcold coffee
starin at a girl whos not me
on your arm a carbon copy

prechorus
feels like we had matching wounds
but mines still black and bruised
and yours is perfectly fine now
feels like we buried alive
something that never died
so god it hurt when i found out

chorus
you love her its over
do you even doubt it on your lips when you say it say it
you love her its over
you already found someonе to miss
while im still standin at the exit ohoh ohohoh
im still standin at thе exit ohoh ohohoh oh oh

verse 2
i cant hate you for getting everything we wanted
i just thought that i would be a part of it
i was movin into your apartment
when you met someone shes from your hometown
you hate the east coast its where you live now
impossible to understand how youre not comin back
but i cant say it out loud
you might also likechorus
you love her its over
do you even doubt it on your lips what do you say say
you love her its over
you already found someone to miss
while im still standin at the exit ohoh ohohoh
im still standin at the exit ohoh ohohoh oh oh

prechorus
feels like we had matching wounds
