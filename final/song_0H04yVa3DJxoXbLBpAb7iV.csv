we say goodbye see you around
we turn our backs then turn back around
we break up we make up and we make love
we can’t seem to let go girl

chorus
so i’m comin over
runnin every red light
to hell with the closure
save it for another time
try not to think about you
but it ain’t workin
why put out a fire when it’s still burnin
just when i think movin on is gettin closer
i’m comin over

verse 2
i’m all alone but you’re on my phone
tellin me you miss me and that you’re at home
who knows what we are in the mornin
all i know is i want you
chorus
so i’m comin over
runnin every red light
to hell with the closure
save it for another time
try not to think about you
but it ain’t workin
why put out a fire when it’s still burnin
just when i think movin on is gettin closer
i’m comin over
ooh i’m comin over

yeah we said that we’re done and i know that it’s late
but you already know i’m on my way

chorus
i’m comin over
runnin every red light
to hell with the closure
save it for another time
try not to think about you
but it ain’t workin
why put out a fire that’s burnin
i’m comin over
runnin every red light
to hell with the closure
save it for another time
try not to think about you
but it ain’t workin
why put out a fire when it’s still burnin
just when i think movin on is gettin closer
i’m comin over
