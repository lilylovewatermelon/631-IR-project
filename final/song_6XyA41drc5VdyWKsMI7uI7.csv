fog in my light hole in the moon
talking by numbers silent storm through
i get a hit off i get a kick of
being here with you oh

i heed the touch of the wind
scratching on the wheels of the burning pavement
i took control of i want to get off
faster faster look out here i go

chorus
whoa come on let me hear you say
yeah the thrill has got a hold on me
whoa take me on a getaway
yeah come on let me hear you say

verse 2
break in the road sun on my heels
focus on the wild open barren spaces
i get a kick of i get a hit off
being here with you oh

i feel the warmth of the rain
dancing on the dust of the burning pavement
i took control of i want to get off
faster faster watch out here i go
