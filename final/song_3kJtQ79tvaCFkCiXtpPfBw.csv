once was a girl little red
who left to her grandmas to bring her some bread
right before she had left mama said
dont wager with strangers now go right ahead

prechorus
over the hills through the woods to grandmamas house she goes
little red nodded her head and left with goods and on her way out she goes

chorus
come find me im little red riding
the hoods on me tightly
to try me unlikely i wish a wolf would
big and bad slightly a big mouth dont fright me
got big bear beside mе with sticks in these woods
wolf this hood is for real this aint oncе pon a time
no we dont relate you and i we dont rhyme
im not scared of the dark black is beautiful right
and my gram needs her fam so its into the night
i see red its the end youll meet boy who cried
im toxic you got it blame that on my sign
youre a snack and a half and im tryna eat right
but a lone wolf dont need a pack im back to bite
guess whos over the hills when you jack drip from jill
or pick sticks up with pigs or give granny her meal
big bad and bout it ill pop out for real
and with these 1s youll be done before you can squeal

into the thick of it little red went
till i came up atrickin to trap me a treat
bark but no bite youre no wolf youre a tree
you know minding your business will always be free
lil red the sneezys are free at my shop
which made little red stop shed been waiting to cop
red wasnt sure bout the site i displayed
but in fall gotta ball witches cook kids who flop
wolf this suspicious how ashy your drip is
your fit needs three wishes what godma did this
really youre reachin werent you chasing three pigs
aint sayn youre simprella but if the shoe fits
red im sssniperwolfs half bro youve seen me online
big bad and boujee im too fine for swine
and look ashys in fashion thats pixie dust right
i can leave if you like but these deals dont come twice
red had warned as she shipped it to grams
dont mess with the bread or the fam or its hands
as you may guess i finessed her address
and then ran to set red up as soon as she left

prechorus
over the hills through the woods to grandmamas house she goes
little red trotted ahead and left with goods and on her way off she goes
chorus
come find me im little red riding
the hoods on me tightly
to try me unlikely i wish a wolf would
big and bad slightly a big mouth dont fright me
and pooh might get sheisty with sticks in these woods
wolf this hood is for real i aint floating your boat
no we dont relate we dont rhyme and it shows
i aint scared of the dark where the wild things bro
and queen tiancé taught me dont stop for no toad
i see red its the end kiss granny goodbye
im toxic you got it blame that on my sign
youre a snack and a half and i ride for my sides
plus its better 1 granny and girl than 5 guys
ima let you all guess it whose running these streets
it starts with an m and it ends in an e
is you big bad or big mad you been past your peak
and with these 1s youll be done before you can speak

verse 2
id blow grannys house down to pieces and bits
but that huffing and puffing got mama wolf ticked
should try chimney diving and slide like recess
but im alpha wolf sized i think knocking is best
come on out granny zumba can wait
your lil red hasnt eaten she needs her a plate
gran with a pot came out quick as a bot
and lets just say i ate that with no crumbs to waste
im top 2 and not 2 yall got to admit it
im like dumpty yall wont catch me slippin
ill slip in this fit and she wont know the difference
plus matching mustaches were practically twinnin
im real weasel poppin this my happy end
even found true love in food and this bed
this a great fall like dumptys but im messy still
and yes snow white was right this food comas for real
into the bed to watch wolflix i went
while i waited for red to deliver my bread
red on her phone was still strolling along
till she came to the door with a ding and a dong
prechorus
over the hills and through the woods to grandmamas house she goes
little red walked in the crib and looked up shook and all in her mind she goes

chorus
hey granny sike you think youre sly
im lil red not lil blind
a lil trick really tried i guess wishes come true
wolf but you lyin this no lullaby
but ill put you to sleep if you play me too
this for my granny
this for my fam
from my little red hood to the little red hen
from the little brown bear to little bo and lil lamb
start with little ol me and itll be the end
knock knock im not here for ha has you think this a joke
you are what you eat guess thats means im the goat
ima do what i want dont care what simon says
red youre not really ready like on my way texts
like my fairy lil pixi youll vanish for good
godmama drama kept wishing she would
i need me a lil treat and heard revenge is sweet
and put me to sleep please i belong to the sheets

verse 3
what big eyes you have oh the better to see
and what a big nose okay pause now thats mean
and right when id double forked up for the dish
red said what a big climb wait rewind thats off script
granny remember youre famous as ever for crate challenge cooking you win every year
since a wolfs clever and really a stepper ill prove that im gran and get red when its clear
one and a two get to three and youre through
three and a four wait youre lying theres more
and on five and six had the win in my grip
but ma natures a hater blew wind and i slipped
red im leaping like the princess had forgot to give a kiss to me
ow fell off oh no but mightve missed a beat
joke is on yall i was already broke
enjoy your lil memes but ill be back fo sho
