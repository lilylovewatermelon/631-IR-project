chorus ash riser
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

verse 1 kendrick lamar
uh and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur thats her favorite rapper
bumpin brendas got a baby while a pervert yellin at her
and she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
then seven cars start honking
she start running like flojo dont care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
just give it all to her daddy but she dont know her father
thats ironic
see a block away from lueders park i seen an el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothin really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she makin ends meet

chorus ash riser
fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide
said if he seen whats between her thighs hed compromise
to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome then felt him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she toppin off police

verse 3 kendrick lamar
and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelvebunk on tour
she suddenly realize shell never escape the allure
of a black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption that sounds foolish
and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
this motherfucker is the fuckin reason why keisha rushing to that
block away from lueders park i seen an el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters still she hit the back seat
then caught a knife inside the bladder left for dead raped in the street
keishas song mmm
my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song sat her down and pressed play
