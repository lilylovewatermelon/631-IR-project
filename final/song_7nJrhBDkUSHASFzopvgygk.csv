well ill never forget the first time that i heard
that pretty mouth say that dirty word
and i cant even remember now
what she backed my truck into
but she covered her mouth and her face got red
and she just looked so darn cute
that i couldnt even act like i was mad
yeah i live for little moments like that

verse 2
well thats like just last year on my birthday
she lost all track of time and burnt the cake
and every smoke detector
in the house was going off
and she was just about to cry
until i took her in my arms
and i tried not to let her see me laugh
yeah i live for little moments like that

verse 3
i know shes not perfect
but she tries so hard for me
and i thank god that she isnt
cause how boring would that be
its the little imperfections
its the sudden change in plans
when she misreads the directions
and were lost but holding hands
yeah i live for little moments like that
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 4
when shes laying on my shoulder
on the sofa in the dark
and about the time she falls asleep
so does my right arm
and i want so bad to move it
cause its tinglin and its numb
but she looks so much like an angel
that i dont want to wake her up

outro
yeah i live for little moments
when she steals my heart again and doesnt even know it
yeah i live for little moments like thatembed"
