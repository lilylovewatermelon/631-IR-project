i remember you and me yeah oh yeah
tangled in hotel sheets
you wore me out you wore me out

i remember honey lips and words so true
i remember nonstop earthquake dreams of you
coming on fast like good dreams do
all night long

still can feel you kiss me love
still can see your brown skin shining shining
still can feel you kiss me love
come on and drive me wild wild

and you move like water yeah
and you broke like waves
ive never been deeper so far gone
your sister in the next room with the television on

still can feel you kiss me love
still can see your brown skin shining shining
still can feel you kiss me love
come on and drive me wild
come on and drive me wild
come on and drive me wild

i remember you and me
tangled in hotel sheets  for hours

still can feel you kiss me love
still can see your brown skin shining shining
still can feel you kiss me love
come on and drive me wild

still can feel you kiss me love
still can see your eyes like diamonds diamonds
memories are strong enough
to come on and drive me wild
come on and drive me wildembed"
