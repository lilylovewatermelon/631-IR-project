what up rippah

verse 1
i come from posted on the block with them hot boys
seven of us ridin on a bike totin them fire rods
a smoker showed me how to sit and make the powder
von showed me never go to sleep he press all the cards
bitch what it is we can talk about it
skinny nigga pockets thick my bitch got a wide body
hoppin off the jet and i got twenty racks in every pocket
cross get set on fire niggas die if you try to stop me
jail cells i was only 12 gettin put in them
hood hoes tryna come up off you i grew up with them
snake niggas straight up hatin niggas bitch i run with them
fuck niggas with that sneak dissin i aint hearin them
hold on now let me turn up on a ho
your favorite rapper rattin on the low
hundred shots in that cutter we got that chevy sittin low
and my youngins they reckless blow all the hinges off your door

plus half of these niggas i could tell you what your bitch bout
