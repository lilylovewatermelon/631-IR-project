i feel it on my skin
i feel it through my teeth
the rhythm of revenge
the rhythm of defeat

chorus
i know youre hiding
please do not find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallows
i know youre hiding
please do not find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallows

verse 2
ill hurt you through the sound
ill hurt you to the beat
no hearts will dance alone
no hearts will trouble me

chorus
i know youre hiding
please do not find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallows
i know youre hiding
please do not find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallows
you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
i know youre hiding
please do no find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallows
i know your hiding
please do no find me
dance with the shadows
into the gallowsembed"
