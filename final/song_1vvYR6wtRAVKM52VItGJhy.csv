its not what you have said its what you have done
to let this come between us
youre right without a fight
this might be worth it to you and in the process gotten to me

chorus
i think that nothing can fly
with this broken wing
theres so much to hold on to now
nothing can fly with this broken wing
so heres a gift in this feather

verse 2
youve gone to far
left standing alone
lets sort this out together
youre right without a fight
and it might be worth it to you but i cant take this anymore

chorus
i think that nothing can fly
with this broken wing
theres so much to hold on to now
nothing can fly with this broken wing
so heres a gift in this feather

from this house of our friendship shut the door
and light the match throw behind you walk away
these ashes
these ashes
these ashes burn

chorus
i think that nothing can fly
with this broken wing
theres so much to hold on to now
nothing can fly with this broken wing
so heres a gift in this feather
nothing can fly with this broken wing
so heres a gift in this featherembed"
