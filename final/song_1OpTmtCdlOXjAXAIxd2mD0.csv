he who has looked upon earth
deeper than flower and fruit
losing some hue of his mirth
as the tree striking rock at the root
unto him shall the marvellous tale
of callistes more humanly come
with the touch on his breast than a hail
from the markets that hum

ii

now the youth footed swift to the dawn
twas the season when wintertide
in the higher rockhollows updrawn
leaves meadows to bud and he spied
by light throwing shallow shade
between the beam and the gloom
sicilian enna whose maid
such aspect wears in her bloom
undеrneath since the charioteer
of darknеss whirled her away
on a reaped afternoon of the year
nigh the poppydroop of day
o and naked of her all dust
the majestic mother and nurse
ringing cries to the god the just
curled the land with the blight of her curse
recollected of this glad isle
still quaking but now more fair
and momently fraying the while
the veil of the shadows there
soft enna that prostrate grief
sang through and revealed round the vines
bronzeorange the crisp young leaf
the wheatblades tripping in lines
a hue unillumined by sun
of the flowers flooding grass as from founts
all the penetrable dun
of the morn ere she mounts
iii

nor had saffron and sapphire and red
waved aloft to their sisters below
when gaped by the rockchannel head
of the lake black a cave at one blow
reverberant over the plain
a sound oft fearfully swung
for the coming of wrathful rain
and forth like the dragontongue
of a fire beaten flat by the gale
but more as the smoke to behold
a chariot burst then a wail
quivered high of the love that would fold
bliss immeasurable bigger than heart
though a god’s and the wheels were stayed
and the team of the chariot swart
reared in marble the six dismayed
like hoofs that by night plashing sea
curve and ramp from the vast swanwave
for lo the great mother she
and callistes gazed he gave
his eyeballs up to the sight
the embrace of the twain of whom
to men are their day their night
mellow fruits and the shearing tomb
our lady of the sheaves
and the lily of hades the sweet
of enna he saw through leaves
the mother and daughter meet
they stood by the chariotwheel
embraced very tall most like
fellow poplars windtaken that reel
down their shivering columns and strike
head to head crossing throats and apart
for the feast of the look they drew
which darkness no longer could thwart
and they broke together anew
exulting to tears flower and bud
but the mate of the rayless was grave
she smiled like sleep on its flood
that washes of all we crave
like the trance of eyes awake
and the spirit enshrouded she cast
the wan underworld on the lake
they were so and they passed
iv

he tells it who knew the law
upon mortals he stood alive
declaring that this he saw
he could see and survive

v

now the youth was not ware of the beams
with the grasses intertwined
for each thing seen as in dreams
came stepping to rear through his mind
till it struck his remembered prayer
to be witness of this which had flown
like a smoke melted thinner than air
that the vacancy doth disown
and viewing a maiden he thought
it might now be morn and afar
within him the memory wrought
of a something that slipped from the car
when those the august moved by
perchance a scarf and perchance
this maiden she did not fly
nor started at his advance
she looked as when infinite thirst
pants pausing to bless the springs
refreshed unsated then first
he trembled with awe of the things
he had seen and he did transfer
divining and doubting in turn
his reverence unto her
nor asked what he crouched to learn
the whence of her whither and why
her presence there and her name
her parentage under which sky
her birth and how hither she came
so young a virgin alone
unfriended having no fear
as oreads have no moan
like the lost upon earth no tear
not a sign of the torch in the blood
though her stature had reached the height
when mantles a tender rud
in maids that of youths have sight
if maids of our seed they be
for he said a glad vision art thou
and she answered him thou to me
as men utter a vow
vi

then said she quick as the cries
of the rainy cranes light light
and helios rose in her eyes
that were full as the dewballs bright
relucent to him as dews
unshaded breathing she sent
her voice to the god of the muse
and along the vale it went
strange to hear not thin not shrill
sweet but no young maids throat
the echo beyond the hill
ran falling on half the note
and under the shaken ground
where the hundredheaded groans
by the roots of great aetna bound
as of him were hollow tones
of wondering roared a tale
repeated to sunless halls
but now off the face of the vale
shadows fled in a breath and the walls
of the lakes rockhead were gold
and the breast of the lake that swell
of the crestless long wave rolled
to shorebubble pebble and shell
a morning of radiant lids
o’er the dance of the earth opened wide
the bees chose their flowers the snub kids
upon hindlegs went sportive or plied
nosing hard at the dugs to be filled
there was milk honey music to make
up their branches the little birds billed
chirrup drone bleat and buzz ringed the lake
o shining in sunlight chief
after water and waters caress
was the young bronzeorange leaf
that clung to the tree as a tress
shooting lucid tendrils to wed
with the vinehook tree or pole
like arachne launched out on her thread
then the maiden her dusky stole
in the span of the blackstarred zone
gathered up for her footing fleet
as one that had toil of her own
she followed the lines of wheat
tripping straight through the fields green blades
to the groves of olive grey
downygrey goldentinged and to glades
where the pearblossom thickens the spray
in a night like the snowpacked storm
pear apple almond plum
not wintry now pushing warm
and she touched them with finger and thumb
as the vinehook closes she smiled
recounting again and again
corn wine fruit oil like a child
with the meaning known to men
for hours in the track of the plough
and the pruningknife she stepped
and of how the seed works and of how
yields the soil she seemed adept
then she murmured that name of the dearth
the beneficent hers who bade
our husbandmen sow for the birth
of the grain making earth full glad
she murmured that others the dirge
of lifelight for whose dark lap
our locks are clipped on the verge
of the realm where runs no sap
she said we have looked on both
and her eyes had a wavering beam
of various lights like the froth
of the stormswollen ravine stream
in flame of the bolt what links
were these which had made him her friend
he eyed her as one who drinks
and would drink to the end

vii

now the meadows with crocus besprent
and the asphodel woodsides she left
and the lakeslopes the ravishing scent
of narcissus darksweet for the cleft
that tutors the torrentbrook
delaying its forceful spleen
with many a wind and crook
through rock to the broad ravine
by the hyacinthbells in the brakes
and the shadeloved white windflower half hid
and the sunloving lizards and snakes
on the clefts barren ledges that slid
out of sight smooth as waterdrops all
at a snap of twig or bark
in the track of the foreign footfall
she climbed to the pineforest dark
overbrowing an emerald chine
of the grassbillows thence as a wreath
running poplar and cypress to pine
the lakebanks are seen and beneath
vineyard village groves rivers towers farms
the citadel watching the bay
the bay with the town in its arms
the town shining white as the spray
of the sapphire seawave on the rock
where the rock stars the girdle of sea
whiteringed as the midday flock
clipped by heat rings the round of the tree
that hour of the piercing shaft
transfixes boughshadows confused
in veins of fire and she laughed
with her quiet mouth amused
to see the whole flock adroop
asleep hug the treestem as one
imperceptibly filling the loop
of its shade at a slant of sun
the pipes under pent of the crag
where the goatherds in piping recline
have whimsical stops burst and flag
uncorrected as outstretched swine
for the fingers are slack and unsure
and the wind issues querulous thorns
and snakesbut she listened demure
comparing days music with morns
of the gentle spirit that slips
from the bark of the tree she discoursed
and of her of the wells whose lips
are coolness enchanting rocksourced
and much of the sacred loon
the frolic the goatfoot god
for stories of indolent noon
in the pineforests odorous nod
she questioned not knowing he can
be waspish irascible rude
he is oftener friendly to man
and ever to beasts and their brood
for the which did she love him well
she said and his pipes of the reed
his twitched lips puffing to tell
in music his tears and his need
against the sharp catch of his hurt
not as shepherds of pan did she speak
nor spake as the schools to divert
but fondly perceiving him weak
before gods and to shepherds a fear
a holiness horn and heel
all this she had learnt in her ear
from callistes and taught him to feel
yea the solemn divinity flushed
through the shaggy brown skin of the beast
and the steeps where the cataract rushed
and the wilds where the forest is priest
were his temple to clothe him in awe
while she spake twas a wonder she read
the haunts of the beak and the claw
as plain as the land of bread
but cities and martial states
whither soon the youth veered his theme
were impervious barriergates
to her and that ship a trireme
nearing harbour scarce wakened her glance
though he dwelt on the message it bore
of sceptre and sword and lance
to the beeswarms black on the shore
which were audible almost
so black they were it befel
that he called up the warrior host
of the song pouring hydromel
in thunder the widewinged song
and he named with his boyish pride
the heroes the noble throng
past acheron now foul tide
with his joy of the godlike band
and the verse divine he named
the chiefs pressing hot on the strand
seen of gods of gods aided and maimed
the fleetfoot and ireful the king
him the prompter in stratagem
manyshifted and masterful sing
o muse but she cried not of them
she breathed as if breath had failed
and her eyes while she bade him desist
held the losttolight ghosts greymailed
as you see the grey rivermist
hold shapes on the yonder bank
a moment her body waned
the light of her sprang and sank
then she looked at the sun she regained
clear feature and she breathed deep
she wore the wan smile he had seen
as the flow of the river of sleep
on the mouth of the shadowqueen
in sunlight she craved to bask
saying life and who was she who
of what issue he dared not ask
for that partly he knew

viii

a noise of the hollow ground
turned the eye to the ear in debate
not the soft overflowing of sound
of the pines ranked lofty straight
barely swayed to some whispers remote
some swarming whispers above
not the pines with the faint airs afloat
hushhushing the nested dove
it was not the pines or the rout
oft heard from midforest in chase
but the long muffled roar of a shout
subterranean sharp grew her face
she rose yet not moved by affright
’twas rather good haste to use
her holiday of delight
in the beams of the god of the muse
and the steeps of the forest she crossed
on its dry red sheddings and cones
up the paths by roots greenmossed
spotted amber and old mossed stones
then out where the brooktorrent starts
to her leap and from bend to curve
a hurrying elbow darts
for the instantglancing swerve
decisive with violent will
in the action formed like hers
the maiden’s ascending and still
ascending the bud of the furze
the broom and all blueberried shoots
of stubborn and prickly kind
the juniper flat on its roots
the dwarf rhododaphne behind
she left and the mountain sheep
far behind goat herbage and flower
the island was hers and the deep
all heaven a golden hour
then with wonderful voice that rang
through air as the swans nigh death
of the glory of light she sang
she sang of the rapture of breath
nor ever says he who heard
heard earth in her boundaries broad
from bosom of singer or bird
a sweetness thus rich of the god
whose harmonies always are sane
she sang of furrow and seed
the burial birth of the grain
the growth and the showers that feed
and the green blades waxing mature
for the husbandman’s armful brown
o the song in its burden ran pure
and burden to song was a crown
callistes a singer skilled
in the gift he could measure and praise
by a rivals art was thrilled
though she sang but a song of days
where the husbandmans toil and strife
little varies to strife and toil
but the milky kernel of life
with her numbered corn wine fruit oil
the song did give him to eat
gave the first rapt vision of good
and the fresh young sense of sweet
the grace of the battle for food
with the issue earth cannot refuse
when men to their labour are sworn
twas a song of the god of the muse
to the forehead of morn

ix

him loved she lo now was he veiled
over sea stood a swelled cloudrack
the fishingboat heavenward sailed
bent abeam with a whitened track
surprised fast hauling the net
as it flew sea dashed earth shook
she said is it night o not yet
with a travail of thoughts in her look
the mountain heaved up to its peak
sea darkened earth gathered her fowl
of bird or of branch rose the shriek
night but never so fell a scowl
wore night nor the sky since then
when ocean ran swallowing shore
and the gods looked down for men
broke tempest with that stern roar
never yet save when black on the whirl
rode wrath of a sovereign power
then the youth and the shuddering girl
dim as shades in the angry shower
joined hands and descended a maze
of the paths that were racing alive
round boulder and bush cleaving ways
incessant with sound of a hive
the height was a fountainurn
pouring streams and the whole solid height
leaped chasing at every turn
the pair in one spirit of flight
to the folding pineforest yet here
like the pause to things hunted in doubt
the stillness bred spectral fear
of the awfulness ranging without
and imminent downward they fled
from under the haunted roof
to the valley aquake with the tread
of an ironresounding hoof
as of legions of thunderful horse
broken loose and in line tramping hard
for the rage of a hungry force
roamed blind of its mark over sward
they saw it rush dense in the cloak
of its travelling swathe of steam
all the vale through a thin threadsmoke
was thrown back to distance extreme
and dull the full breast of it blinked
like a buckler of steel breathed o’er
diminished in strangeness distinct
glowing cold unearthly hoar
an enna of fields beyond sun
out of light in a lurid web
and the traversing fury spun
up and down with a waves flow and ebb
as the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn
retire and in ravenous greed
inveterate swell its return
up and down as if wringing from speed
sights that made the unsighted appear
delude and dissolve on it scoured
lo a sea upon land held career
through the plain of the vale halfdevoured
callistes of home and escape
muttered swiftly unwitting of speech
she gazed at the void of shape
she put her white hand to his reach
saying now have we looked on the three
and divided from day from night
from air that is breath stood she
like the vale out of light

x

then again in disorderly words
he muttered of home and was mute
with the heart of the cowering birds
ere they burst off the fowlers foot
he gave her some redness that streamed
through her limbs in a flitting glow
the sigh of our life she seemed
the bliss of it clothing in woe
frailer than flower when the round
of the sickle encircles it strong
to tell of the things profound
our inmost uttering song
unspoken so stood she awhile
in the gloom of the terror afield
and the silence about her smile
said more than of tongue is revealed
i have breathed i have gazed i have been
it said and not joylessly shone
the remembrance of light through the screen
of a face that seemed shadow and stone
she led the youth trembling appalled
to the lakebanks he saw sink and rise
like a panicstruck breast then she called
and the hurricane blackness had eyes
it launched like the thunderers bolt
pale she drooped and the youth by her side
would have clasped her and dared a revolt
sacrilegious as ever defied
high olympus but vainly for strength
his compassionate heart shook a frame
stricken rigid to ice all its length
on amain the black traveller came
lo a chariot cleaving the storm
clove the fountaining lake with a plough
and the lord of the steeds was in form
he the god of implacable brow
darkness he he in person he raged
through the wave like a boar of the wilds
from the hunters and hounds disengaged
and a name shouted hoarsely his childs
horror melted in anguish to hear
lo the wave hissed apart for the path
of the terrible charioteer
with the foam and torn features of wrath
hurled aloft on each arm in a sheet
and the steeds clove it rushing at land
like the teeth of the famished at meat
then he swept out his hand

xi

this no more doth callistes recall
he saw ere he dropped in swoon
on the maiden the chariot fall
as a thundercloud swings on the moon
forth free of the deluge one cry
from the vanishing gallop rose clear
and skiegeneia the sky
rang skiegeneia the sphere
and she left him therewith to rejoice
repine yearn and know not his aim
the life of their day in her voice
left her life in her name

xii

now the valley in ruin of fields
and fair meadowland showing at eve
like the spearpitted warriors shields
after battle bade men believe
that no other than wrathfullest god
had been loose on her beautiful breast
where the flowery grass was clod
wheat and vine as a trailing nest
the valley discreet in grief
disclosed but the open truth
and enna had hope of the sheaf
there was none for the desolate youth
devoted to mourn and to crave
of the secret he had divined
of his friend of a day would he rave
how for light of our earth she pined
for the olive the vine and the wheat
burning through with inherited fire
and when mother went mother to meet
she was prompted by simple desire
in the daydestined car to have place
at the skirts of the goddess unseen
and be drawn to the dear earths face
she was fire for the blue and the green
of our earth dark fire athirst
as a seed of her bosom for dawn
white air that had robed and nursed
her mother now was she gone
with the silent the god without tear
like a bud peeping out of its sheath
to be sundered and stamped with the sere
and callistes to her beneath
as she to our beams extinct
strained arms he was shade of her shade
in division so were they linked
but the song which had betrayed
her flight to the cavernous ear
for its own keenly wakeful that song
of the sowing and reaping and cheer
of the husbandmans heart made strong
through droughts and deluging rains
with his faith in the great mothers love
o the joy of the breath she sustains
and the lyre of the light above
and the first rapt vision of good
and the fresh young sense of sweet
that song the youth ever pursued
in the track of her footing fleet
for men to be profited much
by her day upon earth did he sing
of her voice and her steps and her touch
on the blossoms of tender spring
immortal and how in her soul
she is with them and tearless abides
folding grain of a love for one goal
in patience past flowing of tides
and if unto him she was tears
he wept not he wasted within
seeming sane in the song to his peers
only crazed where the cravings begin
our lady of gifts prized he less
than her issue in darkness the dim
lost skiegencias caress
of our earth made it richest for him
and for that was a curse on him raised
and he withered rathe dry to his prime
though the bounteous giver be praised
through the island with rites of old time
exceedingly fervent and reaped
veneration for teachings devout
pious hymns when the cornsheaves are heaped
and the winepresses ruddily spout
and the olive and apple are juice
at a touch light as hers lost below
whatsoever to men is of use
sprang his worship of them who bestow
in a measure of songs unexcelled
but that soul loving earth and the sun
from her home of the shadows he held
for his beacon where beam there is none
and to join her or have her brought back
in his frenzy the singer would call
till he followed where never was track
on the path trod of allembed"
