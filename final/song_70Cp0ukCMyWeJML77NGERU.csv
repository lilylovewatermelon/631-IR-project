night falls with gravity
the earth turns from sanity
taking my only friend i know
he leaves a lot his name is hope

chorus
im never what i like
im doublesided
and i just cant hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
cause im twisted up im twisted up inside
verse 2
the horrors of the night melt away
under the warm glow of survival of the day
then we move on
my shadow grows taller along with my fears
and my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
when the sun is climbing window sills
and the silver lining rides the hills
i will be saved for one whole day
until the sun makes the hills its grave

chorus
im never what i like
im doublesided
and i just cant hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
cause im twisted up im twisted up inside
im never what i like
im doublesided
and i just cant hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
cause im twisted up im twisted up inside my mind

my prayers schizophrenic

my prayers schizophrenic
but ill live on yeah ill live on yeah ill live on
im semiautomatic

bridge
by the time the night wears off the dust is down
and shadows burn
i will rise and stand my ground
waiting for the nights return

chorus
im never what i like
im doublesided
and i just cant hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
cause im twisted up im twisted up inside
im never what i like
im doublesided
and i just cant hide
i kinda like it
when i make you cry
cause im twisted up im twisted up inside my mind63embed"
