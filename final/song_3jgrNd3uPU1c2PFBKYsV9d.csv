in massachusetts
only 30 minutes from alewife
i lay in my room
wonderin why ive got this life
i met you by surprise
you were hangin out all the time
but you know you saved me from doin
something to myself that night

verse 2
you called me seven times
one two three four on the line
i didnt mean to scare you
just had the thoughts in my mind
they showed up to my door
my parents didnt know what for
swear i couldve done it
if you werent there when i hit the floor

verse 3
its been so long
and youve been my sister all along
but you know ill be alright
eighth grade was never that tightyou might also like25embed"
