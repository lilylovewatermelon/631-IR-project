to sedate you tear the walls down
headless prison cannibals chew
to consume you bring the alien

halcium and morphine
5methoxyn ndimethyltryptamine
psilocybin mescaline aspirin histomine
brushite darvaset valium caffeine cannabis and lsd
ayahuasca harmine give it all to me i want it

these are just a few of my favorite things
these are just a few of my favorite things

trisolam and xanex serotonin mdma ibogaine dopeamine
tetrahydrochloride atenolol
amanita muscaria
boric oxide arrabinitol psilocin and flamizine
cylotec and harmaline
give it all to me i want it

does your god come in a capsule to sedate you
tear the walls down headless prison
cannibals chew to consume you
bring the alien
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likedoes your god come want to take me to sedate you
build the walls around mindless prison
dont you run chew to consume you
kill the alien
kill the alien
kill your alien
kill your alien

you cant kill me
im already dead
inside my hole
inside my head
we just beg for any way to be sedated
its all about escaping
numb to me
numb body from this hell

i can feel them pushing i can feel them pulling
i can feel them holding i can feel them moving
i can feel them prying i can feel them prodding
i can feel them breathing i can feel them digging
i can feel them stabbing i can feel them scoping
i can feel them living i can feel this
consume take in plunging plumbing
instruments prying aliens inside me
tooling the machine
intoxicating
feel it unfolding riddles in me
its all about escaping
we just beg for any way to get away
who do you bow down to
does your god come in a capsule or on a plate
theyre trying to sedate you
swallow self and bring on the alien
you tried to kill me
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world
im already dead to this world song fades outembed"
