uh me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish ya bish ya bish
hit the house lick tell me is you wit it ya bish ya bish ya bish
home invasion was persuasive was persuasive was persuasive
from nine to five i know its vacant ya bish ya bish ya bish
dreams of livin life like rappers do like rappers do like rappers do
back when condom wrappers wasnt cool they wasnt cool they wasnt cool
i fucked sherane and went to tell my bros tell my bros tell my bros
then usher raymond let it burn came on let burn came on let burn came on
hot sauce all in our top ramen ya bish ya bish ya bish
park the car then we start rhymin ya bish ya bish ya bish
the only thing we had to free our mind free our mind free our mind
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs see dollar signs see dollar signs
you lookin like a easy comeup ya bish ya bish ya bish
a silver spoon i know you come from ya bish ya bish ya bish
and thats a lifestyle that we never knew we never knew we never knew
go at a reverend for the revenue

chorus kendrick lamar  anna wise
it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you doin
everybody gon respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
the one in front of the gun forever
and i been hustlin allday

through canals and alleyways just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
and thats jus how i feel
postchorus kendrick lamar  anna wise
nah nah
a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
thats jus how i feel nah
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
thats jus how i feel nah nah
a dollar might just make that lane switch
thats jus how i feel nah
a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
thats jus how i feel

verse 2 kendrick lamar
dreams of livin life like rappers do like rappers do like rappers do
bump that new e40 after school way after school way after school
you know “big ballin with my homies” my homies
earl stevens had us thinkin rational thinkin rational thats rational
back to reality we poor ya bish ya bish ya bish
another casualty at war ya bish ya bish ya bish
two bullets in my uncle tony head my tony head my tony head
he said one day ill be on tour ya bish ya bish ya bish
that louis burgers never be the same wont be the same wont be the same
a louis belt that never ease that pain wont ease that pain wont ease that pain
but ima purchase when that day is jerkin that day is jerkin that day is jerkin
pull off at churchs with pirellis skirtin pirellis skirtin pirellis skirtin
gang signs out the window ya bish ya bish ya bish
hopin all of em offend you ya bish ya bish ya bish
they say your hood is a pot o gold a pot o gold a pot o gold
and we gon crash it when nobodys home

bridge anna wise
be the last one out to get this dough no way
love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
hit the streets then we break the code no way
hit the brakes when they on patrol no way
be the last one out to get this dough no way
love one of you bucket headed hoes no way
hit the streets then we break the code no way
hit the brakes when they on patrol no way
verse 3 jay rock
magine rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
santa claus dont miss them stockings liquors spillin pistols poppin
bakin soda yola whippin aint no turkey on thanksgivin
my homeboy just domed a nigga i just hope the lord forgive him
pots with cocaine residue every day im hustlin
what else is a thug to do when you eatin cheese from the government
gotta provide for my daughter nem—get the fuck up out my way bish
got that drum and i got them bands just like a parade bish
drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys dont see my stash
if they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
from the gardens where the grass aint cut them serpents lurkin blood
bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs but its all good
broken promises steal your watch and tell you what time it is
take your js and tell you to kick it where a foot locker is
in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

chorus kendrick lamar  anna wise
it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison tell me what you doin
everybody gon respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
the one in front of the gun forever
and i been hustlin allday

through canals and alleyways just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
