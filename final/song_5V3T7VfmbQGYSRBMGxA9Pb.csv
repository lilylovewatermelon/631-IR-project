i wanna dedicate this to my strugglin bro
keep pushin on keep pushin on

verse 1
first of the month check late
got nothin to do
imma roll me a blunt got drank
call me a ho or two yeah
now i know that it sound like im livin on the edge
only you aint hear the worst
got the whole house running on the generator
no good food in my frigidator
and im late for work

hook
dont that sound bad horrible
no inspiration no goals
i know it sound like i wanna die
and i know im so miserable
but this just so happens to be
the best day of my life

verse 2
now i dont wanna confuse you hurtin on the inside
but i wont let you see
thats why every little dollar and every little penny
goes to puttin that outfit on me
cause imma stay fresh to death
dressed to impress the rest
you know how i do it when i do it
imma show you how to do it
so you can do it for somebody else
but i still got the house on the generator
no good food in my frigidator
and im late for work
see tpain liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likehook
dont that sound bad horrible
no inspiration no goals
i know it sound like i wanna die
and i know im so miserable
but this just so happens to be
the best day of my life

bridge
my life my life
bottle of patron big cup of ice
drink drink drink drink drink drink
aint talkin bout that bullshit
im talkin like a newspaper
im talkin bout the newspaper full of weed like the whole thang
and imma roll it up and smoke it
imma let you think about you
and in the end you gotta let me do what i do

hook
dont that sound bad horrible
no inspiration no goals
i know it sound like i wanna die
and i know im so miserable
but this just so happens to be
the best day of my life
dont that sound bad horrible
no inspiration no goals
i know it sound like i wanna die
and i know im so miserable
but this just so happens to be
the best day of my lifeembed"
