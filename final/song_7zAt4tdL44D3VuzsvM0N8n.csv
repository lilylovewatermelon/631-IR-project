like walkin into a dream
so unlike what youve seen
so unsure but it seems
cause weve been waitin for you
fallen into this place
just givin you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay
youll be back here soon anyway
i see a distant light
but girl this cant be right
such a surreal place to see
so how did this come to be
arrived too early

prechorus m shadows
and when i think of all the places i just dont belong
ive come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

chorus m shadows
i dont belong here we gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
cause this time im right
to move on and on
far away from here

place of hope and no pain
perfect skies with no rain
can leave this place but refrain
cause weve been waiting for you
fallen into this place
just givin you a small taste
of your afterlife here so stay
youll be back here soon anyway
this peace on earths not right
up with my back against the wall
no pain or sign of time
im much too young to fall
so out of place dont wanna stay
i feel wrong and thats my sign
ive made up my mind

prechorus m shadows
gave me your hand but realize i just wanna say goodbye
please understand i have to leave and carry on my own life

chorus m shadows
i dont belong here i gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
cause this time im right
to move on and on
far away from here
got nothing against you and surely ill miss you
this place full of peace and light
and id hoped you might
take me back inside
when the time is right
bridge m shadows  the rev
loved ones back home all cryin cause theyre already missin me
i pray by the grace of god that theres somebody listening
give me a chance to be that person i wanna be
i am unbroken im chokin on this ecstasy
oh lord ill try so hard but you gotta let go of me
unbreak me unchain me i need another chance to live ah

chorus m shadows
i dont belong here i gotta move on dear
escape from this afterlife
cause this time im right
to move on and on
far away from here
got nothing against you and surely ill miss you
this place full of peace and light
and id hoped you might
take me back inside
when the time is right41embed"
