stick stick to your stones cause thats all you know
i was caught in the middle
i swallow my words down through the bone
cause nothings that simple

prechorus
late at night you pour it out
know that only brings you down

chorus
but go ahead give me all the blame
twist my words and set them to flame woah
we all know
that youll go tell all of your friends
that im the one you wish you never met
and woah
we all know

postchorus
the story never ends ends
the story never ends ends

in every direction
