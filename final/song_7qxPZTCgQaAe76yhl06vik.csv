verse 1
you say its all in my head
and the things i think just dont make sense
so where you been then dont go all coy
dont turn it round on me like its my fault
see i can see that look in your eyes
the one that shoots me each and every time each and every time

chorus
you grace me with your cold shoulder
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
you shower me with words made of knives
whenever you look at me and wish i was her

verse 2
these days when i see you
you make it look like im seethrough
do tell me why you waste our time
when your heart aint in it and youre not satisfied
you know i know just how you feel
im starting to find myself feeling that way too when

chorus
you grace me with your cold shoulder
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
you shower me with words made of knives
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likebridge
time and time again i play the role of fool
just for you
and even in the daylight when you think that
i dont see you
i try to look for things i hear but our eyes never find
though i do know how you play

chorus
you grace me with your cold shoulder
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
you shower me with words made of knives
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
you grace me with your cold shoulder
whenever you look at me and wish i was her
you shower me with words made of knives
whenever you look at me and wish i was her12embed"
