wont you hold me through the shakes darlin
well its fine if you cut and run
at first light of the crestin sun
but right now im fiendin
and if youre still in town
when my better days roll around
well heat this ground and dance like two hearts bleedin
this city is so loud
and the hotel kicked me out
do you think that shes still proud lookin down
the world got so confusin
im a tool for cheap amusement
and they all hate me from here to tennessee

chorus
so hold me through the shakes
although its more than i can take
there aint no choice for damaged boys like me
hold me through the shakes
although its more than you can take
and when you wake youll still be my darlin
when you wake im yours to take darlin

verse 2
let me have my bloody knuckles
all my nights and dark cold trouble
when i was through i was hopin you might wait for me
they made me out to be
somethin i dont understand
how i am just a man my darlin
now im lost in denver
with a postcard i could send ya
but i dont know of any good itd do
so ill photograph the lights
cause they remind me of your eyes
and pray for you until i untangle this blue

hold me through the shakes
although its more than i can take
there aint no choice for damaged boys like me
hold me through the shakes
although its more than you can take
and when you wake youll still be my darlin
when you wake im yours to take darlin

instrumental break

chorus
well hold me through the shakes
although its more than i can take
there aint no choice for damaged boys like me
hold me through the shakes
although its more than you can take
and when you wake youll still be my darlin
when you wake im yours to take darlinembed"
