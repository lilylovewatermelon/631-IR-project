my old man is a bad man
but i cant deny the way he holds my hand
and he grabs me he has me by my heart
he doesnt mind i have a las vegas past
he doesnt mind i have a la crass way about me
he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

refrain
swimmin pool glimmering darlin
white bikini off with my red nail polish
watch me in the swimming pool bright blue ripples
you sittin sippin on your black cristal yeah

prechorus
light of my life fire of my loins
be a good baby do what i want
light of my life fire of my loins
gimme them gold coins gimme them coins

chorus
and im off to the races
cases of bacardi chasers
chasin me all over town
cause he knows im wasted
facin time again at rikers island
and i wont get out
because im crazy baby
i need you to come here and save me
im your little scarlet starlet
singin in the garden
kiss me on my open mouth
ready for you
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeverse 2
my old man is a tough man
but he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
and he shows me he knows me every inch of my tar black soul
he doesnt mind i have a flat brokedown life
in fact he says he thinks its what he might like about me
admires me the way i roll like a rollin stone

refrain
likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom chateau marmont
slippin on my red dress puttin on my makeup
glass room perfume cognac lilac fumes
says it feels like heaven to him

prechorus
light of his life fire of his loins
keep me forever tell me you own me
light of your life fire of your loins
tell me you own me gimme them coins

chorus
and im off to the races
cases of bacardi chasers
chasin me all over town
cause he knows im wasted
facin time again at rikers island
and i wont get out
because im crazy baby
i need you to come here and save me
im your little scarlet starlet
singin in the garden
kiss me on my open mouth
yo im off to the races laces
leather on my waist is tight
and i am falling down
i can see your face is shameless
ciprianis basement
love you but im going down
god im so crazy baby
im sorry that im misbehaving
im your little harlot starlet
queen of coney island
raisin hell all over town
sorry bout it
bridge
my old man is a thief
and im gonna stay and pray with him til the end
but i trust in the decision of the lord to watch over us
take him when he may if he may
im not afraid to say that id die without him
who else is gonna put up with me this way
i need you i breathe you id never leave you
they would rue the day i was alone without you
youre lying with your gold chain on
cigar hangin from your lips
i said hon you never looked so beautiful
as you do now my man

chorus
and were off to the races places
ready set the gate is down
and now were goin in
to las vegas chaos casino oasis
honey it is time to spin
boy youre so crazy baby
i love you forever not maybe
you are my one true love
you are my one true love

outro
