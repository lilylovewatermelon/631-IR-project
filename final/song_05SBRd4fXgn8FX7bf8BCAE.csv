i need your love i need your time
when everythings wrong you make it right
i feel so high i come alive
i need to be free with you tonight
i need your love
i need your love

verse 1
i take a deep breath every time i pass your door
i know youre there but i cant see you anymore
and thats the reason youre in the dark
ive been a stranger ever since we fell apart

prechorus
and i feel so helpless here
watch my eyes are filled with fear
tell me do you feel the same
hold me in your arms again
chorus
i need your love i need your time
when everythings wrong you make it right
i feel so high i come alive
i need to be free with you tonight
i need your love

i walk in circles but ill never figure out

and i feel so helpless here
watch my eyes are filled with fear
tell me do you feel the same
hold me in your arms again

i feel so high i come alive
i need to be free with you tonight

all the years all the times
you have never been to blame
and now my eyes are open
and now my heart is closing
and all the tears all the lies all the waste
ive been trying to make a change
and now my eyes are open
chorus
i need your love i need your time
when everythings wrong you make it right
