sometimes i lie awake
starring at the ceiling
ill have someone beside me
but she wont know your name
she wont be here long
hell shes almost a memory
youll never be really gone
girl are you feeling me

chorus
do you fall asleep mission my kiss in the dark
wake up the next morning not sure where you are
is it killing you like its killing me
are you lying there lying to somebody else
trying to find the one thing i cant find for myself
when hes touching you really touching you
are you feeling me

bridge
you ever wish on a star that aint falling
hoping you dreams will come true
pray for the day that you know its coming
well i do baby i do baby i do
baby i do

do you fall asleep missing my kiss in the dark
wake up the next morning not sure where you are
is it killing you like its killing me
are you lying there lying to somebody else
trying to find the one thing i cant find for myself
when hes touching you really touching you
are you feeling me

verse 2
oh when hes touching you are you feeling me
are you feeling me
are you feeling me
oh are you feeling me
girl are you feeling me
oh when hes touching youembed"
