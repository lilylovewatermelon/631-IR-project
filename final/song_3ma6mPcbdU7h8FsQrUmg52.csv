yesterday i thought that i was low as i could get
i had hit rock bottom ever since you up and left
but this morning when i saw you with
somebody else well needless to say
thats when i started sinking even lower
and as far as where i am at today

chorus
theres two feet of topsoil
a little bit of bedrock limestone in between
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then theres me

i was kind of hoping i could dig my way back out
a couple dozen roses maybe get you back somehow
but the love in your eyes as you talked to him
today was plain to see
so i am not going to get involved but
should you change your mind
well you know right where ill be

chorus
theres two feet of topsoil
a little bit of bedrock limestone in between
a fossilized dinosaur
a little patch of crude oil
a thousand feet of granite underneath
then theres mesee brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeembed"
