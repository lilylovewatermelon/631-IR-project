chorus
i used to be with stealers and killers and murderers and burglars
and even though im rich i still keep em near me
i gotta change my surroundings and everybody who around me
it seem like shit dont go right when they with me
i used to be with stealers and killers and murderers and burglars
but now im gettin further i dont want no dealings

verse
used to be fucked up bout my niggas and my bitches
but they took me up through there a few times now i aint got no feelin
my aunty told me slow down you in an еlite division
my uncle told me gеt from round them niggas dont like you in it
had to get put in this position to see it myself
i forgot about me i was taking care of everybody else
i was in the cell and i was hollerin at my nigga ced
on the vent he said he heard them niggas want me dead
i called home they said his friends got hit in the head
i hope you never change we sniper gang until the end
my brother my cousin my niggas down there in the feds
even though he aint ride for me every chance i get ima send you bread
you aint gotta remind me how to be real i already know how i play
look at us now my nigga remember when we was smoking red
miss cammy miss red lil dt thats my brother too
i know what i said hurt you but you had hurt me too
im drankin purple juice in the studio and spinnin round
rocking that gshock in the cell block you killing time
im from the no they already know how i be getting down
i switched my flow on them lil niggas who tried to steal my sound
im taking losses back to back i heard them say i lost
numbers back up fuck everybody who countin out
im going up top this shit got hot i had to switch the route
im the one who made the way niggas tried to play like they forgot
i was out the door when i was a youngin i aint have no money
by the time the fame came none of these things aint mean nothing
im on the ugly how i used to
but its just now all my thuggin be on youtube
this shit aint changed me nigga it changed yall
i been on the same block for three days with the same drawers
so whats up nigga what it is
redid the guts on the chevy chevelle
i was lookin up to cool as a shorty
i wanted to walk like that nigga all ears when he talkin
the whole project used to scream free pac
did thirteen his face clean everybody loved him he solid
ever since malcolm elementary everybody knew id be in penitentiary
and the way everybody switchin i know god got somethin for me so i aint fuckin trippinyou might also like2embed"
