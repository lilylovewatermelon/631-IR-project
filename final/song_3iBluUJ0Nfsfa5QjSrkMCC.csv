stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air he held the bowl aloft and intoned

—introibo ad altare dei
halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely

—come up kinch come up you fearful jesuit

solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak

buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly

—back to barracks he said sternly

he added in a preachers tone

—for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns slow music please shut your eyes gents one moment a little trouble about those white corpuscles silence all

he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points chrysostomos two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm

—thanks old chap he cried briskly that will do nicely switch off the current will you

he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips
—the mockery of it he said gaily your absurd name an ancient greek

he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck

buck mulligans gay voice went on

—my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it tripping and sunny like the buck himself we must go to athens will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid

he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried

—will he come the jejune jesuit

ceasing he began to shave with care

—tell me mulligan stephen said quietly

—yes my love

—how long is haines going to stay in this tower

buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder

—god isnt he dreadful he said frankly a ponderous saxon he thinks youre not a gentleman god these bloody english bursting with money and indigestion because he comes from oxford you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner he cant make you out o my name for you is the best kinch the knifeblade

he shaved warily over his chin
—he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said where is his guncase
—a woful lunatic mulligan said were you in a funk

—i was stephen said with energy and growing fear out here in the dark with a man i dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther you saved men from drowning im not a hero however if he stays on here i am off

buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily

—scutter he cried thickly

he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said

—lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor

stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly then gazing over the handkerchief he said

—the bards noserag a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen you can almost taste it cant you

he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly

—god he said quietly isnt the sea what algy calls it a grey sweet mother the snotgreen sea the scrotumtightening sea epi oinopa ponton ah dedalus the greeks i must teach you you must read them in the original thalatta thalatta she is our great sweet mother come and look

stephen stood up and went over to the parapet leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown

—our mighty mother buck mulligan said
he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face

—the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you

—someone killed her stephen said gloomily

—you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said im hyperborean as much as you but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her and you refused there is something sinister in you

he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek a tolerant smile curled his lips

—but a lovely mummer he murmured to himself kinch the loveliest mummer of them all

he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously

stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting

buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade

—ah poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice i must give you a shirt and a few noserags how are the secondhand breeks

—they fit well enough stephen answered

buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip

—the mockery of it he said contentedly secondleg they should be god knows what poxy bowsy left them off i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey youll look spiffing in them im not joking kinch you look damn well when youre dressed

—thanks stephen said i cant wear them if they are grey

—he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror etiquette is etiquette he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers

he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin

stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes

—that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have gpi hes up in dottyville with connolly norman general paralysis of the insane

he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk

—look at yourself he said you dreadful bard

stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack hair on end as he and others see me who chose this face for me this dogsbody to rid of vermin it asks me too

—i pinched it out of the skivvys room buck mulligan said it does her all right the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi lead him not into temptation and her name is ursula

laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephens peering eyes

—the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said if wilde were only alive to see you

drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness

—it is a symbol of irish art the cracked lookingglass of a servant

buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them

—its not fair to tease you like that kinch is it he said kindly god knows you have more spirit than any of them

parried again he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his the cold steelpen

—cracked lookingglass of a servant tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island hellenise it
cranlys arm his arm

—and to think of your having to beg from these swine im the only one that knows what you are why dont you trust me more what have you up your nose against me is it haines if he makes any noise here ill bring down seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe

young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpes rooms palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another o i shall expire break the news to her gently aubrey i shall die with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailors shears a scared calfs face gilded with marmalade i dont want to be debagged dont you play the giddy ox with me
shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms

to ourselves new paganism omphalos

—let him stay stephen said theres nothing wrong with him except at night

—then what is it buck mulligan asked impatiently cough it up im quite frank with you what have you against me now

they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale stephen freed his arm quietly

—do you wish me to tell you he asked

—yes what is it buck mulligan answered i dont remember anything

he looked in stephens face as he spoke a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes

stephen depressed by his own voice said

—do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mothers death

buck mulligan frowned quickly and said

—what where i cant remember anything i remember only ideas and sensations why what happened in the name of god

—you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom she asked you who was in your room

—yes buck mulligan said what did i say i forget

—you said stephen answered o its only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead

a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligans cheek

—did i say that he asked well what harm is that

he shook his constraint from him nervously

—and what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own you saw only your mother die i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom its a beastly thing and nothing else it simply doesnt matter you wouldnt kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you why because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only its injected the wrong way to me its all a mockery and beastly her cerebral lobes are not functioning she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt humour her till its over you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i dont whinge like some hired mute from lalouettes absurd i suppose i did say it i didnt mean to offend the memory of your mother

he had spoken himself into boldness stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly

—i am not thinking of the offence to my mother

—of what then buck mulligan asked

—of the offence to me stephen answered
buck mulligan swung round on his heel

—o an impossible person he exclaimed

he walked off quickly round the parapet stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland sea and headland now grew dim pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks

a voice within the tower called loudly

—are you up there mulligan

—im coming buck mulligan answered

he turned towards stephen and said

—look at the sea what does it care about offences chuck loyola kinch and come on down the sassenach wants his morning rashers

his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof

—dont mope over it all day he said im inconsequent give up the moody brooding

his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead

and no more turn aside and brood
upon loves bitter mystery
for fergus rules the brazen cars
woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet white breast of the dim sea the twining stresses two by two a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide
a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords her door was open she wanted to hear my music silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside she was crying in her wretched bed for those words stephen loves bitter mystery

where now

her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang
i am the boy
that can enjoy
invisibility
phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed

and no more turn aside and brood

folded away in the memory of nature with her toys memories beset his brooding brain her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts
in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes

her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul on me alone the ghostcandle to light her agony ghostly light on the tortured face her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees her eyes on me to strike me down liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat
ghoul chewer of corpses
no mother let me be and let me live

—kinch ahoy

buck mulligans voice sang from within the tower it came nearer up the staircase calling again stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words

—dedalus come down like a good mosey breakfast is ready haines is apologising for waking us last night its all right

—im coming stephen said turning

—do for jesus sake buck mulligan said for my sake and for all our sakes

his head disappeared and reappeared

—i told him your symbol of irish art he says its very clever touch him for a quid will you a guinea i mean

—i get paid this morning stephen said

—the school kip buck mulligan said how much four quid lend us one

—if you want it stephen said

—four shining sovereigns buck mulligan cried with delight well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids four omnipotent sovereigns

he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent

o wont we have a merry time
drinking whisky beer and wine
on coronation
coronation day
o wont we have a merry time
on coronation day
warm sunshine merrying over the sea the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet why should i bring it down or leave it there all day forgotten friendship

he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes i am another now and yet the same a servant too a server of a servant

in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning

—well be choked buck mulligan said haines open that door will you

stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors

—have you the key a voice asked

—dedalus has it buck mulligan said janey mack im choked

he howled without looking up from the fire

—kinch

—its in the lock stephen said coming forward

the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered haines stood at the doorway looking out stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief

—im melting he said as the candle remarked when but hush not a word more on that subject kinch wake up bread butter honey haines come in the grub is ready bless us o lord and these thy gifts wheres the sugar o jay theres no milk

stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet

—what sort of a kip is this he said i told her to come after eight

—we can drink it black stephen said thirstily theres a lemon in the locker

—o damn you and your paris fads buck mulligan said i want sandycove milk

haines came in from the doorway and said quietly

—that woman is coming up with the milk

—the blessings of god on you buck mulligan cried jumping up from his chair sit down pour out the tea there the sugar is in the bag here i cant go fumbling at the damned eggs

he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying

—in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti

haines sat down to pour out the tea

—im giving you two lumps each he said but i say mulligan you do make strong tea dont you

buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice

—when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said and when i makes water i makes water

—by jove it is tea haines said

buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling

—so i do mrs cahill says she begob maam says mrs cahill god send you dont make them in the one pot

he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife

—thats folk he said very earnestly for your book haines five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind

he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows

—can you recall brother is mother grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads

—i doubt it said stephen gravely

—do you now buck mulligan said in the same tone your reasons pray

—i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann

buck mulligans face smiled with delight

—charming he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly do you think she was quite charming

then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf

—for old mary ann
she doesnt care a damn
but hising up her petticoats

he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned

the doorway was darkened by an entering form

—the milk sir

—come in maam mulligan said kinch get the jug

an old woman came forward and stood by stephens elbow

—thats a lovely morning sir she said glory be to god

—to whom mulligan said glancing at her ah to be sure

stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker

—the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces

—how much sir asked the old woman

—a quart stephen said

he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers old shrunken paps she poured again a measureful and a tilly old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour

—it is indeed maam buck mulligan said pouring milk into their cups

—taste it sir she said

he drank at her bidding

—if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits

—are you a medical student sir the old woman asked

—i am maam buck mulligan answered

—look at that now she said

stephen listened in scornful silence she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in gods likeness the serpents prey and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes

—do you understand what he says stephen asked her

—is it french you are talking sir the old woman said to haines

haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently

—irish buck mulligan said is there gaelic on you

—i thought it was irish she said by the sound of it are you from the west sir

—i am an englishman haines answered

—hes english buck mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland

—sure we ought to the old woman said and im ashamed i dont speak the language myself im told its a grand language by them that knows

—grand is no name for it said buck mulligan wonderful entirely fill us out some more tea kinch would you like a cup maam

—no thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go

haines said to her

—have you your bill we had better pay her mulligan hadnt we

stephen filled again the three cups

—bill sir she said halting well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling thats a shilling and one and two is two and two sir

buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets

—pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling

stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried

—a miracle

he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying

—ask nothing more of me sweet all i can give you i give

stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand

—well owe twopence he said

—time enough sir she said taking the coin time enough good morning sir

she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligans tender chant

—heart of my heart were it more
more would be laid at your feet

he turned to stephen and said

—seriously dedalus im stony hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money today the bards must drink and junket ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty

—that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today

—our swim first buck mulligan said

he turned to stephen and asked blandly

—is this the day for your monthly wash kinch

then he said to haines

—the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month

—all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf

haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke

—i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me

speaking to me they wash and tub and scrub agenbite of inwit conscience yet heres a spot

—that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good

buck mulligan kicked stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone

—wait till you hear him on hamlet haines

—well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in

—would i make any money by it stephen asked

haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said

—i dont know im sure

he strolled out to the doorway buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour

—you put your hoof in it now what did you say that for

—well stephen said the problem is to get money from whom from the milkwoman or from him its a toss up i think

—i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes

—i see little hope stephen said from her or from him

buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephens arm

—from me kinch he said

in a suddenly changed tone he added

—to tell you the gods truth i think youre right damn all else they are good for why dont you play them as i do to hell with them all let us get out of the kip

he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly

—mulligan is stripped of his garments

he emptied his pockets on to the table

—theres your snotrag he said

and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief god well simply have to dress the character i want puce gloves and green boots contradiction do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself mercurial malachi a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands

—and theres your latin quarter hat he said

stephen picked it up and put it on haines called to them from the doorway

—are you coming you fellows

—im ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door come out kinch you have eaten all we left i suppose resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow

—and going forth he met butterly

stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it he put the huge key in his inner pocket

at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked

—did you bring the key

—i have it stephen said preceding them

he walked on behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses

—down sir how dare you sir

haines asked

—do you pay rent for this tower

—twelve quid buck mulligan said

—to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder

they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last

—rather bleak in wintertime i should say martello you call it

—billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea but ours is the omphalos

—what is your idea of hamlet haines asked stephen

—no no buck mulligan shouted in pain im not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up wait till i have a few pints in me first

he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat

—you couldnt manage it under three pints kinch could you

—it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer

—you pique my curiosity haines said amiably is it some paradox

—pooh buck mulligan said we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes its quite simple he proves by algebra that hamlets grandson is shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father

—what haines said beginning to point at stephen he himself

buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephens ear

—o shade of kinch the elder japhet in search of a father

—were always tired in the morning stephen said to haines and it is rather long to tell

buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands

—the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said

—i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore that beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it

buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires

—its a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again

eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins

—i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused the father and the son idea the son striving to be atoned with the father

buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety he moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice

—im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard
my mothers a jew my fathers a bird
with joseph the joiner i cannot agree
so heres to disciples and calvary

he held up a forefinger of warning

—if anyone thinks that i amnt divine
hell get no free drinks when im making the wine
but have to drink water and wish it were plain
that i make when the wine becomes water again

he tugged swiftly at stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted

—goodbye now goodbye write down all i said
and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead
whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
and olivets breezy goodbye now goodbye

he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries

haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said

—we oughtnt to laugh i suppose hes rather blasphemous im not a believer myself that is to say still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it what did he call it joseph the joiner

—the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered

—o haines said you have heard it before

—three times a day after meals stephen said drily

—youre not a believer are you haines asked i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god

—theres only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said

haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it

—thank you stephen said taking a cigarette

haines helped himself and snapped the case to he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands

—yes of course he said as they went on again either you believe or you dont isnt it personally i couldnt stomach that idea of a personal god you dont stand for that i suppose

—you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought

he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen a wavering line along the path they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark he wants that key it is mine i paid the rent now i eat his salt bread give him the key too all he will ask for it that was in his eyes

—after all haines began

stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind

—after all i should think you are able to free yourself you are your own master it seems to me

—i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian

—italian haines said

a crazy queen old and jealous kneel down before me

—and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs

—italian haines said again what do you mean

—the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church

haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke

—i can quite understand that he said calmly an irishman must think like that i daresay we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly it seems history is to blame

the proud potent titles clanged over stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christs terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger idle mockery the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michaels host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields

hear hear prolonged applause zut nom de dieu

—of course im a britisher hainess voice said and i feel as one i dont want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either thats our national problem im afraid just now

two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman

—shes making for bullock harbour

the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain

—theres five fathoms out there he said itll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one its nine days today
the man that was drowned a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite here i am

they followed the winding path down to the creek buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water

—is the brother with you malachi

—down in westmeath with the bannons

—still there i got a card from bannon says he found a sweet young thing down there photo girl he calls her

—snapshot eh brief exposure

buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth

buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone

—seymours back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock chucked medicine and going in for the army

—ah go to god buck mulligan said

—going over next week to stew you know that red carlisle girl lily

—yes

—spooning with him last night on the pier the father is rotto with money

—is she up the pole

—better ask seymour that

—seymour a bleeding officer buck mulligan said

he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely

—redheaded women buck like goats

he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt

—my twelfth rib is gone he cried im the uebermensch toothless kinch and i the supermen

he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay

—are you going in here malachi

—yes make room in the bed

the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes haines sat down on a stone smoking

—are you not coming in buck mulligan asked

—later on haines said not on my breakfast

stephen turned away

—im going mulligan he said

—give us that key kinch buck mulligan said to keep my chemise flat

stephen handed him the key buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes

—and twopence he said for a pint throw it there

stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap dressing undressing buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly

—he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord thus spake zarathustra

his plump body plunged

—well see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish

horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon

—the ship buck mulligan cried half twelve

—good stephen said

he walked along the upwardcurving path

liliata rutilantium
turma circumdet
iubilantium te virginum

the priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly i will not sleep here tonight home also i cannot go

a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea turning the curve he waved his hand it called again a sleek brown head a seals far out on the water round
