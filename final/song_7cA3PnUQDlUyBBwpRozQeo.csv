been flyin solo for so long
nobodys singin the harmony
up there just me and my shadow
no bass no guitar no tambourine

prechorus 1
and i found you like a melody
you were singin in the same key as me
we had ‘em dancin in the streets

chorus
i dont wanna be a one man band
i dont wanna be a rolling stone alone
puttin miles on a rundown van
baby we can take our own show on the road
ill lay down the beat youll carry the tune
well get tattoos and well trash hotel rooms
baby take my hand
i dont wanna be a one man band
no

verse 2
i wanna run down your wild dreams
and i wanna chase every high with you
count every rip in these old jeans
well never learn how to sing the blues
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeprechorus 2
if im gonna be famous
girl i wanna be famous with you
we got our own little groove

chorus
i dont wanna be a one man band
i dont wanna be a rolling stone alone
puttin miles on a rundown van
baby we can take our own show on the road
ill lay down the beat youll carry the tune
well get tattoos and well trash hotel rooms
baby take my hand
cause i dont wanna be a one man band

bridge
when the spotlight goes cold and the curtains come down
the chairs are all stacked and theres no one around
and nobodys payin we’ll still be playin

chorus
i dont wanna be a one man band
i dont wanna be a rolling stone alone
puttin miles on a rundown van
baby we can take our own show on the road
ill lay down the beat youll carry the tune
well get tattoos and well trash hotel rooms
baby take my hand
cause i dont wanna be a one man band
i dont wanna be a one man band6embed"
