mother please forgive them
for they know not what they do
looking back in historys books
it seems its nothing new
oh let my mother live
heaven is for heroes
and hell is full of fools
stupidity no will to live
theyre breaking gods own rules
please let my mother live

father of all creation
i think were all going wrong
the path theyre taking
seems to be breaking
and it wont take too long
children of the future
watching empires fall
madness the cup they drink from
self destruction the toll
i had a vision l saw the world burn
and the seas had turned red
the sun had fallen the final curtain
in the land of the dead
mother please show the children
before its too late
to fight each other theres no one winning
we must fight all the hateyou might also like7embed"
