whistle for the boys now dont be shy
give us all a song and a reason why
baby got the bones and a hand me down
says her heart is black but her eyes are brown
give the boys a flash and theyll love you so
give the girl some cash cause your mother said so
and take em out to look at the queen
and any old girl whos in between

prechorus
lay yourself down by the side of the bed
oh you naughty girl you know you tickle me red
you look so dumb and you sound so twee
and you can only wish that you was married to me

chorus
well thats what you get
oh dont get upset
ridiculous you
waiting in the queue oh whoopeedoo
you could have been
the best that ive seen
under the red light
everybody knows you cried last night
you might also likeverse 2
now give us all a go til your face turns red
little greg said you went home instead
if you stick around youll get an alibi
and well try and keep your pretty face bone dry
rent a honey rent a honey one two three
keeping all the boys from your door cant be easy
well ruby said you was wrecked
but you were never well behaved the last time i checked

prechorus
lay yourself down by the side of the bed
oh you naughty girl you know you tickle me red
you look so dumb and you sound so twee
and you can only wish that you were married to me

chorus
well thats what you get
oh dont get upset
ridiculous you
waiting in the queue oh whoopeedoo
you could have been
the best that ive seen
under the red light
everybody knows you cried last night
guitar solo

prechorus

oh you naughty girl you know you tickle me red
you look so dumb and you sound so twee
and you can only wish that you were married to me

chorus
well thats what you get
oh dont get upset
ridiculous you
waiting in the queue oh whoopeedoo
you could have been
the best that ive seen
under the red light
everybody knows you cried last night
