theres lots of pretty people here sharing sotries and passing letters and
theres lots of questions answered and metaphysical astronomical songs
words printed all on papers that seem too mystical its so magical
people that dance and compute that no ones better than you

break
la la la la la la la la la la la la

verse 2
theres kings in distant cities who rule their persons and make them happy and
we wont forget about all the servisory congratulatory
even the animals know that somethings brewing and theyre all cooing
cause in the end id like to say no ones better than you

bridge
i hope youre happy now ive revealed the truth
ive even written this whole song about you
and not about me and not about me

verse 3
please dont just laugh and clap right now this is serious im not delirious
ive waited very patiently just to let you know who should run the show
cause we all know these are the facts nothing to retract nothing too abstract
concluding in this song ill say no ones better than you
no ones better than you

no ones better than you8embed"
