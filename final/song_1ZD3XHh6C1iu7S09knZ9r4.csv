so let’s get started my name is zach and i’m a dj at any bar that will have me a designer at and cofounder of a firm called skeptic a lecturer of graphic design at emmanuel college in boston and a graduate student at the dynamic media institute at the massachusetts college of art and design
today i’m going to be discussing my research about the relationship between djing and the near future of learning experiences

i’ll be telling you about some of the research that i’ve done and the things i’ve designed and in doing so attempt to illustrate and explain a dj methodology of learning i’ll then try to explain why i so firmly believe this methodology is important for us today

as a dj every time i play a gig or make a song i engage in a creative learning process by selecting which records to bring to a gig or deciding what songs to sample djs create databases and establish limits within which they play illuminating connections between database entries for themselves and their audiences

i believe that the most powerful learning experiences are indeed creative in that the learner engages in an act of creation while playing a dj set is one example of such a learning experience writing an engaging and thoughtful research paper is another

as our access to information increases no matter what we are studying our ability to manage complexity must increase our rapidly changing experiences of the world shaped like rocks by the floodwaters of data require a new methodology for learning

i believe that this new methodology is specifically a dj methodology it extends the philosophies of bricolage and constructionism by understanding that anything – ideas events characters or places – can be sampled and mixed in an exploratory creative act

dynamic media is the way in which i frame my exploration of this learning methodology the relationship between the variability and modularity of a dj set and the database of a student’s creative inquiry forms the foundation of my studio practice i design learning experiences systems and technologies in order to better understand and express the dj methodology

i’d like to begin though by going waaaaay back to 1999 and tell you about how one particular piece of technology changed my life and shaped the way i learn

this is the boss dr sample sp202 i bought it when i was 15 i couldn’t afford turntables and a mixer so when i found out that samplers were how most of the hiphop music i was listening to was being made i bought the only one i could afford the way it works is pretty simple select a number in your bank of samples press record and voila that sound has now been recorded for you to use in your own musicmaking it is now an entry in your “database” of samples

with a few different cables from radioshack i realized that i could sample practically anything around me tapes records cds tv shows conversations or live instrumentation it sparked a new sortof curiosity as my skills and understanding of music improved my sampling decisions became more intentional using different sounds for different reasons when working on a “beat” i would play samples together connecting them to one another through mixing and sequencing

more than an entree into the world of hiphopmusicmaking however the dr sample offered me a new way to think about the world the approach to musicmaking which the dr sample made possible shaped the way i approached any creative endeavor soon i found myself searching for source material and building a “database” of “samples” for everything in fact most of my essays in high school were built on attempts to extract from the given topic some “samples” or source material then connecting them to or “mixing” them with other seemingly unrelated “samples” much as i might in a musical composition

towards the end of high school i bought my first set of turntables and started to become an avid record collector several years and over a thousand records later i started “gigging” as an actual dj playing at bars around town i soon realized that djing in the more formal recordplaying sense was just like sampling and making beats it was also no different than the way i would address a design brief or an essay assignment as a dj just like as a designer and writer you have a purpose an audience and a certain set of constraints
preparing for a gig standing at home in front of my stacks of records i would begin to construct my “database” choosing four crates worth of records this is like preparing to write choosing from all your research the information that you think might help you understand your topic just like with sampling whether in making a beat or writing a paper i would select my records based on the properties of each record and how i felt it aligned with my goals for the evening my “thesis” or “point of view” if my record collection were a song my records would be samples of it

i quickly learned that to plan an entire dj set before actually showing up at the bar is a bad idea djing is about improvisation but one that requires planning skill and a deep knowledge of one’s database through a careful curation of my database i hoped to facilitate the conditions under which i could play just the right records at just the right times every night that i played a gig i created with my records a thesis a designed experience that attempted to achieve a particular goal given a certain set of constraints

the methodology through which i went about this was a process of collection sampling mixing improvisation and reflection not unlike what i did when i walked around my house as a 15year old looking for stuff to sample and then making a beat out of it or what i did when i wrote a paper or designed an identity

like i said the dr sample gave me a new way to think about the world – from music to design to research – i see everything as something that contains samples or can be sampled and all of my work exploring this space between djing and learning reflects this epistemology

the first thing that people often think of when i tell them that my work is about djing and learning is “remix” people love the word “remix” in fact we throw it around quite a bit without actually understanding what it means

i’d like to suggest that the word “remix” itself is not an adequate way to describe this dj methodology in part because it is just so difficult to define

in his book remix lawrence lessig defines the term in several different ways first lessig emphasizes the nature of remix as an act of synthesis drawing a parallel between remix and the writing of a great legal brief the best briefs are meaningful syntheses of information not merely a quick “copypaste” job

soon though lessig’s definition begins to loosen calling the “right to quote” the same as the right to “remix” removing the act of synthesis from the process entirely 56

when discussing the work of the dj girl talk lessig states that “sounds are being used like paint on a palette but all the paint has been scratched off of other paintings” 70

soon lessig states that “remix is ‘just collage’” 70

eventually he says that “remixed media succeed when they show others something new they fail when they are trite or derivative a good  remix draws upon the work of others in order to do new work” 82

eduardo navas’ research echoes this sentiment navas focuses on two particular types of remix regressive and regenerative regressive remixes are allegorical relying on the spectacular nature of that which is being remixed these are almost exclusively the musical remixes we hear all the time
we celebrate a remix of a beyonce song to a great degree specifically because it is a remix of a beyonce song in this way regressive remixes do not generate new value they do not “do new work”

in opposition to the regressive remix the regenerative remix is intended specifically to do new work navas gives the example of software mashups as regenerative remixes the software mashup does something that neither of the softwares being mashed up could do on its own in navas’ definition of regenerative remix sampling becomes supplanted by a computational “constant updating”
though valuable for web applications a “constant updating” a deluge of data becomes a challenge for critical reflection navas this challenge presents a unique opportunity for the design of new systems of limitation that relate directly to sampling and djing it is this opportunity that i explore in my work

what i believe is important to glean from navas’ theory of regenerative remix is something in the vein of lessig’s “good” remix – the ability to do new work to create value through synthesis this more general interpretation of regenerative remix is fundamental to my understanding of why the dj methodology of learning is valuable

if the language surrounding the practice of djing is so important to the way i discuss the dj methodology of learning then the language surrounding learning experiences becomes equally if not more important i’ve already mentioned this term creative learning a few times without defining it or describing how exactly djing is a creative learning experience i look to mitch resnick and sherry turkle’s framework for creative learning experiences based on the structure of their class at the mit media lab which i took in the fall of 2011 they dedicate the class to understanding the term though at its most basic it means learning through the act of creation

resnick defines creative learning as a “spiral”like process that includes five steps that repeat indefinitely each pass through the process builds on the previous one these steps are imagine create play share and reflect with this reflection informing future imagination in my work as a dj i constantly experience this process

in addition to the spiral the components of creative learning experiences fall into 11 general categories there are two of these categories—objects and construction—that to understand the way in which i interpret their relationship to djing is to understand the foundation for the experiences i have designed

the first of these is “objects” interacting with material things and not just abstract concepts is a central tenant of creative learning resnick and turkle value objects as “thingstothinkwith” celebrating a connected concrete thinking that brings “together thought and feeling” turkle evocative objects

the objects that function in this way bringing together thought and feeling are evocative objects
“objects” can also include computational objects such as computers software and building blocks of code with which learners might interact for example when playing with the software scratch resnick computational objects argues turkle share a quality of betweenness that is similar to the way in which a transitional object exists in a psychological space between self and other for a child
records are pieces of vinyl and as such they are most certainly “objects” part of the physical world but what about a song or a sample i can’t touch a sound but i can manipulate it like turkle’s evocative objects samples became for me “things to think with”

by making beats i traveled around the world back in time learning both about the properties of music and sound as well as about the world and culture music represents ideas – whether a musical idea eg a certain frequency range or a theoretical idea eg cumbia music representing evolving cultural relationships in columbia manipulating music allows for exploration with the ideas that the musical object itself represents

in mixing and manipulating samples and records i am engaging in an act of construction with objects the philosophy of constructionism was pioneered by seymour papert who argued that we construct knowledge by constructing in the world children’s machine p 142143 it is an evolution of claude levistrauss’ bricolage which is a sortof “making do with what you have” in order to solve a problem
a condition of construction according to papert is that “the product can be shown discussed examined probed and admired” p 142 beats and mixes exist in this way though they are not physical products that can be held they are indeed constructions

wayne marshall influential dj blogger and harvard ethnomusicologist has pioneered and advocated for “musically expressed ideas about music” as a pedagogical practice marshall and even coined a fauxspanish term for it  musikeando his mashups dj sets and remixes are learning experiences for him – reflective and critical explorations of ideas about music here’s a condensed example of one of his musical research projects and a great time for me to take a drink of water
samples are evocative objects for the djs that work with them for wayne samples are the building blocks for musicallyexpressed learning experiences and thesis statements samples also stand for other ideas for the cultures from which they come the time periods during which they were created the geographical locations from which they originate although he is expressing ideas about music through music wayne is also expressing ideas about the things represented by the music

technology has enabled wayne’s practice of musikeando now more than ever before consumers of content are also creators of content
this is not just the case in music but in video imagemaking and the written word we have the power to critically engage in the experience of content through creation with the democratization of sophisticated production technologies and the subsequent rise of mashup culture further blurring the line between creator and consumer

for wayne sampling becomes a way to construct ideas and the samples within a sampler the construction kit i believe his concept of musikeando can extend to every type of media
i would like to suggest that sampling and djing can be leveraged in the service of the creation of mediaagnostic conceptual construction kits that facilitate creative learning experiences that lead to critical inquiry and eventually regenerative remixes of content

that was a mouthful and to show you exactly what i mean by that runonsentence i’d like to discuss a few projects that i’ve worked on

the first is called not coincidentally sampler sampler is a conceptual prototype for a research tool and service a platform to catalyze the process of selection sampling and mixing in hopes of revealing previously hidden connections between pieces of information it is based rather explicitly on the interface and experience of the dr sample

video of sampler prototype

one of the features or nonfeatures of the technology on which i based this project my old dr sample was indeed its technological limitations these limitations engendered creative approaches to my musicmaking practice if i found myself beginning to work on one song with a certain set of samples and started to work on a different song i was forced to delete some samples from the first i would often find that samples from each set sounded perfect when mixed

the way that the limitations of early sampling technology facilitated serendipitous musical experiences is an inspiration for my current work that limitations can engender innovative solutions is by no means a novel concept nachmanovich as technology progresses and the horizon of the possible continues to recede however it becomes more difficult for us to impose potentially fruitful limiting experiences on ourselves

in considering the way my dr sample acted as a construction kit that facilitated serendipitous musicmaking experiences for me i began to wonder about the potential for the dr sample to become a model for a conceptual construction kit could learners see samples of ideas or events as things with which they could build an argument or a new idea could the interface and the interaction create a spontaneous improvisational experience of facilitated serendipity and help users see and explore connections between content that they might never have otherwise noticed

what you saw in the video was a functional prototype of the system but the sampler project seems to have some potential beyond the limited amount of user testing that i’ve done a colleague said that she would love to use such a tool in the design history class she teaches pointing out that it would help her students draw connections between what happens in design and what happens in culture at large other educators have mentioned that they are interested in sampler as a way to help students understand similarly broad and obscured relationships between certain disciplines and wider cultural phenomena

sampler is a statement about a compromise between computation and human input it is about an engagement with computation and a set of limitations that forces the user to become creative – to look at problems and ideas in new ways in order to come up with an innovative take on a set of information

i called my parents when i was working on the sampler project to see if they could find my old dr sample they couldn’t i took it to a friend’s house years ago to do a recording session but i don’t remember what happened to it afterward

i was so enthralled with my newly purchased ableton live software and my new macbook pro that at the time i might have figured the dr sample didn’t matter to my music anymore something about my music changed however when so much more of it was made directly on my computer the way in which technology mediated my experience had shifted and everything was possible

my entire itunes library sat there – i had more effects more samples more songs to sample more tracks to use more places to store samples than i ever had before it was so exciting and yet there was a “rawness” as one of my friends best described it that faded away

there are ways of making which become easier when overwhelmed by possibility we rely so heavily on software to facilitate meaningful musicmaking experiences the design of the software the varying processor power required by different actions the hierarchy of the system and many other computational factors – intentionally or not – guide musicmakers towards making certain actions and decisions without even knowing it

experimental jetset a design firm based in the netherlands has said that they are interested in the idea of “the function of a design as an embodiment of ideology” when you think about it this saying can help illuminate the connections between an experience or object the powers that influenced the creation of the experience or object and the way that experience or object influences those who interact with it – whether it is a piece of musicmaking software or a nation’s education system

i started to consider the implications of this overreliance on computation to generate meaningful experiences of content when i was drinking beer with a friend of mine who is a high school teacher he told me his students were having a difficult time synthesizing information and creating specific arguable thesis statements for their papers

his students digital natives from primarily uppermiddle class families could find any piece of information they wanted about a particular topic they had access to online journals to countless resources in their school to websites and history books overwhelmed by their access to information however they relied too heavily on technology to help them make meaning from this information that the technology was so crucial in helping them access in the first place

together my friend and i designed a conceptual prototype research tool to help his students mix and synthesize research and create specific arguable thesis statements for papers in the interface designs and in the paper prototyping we did with his high school students we explored this dj process of collection selection connection mixing reflection and iteration

through the design of a prototype as well as user testing even in an analog form we found that we had designed an experience that students found valuable some students told us that our experiment had been helpful to them in clarifying ideas for their research papers

one student as she was working on her paper prototype exclaimed “it’s turning into something” she had begun to create a regenerative remix of her research

like my friend’s students we are overwhelmed with data bombarded by information  we’ve heard this all too often in a world of constant computational updating whether in our stocks or our social networks it becomes difficult to extract oneself from this cycle of nowness

much like status updates the nowness of quantifiable metrics such as grades leveling badges and standardized testing as well as practical skills that make students employable such as checklists of skills and softwares become attractive ways to assess and think about learning we lose our ability to look holistically beyond the now to see the benefit in what we can’t easily understand or analyze computationally at this moment

we lose our faith in our own ability to make meaning and invest this ability in our digital companions as we create more facebook posts more metrics for evaluating learning more quantifiable ways to understand a baseball player’s effectiveness our increasing ability to handle vast amounts of information computationally becomes an attractive way to handle any type of information the information we produce then begins to cater to the way it is parsed

this problem is exacerbated in the age of big data where companies like ibm have designed a veritable army of “solutions” to help us make meaning from it all meanwhile jer thorp in an article in the harvard business review argues that for us to truly harness the power of big data we need a “reframing of data into a human context”

now i’m not entirely sure what he means by this but the ways in which our overreliance on computation has shaped the currently notsohuman context of our data go far beyond what we might refer to as “big data” and pose a problem deeper than thorpe’s calltoaction will likely be able to affect

nicholas carr argues that “when we look at a product recommended to us by amazon or netflix we’re following a script… these scripts can be ingenious and extraordinarily useful… but they also mechanize the messy processes of intellectual exploration” carr is describing a loss of the capacity to make information meaningful we have given over that power to computation and have allowed ourselves to believe that the most important type of meaning is machinereadable not merely at the scale of big data but at every scale even at a scale that might be considered well human

what i noticed in both the sampler and synthesis projects what made me excited was that the products of those experiences yielded information that seemed to escape machinereadability if only slightly users created regenerative remixes that were more humanreadable

through interactions with these conceptual construction kits learners were engaged in experiences of critical thinking and critical reflection much in the same way as wayne marshall described his experiences with music

i began to wonder how these experiences of critical thinking could translate into the graphic design classes i teach dr meredith davis argues that design education should not be dominated by an ideology that “views complexity as a problem to be overcome through reductivist artifacts” she argues that design education should focus instead on making the complex meaningful inspired by dr davis’ work and the synthesis and sampler projects i attempted to create an assignment for my graphic design students using the dj methodology of learning

while focusing on fostering students’ critical thinking skills the manipulative media project i run with my firstyear design students also helps them learn photoshop

i give the students three quotes from which each student selects one to research limitation
the students then research their quotes and come to class with at least ten pieces of research represented by notecards or postits along with urls or printed sources collection sampling facilitated serendipity

students work to draw connections between these pieces of research asking not only which pieces were connected but how they were connected by the end of the first week of this project students have developed a “thesis statement” based on their analysis mixing

for the remainder of the project students work to visually communicate this thesis through the mixing and manipulation of imagery in photoshop eventually constructing a triptych of images that serves as a visual thesis mixing and reflection

in giving this project i have seen students gain valuable insight into themselves their interests and the world around them through creative and critical inquiries facilitated by the dj methodology by establishing sets of limitations within which students found serendipitous connections between content the manipulative media assignment helps students create humanreadable meaning through the making of digital artwork

now all of this is not to say that technologicallymediated experiences are bad and the dj methodology is by no means a wholesale rejection of the importance of technological progress in fact i’ve incorporated emerging technologies into nearly everything i do

my work has also celebrated the ability for computation to mediate interactions and help us make new meaning sometimes meaning that maybe even our brains don’t understand but maybe our muscles do

rb rd for example is a prototype for a gestural musicmaking experience that facilitates embodied learning teaching users about properties of electronic music computation and computer vision technology paired with motor memory tacit knowledge and a “learning by doing” approach to musical experience could become a powerful tool for understanding principles of electronic music
here’s a quick peek at some of the various prototypes and user testing i’ve done

video of rb rd prototypes

imagine a teenager downloading a free software to his computer plugging in his kinect and immediately being able to play around making music with his body using stock sounds and effects an interface helps this kid understand what properties of which sounds he’s affecting with which joints as his knowledge of music becomes more sophisticated he learns through the online community that he can easily swap out the stock sounds for his own and can map different types of effects and properties of sound to different joints soon he has programmed his own gestural musicmaking experience and performs for his friends he contributes regularly to the online community giving tutorials and comments

in this way rb rd is a celebration of the way computation can facilitate experiences that become meaningful for learners it is a kinesthetic embodied learning experience some of the meaning that learners derive from this experience is qualitative – it’s maybe not so machinereadable

though emerging immersive learning technologies are creating powerful learning experiences for students across the country some get evaluated quantitatively through the lens of machinereadability assessing “number of utterances” of key phrases during user interactions for example birchfield
it is no coincidence that as we have invested computation with so much meaningmaking power our education system is increasingly designed for machinereadability whether through tests grades badges or other systems the underlying ideologies driving the design of the american education system have shifted argues david labaree from the goal of democratic equality a qualitative experience to a marketoriented combination of social efficiency and social mobility the social efficiency goal says labaree is about training students to become workers while the social mobility goal is about the individual student as a consumer of education with education itself becoming a marketbased good together the social mobility and social efficiency goals “portray education as a mechanism for adapting students to the market”

as the power of computation to process large amounts of data increases we continue to find develop and manufacture metrics by which we can “measure” the effectiveness of education just like we measure markets and just like we cater our contentcreation to machinereadability we cater the creation of our learning systems to machinereadability stem education and the increasing popularity of “badges” are two examples

the social efficiency and social mobility ideologies have shaped the way educators and policymakers view science education science is bundled says larry moran a professor of biochemistry with technology engineering and math education as if all four are the same and should serve the same purposes moran argues however that “the goal of true science education should be no different than the educational goals in history philosophy or english literature it’s supposed to teach you how to think critically”

critical thinking skills however are more difficult to quantify while lab results and technical competencies are not moran ends his essay in clear defiance of the dangerous pairing of the social efficiency and social mobility goals

physics is not about sending spaceships to mars
geology is not about finding oil
chemistry is not about better plastics
biology is not about drugs

the increasing interest in adding the arts to create steam education may help but the question of what ideologies drive the resulting curricula remains

online learning experiences not facilitated by organizations with inherent ties to the american education system are often still plagued by the marketdriven educational ideologies and easytocompute metrics take the recent interest in online badges online badges are said to be representative of an accomplishment skill quality or interest an online record of achievement that tracks the community that issued the badge and the work completed to get it mozilla
though some have advocated badges as a way to present a “nuanced” picture of a person’s learning and abilities badges are fundamentally binary a 1 or a zero a yes or a no easy to compute advocates of badges also claim that they provide motivation to learn though wellintentioned i worry that by leveraging behaviorist approaches to motivation through the dissemination of a binary badge system however advocates of badges open the door for future employers to assess potential employees through a simple binary evaluation process whoever has the most 1s gets the job who needs interviewers when all you need is a computer learning is a commodity to be consumed and this helps the market as a whole function more efficiently

i doubt that the increasing influence on learning and education of the marketbased goals of social efficiency and social mobility is a coincidence i believe that it is connected overtly and implicitly to the increasing power of computation and our increasing faith that computation will help us make meaning from the overwhelming amount of data with which we are faced

today we increasingly design for machine readability whether we are designing our own internet identities on tumblr and facebook creating ecommerce sites seo is a prime example of design for machinereadability or creating web applications that interface with several different apis the data deluge our perceived inability to cope with it the steadily increasing power of computation to do more for us coupled with our reliance on computational meaningmaking have shifted our ideas about who or what we are designing for in userexperience design our users are no longer just human we have started to design algorithms to interact with other algorithms not with us
kevin slavin in his keynote “those algorithms that govern our lives” at the 2011 lift conference discusses the way we write algorithms and then give over our power to those algorithms these algorithms communicate with one another and leave humans as bystanders merely there to watch the interaction and evolution of systems that cater more and more to things that aren’t human

one of the most astounding examples he cites of the influence that machinereadable meaning wields over our lives and an indicator of its future impact on the design of both our physical and digital realities is the relationship between algorithmic trading in the stock market and the manhattan cityscape he states that the image of a city is now “a network topology” and uses the example of realestate prices skyrocketing in manhattan near 60 hudson street the carrier hotel one of the world’s largest internet hubs because some 70 of today’s trading is done algorithmically the closer a company’s data center is to the carrier hotel the fewer milliseconds it takes for a trade to go through

these minuscule periods of time are infinitely valuable costing or earning companies tens of millions of dollars because our trading is done by the communication of algorithms to one another we have become bystanders to realestate prices effectively slavin says new york city is being optimized to run like a motherboard

unlike the design of systems that facilitate the communication of algorithms with one another djing is a peculiarly human activity it is a communication between people though mediated by technologies at its best it is a different sort of mediation douglas rushkoff asserts that there are certain aspects of humanity that are subtle and weird things that can’t be assigned a value or coded “this obsessive need to nail it all down” he says “denies us access to all of these other great tools for observation which are subtler weirder tools”  these subtle weird tools are not only tools for observation dj sets that surprise and delight the audience with unexpected beautiful and conceptually compelling connections are the result of these subtle weird tools so are creative wellcrafted insightful research papers these subtle weird tools are tools for the making of humanreadable meaning

i believe that djing acknowledges the magic of being human – that as performers musicians producers and artists we engage our subtle weird tools to create meaningful experiences djing fights therefore the homogeny and hegemony of the algorithms that are shaping our lives slavin the dj methodology of learning is about leveraging algorithms in a way that allows us to use our uniquely human capabilities to create meaning for ourselves it’s about using the things that make us human the connections that we intuit that we can’t quite articulate right away to ask better questions to engage in more deep and meaningful inquiry

our perceived inability to cope with the deluge of data our faith in computation to make meaning for us and the influence of marketbased goals of education and learning which are inextricably connected with machinereadability have helped us strip ourselves of the ability to think critically i
believe there is a gap an absence of an advocacy for deep learning that requires synthesis this gap is felt when law students write sloppy briefs it is felt when history students submit poorly organized papers that lack specific arguable thesis statements it is also felt outside of schools when employees are unknowingly dissuaded from pursuing a solution because their actions are being eversosubtly guided by the underlying computational architecture of the software they are using the missing advocacy for learning that requires critical thinking and synthesis is indicative of a givingover of our powers of analysis and synthesis to algorithms to these things that are not trying to create meaning for humans of course because they are not human

the challenge we face is to find ways to utilize and leverage data to create meaning for humans meaning that goes beyond semantics and metadata we are beginning to find ourselves in a world governed not by our interpretations of information but rather the interpretation of information by algorithms that we developed but of which we are neither the audience nor the users we are blind to this shift because we increasingly and unknowingly embed this ideology into the learning experiences and educational systems that we design

the dj methodology is a step in combating this danger while being built on experiences that reference or engage with computation its creative application of computation and algorithm refrains from investing technology with the power to make meaning rather it endeavors to facilitate the human application of our subtle weird tools helping humans illuminate new connections synthesize information and create humanreadable meaning i hope that the dj methodology can lead to the design of learning experiences that address the increasing complexity and connectedness of our world in order to generate meaning that is truly human readable

thank you
