outside of me theres no one there
there was never a chance that you could care
im seeing visions in my dreams
of all the things you think ill be

chorus
thats the thing it means everything to me
but i cant bring myself to be that way just yet

verse 2
its been a long time between us
and i always know its what you want
im opening up to let you down
im sorry i cant be that right now

chorus
forgive me i just wanted to feel free
sometimes i feel i might have made your life a mess
thats the thing it means everything to me
i cant bring myself to be that way just yet
hey

guitar solo
