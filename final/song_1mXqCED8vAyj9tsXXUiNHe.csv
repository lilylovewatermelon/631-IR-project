the man of a thousand faces
sits down at the table
eats a small lump of sugar
and smiles at the moon like he knows her

verse 2
he begins his quiet ascension
without anyones sturdy instruction
to a place of no religion
has found a path to our alikeness

verse 3
his words are quiet like stains are
on a tablecloth washed in a river
stains that are trying to cover for each other
or at least blend in with the pattern

bridge
good is better than perfect
scrub till your fingers are bleeding
and im crying for things that
i tell others to do without crying

verse 4
he used to go to his favorite bookstores
and rip out his favorite pages
and stuff em into his breast pocket
and the moon to him was a stranger

now he sits down at a table
right next to the window
and begins his quiet ascension
without anyones sturdy instruction

verse 6
to a place with no religion
has found a path to our alikeness
and eats a small lump of sugar
and smiles at the moon like he knows her2embed"
