love such a lonely place
nobody wants to be alone
to have the world but no one to share it with

verse
i am so alone
i cant stand this feeling of being without you
yes ill do
whatever it takes to prove i truly love you
dont let me go
lets stay together
forever and ever
cant sleep without you by my side
