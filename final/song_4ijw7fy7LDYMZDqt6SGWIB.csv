if you’re travelin in the north country fair
where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
remember me to one who lives there
for she once was a true love of mine

verse 2
if you go when the snowflakes storm
when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see she has a coat so warm
to keep her from the howling winds

verse 3
please see if her hair hangs long
if it rolls and flows all down her breast
please see for me if her hairs hangin long
for that’s the way i remember her best

verse 4
i’m awondering if she remembers me at all
many times i’ve often prayed
in the darkness of my night
in the brightness of my day
