well i aint sure but ive been told hes baking cakes inside our souls
stayed awake took a nap got myself my bottles back
im breaking them out on the street walking around in my bare feet
i do not need you to tell me that i am not a cat

verse 2
i caught a ride we caught some air hes never gonna cut his hair
it takes more time to make a fake we night swam down in the lake
and washed the dirt off our intentions
prattled on about bad inventions

verse 3
i came as ice i came as a whore
i came as advice that came too sure
i came as gold i came as crap
i came clean and i came as a rat
it takes a long time but god dies too
but not before hell stick it to you

chorus
well i dont know but i been told
youll never die when youll never grow old
heyoh yo heyoh yo heyoh yo
heyoh heyoooooh

i came as a call i came as flat
i came too soon so i came back
i came as flowers i came as nice
i came as dirt and i came as a surprise
it takes a long time but god dies too
but not before hell stick it to you

chorus
i dont know but i been told
youll never die when youll never grow old
heyoh yo heyoh yo heyoh yo
heyoh heyoooooh
heyoh yo heyoh yo heyoh yo
heyoh heyooooohembed"
