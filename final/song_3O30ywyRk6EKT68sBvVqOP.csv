jesus christ girl
what are people going to think
when i show up to one of several funerals
ive attended for grandpa this week
with you with me
but someones got to help me dig
someones got to help me dig

verse 2
jesus christ girl
it hasnt been long so it seems
since i was picking out an island and a tomb for you
at the hollywood cemetery
you kiss on me
but we should let this dead guy sleep
we should let this dead guy sleep

verse 3
jesus christ girl
i laid up for hours in a daze
retracing the expanse of your american back
with adderall and weed in my veins
you came i think
because the marble made my cheeks look pink
but im unsure of so many things

someones got to help me dig
someones got to help me dig12embed"
