i wish i found some better sounds no ones ever heard
i wish i had a better voice that sang some better words
i wish i found some chords in an order that is new
i wish i didnt have to rhyme every time i sang
i was told when i get older all my fears would shrink
but now im insecure and i care what people think

prechorus
my names blurryface and i care what you think
my names blurryface and i care what you think

chorus
wish we could turn back time time to the good old days
when our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out out
oh wish we could turn back time oh to the good old days oh
when our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out out out out out
were stressed out out out out out

verse 2
sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when i was young
how come im never able to identify where its comin from
id make a candle out of it if i ever found it
try to sell it never sell out of it id probably only sell one
itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
same clothes homegrown a stones throw from a creek we used to roam
but it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter

used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughin at our face

used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughin at our face
sayin wake up you need to make money yeah
