damnall i could do all i could say
is that im sorry

verse 1
ohhh you should of shown me a little more love
but still there aint no reason
for me to walk out on this thing called us
but you keep giving me the feeling

cussing me out in front of my friends not giving a damn on how i feel

and you dont even know
how many times i asked your momma what i should do
and its my fault

i got bad news that i gotta break to you
i know you gonna act a fool but i gotta let her know
