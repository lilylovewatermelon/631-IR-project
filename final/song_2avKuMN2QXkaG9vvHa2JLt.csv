verse 1
all the tension in the world today
all the little girls fillin up the world today
when the good comes to bad the bad comes to good
but ima live my life like i should like i should
now all the critics wanna hit it
ya shit can how we did it just because they dont get it
but ill stay fitted new era committed
now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
but do we always gotta cry
do we always gotta live inside a lie
lifes just a blast thats movin really fast
you better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
follow me into a solo
remember that kid so what you wanna do
and where you gonna run when youre starin down the cable of a
mic pointed at your grill like a gun

so dont be upset when youre broke and youre done
cause ima be the one till i jet ima be the one till i jet

verse 2 fred durst
does anybody really know the secret
or the combination for this life and where they keep it
its kinda sad when you dont know the meanin
but everything happens for a reason everything happens for a reason
i dont even know what i should say
cause im an idiot a loser microphone abuser
i analyze every second i exist
beatin up my mind every second with my fists
and everybody wanna run wanna run
everybody wanna hide from the gun hide from the gun
you can take that ride through this life if you want
but you cant take the edge off the knife no sir
and now you want your money back your money back
but youre denied cause your brains fried from the sack
and there aint nothin i can do
cause life is a lesson you learn it when youre through
