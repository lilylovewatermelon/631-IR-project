la la lala yeah
wait til i get my money right

verse 1 kanye west
i had a dream i could buy my way to heaven
when i awoke i spent that on a necklace
i told god id be back in a second
man its so hard not to act reckless
to whom much is given much is tested
get arrested guess until he get the message
i feel the pressure under more scrutiny
and what i do act more stupidly
bought more jewelry more louis v
my mama couldnt get through to me
the drama people suing me
im on tv talking like its just you and me
im just saying how i feel man
i aint one of the cosbys i aint go to hillman
i guess the money shouldve changed him
i guess i shouldve forgot where i came from

verse 3 kanye west
let the champagne splash let that man get cash
let that man get past
he dont even stop to get gas
if he can move through the rumors
he can drive off of fumes cause
how he move in a room full of nos
how he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
so when he buried in a tomb full of gold
treasure whats your pleasure
life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
so if the devil wear prada adam eve wear nada
im in between but way more fresher
with way less effort
cause when you try hard thats when you die hard
your homies looking like why god
when they reminisce over you my god
