feeling so faithless lost under the surface
i dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

prechorus chester bennington  mike shinoda

every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow

ive become so numb i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you

holding too tightly afraid to lose control

every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take
