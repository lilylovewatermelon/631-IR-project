one foot on the bus bout half past nine
i knew that you were leavin this time
i thought about layin down in its path
thinking that you might get off for that
i remember that night we laid in bed
namin all our kids that we hadnt had yet
one for your grandma and one for mine
said wed draw straws when it came time

chorus
ill move on baby just like you
when the desert floods and the grass turns blue
when a sailin ship dont need her moon
itll break my heart but ill get through
someday when i stop loving you

verse 2
i bet all i had on a thing called love
i guess in the end it wasnt enough
and its hard to watch you leave right now
im gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
somehow

chorus
ill move on baby just like you
when the desert floods and the grass turns blue
when a sailin ship dont need her moon
itll break my heart but ill get through
someday when i stop loving you

chorus
ill move on baby just like you
when the desert floods and the grass turns blue
when a sailin ship dont need her moon
itll break my heart but ill get through
someday when i stop lovin you

someday when i stop lovin you
