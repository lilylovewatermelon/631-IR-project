i cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
i screamed his name til the neighbors called the cops
i numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
dont know what i did next all i know i couldnt stop

verse 2
word got around to the barflies and the baptists
my mamas phone started ringin off the hook
i can hear her now sayin she aint gonna have it
dont matter how you feel it only matters how you look

chorus
go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
cause i raised you better gotta keep it together
even when you fall apart
but this aint my mamas broken heart

verse 3
i wish i could be just a little less dramatic
like a kennedy when camelot went down in flames
leave it to me to be holding the matches
when the fire trucks show up and theres nobody else to blame

verse 4
cant get revenge and keep a spotless reputation ah
sometimes revenges just a choice you gotta make ah
my mama came from a softer generation
where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
cause i raised you better gotta keep it together
even when you fall apart
but this aint my mamas broken heart

bridge
powder your nose paint your toes
line your lips and keep em closed
cross your legs dot your eyes
and never let em see you cry

chorus
go and fix your make up well its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start actin like a lady
cause i raised you better gotta keep it together
even when you fall apart
but this aint my mamas broken heart13embed"
