oh maybe i just wasnt good enough
to blow your mind you know i tried
them silver lines they cut like blades of glass
not worth the blood weve shed for love

pre chorus
so give it up stop beating
hearts have gone cold
had enough repeating
its all been done before

give it up start beating
hearts have gone cold
hey now
when we gonna wake up

chorus
but fools gold shines like diamonds in her eyes
thought we had a million
but baby we got nothing
fools gold shines like words that make us cry
we just keep on digging
find us something better for the next time next time
something better for the next time next time

so maybe i was just not strong enough
to tow the line make true the lies
the fortune found now its all locked away
weve lost the key hard to believe

prechorus
so give it up start beating
hearts have gone cold

chorus
but fools gold shines like diamonds in her eyes
thought we had a million
but baby we got nothing
fools gold shines like words that make us cry
we just keep on digging
