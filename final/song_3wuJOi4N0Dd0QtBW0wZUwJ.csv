chairs thrown and tables toppled
hands armed with broken bottles
standing no chance to win but
were not running were not running

verse 1
theres a point i think were missing
its in the air we raise our fists in
in the smiles we cast each other
my sister my brother
about the time we gave up hoping
wed ever find these locks still open
stumbling on stones unturned
the hurt we feel we all have earned
the lines we cross in search of change
but all they see is treason

chorus
although we have no obligation to stay alive
on broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive
break out i wont be left here
behind closed doors

verse 2
bonfires burn like beacons
guiding the lost and weakened
flames dance on crashing waves
guiding ships whove gone astray
time out lets stop and think this through
weve all got better things to do
than talk in circles run in place
answers are inches from our face

although we have no obligation to stay alive
on broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive
break out i wont be left here
behind closed doors

bridge
black eyes broken fingers
blood drips and i let it run
down my lips into my swollen gums
when hope is nonexistent
our instincts all scream run
we never turn our backs or even bite our tongues

chorus
although we have no obligation to stay alive
on broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive
break out i wont be left here
behind closed doors
although we have no obligation to stay alive
on broken backs we beg for mercy we will survive
break out i wont be left here
behind closed doors5embed"
