sittin on the counter in your kitchen
can you hear my heartbeat fucking kickin
your eyes light up cause you best believe that i got something up my sleeve
i walk my talk no time for wishful thinking
i push up on my toes you call me sweet thing
im breathing down your neck your body screaming
and you thought that you were the boss tonight but i can put up one good fight
i flip the script like i can take a beating

chorus
and when you start to feel the rush
a crimson headache aching blush
and you surrender to the touch youll know
i can put on a show i can put on a show
dont you see what youre finding
this is heaven in hiding oh
and when you start to look at me a physical fatality
and you surrender to the heat youll know
i can put on a show i can put on a show
dont you see what youre finding
this is heaven in hiding
this is heaven in hiding oh

verse 2
sitting on the concrete in your basement

and i can tell you mean it cause youre shaking
