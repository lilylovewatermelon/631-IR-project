you can here my engine hummin comin rumblin up the road
and i know when you meet me at the fence line in the sunshine youll be lookin fine in your bandanna and your blue jeans
baby would you ride with me

verse 2
so climb up in the seat put your bare feet up
tap along with the radio
girl we can go kick around downtown with the top down
we can follow this county road wherever it leads
baby would you ride with me

chorus
take my hand say i do
i want to go down this road with you
high and low thick and thin
forevers just around the bend
and well be right where we want to be
baby would you ride with me

verse 3
you know life is a bull when the gate gets pulled
and you better be holding on tight
its a roller coaster flippin over
its a sailboat on the tide on the wide open sea
baby would you ride with me
