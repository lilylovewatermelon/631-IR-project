to let me know you made it home
dont want nothing to be wrong
with parttime lover

if she isnt with me ill blink the lights
to let you know tonights the night
for me and you
my parttime lover

we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

if im with friends and we should meet
just pass me by dont even speak
know the word discreet
with parttime lovers

but if theres some emergency
have a male friend to ask for me
so then she wont peek to you
my parttime lover

we are undercover passion on the run
chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

chasing love up against the sun
we are strangers by day lovers by night
knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

ive got something that i must tell
last night someone rang our doorbell
and it was not you
my parttime lover

and then a man caught our exchange
but didnt want to leave his name
i guess that two can play the game
of parttime lovers

you and me
parttime lovers
but she and he
parttime loversembed"
