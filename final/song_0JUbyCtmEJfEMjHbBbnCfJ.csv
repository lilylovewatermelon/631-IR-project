fridge is leakin and the faucets drippin
smoke detector chirps all night
the squeaky screen door with a hole big enough
to let the neighborhood bugs inside
out back jacks got a chop top cadillac
three years up on blocks
the junk mailbox lookin like its been drinkin
leanin to 11 oclock

chorus
we work a long day
sunup to payday
for a life this big
if youre broke dont fix it
learn to live with it
and like it just the way it is
when youre dirt rich
uh uh

verse 2
laid back lax lettin go and lovin this
itty bitty slice of american pie
some folks think its all about the money honey
were livin proof that aint right

we work a long day
sunup to payday
for a life this big
if youre broke dont fix it
learn to live with it
and like it just the way it is
when youre dirt rich

when youre dirt richembed"
