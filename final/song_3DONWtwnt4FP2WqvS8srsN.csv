would you calm me down
you settled the score
the feelings i fight all the strangers in town
burn so bright would know if you were here
the feelings i fight would you ease my mind
yeah come on

the sleep fled from my eyes
and i i know that i need some
give a thought to the one that you know
oh would you calm me down
when the dark gets shallow and fast
we put on the clinic
if you were here it felt good to me
would you calm me down cant see im losing it
we settled the score must have set up the scene
put on a clinic the man asleep knockup
and now i need to write i see it theyre all alive
oh would you ease my mind
yeah
the ghost of you lingers
put on a clinic till we hit the wall
it lingers
just like a sailor with his wounds being salted
come on
i had a nightmare nothing could be put back together
you might also likeits alright
its alright
would you settle the score

if you were here
would you calm me down
the ghost of you lingers
and leaves
i always think about it

oh would you calm me down2embed"
