yours truly
i walk on clouds
look down and see the world from a point of view were true true
never followed trends did what few would do
still drop tunes for you and you
im from the glove motor city show me love and i show it back
check my stats capricorn on the zodiac
all the real heads know the raps
guilt simpson in the back toasting cognac
cheers cheers

josh
hows this happening

quelle chris
yours truly
sincerely qc
ps pump your bs breaks im groovy the dream
borderline mlk jr and juicy
so those from loose leaf to phonos
como to how you not know

my whole style is go buckwild
but look both ways like musiq soulchild
my new bowl not in my house
if you plannin to put shade in the sauce
its like buble to white folks when i write quotes
something about it left their eyes cloudy
you might also likesurrounded by the hardest this side of the tardis
still draped up in my baggy garments
looking like rap incarnate
return of the mac
eating cheesecake factory mac n cheese balls
the bread in the basket was all for me paul

all im saying is i keep it fat fuck the weighin
any class i bash my way in
im not for playing still he
quick to go from boom bye yeah to kumbaya to
keef and close like juggalos keep movements red and purple faygos

my childhood full of fables
my wiring full of cables
im boutta split the pie and take whats mine its simultaneous
if you gettin this leather runner before im dead and famous
got so much more to say
let me gather up these pages these pages

med
yeah
sincerely yours
city known i did it for
were never sure
no pity worn get informed
painted path breath of wind i could send a storm
my brain hurricane raining like a meteor

medaphor piggy bank burst tryna stuff a trust fund
stacking funds education for my son
meditation keep my trigger finger numb save a rapper from
succumbing the verse birth the troubled sun

i vision estate great grandkids relayed it straight
any occasion we use to celebrate
went from ls to elevating
held at heavens gate but faith is all we got in a shot to make it
but faith is all we got in a shot to make

shits getting real out here man keep your head up

josh
oh i was nervous then
but just despondent now
while i wander through aforementioned crowds

nothing left to say
when the portraits done
solipsistic truths
just feeling far from everyoneembed"
