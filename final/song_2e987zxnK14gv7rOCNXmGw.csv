they used to tell me you got to choose a side
now its four years later and they beg for advice
dont trust the critic hes a cynic make the call for yourself
this is my 10step course to not be like everyone else

and i know its not the easiest route
and i know it leaves you overflowing with doubt
but if you want it you can have it hope its all that you dreamt
cause once you got it forget it i wont be leaving this

chorus
you cant trust everyone you meet
they wont amount to anything
go tell them go tell them
its not as simple as you think
you cant trust everyone you meet
they never meant that much to me
go tell them go tell them
its not as simple as you think
