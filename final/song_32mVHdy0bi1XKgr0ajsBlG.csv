state the obvious i didnt get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that im obsessive and crazy
thats fine you wont mind if i say
by the way

chorus
i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

verse 2
theres no time for tears im just sittin here planning my revenge
theres nothing stoppin me from goin out with all of your best friends
and if you come around sayin sorry to me
my daddys gonna show ya how sorry youll be

chorus
cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lyin
so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn

bridge
and if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive

so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
as far as im concerned youre just another picture to burn
