i told em all where to stick it
i left town with a dime to my name
said im done with all of my fake friends
selfrighteous pawns in a losing game
got my band and a light that wont go out
been burning since the day i was born
so ill cry just a little then ill dry my eyes
cause im not a little girl no more

chorus
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind

verse 2
stood in line for so long just to picket
something i wont ever understand
arent you tired of always being mad at the world
wont you just admit you dont care
and lady i dont want your pity
so dont feel sad for me
i got a love i would die for and a song to sing
maybe were both just living out our dream

and some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind

bridge
we get along for the most part
me and reality the light and the dark
we live alone two different worlds
me in a fantasy you in your memories
but we get along
we get along for the most part
we get along yeah for the most part
we get along for the most part
we get along
we get along we get along

chorus
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes we grow up never grow old
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind
some of us have to grow up sometimes we grow up never grow old
and so if i have to im gonna leave you behind15embed"
