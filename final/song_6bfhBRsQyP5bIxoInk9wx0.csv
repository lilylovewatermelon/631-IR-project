drowned by your mongrel heart again
if you dont answer where do you want to be found love
you duck through the window youre a blight on the town

chorus
love is turning you out
sliding whirling round
i tried to warn you
this waiting game
will bring that specter down

and would it be wrong
to clamp down on your racing heart love
and if theyd known persisted oh to be found love
its not what you deserve

chorus
love is turning you out
sliding whirling round
i tried to warn you
this waiting game
will bring that specter down

faster than you run come your demons
turn out the lights oh sacred owl
if you dont answer would you want to be found love
five days on trapped by their weight

love is turning you out
sliding winding round
i tried to warn you
this waiting game
will bring that specter down down down

back on this old game youll be
cut down in a seedy stairway
if you dont answer would you want to be found love
sapped from the bed to the window

looking back on the time
starting in the mines
what it is to be twentynine
when fame sets your life down

would it be wrong
would it be wrong
to disappoint you now
disappoint you now2embed"
