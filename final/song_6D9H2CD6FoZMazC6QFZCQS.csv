maybe its because im crazy
maybe its because i just cant honestly tell you what i want
its never enough to stay still and hold you
to break loose and run the taste of you wild on my tongue

am i no good to you now
am i no good to you
am i no good to you now
am i no good to you

chorus
woah wooah
yeah were spilling over
woah wooah
were falling apart

i spent my days with doctors
and my nights with crooks
and all of them would sell me for a song
so im here safe dear
fixin in your arm

am i no good to you now
am i no good to you
am i no good to you now
so much i can give
you might also likewere fallin apart

woah wooah
and were spilling over
woah wooah
im fallin apart
woah wooah
and tear me out
dont start me over
forever changed
i shoulda told ya
woah wooah
im falling apart

and all i say doesnt matter anyway
yeah all i say doesnt matter anyway
ive given up so call my bluff
cuz i just need to be reminded who i am

ive fallin apart
woah wooah
yeah were spillin over
woah wooah
im fallin apart
ive given up and startin over
i wanna be the one wholl hold you
fallin apart
so itll be love

so come on nowembed"
