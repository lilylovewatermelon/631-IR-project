trust me trust me
i dont like being alone
thinking bout ringing your line
i wish you would come home
but im just tryna balance my space
im just tryna protect my space oh
i dont really need the pain
but i love to feel the pain
maybe i could use a break
so we just might have to wait oh

prechorus
cause were way too in love just to fuck and let go
cause were way too involved just to cut and not call

chorus
way too in deep deep
way too in deep
way too in deep deep
way too in deep oh
wish i could call wish i could call and go home
oh no no no we cant even let it gosee summer walker liveget tickets as low as 238you might also like5embed"
