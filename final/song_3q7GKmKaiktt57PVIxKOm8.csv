one two three
yeah
drop it

verse 1
bones in the water and dust in my lungs
absorbing archaic like a sponge
the ultimate way is the way you control
but can you stay if you detach your soul
bury the present and squeeze out the past
the ones you endear to never last
chemical burns and the animalistic
im just another hardline pseudostatistic

prechorus
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this

verse 2
blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
trying to commit to whats beneath
to find the time is to lose the momentum
you learn the lessons and immediately forget them
automatic and out of my reach
consult all the waste to find the key
minimal life and the polysyllabic
im just another blank page push the button pull the rage

can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this

chorus
i am all but what am i
another number that isnt equal to any of you
i control but i comply
pick me apart then pick up the pieces im uneven

bridge
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done

prechorus
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
im dying to feel this

chorus
i am all but what am i

pick me apart then pick up the pieces im uneven
