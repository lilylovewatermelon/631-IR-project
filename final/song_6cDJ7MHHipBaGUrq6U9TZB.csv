in the morning when the sun breaks free
a reflection that i know ive seen
in the night its haunting me
a lonely ghost a lonely ghost
ever since i was just a child
ive seen the visions in my sleep
of a man roaming through the wild
with all these ghosts a lonely ghost

chorus
but you cant breathe in if you dont breathe out
cause its a new day were gonna go far
knuckle down trim and shake off the dead weight
you know what they say
you cant hide from your ghosts
cause its a new day i wanna go far
break it down jump the gun find a new way
you know what they say
im stuck here living with all these ghosts a lonely ghost

verse 1
im looking back at a room for two
the skeletons of all we knew
that we were only broke and bruised
as you held me close along the coast
when the morning settles in
and ive learned how to live with it
i cant rewind all the things i did
and all these ghosts the lonely ghosts

but you cant breathe in if you dont breathe out
cause its a new day were gonna go far
knuckle down trim and shake off the dead weight
you know what they say
you cant hide from your ghosts
cause its a new day i wanna go far
break it down jump the gun find a new way
you know what they say
im stuck here living with all these ghosts a lonely ghost

bridge
now we know well never be alone alone
and we know i wanna be alone alone

chorus
cause its a new day were gonna go far
knuckle down trim and shake off the dead weight
you know what they say
you cant hide from your ghosts
cause its a new day i wanna go far
break it down jump the gun find a new way
you know what they say
im stuck here living with all these ghosts a lonely ghost
