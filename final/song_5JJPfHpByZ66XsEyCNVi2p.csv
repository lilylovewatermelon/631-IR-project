krystal is a real pro
shes a red rose
she could wreck any home
krystal is a good host
on a talk show
she could strike any pose

chorus
i forget if i ever loved anyone else
i forget if i ever loved anyone else

verse 2
ks eyes are like first prize
these are hard times
but she carries on by
dressed nice in all weather types
she will pass by
at a point in your life

chorus
i forget if i ever loved anyone else
im a mess and ill never love anyone else

chorus
i forget if i ever loved anyone else
im a mess and ill never love anyone else
im obsessed and ill never love anyone else
i forget if i ever loved anyone elsesee matt maltese liveget tickets as low as 41you might also like1embed"
