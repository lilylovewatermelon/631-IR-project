sometimes tears say all there is to say
sometime your first scars wont ever fade away

chorus
tried to break my heart well its broke
tried to hang me high well im choked
wanted rain on me well im soaked soaked to the skin
its the end where i begin its the end where i begin

verse 2
sometimes we dont learn from our mistakes
and sometimes weve no choice but to walk away away

chorus
tried to break my heart well its broke
tried to hang me high well im choked
wanted rain on me well im soaked soaked to the skin
its the end where i begin its the end where i begin

now im alive and the ghosts are gone
ive shed all the pain ive been holding on
the cure for a heart is to move along
so move along so move along

now im alive and the ghosts are gone
ive shed all the pain ive been holding on
the cure for a heart is to move along
so move along so move along
