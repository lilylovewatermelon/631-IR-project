you say i say you say i say you say i say
but now youre out there playing games
i knew that you would never change

verse 1
you say that you love me but you still be wilding out
all of this yelling all of this fussing over just nothing in my house
i pray to my savior and hope he would just help me out
cause all of this confusion got me just losing sight of what i should be doing now

prechorus
i cant lie i dont wanna waste no more time
i cant see why you never tried to do me right
i cant lie i dont wanna waste no more time
i cant see why you never tried to do me right

chorus
you say that you love me
i say that i love you
you say we dont ever have to fight
i say i dont wanna ever cry
you say you would never play the field
i say i would always keep it real
but now youre out there playing games
i knew that you would never change

i try to be patient to see if you could figure out
with all of your lying all your denying i cannot keep you around
you know that i love you its gonna hurt me to see you leave
i cant go through being misused cause you know that that aint me

prechorus
i cant lie i dont wanna waste no more time
i cant see why you never tried to do me right
i cant lie i dont wanna waste no more time
i cant see why you never tried to do me right

chorus
you say that you love me
i say that i love you
you say we dont ever have to fight
i say i dont wanna ever cry
you say you would never play the field
i say i would always keep it real
but now youre out there playing games
i knew that you would never change

verse 3
im cool with whatever cause its been so long
all this nonsense you doing only made me strong
but if we stay together its got to be some change
i dont even wanna hear another calling your name
im cool with whatever cause its been so long
all this nonsense you doing only made me strong
ill dont think well be together cause youll never change
already set inside your ways youll always be the same
chorus
you say you really love me
i say i really love you
you say we dont ever have to fight
i say i dont wanna ever cry
you say you would never play the field
i say i would always keep it real
but now youre out there playing games
i knew that you would never change
