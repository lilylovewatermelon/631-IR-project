what planet are you from girl
and are there others like you there
and could you do that magic trick again
poppin up from nowhere
though my planets full of warfare
you make it feel like a dream
man i hope they never find you

chorus
i think you are a lost queen
let me serve you serve you
hot sex and gold shiny things
i think you are a lost queen
let me serve you serve you
remind you that you are a lost queen
i think you are a lost queen

verse 1
i dont have a problem with multitaskin
takin care of you thats my number one passion
put it before my eyes you know ima smash it
only if you want it want it
you dont have to ever think about askin
i can read your mind girl of course i have it
can i start you up thats automatic
get your motor runnin runnin vroomvroom
im never too busy to tell you that youre pretty
aint gotta ask me to
surprise you in the city when your day is goin shitty
aint gotta ask me to

i donâ€™t have a problem meeting momma and daddy
honey and sugar man i bet theyre so classy

and right before we finish ill ask you did you get it
aint gotta ask me to
