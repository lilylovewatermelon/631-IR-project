for starts
what a waste to say the heart could feel apart
or feel complete baby
why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird
when it sings so sweet
the screaming heaving fuckery of the world
why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain
when all things come from nothing and honey if nothings gained

prechorus
my heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
thats how i know now that you understand

chorus
theres no plan theres no race to be run
the harder the rain honey the sweeter the sun
theres no plan theres no kingdom to come
ill be your man if you got love to get done
sit in and watch the sunlight fade
honey enjoy its gettin late
theres no plan theres no hand on the reign
as mack explained there will be darkness again

verse 2
let it hurl let the awful song be heard
blue bird i know your beat baby
but your secret is safe with me cause if secrets were like seeds
keep my body from the fire hire a gardener for my grave
your secret is safe with me and if secrets were like seeds
when im lying under marble marvel at flowers youll have made

my heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
thats how i know now that you understand

chorus
theres no plan theres no race to be run
the harder the pain honey the sweeter the song
theres no plan theres no kingdom to come
but ill be your man if you got love to get done
sit in and watch the sunlight fade
honey enjoy its gettin late
theres no plan theres no hand on the reign
as mack explained there will be darkness again

prechorus
my heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
thats how i know now that you understand
how big the hourglass how deep the sand
i shouldnt hope to know but here i stand

chorus
and theres no plan theres no race to be run
the harder the rain honey the sweeter the sun
theres no plan theres no kingdom to come
but ill be your man if you got love to get done
sit in and watch the sunlight fade
honey enjoy its gettin late
theres no plan theres no hand on the reign
as mack explained there will be darkness again26embed"
