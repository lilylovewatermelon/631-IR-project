just like a star across my sky
just like an angel off the page
you have appeared to my life
feel like ill never be the same
just like a song in my heart
just like oil on my hands
honor to love you

chorus
still i wonder why it is
i dont argue like this
with anyone but you
we do it all the time
blowing out my mind

verse 2
youve got this look i cant describe
you make me feel like im alive
when everything else is au fait
without a doubt youre on my side
heaven has been away too long
cant find the words to write this song
oh your love

chorus
still i wonder why it is
i dont argue like this
with anyone but you
we do it all the time
blowing out my mind

now i have come to understand the way it is
its not a secret anymore
cause weve been through that before
from tonight i know that youre the only one
ive been confused and in the dark
now i understand

chorus
i wonder why it is
i dont argue like this
with anyone but you
i wonder why it is
i wont let my guard down
for anyone but you
we do it all the time
blowing out my mind

just like a star across my sky
just like an angel off the page
