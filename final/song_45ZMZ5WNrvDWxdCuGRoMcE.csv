moving along at a pace unknown to man
go go go go go go go goohoh
go go go go gooh

prechorus
and you thought the lions were bad
well they tried to kill my brothers
and for every king that died
oh they would crown another
and its harder than you think
telling dreams from one another
and you thought the lions were bad
well they tried to kill my brothers

chorus
and felled in the night by the ones you think you love
they will come for you
and felled in the night by the ones you think you love
they will come for you

oh to see what it means to be free
of the shackles and the dream that you claim to see
