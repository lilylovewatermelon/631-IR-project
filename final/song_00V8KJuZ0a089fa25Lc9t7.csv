youre not the type type a girl
to remain with a guy with a guy too shy too afraid
to say hell give his heart to you forever
im not the boy who will fall to his knees
with his hands clasped tight beggin beggin you please
to stay with him for worse or for better

prechorus
but im staring at you now
theres no one else around
im thinking youre the girl for me

chorus
im just saying its fine by me
if you never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me

veres 2
in the past i would try try hard to commit to a girl
wouldnt get too far
it always somehow seemed to fall apart
but with you you you i can see what i need
i can dream realistically
i knew that this was different from the start
and it seems that every time were eye to eye
i can find another piece of you that i dont wanna lose
you might also likeprechorus
and im staring at you now
theres no one else around
im thinking youre the girl i need

chorus
im just saying its fine by me
if you never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me
im just saying its fine by me
if you never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me

bridge
and its never easy
but darling believe me
im as skeptical as you
but when i think of life without us
it seems like what were supposed to do
but i dont wanna come on too strong

chorus
im just saying its fine by me
if you never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me
its fine by me
if you never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me
im just saying its fine by me
if we never leave
and we can lay like this forever
its fine by me13embed"
