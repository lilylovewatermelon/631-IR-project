i got five bucks sitting at a coffee shop
i just wrote a lyric that made me stop
to think about the world and what i got
its a beautiful beautiful day

verse 2
i got dreams for food and hope for drink
a new chance coming every time i blink
sunset dripping off the thoughts i think
its a beautiful beautiful day

prechorus
and maybe
i should care more about safety
but i cant ignore or betray these
voices singing

chorus
you can do this
you can do this
you are not a lulunatic
crazy would be changing your mind
you can do this
you can do this
you are not a lulunatic
crazy would be leaving it behind

i got five bucks waiting on a matinee
i love to see films in the middle of the day
same movie seen a different way
i dont think that makes me crazy

verse 4
and i start work on the opposite side
of the clock ticktock clubs open at nine
id like to rock till the early day light
write music till five
this is my life

prechorus

chorus

bridge
i will wiggle in a strait jacket forever
this is not some slight disease we can try and cure
this is one thing in my life that i know for sure
there is no turning back now

oh

prechorus
chorus

would be leaving it behind
would be leaving it behind
would be leaving it behind
would be leaving it behindembed"
