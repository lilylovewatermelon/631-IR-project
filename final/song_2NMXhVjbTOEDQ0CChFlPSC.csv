that rained so much before she came
then i saw you we grew together
we were just the same

we fell in love oh so desperately
against the familys will
we planned to run away
she said to meet me at night on the hill

theyll never find us
thats what she said
we could have made it out
but in the night they stole her life

now theres nothing more than this
a lonely sky amongst the mist
now youre gone
my black swan

i know theres nothing left to say
but if you ever fly my way
sing your song
now youre gone
love so strong
my black swan

the jury set them free
now the town seals my history
to a place no one should be

you did the crime thats what they say
i wish i could clear my name
from that dark night they stole her life

now theres nothing more than this
a lonely sky amongst the mist
now youre gone
my black swan
i know theres nothing left to say
but if you ever fly my way
sing your song
now youre gone
love so strong
my black swan

theyll never find us
that s what she said
we could have made it out
but that dark night they stole her life

you did the crime
thats what they say
i wish i could clear my name
from that dark night they stole her life
now theres nothing more than this
a lonely sky amongst the mist
now youre gone
my black swan

i know theres nothing left to say
but if you ever fly my way
sing your song
now youre gone
love so strong
my black swan
my black swan
