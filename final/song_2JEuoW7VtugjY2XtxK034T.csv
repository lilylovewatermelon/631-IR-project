cause i don’t belong here
cause i dont belong here
’cause i dont belong here

verse 1
those days it was all i wanted
nowadays it feels all the same
used to stare at my bedroom ceiling
wishing everything could change
now its hard when youre always searching
for the life that you left behind
time disappears year after year
how the hell did i get here cause

chorus
i feel so far away
minutes turn to hours and the hours into days
i gave up everything
you dont know what you got until you throw it all away
cause i dont belong here i don’t belong here i don’t belong
i dont belong
i don’t belong here i dont belong here i dont belong

verse 2
looking back on the past all the time i wasted
running from everyone that tells me that im fading out
must be mistaken ’cause i i i dont feel anything
you know i got this brain it drives me insane
some days i feel i cant take the pain im gone
i cant explain it cause i i i dont need anything no
see i prevail liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus
i feel so far away
minutes turn to hours and the hours into days
i gave up everything
you dont know what you got until you throw it all away
cause i dont belong here i dont belong here i dont belong
i dont belong
i dont belong here i dont belong here i dont belong2embed"
