you know im sorry
i wont make it to your party
got caught up in my own selfishness
it wont let me be a part of this
and i know ive started
drifting off every second
i cant wait to leave as soon as i
arrive i count the seconds

chorus
down and down we go
well torch this place we know
before one of us takes a chance
and breaks this i wont be the one
no i wont be the one

verse 2
i know its pathetic
fuck it yeah i said it
tried to tell it like it is
theres a chance that ill regret it so
lets go lets end this
i delete before i send it
and we can play pretend
like we havent reached the end yet

down and down we go
and well torch this place we know
before one of us takes a chance
and breaks this i wont be the one
no i wont be the one
