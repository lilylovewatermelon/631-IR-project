hold on i thought that i could take it from here
oh i thought that i was calm in the clear
now its getting harder
hold on i thought that i was doing so well
oh like everything was under a spell
now its getting harder

chorus
i never loved you fully in the way i could
i fought the current running just the way you would
and now im in the creek
and its getting harder
im like falling water

verse 2
go on and tell me just what im supposed to say
as if it could be any other way
oh its getting louder
go on and tell me just how i could allow
all thats light to end up somehow
where its getting darker

chorus
i never loved you fully in the way i could
i fought the current running just the way you would
and now im stuck upstream
and its getting harder
im like falling water falling water falling water
you might also likebridge
and im like falling water set me free
you were like falling water coming down on me

chorus
i never loved you fully in the way i could
and im like falling water set me free
i fought the current running just the way you would
you were like falling water coming down on me
and now im in the creek
and im like falling water set me free
you were like falling water coming down on me

outro
i never gave you everything i wish i could
and it was coming down on me
i shouldve seen it coming from where you stood
and i was standing in the creek
but now im in the creek
and im like falling water set me free
you were like falling water coming down on me
and im like falling water set me free
you were like falling water coming down on me
and its getting harder
and it was coming down on me
and i was standing in the creek
you were like falling water
i was like falling water in the creek12embed"
