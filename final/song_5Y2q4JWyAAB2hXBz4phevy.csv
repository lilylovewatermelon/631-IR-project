lets just take our time
theres nothing else to do
what better way to spend the night
wasting it with you
the moon has won the war
the daylight waits to win
stay here by my side
well watch the struggle start again

chorus
i need you
now and forever
to stay right here with me
dont ever leave
love was kept
from me like a secret
and i swore i was through
until you
until you

verse 2
the citys settled down
i watch you as you sleep
theres a silent celebration
for every breath you breathe
all this now makes sense
with you as company
i left all i knew and found
the better part of me
yeah yeah

bridge
the time it took to find you
i would wait again my baby
for the feelings that i feel with you now

chorus
i need you
now and forever
to stay right here with me
dont ever leave
love was kept
from me like a secret
and i swore i was through
until you
until youembed"
