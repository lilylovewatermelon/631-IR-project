maybe i didnt treat you
quite as good as i should have
maybe i didnt love you
quite as often as i could have
little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time

chorus
but you are always on my mind
you are always on my mind

verse 2
maybe i didnt hold you
all those lonely lonely times
and i guess i never told you
im so happy that youre mine
if i made you feel second place
girl im sorry i was blind

chorus
you are always on my mind
you are always on my mind

bridge
tell me tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
give me give me more chance to keep you satisfiedsatisfied

little things i should have said and done
i just never took the time
you are always on my mind
you are always on my mind2embed"
