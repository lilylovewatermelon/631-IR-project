who needs a coffee cause im doing a run
im writing down the orders now for everyone
the coffee is free just like me
im an unpaid intern

verse 2
sorting papers running around runnin around
sitting in the meeting room not making a sound not a sound
barely people somehow legal
unpaid intern

verse 3
you work all day go back to your dorm
and since you cant afford a mortgage you just torrent a porn
cause youre an intern unpaid
