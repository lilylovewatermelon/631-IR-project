i poured up a dirty sprite again
i pop all these percs and vicodins
i poured up a dirty sprite again
i pop all these percs and vicodins
i poured up a dirty sprite again
i pop all these percs and vicodins
i poured up a dirty sprite again
i pop all these percs and vicodins

verse 1 crim
96 impala with a bottle full of roxy
know i got suboxone when i run out from the popping
drug addicted i admit it
said before aint trying to quit it
codeine codeine got it dripping on my shirt from sloppy sipping
popping some percs and some vicodins
leaning back hoping that life would end
again and again thats everyday everyday
fuck a rehab i just wither my life away
grey foreverever drug possessors
my life expectancy up on the dresser

verse 2 yung slumber
pathetic i need anaesthetics i aint energetic
all these drugs never regret it i guess its genetic
it aint my aesthetic thats fucking generic
uicide the epidemic make the kids quit academics
take drugs til you epileptic
call the paramedics depression magnetic
im antikinetic fucking apathetic again im pathetic
just move on without me then fucking forget it
thought i moved on but i keep forgetting yeah yeah yeah
