weak niggas wanna plead they case case
just to raise up out my face face
i aint got that time to waste
punch your mouth and knock out the taste
you myspaceing and facebooking
playing games with them toys
im in the streets where gangstas meet
while you online with them boys
so step your game up build your name up
quit your talking and get to doing
all that planning and contemplating
when the fuck you gon start pursuing
cars aint driving theyself mansions aint building theyself
they waiting for ed mcmahon
they need to stop feeling theyself
they wealth aint comin until they earn it
but thats something they wont know til they learn it
while burning
