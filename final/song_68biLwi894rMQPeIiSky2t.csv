verse 1 nf
yeah i know the person in the mirrors not a perfect one
i look at him every day and think hes not enough
my lifes a book that i dont really like to open up
im twentysix but i feel like i live in chapter one
i skim through it ive been through it they laugh at us
you think its funny yeah laugh it up
i always felt like no one listened to me thats how i grew up
church is where i found god but its also where i learned to judge
yeah i had to learn theres a difference between
what you want and what you really need
ive always been motivated by comments from people tellin me things they think ill never be
and then i become it this is my everything
theres so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
you probably be terrified of my memories dont lecture me
let me be let me see let me breathe how they remember me
doesnt alter who i am as a person to take my energy yeah

verse 2 nf
yeah my fans made me who i am but they also deceived me
ive been allowed to live life like im already grieving
im at a table of liars but dont eat what they feed me
my hoodie over my face so nobody can see me
im on a plane bout to fly again
looking out the window take a moment to admire it
wondering how high it is wonder where the time has went
then i shut the window and go back to feeling like im out my mind again agh
yeah seems like were all trying to climb a ladder
its crazy what well do to climb it faster
its like we throw away the things in life that really matter
just so we can make it to the top and wonder what were even climbing after
i know the feeling of feeling like everything that you deal with
dont never change thats part of being a human yeah
lifes what you make of it take it embrace it and take it and savor it
aint about what you did its what you became from it agh
