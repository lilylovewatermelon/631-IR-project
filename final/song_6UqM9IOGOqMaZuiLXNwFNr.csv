theres three in the hall from those pictures in the closet
two in the bedroom from that night i lost it
and one deep inside me determined to stay
they dont get any bigger but they dont go away

chorus
holes in and around me i keep falling back into
holes dig in and surround me
god knows what im gonna do
to fill in these holes left by you
left by you

bridge
i pour drink after drink but nothing hit bottom
ive been on my knees admitted my problems
the love that we made still barely an echo
ill try anything in these vacant hollow

chorus
holes in and around me i keep falling back into
holes dig in and surround me
god knows what im gonna do
to fill in these holes left by you
left by you

theres two through my hands and one through my feet
from this cross that i bare to the day that i see
its guilt and its blame its shame and its love
seeking the truth i dug them myself

outro
all these holes dig in and surround me
god knows what im gonna do
to fill in these holes left by you3embed"
