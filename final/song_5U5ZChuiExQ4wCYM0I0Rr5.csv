take a good look at agony
force fed passed down time release
im inspired to find the liar
blackless x on the back of a soulful man
ive got ways you understand
look left look right but im behind you

prechorus
i never noticed until i focused
on everything you did you said
you lit the fuse inside my head

chorus
thank you for reminding me
of why i am sick inside
thank you for the venom
did you think it would paralyze
these scars i scratch i tear are there
under my skin
where youve always been
thank you for reminding me to sin with a grin

verse 2
hangman standing on a twisted 2 by 4
built your house but forgot to lock the door
im inside with two black eyes
i have not one shred of sympathy
i have no use for apologies
im inspired to find the liar
