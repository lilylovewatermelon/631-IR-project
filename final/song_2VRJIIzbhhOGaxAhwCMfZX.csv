they say that we aint got the style we aint got the class
we aint got the tunes thats gonna put us on the map
and im a phony in disguise tryna make the radio
im an antisocial anarchist who sound like soandso
they say im just a stupid kid another crazy radical
rock n roll is dead i probably should have stayed at school
another generation x who somehow slipped up through the cracks
oh theyd love to see me fall but im already on my back

chorus
so it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit but you know i never bother
it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit they can kiss the back of my hand

verse 2
now i know im not a saint ive been a sinner all my life
i aint tryin to hide my flaws id rather keep them in the light
they want to criticize scrutinize cast another stone
burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
they say the devil is my pal i do a lot of drugs
the crowd will only like me if theyre really fucking drunk
they think they know my thoughts but they dont know the least
if theyd listen to the words theyd find a message tucked beneath
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likechorus
but it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit even though they never bother
it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit they can kiss the back of my hand

bridge
you hear that you hear whats coming
oh you better run for the hills
cause were coming to your town
and were gonna burn that motherfucker down
aaaaaaoooh

verse 3
heres the moral to the story we dont do it for the glory
we dont do it for the money we dont do it for the fame
so all the critics who despise us go ahead and criticize us
its your tyranny that drives us adds the fire to our flames

outro
and it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit but you know we never bother
it goes in one ear and right out the other
im only playing music cause you know i fucking love it
it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit but you know i never bother
it goes in one ear and right out the other
people talking shit they can kiss the back of my hand15embed"
