please save a kid that needs some help
and i cant begin to think of anything that could help
but the weed is guaranteed indeed just what i need
how i feel upon a time so recent in time made me sad
when i recollect how it used to be
like david and goliath kinda like me
and the devil tryna rip out my soul
tryna catch a nigga on sleep nono
you can try again and ill be ready
wont let you kill me in my dream like freddy krueger
no im not no loser ill see you in hell

please save a kid that needs some help
and i cant see ahead of me so i move in stealth
hide and seek within a dream i seem to glide above my horror
though i feel ill never be complete inside the dark i borrow
to proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable
and they talk and judge a man
they have no clue of what im capable
til i show a side of me no one had thought could be within
i told you no im not a loser ill see you in hell

my mama told me dont let no one break me let no one break me

verse 3
im just a kid who needs no help
ive achieved a bigger thing
no cash or check could be more blessed
and if you had ever seen the things ive seen up in my slumber
youd be shook stay awake
no need to run your fate would follow
you should know not for the faint at heart
this world understands no coward
its a goal a simple code i stay on the grind to the 25th hour
and i know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
i told you no ill never let you drag me down to hell
