i miss long beach and i miss you babe
i miss dancing with you the most of all
i miss the bar where the beach boys would go
dennis last stop before kokomo

prechorus
those nights were on fire
we couldnt get higher
we didnt know that we had it all
but nobody warns you before the fall

chorus
and im wasted
dont leave‚ i just need a wakeup call
im facing the greatest
the greatest loss of them all
the culture is lit and i had a ball
i guess im signing off after all

guitar solo

verse 2
i miss new york and i miss the music
me and my friends‚ we miss rock n roll
i want shit to feel just like it used to
when‚ baby i was doing nothin the most of all

the culture is lit and if this is it‚ i had a ball
i guess that im burned out after all

chorus
im wasted
dont leave i just need a wakeup call
im facing the greatest
the greatest loss of them all
the culture is lit and i had a ball
i guess that im burned out after all
