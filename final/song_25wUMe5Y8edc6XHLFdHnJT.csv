chorus
oh i wish i had the power the power to change the world
but im just one man trying to do it on my own
oh i wish i had the power the power to change the world
but im just one man trying to do it on my own
can someone help me change the world
can somebody help me change the world

verse 1
every day i saw you there chilling on the corner
puffin on crack and marijuana
because i know how your life is
nobody just be guidin no
hope to see black people living longer
also less kids without fathers
we should all come together
please stop fighting and killing each other
its what happens when your living in the street life
its so dark and you dont get sunlight
people seeing why you dont get treated right
but ima try to change it

verse 2
many people living off welfare
hoping things get better next year

so many sick without health care
too many innocent people dyin
