verse 2 jae millz
my old bitch gone my new bitch with me
and she in the club looking for a new bitch with me
and truthfully tonight i might have ya bitch with me
she aint gone dive in that benz but she gone dip with me
old girl must thought millz was the next man
who knows where she at she probably with her ex man
no second guessing whats the next plan
new season back to the green like a jets fan
im bout money and that attracts divas
you put a ring on her must have thought she was a keeper
but now that girl gone like a fast ball to jeter

east side gudda add another gudda
my bitch was acting up so i had to get another
pockets on full chips stack like pringles
cancel that bitch buy another like nino
i lost one got ten more calling
man women like fleas cant shake them bitches off me
i have a new one every morning with my coffee
im on that sip and she love it when im off speed
so you not wanted like an orphan
you nothing to me just another dog bitch barking
no need to come back bitch you can keep walking
