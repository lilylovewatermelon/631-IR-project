one evening as the sun went down
and the jungle fire was burning
down the track came a hobo hikin
and he said boys im not turning
im headed for a land thats far away
besides the crystal fountains
so come with me well go and see
the big rock candy mountains

verse 2
in the big rock candy mountains
theres a land thats fair and bright
where the handouts grow on bushes
and you sleep out every night
where the boxcars all are empty
and the sun shines everyday
all the birds and the bees
and the cigarette trees
the lemonade springs
where the bluebird sings
in the big rock candy mountains

verse 3
in the big rock candy mountains
all the cops have wooden legs
and the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
and the hens lay softboiled eggs
the farmers trees are full of fruit
and the barns are full of hay
oh im bound to go
where there aint no snow
where the rain dont fall
the wind dont blow
in the big rock candy mountains

in the big rock candy mountains
you never change your socks
and the little streams of alcohol
come trickling down the rocks
the brakemen have to tip their hats
and the railroad bulls are blind
theres a lake of stew
and of whiskey too
you can paddle all around them
in a big canoe
in the big rock candy mountains

verse 5
in the big rock candy mountains
the jails are made of tin
and you can walk right out again
as soon as you are in
there aint no shorthandled shovels
no axes saws or picks
im going to stay
where you sleep all day
where they hung the turk
that invented work
in the big rock candy mountains
ill see you all this coming fall
in the big rock candy mountains6embed"
