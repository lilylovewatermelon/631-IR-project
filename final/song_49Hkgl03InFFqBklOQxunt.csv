hotel in the hills with a carousel
farmhouse in the front a tractor in the lounge
oh oh oh honey i need you round i know i know

listen now can we talk in love and walk the town
be easy now go hiking through the hills in a summer gown
raise the kids peace within and make our sound

hear me now im down on knees and praying
though my faith is weak
without you so please baby please give us a chance
make amends and i will stand until the end
a million times a trillion more

oh oh oh honey i need you round i know i know

smile baby dont cry
i will only fly with you by my side
baby im cornered now
baby dont push me out
lately i walk in doubt
maybe its crashing down
baby can you save it now
you might also likeoh oh oh honey i need you round i know i know
oh oh oh honey i need you round i know i know

baby im cornered now
baby dont push me out
lately i walk in doubt
maybe its crashing down

baby im cornered now
baby dont push me out
lately i walk in doubt
maybe its crashing down4embed"
