you’ve got a cousin who’s telling you somethin’
that doesn’t have nothin’ to do with the lovin’ that we’re in baby
i hear she’s sayin’ this game we’re playin’ should be complicated
if you won’t i’ll say it i think she’s crazy cause

chorus
love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
a bunch of knockdown dragouts cryin in the rain
it’s all right to keep it light now mama don’t you think
we’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
my heart’s never smiled so hard
baby lovin’ you is fun
it’s fun

verse 2
i’m walkin around all over this town ten feet off the ground
so happy i found you baby i love it
there’s no selfhelp book on your shelf you know too well
they’re trying to sell you somethin’ for nothin’ cause

chorus
love don’t have to be a bunch of drama
a bunch of knockdown dragouts cryin in the rain
it’s all right to keep it light now mama don’t you think
we’re having such a good time together and it’s only just begun
my heart’s never smiled so hard
baby lovin’ you is fun
