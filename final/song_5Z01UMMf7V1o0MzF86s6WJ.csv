look if you had one shot or one opportunity
to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
would you capture it or just let it slip
yo

verse 1
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
he opens his mouth but the words wont come out
hes chokin how everybodys jokin now
the clocks run out times up over blaow
snap back to reality ope there goes gravity
ope there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad
but he wont give up that easy no he wont have it
he knows his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter
hes dope he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant
he knows when he goes back to this mobile home thats when its
back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody
better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him

chorus
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better

his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
this world is mine for the taking make me king
as we move toward a new world order
a normal life is boring but superstardoms
close to postmortem it only grows harder
homie grows hotter he blows its all over
these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads
god only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
is told it unfolds i suppose its old partner
but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdahdahdah

chorus
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better
verse 3
no more games ima change what you call rage
tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
all the pain inside amplified by the
fact that i cant get by with my nineto
five and i cant provide the right type of life for my family
cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and its gettin even harder
tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
babymama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
stay in one spot another day of monotonys gotten me
to the point im like a snail ive got
to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfuckin option failures not
mom i love you but this trailers got
to go i cannot grow old in salems lot
so here i go its my shot feet fail me not
this may be the only opportunity that i got

chorus
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better lose yourself in the music
the moment you own it you better never let it go go
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
you better
outro
you can do anything you set your mind to man15kembed"
