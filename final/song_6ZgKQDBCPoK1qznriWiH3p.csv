have you grown up now youve tasted the sun
are you still jaded are you wasting for fun
you are a solider with the future in your palm
were getting older and youve chipped away your calm

chorus
slaving on
i never said youre mine
slaving on
ill never waste your time
slaving on
i never said youre mine
slaving on

verse
im getting less from you than i have ever known
theres so much more to you than threads have ever sewn
if life is there to take then clutch it with your hand
youve sabotaged yourself your exodus was planned

chorus
slaving on
i never said youre mine
slaving on
ill never waste your time
slaving on
i never said youre mine
slaving on
ill never waste your time
slaving on
i never said youre mine
slaving on
never waste your time
slaving on
never said youre mine
