cold afternoon i had no idea who you were
so casually you walked into my universe
you said hey you got some pretty brown eyes
and i couldnt couldnt help but smile
and i think thats the moment it all happen
wouldnt you say so captain
but love turned into games
games turned into heartbreak
and heartbreak turned into war
and if im correct you use to tell me
darling all is fair in love and war

chorus
you you meant the world to me
then you went world war three
you you love so mercilessly
and left me out to bleed
guns out lets go ill be your fighter if you say so
shots fired i see the battlefield is filled with fatality

verse 2
i dont get why were meant to fall in love then say goodbye
gave you all my heart and all my precious time
and i can picture you in your blue jeans
looking right at me with that gorgeous smile
i couldnt see the lies and the things that you would hide
you might also likechorus
you you meant the world to me
then you went world war three
you you love mercilessly
and left me out to bleed
guns out lets go ill be your fighter if you say so
shots fired i see the battlefield is filled with fatality

postchorus
so heres to you heres to us
heres to everything we ever were
and heres to a new world war

bridge
i can see the headlights now
he tore her apart
but i got the greatest weapon of all a broken heart

chorus
you you meant the world to me
then you went world war three
you you love so mercilessly
and left me out to bleed
guns out lets go ill be your fighter if you say so
shots fired i see the battlefield is filled with fatality
postchorus
so heres to you heres to us
heres to everything we ever were
and heres to a new world war5embed"
