verse 1
it started with a low light
next thing i knew they ripped me from my bed
and then they took my blood type
it left a strange impression in my head
you know that i was hoping
that i could leave this starcrossed world behind
but when they cut me open
i guess i changed my mind

prechorus
and you know i might
have just flown too far from the floor this time
cause theyre calling me by my name
and theyre zipping white light beams
disregarding bombs and satellites
that was the turning point
that was one lonely night
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
the storm maker says it aint so bad
the dream makers gonna make you mad
the spaceman says everybody look down
its all in your mind

verse 2
well now im back at home and
im looking forward to this life i live
you know its gonna haunt me
so hesitation to this life i give
you think you might cross over
youre caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
youd better look it over
before you make that leap

prechorus
and you know im fine
but i hear those voices at night sometimes
they justify my claim
and the public dont dwell on my transmission
cause it wasnt televised
but it was the turning point
oh what a lonely night

chorus
the storm maker says it aint so bad
the dream makers gonna make you mad
the spaceman says everybody look down
its all in your mind
the storm maker says it aint so bad
the dream makers gonna make you mad
the spaceman says everybody look down
its all in your mind
bridge
my global position systems are vocally addressed
they say the nile used to run from east to west
they say the nile used to run
from east to west

prechorus
im fine
but i hear those voices at night
sometimes

chorus
the storm maker says it aint so bad
the dream makers gonna make you mad
the spaceman says everybody look down
its all in your mind
the storm maker says it aint so bad
the dream makers gonna make you mad
the spaceman says everybody look down
its all in your mind

outro
its all in my mind
its all in my mind18embed"
