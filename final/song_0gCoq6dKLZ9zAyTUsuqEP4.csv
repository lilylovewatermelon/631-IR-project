im going to put on my new shirt
shine up these old boots
take a deep breath
try to keep my cool
i know youre going to be there
im going to have a couple drinks just to knock off the edge
not too much dont want to make a fool of myself
i know youre going to be there i know youre going to be there

chorus
and im going to bring somebody i barely even know
and when you turn my way im going to pull her in close
and the crazy thing about it is i aint into her at all
i just want to see if you still care
i know youre going to be there

verse 2
you love the band thats playing you wouldnt miss them for the world
all our friends are coming out and if i know one thing girl i know youre going to be there
going to walk right by that table where you always like to sit
and when i run into you its going to be an accident
i know youre going to be there

im going to act like it aint nothing but another friday night
and youre just some old friend and im doing just fine
like im only going out to shake off another week
maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
but i know youre going to be there
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
and im going to bring somebody i barely even know
and when you turn my way im going to pull her in real close
and the crazy thing about it is i aint into her at all
i just want to see if you still care
i know youre gonna be there
i know youre gonna be there

outro
im going to put on my new shirt
shine up these old boots
truth is when i see you i dont know what ill doembed"
