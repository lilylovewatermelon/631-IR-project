25 years and my life is still
tryin to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination
i realized quickly when i knew i should
that the world was made up of a brotherhood of man
for whatever that means

prechorus
and so i cry sometimes when im lying in bed
just to get it all out whats in my head
and i im feeling a little peculiar
and when i wake up in the morning and i step outside
and i take a deep breath and i get real high
and i scream at the top of my lungs
whats going on

chorus
and i say heyeyey heyeyey
i said hey whats going on
and i say hеyeyey heyеyey
i said hey whats going on

prechorus
and well i cry sometimes when im lying in bed
just to get it all out whats in my head
and im im feeling a little peculiar
and when i wake up in the morning and i step outside
and i take a deep breath and i get real high
and i scream at the top of my lungs
whats going on
