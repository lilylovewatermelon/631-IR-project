this world can take you by the hand and tempt the soul of any man
but you can choose your path theres two roads you can take
one way is right and one way is wrong
the flesh is weak but love is strong
and shes all i see between the devil and me

chorus
the gates of hell swing open wide invitin me to step inside
ill be your friend he calls again i know its him
the flames are spreadin everywhere
but through the smoke i see her there
shes all i see between the devil and me

verse 2
i hold her in my arms tonight
so safe and warm i close my eyes
and a cool breeze blows cross our bodies in the dark
outside her reach is my concern
somewhere i know a fire burns
and shes all i see between the devil and me

chorus
the gates of hell swing open wide invitin me to step inside
ill be your friend he calls again i know its him
the flames are spreadin everywhere
but through the smoke i see her there
shes all i see between the devil and me
