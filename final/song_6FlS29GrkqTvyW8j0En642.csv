no more pain tiara

pr terrorist
aiyo i look into my 6 year olds eyes and see the tear drop
if she could express how she feel she make the shit stop
me and her moms fightin and fussin
cant even act like two adults and have a simple discussion
is that complex the only time we both get along is during sex
what a mess my little girls heart is being stressed
started at a young age my hormones on a rampage
mami was naive daddy was nasty
and couldnt let her fat ass slide past me
cuttin school throwin rocks at her window
damn right i spent the night her grandma she didnt know
two teens experimentin with sex had no idea
that parenthood was coming next with checks
sellin drugs in the projects to get her diapers
even spent six months on rikers for assault
tellin jakes it aint my fault
its just a thug life young life what a life
the hell you go through to come out right its real

chorus 4x pr terrorist
tear drops rollin down my little girls face
all the times i wasnt there i wish i could replace
you might also likepr terrorist
wiped the tears out your eyes sit you on my lap
i know its real hard havin a father that rap
but my music put food in your mouth and clothes on your back
send you to school free your mind from being trapped
in this jungle of hell where more fail than succeed
wont let it happen cuz youre way too important to me
my little princess my shining star my understanding
unconditional love whose heart needs gentle handling
wont let a soul hurt you cuz god allah birth you
and never in my life will i ever desert you

chorus 4x

pr terrorist
just strugglin trynna find a better way for us
so much stress i feel like my brain about to bust
gotta worry bout the little boys bothering you
gotta worry bout whippin ass down at your school
cuz youre beautiful just like i knew you would be
cuz complain to your moms cuz you got it from me
slick talkin like your daddy you could of fooled me
in delivery i see little me was a she
now youre all grown up and fool of questions
sometimes the truth hurts but i gotta give you answers
and explain how things work in the big world
some things you have to learn and find out when youre a big girl
remember i wont always be here so close your eyes
and put the song to your ears and wipe the tears
these words that im sayin to you is sincere
daddy loves you tiara daddy loves you
