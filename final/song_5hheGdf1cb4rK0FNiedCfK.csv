undo these chains my friend
ill show you the rage ive hidden
perish the sacrament
swallow but nothings forgiven

prechorus
you and i cant decide
which of us was taken for granted
make amends
some of us are destined to be outlived

chorus
step inside see the devil in i
too many times weve let it come to this
step inside see the devil in i
youll realize im not your devil anymore

verse 2
under the words of men
something is tempting the father
where is your will my friend
insatiates never even bother

prechorus
you and i wrong or right
traded a lie for the leverage
in between the lens in light
youre not what you seem
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
step inside see the devil in i
too many times weve let it come to this
step inside see the devil in i
youll realize im not your devil

bridge
im not your devil anymore
your station is abandoned
fooled you cause i know what youve done
sensation depravation
you shouldve burned when you turned on everyone

chorus
so step inside see the devil in i
too many times weve let it come to this
step inside see the devil in i
i know youll find your answers in the end
step inside see the devil in i
youll realize im not your devil anymore

outro
so step inside
step inside
see the devil in i
see the devil in i84embed"
