drivin northbound drivin homeward drivin wind is drivin me
and it just seems so funny that i always end up here
walkin outside in the storm while looking way up past the treeline
its been some time…
give me darkness when im dreaming
give me moonlight when im leaving
give me shoes that werent made for standing
give me treeline give me big sky get me snowbound give me rain clouds give me a bed time…just sometimes
now youre talkin in my room but there aint nobody here
cause ive been driving like a trucker ive been wearin’ through the gears
i’ve been training like a soldier ive been burnin through this sorrow
and the only talkin lately is that background radio…

you were my friend and i was the same
riding that hope was like catching some train
well now i just walk well i dont mind the rain
but ive been singing so much softer than i did back then

the night i think is darker than we can really say
and gods been living in that ocean sending us all the big waves
and i wish i was a sailor so i could know just how to trust
maybe i could bring some grace back home to the dry land for each of us
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likesay what you say you say it so well
just say you will wait like snow on the rail
i been combing that train yard for some kind of sign
even my own self it just dont seem mine

give me darkness when im dreaming give me moonlight when im leaving
give me mustang horse and muscle cause i wont be goin gentle
give me slanteye looks when im lying give me fingers when im crying
and i aint out there to cheat you see i killed that damn coyote in me…1embed"
