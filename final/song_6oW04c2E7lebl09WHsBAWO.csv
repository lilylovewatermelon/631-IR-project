verse 1
who wants to be right as rain
its better when something is wrong
you get excitement in your bones
and everything you dos a game
when night comes and youre on your own
you can say i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
its harder when youre on top

chorus
cause when hard work dont pay off and im tired
there aint no room in my bed as far as im concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we wont be making up ive cried my heart out
and now ive had enough of love

verse 2
who wants to be riding high
when youll just crumble back on down
you give up everything you are
and even then you dont get far
they make believe that everything
is exactly what it seems
but at least when youre at your worst
you know how to feel things

there aint no room in my bed as far as im concerned
so wipe that dirty smile off
we wont be making up ive cried my heart out
and now ive had enough of love

bridge
go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
cause it will never hurt as much it did then
when we were both right and no one had blame
but now i give up on this endless game

verse 3
cause who wants to be right as rain
its better when something is wrong
i get excitement in my bones
even though everythings a strain
when night comes and im on my own
you should know i chose to be alone
who wants to be right as rain
its harder when youre on top

cause when hard work dont pay off and im tired
there aint no room in my bed as far as im concerned
