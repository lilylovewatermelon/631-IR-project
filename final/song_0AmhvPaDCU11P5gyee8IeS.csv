verse 1
three months two weeks five days
phone calls emails and the games
we been playing with each other
baby wont you come over to my place
im sending you a first class ticket
to a three day love affair
rose petals and bubble baths
we can do it girl any way you like it
but you know i got to have it

chorus
turn the lights down low
light some candles babe
we can get on
its been so long since
we last made love
i miss your love
we gonna do it all night long
put on a sexy dress a secret vickies
its time to get hot time to get freaky
its been so long since we made love
we gonna do it all night long
