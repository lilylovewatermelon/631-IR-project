whys she telling me the story of her life
all the things you wanna kill will give you spite
and if youve taken all the prisoners inside
as theyre doling out their wisdom in the fire

chorus
i will say
i will say dont judge me
i will say
i will say dont judge me
i wait on a darkened highway
i wait on a darkened highway

verse 2
i can take as long as without looking by
whys she telling me the story of her life
and if youve taken all the prisoners inside
as theyve thrown all their wisdom in the fire

chorus
i will say
i will say dont judge me
i will say
i will say dont judge me
i wait on a darkened highway
i wait on a darkened highway
on pace to tie dan nicktons record for the worst foul shooter in the history of the playoffs

i will say dont judge me
i will say
i will say dont judge me
i wait on a darkened highway
i wait on a darkened highway7embed"
