so i think you are a fool
hanging on my every word
its getting ugly
so im ugly

tear me from your heart
tearing me apart
so i thought youd disappear
being alone is what you fear
are you lonely
yes lonely

tear me from your heart
tearing me apart

hoping and scolding revolting
peel it back reveal the scar
loathing exploding controlling
