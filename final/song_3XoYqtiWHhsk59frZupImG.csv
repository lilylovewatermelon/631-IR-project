i just made something unexpected
something sharp something new
its not symmetrical or perfect
but its beautiful and its mine
what else can i do

verse 2 mirabel  isabela
bring it in bring it in
good talk bring it in bring it in what else can i do 
lets walk bring it in bring it in
free hugs bring it in bring it in
verse 3 isabela
i grow rows and rows of roses
flor de mayo by the mile
i make perfect practiced poses
so much hides behind my smile

bridge 1 isabela  mirabel
what could i do if i just grew what i was feeling in the moment
do you know where youre going woah
what could i do if i just knew it didnt need to be perfect
it just needed to be and theyd let me be

chorus isabela  mirabel
a hurricane of jacarandas
strangling figs big
hanging vines this is fine
palma de cera fills the air as i climb
and i push through
