take a breath
hold it in
start a fight
you wont win
had enough
lets begin
never mind
i dont care

prechorus
all in all
youre no good
you dont cry
like you should
let it go
if you could
when love dies in the end

chorus
so ill find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
cause youre so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life

here we go
does it hurt
say goodbye
to this world
i will not
be undone
come to life
it gets worse

prechorus
all in all
youre no good
you dont cry
like you should
ill be gone
when you fall
your sad life
says it all

chorus
so ill find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
cause youre so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life
bridge
dont carry me under
youre the devil in disguise
god sing for the hopeless
im the one you left behind

chorus
so ill find what lies beneath
your sick twisted smile
as i lie underneath
your cold jaded eyes
now you turn the tide on me
cause youre so unkind
i will always be here
for the rest of my life10embed"
