folding my clothes and i feel useless
dont think i know how to do this
once i was told but like any misfit
i spit on some good advice

verse 2
out in the cold and tryin to make fire
two sticks and stone still got no fire
once i was shown but i was inside then
and spit on that good advice

chorus
wisdom wisdom
where can i get some
wisdom wisdom

verse 3
on the payroll and digging up ditches
dollar is low so are my wages
once i was told just how to get rich
but i spit on that good advice

wisdom wisdom
where can i get some

verse 4
take off my clothes and i feel useless
dont think i know how to do this
once i was told but i like to fidget
and miss out on good advice
