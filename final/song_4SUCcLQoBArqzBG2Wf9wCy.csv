i remember back when i was sixteen
i was sittin around pickin just my pops and me
when his friend walked up in a cowboy hat
said i like what your doin but it aint where its at
i see this road will leave you cold and alone
old and broke and just a bag of bones
so you better take heed to the words i say
and stay quite clear of that lost highway

chorus
oh southern wind wont you take me high
i got seven ladies dancin naked round an old camp fire
guitars pickin with a bottle of wine
ill be an old broke guitar picker lord when i die

verse 2
holes in my clothes i got holes in my shoes
i got a hole in my heart thats why im singin the blues
i put some change in my pocket but its all gone
and everything that i do it seems to be wrong
so now im broke im back on the street
with a guitar case in front of tate and me
so you better listen up cause it aint no lie
please throw a nickel in when you walk by
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likechorus
oh southern wind wont you take me high
its hard to keep rollin when all you got is flat tires
guitars pickin with a bottle of wine
ill be an old broke guitar picker lord when i die

verse 3
i came in this world with nothin on my back
now ill leave the same way and thats a fact
aint in it for the money aint in it for the fame
i dont really care if you remember my name
so now i got to go i got to hit the road
i got to do the only thing that i know
i got this feelin deep down and i got to be true
and i sure as hell aint gonna change for you

chorus
oh southern wind wont you take me high
when i hear the sounds comin from an amplifier
guitars pickin with a bottle of wine
ill be an old a broke guitar pickerembed"
