i sat down to say it
the words wouldnt come
i just couldnt play it
and it tore me all apart
the bell i tried to ring it
the words wouldnt come
i just couldnt sing it
i used to know this song by heart

chorus
i used to sing this song to you
for days and days
in so many different manners
fn so many different ways
i used to think this dream we shared
would never come apart
i used to know this song by heart

interlude

chorus
i used to sing this song to you
