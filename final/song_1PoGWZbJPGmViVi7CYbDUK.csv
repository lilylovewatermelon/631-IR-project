when i got the news today
i didnt know what to say
so i just hung up the phone
i took a walk to clear my head
this is where the walking lead
cant believe youre really gone
dont feel like going home

chorus
so im gonna sit right here
on the edge of this pier
watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer

verse 2
funny how the good ones go
too soon but the good lord knows
the reasons why i guess
sometimes the greater plan
is kinda hard to understand
right now it dont make sense
i cant make it all make sense

chorus
so im gonna sit right here
on the edge of this pier
watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
so long my friend
till we meet again
ill remember you
and all the times that we used to

chorus
sit right here
on the edge of this pier
watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer
drink a beer yeah29embed"
