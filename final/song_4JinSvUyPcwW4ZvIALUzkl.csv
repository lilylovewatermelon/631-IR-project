hey there
whats that in your sky
with all the pretty lights
you think i can get that high
so hey you man
wheres your motivation
and why the celebration
youve gotten nothing done here

chorus
you wanna live until
you die alone and will
and i can fly alone at will
im not so far below
ill live beneath your sky
with tainted eyes
ive made my mind
to live until i die

verse 2
run run run
catch me if you can can can
come and hold my hand and
ill be your biggest fan
hey followers
living in your hollow words
i have seen your nine to fives
wash away your dreams
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likechorus
you wanna live until
you die alone and will
and i can fly alone at will
im not so far below
ill live beneath your sky
with tainted eyes
ive made my mind
hey im just fine with all my time
to live until i dieembed"
