you win some and lose some i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life but that doesnt make it right
okay you got ahead tonight
man that doesnt make it right
man that doesnt make it right
how do you sleep at night

verse 1 big sean
sean nigga you on damn nigga you on
you was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
damn nigga you did it but damn it you did it wrong
you got time for that gig but not time for the phone
got it right with your ends but fucked it up with your friends
i seen your ass up on tv  touched up on them twins
you dont know about hard times you clutched up in that benz
get tired of fuckin hoes then get to fuckin their friends whoa
niggas want handouts and i only got two
now im on the phone talkin to my mom like i only got you
gettin dressed up for court thats a law suit
aint wearin v necks but niggas ask what happened to the crew
now im in court for some shit i didnt do
cause of my nigga knowin my career couldve been through
so when its time to travel management say i only need two
listenin to them when im the one that makes the rules
im just a victim of the life though that i aint tryna lose
this the dream i had a wake up call and missed snooze
lately though my family been too happy
i just turned my mama hooptie to a new caddy
people thinkin im rich and i wish they knew that
i been signed for four years and im just able to do that
worry bout my next rolex time piece
my nigga tone worry bout our sis shanice
we supposed to be the role models
no wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

is this the example im tryna set
are these the people imma forget
are these the times imma regret
livin life wishin i could hit reset but but

chorus big sean  jhene aiko
you win some and lose some i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life but that doesnt make it right
okay you got ahead tonight
man that doesnt make it right

verse 2 big sean
okay you win some lose some break some bruise some
life could be a test multiple choice choose some
choose one stick with it man prove some
sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin through somethin
real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
i always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
i got four aunties two uncles one dad
one mom two brothers and 200 niggas mad
and its only one me divide it and do the math
im the one that dropped out got no time for the class
how am i supposed to have time for everyone i just said
i dont even have time for everything in my head
on my way to see kim and ye both tie the knot
wishin me and you were no strings attached but were nots
man thats drama drama drama
so deep that call each others mamas mamas
we need a break i mean comma comma comma
im tryin homie
but she always picks the wrong time like phones dyin on me
in the bed cryin on me talkin lyin on me
it sucks to hit the internet and see youre lyin on me
prechorus 2 big sean  jhene aiko
fuck
is this the example we tryna set
are you the person imma forget
are these the times imma regret
livin life wishin i could hit reset but but

chorus big sean  jhene aiko
you win some and lose some i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life but that doesnt make it right
okay you got ahead tonight
man that doesnt make it right
man that doesnt make it right

outro
see the mind is a fucking trickster
it can fuck you round but your heart will never lie to you
and that’s why people love you sean
because you talk to them from the heart
thanks dad
that’s why youre magical sean
it’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
you speaking that from your brain but they hear you from your heart
because people can see your bullshit
and i know i’m talking a lot of shit
no you’re not
but i want you to hear that
because i’m a great motherfucker man
and i’m very modest
you know i am
and i know a lot of shit
they know when you bullshit
they don’t even intellectualize it
they feel it
life is a feeling process58embed"
