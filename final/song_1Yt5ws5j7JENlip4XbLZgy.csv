froze hearted she left me out for dead
they left me out for dead just like my mama told me
im back on road im like fuck a friendship
thats a costly pleasure i cant afford no homies
niggas plotted on me damn near laid on me
i was beggin em for my shot and niggas played on me
im back on road tellin them wait on it
i call the shots now and i make the plays on it

verse
lied to my bitch so much im startin to believe it
i done brought her one chanel then she got conceited
at school i was sellin dope to students and the teachers
im a selfmade nigga bitch you wanna leave then leave me
got my heart broken bitch and threw me back in savage mode
if she ever let me fuck again it be a grabandgo
woulda held it down but bitch you got me lookin goofy
the way im feelin see your man it might just slap his kufi off
niggas think im wildin they should see me out in action
stop sign on my hip for niggas seein me in traffic
you dont get no points for pullin faggot moves
its cat and mouse out with this cheese i call it ratatool
watchin out for feds i gotta keep some dawgs with me
niggas swoop and sneak theyll lay down and get robbed with you
used to hit that pot up with that fingerroll
shit i used to hit that pot up with that fingerroll
lied to myself so much im startin to believe it
i tell her that im dippin when we both know i aint leavin
tell her that im faithful we both know that im cheatin
i been keepin this shit hunnid since like 93
live from the trap bitch i aint supposed to be here
i get caught with certain guys and they gon give me three years
lil nigga break his arm fuckin with that kickback
niggas stole our cousin from us now we want our lick backyou might also like4embed"
