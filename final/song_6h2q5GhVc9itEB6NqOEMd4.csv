verse 1
so this is the end of the story
everything we had everything we did
is buried in dust and this dust is all thats left of us
but only a few ever worried
while the signs were clear they had no idea
you just get use to livin in fear
or give up when you cant even picture your future
we walk the plank with our eyes wide open

chorus
we walk the plank with our eyes wide open we—
walk the plank with our eyes wide open we—
yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open we—
walk the plank with our eyes wide open we—

verse 2
some people offered up answers answers
we made out we like we heard they were only words
they didnt add up to a change in the way we were living
and the saddest thing is all of it couldve been avoided
but it was like to stop consuming is to stop being human
and whyd i make a change if you wont
were all in the same boat stayin afloat for the moment
