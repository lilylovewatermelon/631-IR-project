everybody needs a glass of water today
to chase the hate away
you know youve got company comin over
so you scrub extra hard
and everybody needs somebody to love

bridge
before its too late its too late
oh dont nobody wanna grow old alone

verse 2
everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
and scratch their dandruff
and everybody need to quit actin hard and shit
before you get your ass whooped ill slap the fuck out ya
and everybody needs somebody to love
before its too late its too late
