verse 1
lets talk this over
its not like were dead
was it something i did
was it something you said
dont leave me hangin
in a city so dead
held up so high
on such a breakable thread breakable thread

prechorus
you were all the things i thought i knew
and i thought we could be

chorus
you were everything everything
that i wanted that i wanted
we were meant to be supposed to be
but we lost it we lost it
and all of our memories so close to me
just fade away
all this time you were pretending
so much for my happy ending
