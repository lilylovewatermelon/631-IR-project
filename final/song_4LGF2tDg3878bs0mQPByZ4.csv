on bended knee is no way to be free
lifting up an empty cup i ask silently
that all my destinations will accept the one thats me
so i can breathe

verse 2
circles they grow and they swallow people whole
half their lives they say goodnight to wives theyll never know
got a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soul
and so it goes

verse 3
dont come closer or ill have to go
holding me like gravity are places that pull
if ever there was someone to keep me at home
it would be you

verse 4
everyone i come across in cages they bought
they think of me and my wandering but im never what they thought
got my indignation but im pure in all my thoughts
im alive

verse 5
wind in my hair i feel part of everywhere
underneath my being is a road that disappeared
late at night i hear the trees theyre singing with the dead
overhead

leave it to me as i find a way to be
consider me a satellite forever orbiting
i knew all the rules but the rules do not know me
