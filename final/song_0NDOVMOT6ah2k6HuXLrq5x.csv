on the cloud of unknowing
my world seems open
every satellite up here is watching
but i was here from the very start
trying to find a way to your heart

verse 2 bobby womack
all the days of forgetting
theyve gone out with the tide
lost at sea somewhere waiting
like setting suns at the rodeo
trying to find someone youll never know

verse 3 bobby womack
oh sinking love
on the cloud of unknowing
every satellite up here is watching
waiting to see what the morning brings
may bring sunshine on its wings
