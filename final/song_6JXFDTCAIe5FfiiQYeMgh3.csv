now minister malcolm the thing that i thought might be good for starting it off is to talk about one of the most pervasive beliefs in the general society about the nation of islam

verse 1 kodak black
talkin to you like talkin to myself
cause it aint no gettin through to you at all i swear
and ive been thinkin bout you since i came to jail
ive tried to reach out to you but it was to no avail
guess it aint nothin else to do when we outgrew each other
we hard down beefin like we never knew each other
top off the coupe no bikini became our life now
im sippin bellini livin that lifestyle

interlude herman blake
and that is that it is an organization dedicated to the use of violent means to attain its goals the question i have is how true is this and why do you think it persists in society

verse 2 kodak black
poppin pills poppin pistols i put my mic down
i almost lost my life that night i was on a bloodhound
they tryna tell us put the bikes up and the guns down
x was tryna buy a bike then he got gunned down
x was tryna change his life but he got burned down
x wasnt ridin with no pipe so he got gunned down
listen do as i say dont do as i do

verse 3 kodak black
if i wasnt rich you wouldnt be pullin up to my funeral
first they kissin you huggin you then they suin you
if it was me it was you im wonderin what you would do
i just pulled up on your mama homie she beautiful
yeah gotta keep the strap cant let you latch all on me
i got married to the game she put these racks all on me
now i got diamonds on my ring look like a matrimony
first they screamin my name then file a lawsuit on me
you would hate to see me reach my full potential
you want me robbin poppin mollies poppin pistols
im goin to college cause to the youngins im influential
thought it was congress they aint know this was a presidential
they aint know that i was intellectual
you tryna change your life but they wont let you
i know they know im special why they playin with me
you talkin jewels im droppin jewels you see the difference
coppin jewels for your dawgs they dont appreciate it
everybody gon say you fake when you make it
back of the maybach with the tints so you dont notice me
when the money bring the fame you cant even roll in peace
guess all the pain that i went through had to be the recipe
i stood tall through it all and brought out the best of me
ayo dismiss all them charges that aint my destiny
everything i said i stood on it i got integrity
ga i put my hood on it i bring the jects with me
you need security by your grave so you can rest in peace
tired
outro malcolm x
charge of violence against us actually stems from the guilt complex that exists in the conscious and subconscious minds of most white people in this country they know that theyve been violent in their brutality against negros and they feel that some day the negro is going to wake up and try and do unto as them as they have done—do unto the whites as the whites have done unto us5embed"
