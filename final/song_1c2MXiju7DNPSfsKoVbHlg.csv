verse 1
im afraid that i gotta do what i gotta do
but if i let you go where you gonna go
we gotta make a change time to turn the page

weve been through tougher times you know it gets worse
we can turn this around please let me be first
and as i feel your tears spillin on my shirt
somethin isnt right and i dont wanna fight you

prechorus
hey you
come over and let me embrace you
i know that im causin you pain too
but remember if you need to cry cry

chorus

i know i made you feel this way
you gotta breathe well be okay be okay
