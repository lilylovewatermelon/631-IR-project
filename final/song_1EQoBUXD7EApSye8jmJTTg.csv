i never knew perfection til
i heard you speak and now it kills me
just to hear you say the simple things
now waking up is hard to do
and sleeping is impossible too
everythings reminding me of you
what can i do

chorus
it’s not right not okay
say the words that you say
maybe were better off this way
i’m not fine i’m in pain
it’s harder everyday
maybe were better off this way
it’s better that we break

verse 2
a fool to let you slip away
i chase you just to hear you say
youre scared and that you think that im insane
the city looks so nice from here
pity i can’ see it clearly
while youre standing there it disappears
it disappears

its not right not okay
say the words that you say
maybe we’re better off this way
i’m not fine i’m in pain
it’s harder everyday
maybe we’re better off this way
it’s better that we break

verse 3
saw you sitting all alone
you’re fragile and you’re cold but that’s all right
life these days is getting rough
they’ve knocked you down and beat you up
but it’s just a rollercoaster anyway yeah

chorus
its not right not okay
say the words that you say
maybe we’re better off this way
i’m not fine i’m in pain
it’s harder everyday
maybe we’re better off this way
i’m not fine not ok
say the words that you say
maybe we’re better off this way
i’m not fine i’m in pain
it’s harder everyday
outro
maybe we’re better off this way
it’s better that we break baby5embed"
