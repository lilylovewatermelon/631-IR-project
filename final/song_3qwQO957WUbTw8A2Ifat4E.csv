verse 1
you could read a million pages
know the words in all the phrases
you could try to turn a lie into the truth
and you can live to be a hundred
memorizing every number
you could even put a man on the moon
and the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me
but im following this feeling

chorus
i dont know why its so hard to swallow our pride
and i dont know how many wrongs make a right
i dont know the reason sometimes it just feels so good to cry
and i dont know which way the wind will blow
but youre here with me and thats all i need to know

postchorus

theres a moment in the morning
when i feel the most alone
but then i hear your voice whispering my name
its like a wave of understanding
and i never could have planned it
where the questions and doubts all fade away

chorus
and i dont know why its so hard to swallow our pride
and i dont know how many wrongs make a right
i dont know the reason sometimes it just feels so good to cry
and i dont know which way the wind will blow
but youre here with me and thats all i need to know

ohoh oh thats all i need to know

bridge
i figured it out just turn me around
at the speed of light
all that i ever needed to know
was in your eyes
chorus
i dont know why its so hard to swallow our pride
and ill never count all the stars in the sky
i dont know the reason sometimes it just feels so good to cry
and i dont know which way the wind will blow
but youre here with me and thats all i need to know
