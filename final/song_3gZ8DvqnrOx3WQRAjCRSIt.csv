i have to wonder
if this waves too big to ride
commit or not commit
in such a crazy tide

prechorus
its sooner than i thought
but you called me out
i lost control and theres no doubt
im gonna start all over

chorus
out of the fire and into the fire again
you make me want to forget
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind or worse
another chance to get burned
and start all over
im gonna start all over

verse 2
fantastic and romantic
all a big surprise big surprise
you got the warning
hesitation pushed aside
you might also likeprechorus
its sooner than i want
but you caught my heart
i guess im ready now to start
im gonna start all over

chorus
out of the fire and into the fire again
you make me want to forget
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind or worse
another chance to get burned
and start all over
im gonna start all over

bridge
its so easy you disrupt me cant complain
its so easy you disrupt me cant complain
its so easy you disrupt me cant complain
its so easy you disrupt me
im gonna start all over start all over

chorus
out of the fire and into the fire again
you make me want to forget
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind or worse
another chance to get burned
and start all over
chorus
out of the fire and into the fire again
you make me want to forget
and start all over
here i come straight out of my mind or worse
another chance to get burned
and start all over
