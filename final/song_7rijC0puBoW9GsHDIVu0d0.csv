youre broken so am i
im better off alone
no one to turn to and nothing to call my own
outspoken so am i
explosive words that your world wouldnt understand
turn away again

youre beaten so am i
ive got a heart of stone
no medication can cure
what has taken hold
youre hurting so will i

ive been running from your

show no emotion and it can destroy your soul
another sacrifice
to a tormentor your world wouldnt understand

a maniacal breed of subhuman parasites
thrown into a feeding frenzy
with the smell of fresh blood
open your eyes and see
the creatures for what they are
a swirling mass of hatred and envy
dont be naive enough
to think you are unaffected
the conversion has already begun
verse 3
youre frightened so am i
a world of demons wait
watching our movements
and filling my heart with hate
youre burning so will i
when i awake to discover
how ive been ravaged by your
