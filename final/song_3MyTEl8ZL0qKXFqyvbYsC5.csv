my heart speaks before my mind thinks through
and i blush as i say yes yes

and im feeling weak and i cant speak speak

never thought id give in so willingly to a human being
with abilities to set me free free let me be me

its so amazing how something so sweet
has come and rearranged my life
ive been kissed by destiny oh heaven came and saved me
an angel was placed at my feet this isnt ordinary
hes loving me for me
spoken outro
stripped of all makeup
no need for fancy clothes
no cover ups push ups
with him i dont have to put on a show
he loves every freckle every curve
every inch of my skin
fulfilling me entirely
taking all of me in
hes real hes honest
hes loving me for me
