they’re the in crowd we’re the other ones
it’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from
we let our colors show where the numbers ain’t
with the paint where there ain’t supposed to be paint

that’s who we are
that’s how we roll
the outsiders the outsiders

verse 2
our women get hot and our leather gets stained
when we saddle up and ride em in the pouring rain
we’re the junkyard dogs we’re the alley cats
keep the wind at our front and the hell at our back

prechorus
that’s who we are
we do our talking walk that walk
wide open rocking
that’s how we roll

chorus
our backs to the wall
a band of brothers
together alone the outsiders
we’re the riders we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
yeah we’re the fighters the allnighters
so fire them up and get a lil higher

verse 3
we’re the bad news
we’re the young guns
we’re the ones that they told you to run from
yeah the player’s going to play and a haters going to hate
and a regulators born to regulate
when it hits the fan and it all goes down
and the gloves come off
you’re going to find out just

prechorus
that’s who we are
we do our talking walk that walk
wide open rocking
that’s how we roll

chorus
our backs to the wall
a band of brothers
together alone the outsiders
we’re the riders we’re the ones burning rubber off our tires
yeah we’re the fighters the allnighters
so fire them up and get a lil higher
