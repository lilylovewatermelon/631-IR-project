this place rings with echoes of
lives once lived but now are lost
time spent wondering about tomorrow
i dont care if we lose it all tonight
up in flames burning bright
warming the air of the world

chorus
i dont love you anymore is all i remember you telling me
never have i felt so cold
but ive no more blood to bleed
cause my heart has been draining into the sea

verse 2
steps i take in your footsteps
arent getting me closer to what is left
of the dreams of what i once claimed to know
within my bones this resonates
boiling blood will circulate
could you tell me again what you did this for

chorus
i dont love you anymore is all i remember you telling me
never have i felt so cold
but ive no more blood to bleed
cause my heart has been draining into the sea oh oh oh oh

still i wait
with a hope inside of me inside of me
so still so still i wait i wait
until again we meet
until again we meet

within my bones this resonates
boiling blood will circulate
could you tell me again what you did this for

chorus
i dont love you anymore is all i remember you telling me
never have i felt so cold
but ive no more blood to bleed
cause my heart has been draining into the sea
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh

outro
still i wait
with a hope so still inside of me i wait
so still a hope i wait inside of me1embed"
