crawling over the great plains of my cellphone contacts
just to find a pretty girl to take home late at night
to hold my sweaty palms and stuff

heads up because im always moving forward
and if sometimes i get scared i know that i can look towards you
back of the pack but not back of my mind
and thats the worst part—knowing i gotta find someone new
yeah i said that im always moving forward
but my heads really on a swivel
searching for the tracks i made when i left you
and though it sounds like i lost what i got
what im really trying to say is
im gonna get back what i lost
so you better tell your fucking heart to look outyou might also likeembed"
