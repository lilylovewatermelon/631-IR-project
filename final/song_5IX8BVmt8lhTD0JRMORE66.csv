a great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
honey let me be your salty dog

let me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dog

look it here sal i know you
run down stocking and a wore out shoe
honey let me be your salty dog

let me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dog

down in the wildwood sitting on a log
finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
honey let me be your salty dog

let me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dog

well i pulled the trigger and the gun set go
the shot gun over in mexico
honey let me be your salty dog
you might also likelet me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dog

salty down now

let me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dog

let me be your salty dog
or i wont be your little man at all
honey let me be your salty dogembed"
