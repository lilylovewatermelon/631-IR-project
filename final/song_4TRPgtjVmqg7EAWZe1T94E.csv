i need i feel a love you love to love the fear
i never want to be alone ive forgotten to
the road keeps moving the clouds the clouds become unreal
i guess ill always be at home

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
do you want me to try
directing your night

verse 2 serj tankian
an exit lights the sky the sky becomes complete
traveling hearts divide the throne ive forgotten to
friction lines bumps the highway song complete
the signs are all turning right

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
do you want me to try
directing your night
want me to try
directing your light
