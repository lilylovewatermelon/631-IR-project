dont you need me oh baby boy
cause im so happy without your noise

verse 1
baby woo now my head is on backwards
and my feet at funny angles
and every time i take a step
were movin forwards faster
and lately i cant take it
baby now my bodys intact and
in an ordinary fashion
and everything i tried to leave behind
is still beside us woo
and lately i cant take it
woo

prechorus
leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
shes broken but shes fun
my girl eats mayonnaise
from a jar while shes gettin blazed

chorus
dont you need me oh baby boy
cause im so happy without your noise

lazy woo and lyin on your belly
with a super porp cola
looking at your phone in clothes
youve worn for three days over
with a cookie as a coaster
maybe i wish i could remould you
to vertical and golden
but you turned to styrofoam
and so it hurts to say its hopeless woo
and we aint gonna make it
woo

prechorus
leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
shes broken but shes fun
my girl eats mayonnaise
from a jar while shes gettin blazed

verse 3
shes drunk on old cartoons
liquid tv afternoons
sometimes it makes me laugh
sometimes it makes me sad

chorus
dont you need me oh baby boy
cause im so happy without your noise
dont you need me you baby boy
cause im so happy without your noise
outro
oh baby now my head is on backwards
mmm baby now my head is on backwards
oh baby now my head is on backwards
mmm baby now my head is on backwards
dont you need me you baby boy
cause im so happy without your noise28embed"
