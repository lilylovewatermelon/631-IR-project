what do you do
when you know somethings bad for you
and you still cant let go

verse 1
i was naive your love was like candy
artificially sweet i was deceived by the wrapping
got caught in your web and i learned how to bleed
i was prey in your bed and devoured completely

chorus
oh and it hurts my soul cause i cant let go
all these walls are cavin in
i cant stop my sufferin
i hate to show that ive lost control
cause i i keep goin right back to the one thing that i need
to walk away from yeah

postchorus
i need to get away from you
need to walk away from you
get away walk away walk away

verse 2
i should have known that i was used for amusement for amusement oh
couldnt see through the smoke it was all an illusion
now ive been lickin my wounds lickin my wounds
but the venom seeps deeper and deeper
we both can seduce but darlin you hold me prisoner prisoner

oh im about to break i cant stop this ache
im addicted to your allure
and im feindin for a cure
every step i take leads to one mistake
i keep goin right back to the one thing that i need oh

getting nothing in return
what did i do to deserve
the pain of this slow burn
and everywhere i turn
i keep goin right back to the one thing that i need
to walk away from yeah

i let out a silent prayer let it be over over ooh
