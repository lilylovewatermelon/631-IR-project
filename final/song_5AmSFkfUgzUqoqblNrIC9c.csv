been through a lot in the last year
its like everything i love is slipping away
and every time i come home
some more of me it isnt there
i gotta get it together
i need to do things for myself
ive given everything but still you take more from me
i need some room to breathe

chorus
come on come on you know this isnt what we planned on
come on come on tell me well be okay well be okay
lets go back lets go back
to a time where i still felt i had a family

verse 2
this isnt what i remember
everyones looking out for just themselves
if need be ill be happy to leave
just be warned ill be taking most of you with me
i see straight through
that smile straight through that painted face
dont think that i cant tell
which one of you is against me
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus
come on come on you know this isnt what we planned on
come on come on tell me well be okay well be okay
lets go back lets go back
to a time where i still felt i had a family

i have the greatest faith in fools
i turned my back and out came the wolves

chorus
come on come on you know this isnt what we planned on
come on come on tell me well be okay well be okay
lets go back lets go back
to a time where i still felt i had a family
