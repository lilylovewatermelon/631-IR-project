well i have a reputation of being a late night destination
like im some kind of vacation for lost souls
my door is always open they come in lonely they come in broken
to figure out where theyre goin then they go
and when they dont need me no more
im left sweepin up the floor

chorus
my heart is a bar and im closin it down
so find somewhere else to get drunk in this town
im tired of bein a shoulder and never havin one around
my heart is a bar and im closin im closin it down
oohooh

verse 2
ive come to the conclusion that true love is an illusion
youre bein used or youre usin someone else
well im sick of all the noise so kill the lights and pay the boys
fire the band and take the poison off the shelf
cest la vie farewell

chorus
my heart is a bar and im closin it down
so find somewhere else to get drunk in this town
im tired of bein a shoulder and never havin one around
my heart is a bar and im closin im closin it down

chorus
my heart is a bar and im closin it down
so find somewhere else to get drunk in this town
