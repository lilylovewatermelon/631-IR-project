always tried to see it your way
never really knew whats right
never really played in your games
saw it from the outside
never gonna live it your way
id rather stand and fight
never gonna fall into place
see it from my side

chorus
letting go of everything everything
looks better down on paper
letting go of anything anything
not until i meet my maker

verse 2
never really saw it my way
never really knew whats right
always tried to hide from the blame
saw it from the inside
never had to save it for face
never had to run and hide
tell me how ive fallen from grace
see you on the dark side
