i know you may not be feeling the same way i am
sweetheart youre mine and now our life is all planned
nobody needs you the way you know i do
forget what they say lets start our life anew

verse 2
oh darling
im not so sure about our hearts aligning
at 16 years old could this just be bad timing
puppies pining

chorus
listen to me sweetheart you are nothing when were apart
i can promise you this when we split the town you wont be missedyou might also like9embed"
