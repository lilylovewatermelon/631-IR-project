songs in the kitchen
playing on the radio
coffee on the counter
bacon frying on the stove
billy graham on tv
mom and daddy kissing
songs in the kitchen

verse 2
songs in the car
freshpressed sunday clothes
momma putting on her make up
daddys bible on the dashboard
me and lewis in the back seat
singing out our little hearts
songs in the car

chorus
all my dreams came true
my songs took me far away
now im singing them every night
in these bright lights up on this stage
if you catch me close my eyes every now and then
to tell you the truth
im probably just missing
songs in the kitchen
songs in the car
songs from the heart

verse 3
songs in the church
choir a little out of tune
preacher wiping his forehead
us squirming in the pew
that old piano playing
just as i am
everytime we sing every verse
yeah i wonder if i still can

chorus
all my dreams came true
my songs took me far away
now im singing them every night
in these bright lights up on this stage
if you catch me close my eyes every now and then
to tell you the truth
im probably just missing
songs in the kitchen
songs in the car
songs in the church
songs from the heart

oh songs in the kitchen
songs in the kitchenembed"
