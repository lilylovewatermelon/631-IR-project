only a coward would pick up a gun
and shoot up a crowd tryna have fun
now the vegas lights they wont lose their glow
and the band will play and go on with the show

chorus
and youre gonna get your turn
yes youre gonna get your turn
son youre gonna get your turn
devil gonna watch you burn

verse 2
i wasnt there i didnt see
but i had friends in your company
if i could snap my fingers if i could flip a switch
id make that last bullet first you son of a bitch

chorus
youre gonna get your turn
yes youre gonna get your turn
oh youre gonna get your turn
devil gonna watch you burn

bridge
to the evil ones you know who you are
i beg of you dont you go too far
just know this let it give you pause
before you mail out your bombs or pull a trigger in a synagogue

oh yourе gonna get your turn youre gonna get your turn
yes youre gonna get your turn
