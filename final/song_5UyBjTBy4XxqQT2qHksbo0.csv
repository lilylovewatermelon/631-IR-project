in a life where we work out theres a house up on a hill
a front porch going all of the way round and a flower pot on the windowsill
we sit and watch the sunset while the kids play in the field
cause in a life where we work out theres a house up on a hill

verse 2 kaitlin butts
i still call you darlin you still call me babe
i smile in the mirror when i say my new last name
you take me out dancin on the weekends you dont sing
cause in a life where we work out you still call me babe

chorus cleto cordero cleto cordero  kaitlin butts
if life is only ups and downs
maybe youll come on back around
save me from what ive become
lord knows i cant keep losing sleep dreaming about
a life where we work out

verse 3 kaitlin butts cleto cordero cleto cordero  kaitlin butts
our loves still hotter than a texas summer day
you still bite your lip when i look at you in that way
we pull off on some old dirt road on the way home cause we cant wait
cause in a life where we work out our loves hotter than a summer day

chorus cleto cordero cleto cordero  kaitlin butts kaitlin butts
if life is only ups and downs
maybe youll come on back around
save me from what ive become
lord knows i cant keep losing sleep dreaming about
a life where we work out
