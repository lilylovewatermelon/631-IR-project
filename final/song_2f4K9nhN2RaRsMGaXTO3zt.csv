verse
member sittin in class the first time listening to dilla
everythings good
rubbin on yo chin sippin gin margiela brand chinchilla
everythings good
my manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
and some fruit snacks and some killers
phone numbers on speed dial call them savemonkey gorillas
everythings good
i aint really that good at goodbyes i aint really that bad at leavin
i aint really always been a good guy i used to be thirsty thievin
runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin bleedin
i aint really help the helpless i used to be worse than worthless
now im worth hooks and verses im good like books in churches
harolds and hooks and churchs
everythings good
see my name when you google search it
use a card when i make a purchase
everythings good
but i knew i was fly when i was just a caterpillar
that id make it even if i never make a miluh
when i meet my maker he gon make sure that we chillin
and everythings good
i aint really that good at goodnight
i aint really that bad at sleepin
with bad bitches put em aside i used to be thirsty creeping
now im out working evenings birthdays even tuesdays
wednesdays thursdays weekends
rehearsing verses
murdering merch and events
damn it feel good to be a gangsta
and it feel good for me to thank you
put money back in your bank account
off of songs i barely could think up
cause a lot of songs niggas gon make up
make sense but they never gon make a sound
and im better than i was the last time crescendo
thanks justin lending them pencils
mr menzies mensa chris minto
the time i beat chris on nintendo
nanana hey hey good intro
remember jacket shoppin after listening to thriller
remember the first time you heard this through
and thought damn thats that nigga
everythings good
