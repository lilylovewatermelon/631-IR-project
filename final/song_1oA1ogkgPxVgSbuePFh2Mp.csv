every day i get closer and closer
to releasing this on you
revel in it i can snap it in half
and let the other make this happen to you
all i see is overrated biology drowning me
youre all abortions to me
fuckin millions and millions of apologies
i dont give a fuck i can make you all go away

verse 2
anyway you make me sick
and it doesnt help your case
its so serious i cant stop laughing
and i cannot wash my mouth of this taste
defile destroy disgrace deface defy
i dont know how much longer i can live a lie
i want the whole world to burn maybe then youll learn
this wasnt meant to flourish on my earth

chorus
killing everyone
killing everything
killing everyone
killing everything

my eyes are dead and my veins are too
and im starting to believe
my hands are shaking and i feel my smile
like i wrecked this on a harbinger see
no ones crying anymore i am closing the door
i am nothing but a mechanism for the hurt
my flesh is a weapon my face is a stain
its time that i give you my pain

chorus
killing everyone
killing everything
killing everyone
killing everythingembed"
