in the sensations of hearing touch sight and pain we are accustomed to distinguish from among the other elements the element of voluminousness we call the reverberations of a thunderstorm more voluminous than the squeaking of a slatepencil the entrance into a warm bath gives our skin a more massive feeling than the prick of a pin a little neuralgic pain fine as a cobweb in the face seems less extensive than the heavy soreness of a boil or the vast discomfort of a colic or a lumbago and a solitary star looks smaller than the noonday sky in the sensation of dizziness or subjective motion which recent investigation has proved to be connected with stimulation of the semicircular canals of the ear the spatial character is very prominent whether the muscular sense directly yields us knowledge of space is still a matter of litigation among psychologists whilst some go so far as to ascribe our entire cognition of extension to its exclusive aid others deny to it all extensive quality whatever under these circumstances we shall do better to adjourn its consideration admitting however that it seems at first sight as if we felt something decidedly more voluminous when we contract our thighmuscles than when we twitch an eyelid or some small muscle in the face it seems moreover as if this difference lay in the feeling of the thighmuscles themselves

in the sensations of smell and taste this element of varying vastness seems less prominent but not altogether absent some tastes and smells appear less extensive than complex flavors like that of roast meat or plum pudding on the one hand or heavy odors like musk or tuberose on the other the epithet sharp given to the acid class would seem to show that to the popular mind there is something narrow and as it were streaky in the impression they make other flavors and odors being bigger and rounder the sensations derived from the inward organs are also distinctly more or less voluminous repletion and emptiness suffocation palpitation headache are examples of this and certainly not less spatial is the consciousness we have of our general bodily condition in nausea fever heavy drowsiness and fatigue our entire cubic content seems then sensibly manifest to us as such and feels much larger than any local pulsation pressure or discomfort skin and retina are however the organs in which the spaceelement plays the most active part not only does the maximal vastness yielded by the retina surpass that yielded by any other organ but the intricacy with which our attention can subdivide this vastness and perceive it to be composed of lesser portions simultaneously coexisting alongside of each other is without a parallel elsewhere 2 the ear gives a greater vastness than the skin but is considerably less able to subdivide it 3

now my first thesis is that this element discernible in each and every sensation though more developed in some than in others is the original sensation of space out of which all the exact knowledge about space that we afterwards come to have is woven by processes of discrimination association and selection extensity as mr james ward calls it 4 on this view becomes an element in each sensation just as intensity is the latter every one will admit to be a distinguishable though not separable ingredient of the sensible quality in like manner extensity being an entirely peculiar kind of feeling indescribable except in terms of itself and inseparable in actual experience from some sensational quality which it must accompany can itself receive no other name than that of sensational element

it must now be noted that the vastness hitherto spoken of is as great in one direction as in another its dimensions are so vague that in it there is no question as yet of surface as opposed to depth volume being the best short name for the sensation in question sensations of different orders are roughly comparable inter se with respect to their volumes this shows that the spatial quality in each is identical wherever found for different qualitative elements eg warmth and odor are incommensurate persons born blind are reported surprised at the largeness with which objects appear to them when their sight is restored franz says of his patient cured of cataract he saw everything much larger than he had supposed from the idea obtained by his sense of touch moving and especially living objects appeared very large 5 loud sounds have a certain enormousness of feeling it is impossible to conceive of the explosion of a cannon as fining a small space in general sounds seem to occupy all the room between us and their source and in the case of certain ones the crickets song the whistling of the wind the roaring of the surf or a distant railway train to have no definite starting point

in the sphere of vision we have facts of the same order glowing bodies as hering says give us a perception which seems roomy raumhaft in comparison with that of strictly surface color a glowing iron looks luminous through and through and so does a flame 6 a luminous fog a band of sunshine affect us in the same way as hering urges

 we must distinguish roomy from superficial as well as distinctly from indistinctly bounded sensations the dark which with closed eyes one sees before one is for example a roomy sensation we do not see a black surface like a wall in front of us but a space fined with darkness and even when we succeed in seeing this darkness as terminated by a black wall there still remains in front of this wall the dark space the same thing happens when we find ourselves with open eyes in an absolutely dark room this sensation of darkness is also vaguely bounded an example of a distinctly bounded roomy sensation is that of a clear and colored fluid seen in a glass the yellow of the wine is seen not only on the bounding surface of the glass the yellow sensation fins the whole interior of the glass by day the socalled empty space between us and objects seen appears very different from what it is by night the increasing darkness settles not only upon the things but also between us and the things so as at last to cover them completely and fin the space alone if i look into a dark box i find it fined with darkness and this is seen not merely as the darkcolored sides or walls of the box a shady corner in an otherwise welllighted room is full of a darkness which is not only on the walls and floor but between them in the space they include every sensation is there where i experience it and if i have it at once at every point of a certain roomy space it is then a voluminous sensation a cube of transparent green glass gives us a spatial sensation an opaque cube painted green on the contrary only sensations of surface 7

there are certain quasimotor sensations in the head when we change the direction of the attention which equally seem to involve three dimensions if with closed eyes we think of the top of the house and then of the cellar of the distance in front of us and then of that behind us of space far to the right and then far to the left we have something far stronger than an idea  an actual feeling namely as if something in the head moved into another direction fechner was i believe the first to publish any remarks on these feelings he writes as follows

when we transfer the attention from objects of one sense to those of another we have an indescribable feeling though at the same time one perfectly determinate and reproducible at pleasure of altered direction or differently localized tension spannung we feel a strain forward in the eyes one directed sideways in the ears increasing with the degree of our attention and changing according as we look at an object carefully or listen to something attentively  wherefore we speak of straining the attention the difference is most plainly felt when the attention vibrates rapidly between eye and ear this feeling localizes itself with most decided difference in regard to the various senseorgans according as we wish to discriminate a thing delicately by touch taste or smell

but now i have when i try to vividly recall a picture of memory or fancy a feeling perfectly analogous to that which i experience when i seek to grasp a thing keenly by eye or ear and this analogous feeling is very differently localized while in sharpest possible attention to real objects as well as to afterimages the strain is plainly forwards and when the attention changes from one sense to another only alters its direction between the senseorgans leaving the rest of the head free from strain the case is different in memory or fancy for here the feeling withdraws entirely from the external senseorgans and seems rather to take refuge in that part of the head which the brain fins if i wish for example to recall a place or person it will arise before me with vividness not according as i strain my attention forwards but rather in proportion as i so to speak retract it backwards 8

it appears probable that the feelings which fechner describes are in part constituted by imaginary semicircular canal sensations 9 these undoubtedly convey the most delicate perception of change in direction and when as here the changes are not perceived as taking place in the external world they occupy a vague internal space located within the head 10

in the skin itself there is a vague form of projection into the third dimension to which hering has called attention

 heat is not felt only against the cutaneous surface but when communicated through the air may appear extending more or less out from the surface into the third dimension of surrounding space we can determine in the dark the place of a radiant body by moving the hand to and fro and attending to the fluctuation of our feeling of warmth the feeling itself however is not projected fully into the spot at which we localize the hot body but always remains in the neighborhood of the hand
the interior of ones mouthcavity feels larger when explored by the tongue than when looked at the crater of a newlyextracted tooth and the movements of a loose tooth in its socket feel quite monstrous a midge buzzing against the drum of the ear will often seem as big as a butterfly the spatial sensibility of the tympanic membrane has hitherto been very little studied though the subject will well repay much trouble if we approach it by introducing into the outer ear some small object like the tip of a rolledup tissuepaper lamplighter we are surprised at the large radiating sensation which its presence gives us end at the sense of clearness and openness which comes when it is removed it is immaterial to inquire whether the farreaching sensation here be due to actual irradiation upon distant nerves or not we are considering now not the objective causes of the spatial feeling but its subjective varieties and the experiment shows that the same object gives more of it to the inner than to the outer cuticle of the ear the pressure of the air in the tympanic cavity upon the membrane gives an astonishingly large sensation we increase the pressure by holding our nostrils and closing our mouth and forcing air through our eustachian tubes by an expiratory effort and we can diminish it by either inspiring or swallowing under the same conditions of closed mouth and nose in either case me get a large round tridimensional sensation inside of the head which seems as if it must come from the affection of an organ much larger than the tympanic membrane whose surface hardly exceeds that of ones littlefingernail

the tympanic membrane is furthermore able to render sensible differences in the pressure of the external atmosphere too slight to be felt either as noise or in this more violent way if the reader will sit with closed eyes and let a friend approximate some solid object like a large book noiselessly to his face he min immediately become aware of the objects presence and position  likewise of its departure a friend of the writer making the experiment for the first time discriminated unhesitatingly between the three degrees of solidity of a board a latticeframe and a sieve held close to his ear now as this sensation is never used by ordinary persons as a means of perception we may fairly assume that its felt quality in those whose attention is called to it for the first time belongs to it quâ sensation and owes nothing to educational suggestions but this felt quality is most distinctly and unmistakably one of vague spatial vastness in three dimensions  quite as much so as is the felt quality of the retinal sensation when we lie on our back and fin the entire held of vision with the empty blue sky when an object is brought near the ear we immediately feel shut in contracted when the object is removed we suddenly feel as if a transparency clearness openness had been made outside of us and the feeling will by any one who will take the pains to observe it be acknowledged to involve the third dimension in a vague unmeasured state 11

the reader will have noticed in this enumeration of facts that voluminousness of the feeling seems to bear very little relation to the size of the organ that yields it the ear and eye are comparatively minute organs yet they give us feelings of great volume the same lack of exact proportion between size of feeling and size of organ affected obtains within the limits of particular sensory organs an object appears smaller on the lateral portions of the retina than it does on the fovea as may be easily verified by holding the two forefingers parallel and a couple of inches apart and transferring the gaze of one eye from one to the other then the finger not directly looked at will appear to shrink and this whatever be the direction of the fingers on the tongue a crumb or the calibre of a small tube appears larger than between the fingers if two points kept equidistant blunted compass or scissorspoints for example be drawn across the skin so as really to describe a pair of parallel lines the lines will appear farther apart in some spots than in others if for example me draw them horizontally across the face so that the mouth falls between them the person experimented upon will feel as if they began to diverge near the mouth and to include it in a well marked ellipse in like manner if we keep the compass

points one or two centimetres apart and draw them down the forearm over the wrist and palm finally drawing one along one finger the other along its neighbor the appearance will be that of a single line soon breaking into two which become more widely separated below the wrist to contract again in the palm and finally diverge rapidly again towards the fingertips the dotted lines in figs 51 and 52 represent the true path of the compasspoints the full lines their apparent path the same length of skin moreover will convey a more extensive sensation according to the manlier of stimulation if the edge of a card be pressed against the skis the distance between its extremities will seem shorter than that between two compasstips touching the same terminal points 12 142

in the eye intensity of nervestimulation seems to increase

the volume of the feeling as well as its brilliancy if we raise and lower the gas alternately the whole room and all the objects in it seem alternately to enlarge and contract if we cover half a page of small print with a gray glass the print seen through the glass appears decidedly smaller than that seen outside of it and the darker the glass the greater the difference when a circumscribed opacity in front of the retina keeps off part of the light from the portion which it covers objects projected on that portion may seem but half as large as when their image falls outside of it 13 the inverse effect seems produced by certain drugs and anæsthetics morphine atropine daturine and cold blunt the sensibility of the skin so that distances upon it seem less haschish produces strange perversions of the general sensibility under its influence ones body may seem either enormously enlarged or strangely contracted sometimes a single member will alter its proportion to the rest or ones back for instance will appear entirely absent as if one mere hollow behind objects comparatively near will recede to a vast distance a short street assume to the eye an immeasurable perspective ether and chloroform occasionally produce not wholly dissimilar results panum the german physiologist relates that when as a boy he was etherized for neuralgia the objects in the room grew extremely small and distant before his held of vision darkhued over and the roaring in his ears began he also mentions that a friend of his in church struggling in vain to keep awake saw the preacher grow smaller and smaller and more and more distant i myself on one occasion observed the same recession of objects during the beginning of chloroformization in various cerebral diseases we find analogous disturbances

can we assign the physiological conditions which make the elementary sensible largeness of one sensation vary so much from that of another only imperfectly one factor in the result undoubtedly is the number of nerveterminations simultaneously excited by the outward agent that awakens the sensation when many skinnerves are warmed or much retinal surface illuminated our feeling is larger than when a lesser nervous surface is excited the single sensation yielded by two compasspoints although it seems simple is yet felt to be much bigger and blunter than that yielded by one the touch of a single point may always be recognized by its quality of sharpness this page looks much smaller to the reader if he closes one eye than if both eyes are open so does the moon which latter fact shows that the phenomenon has nothing to do with parallax the celebrated boy couched for the cataract by cheselden thought after his first eye was operated all things he saw extremely large but being couched of his second eye said that objects at first appeared large to this eye but not so large as they did at first to the other and looking upon the same object with both eyes he thought it looked about twice as large as with the first couched eye only but not double that we can anyways discover

the greater extensiveness that the feeling of certain parts of the same surface has over other parts and that one order of surface has over another retina over skin for example may also to a certain extent be explained by the operation of the same factor it is an anatomical fact that the most spatially sensitive surfaces retina tongue finger tips etc are supplied by nervetrunks of unusual thickness which must supply to every unit of surfacearea an unusually large number of terminal fibres but the variations of felt extension obey probably only a very rough law of numerical proportion to the number of fibres a sound is not twice as voluminous to two ears as to one and the abovecited variations of feeling when the same surface is excited under different conditions show that the feeling is a resultant of several factors of which the anatomical one is only the principal many ingenious hypotheses have been brought forward to assign the cooperating factors where different conditions give conflicting amounts of felt space later we shall analyze some of these cases in detail but it must be confessed here in advance that many of them resist analysis altogether 14

the perception of spatial order

so far all we have established or sought to establish is the existence of the vague form or quale of spatiality as an inseparable element bound up with the other peculiarities of each and every one of our sensations the numerous examples we have adduced of the variations of this extensive element have only been meant to make clear its strictly sensational character in very few of them will the reader have been able to explain the variation by an added intellectual element such as the suggestion of a recollected experience in almost all it has seemed to be the immediate psychic effect of a peculiar sort of nerveprocess excited and all the nerveprocesses in question agree in yielding what space they do yield to the mind in the shape of a simple total vastness in which primitively at least no order of parts or of subdivisions reigns

let no one be surprised at this notion of a space without order there may be a space without order just as there may be an order without space 15 and the primitive perceptions of space are certainly of an unordered kind the order which the spaces first perceived potentially include must before being distinctly apprehended by the mind be woven into those spaces by a rather complicated set of intellectual acts the primordial largenesses which the sensations yield must be measured and subdivided by consciousness and added together before they can form by their synthesis what we know as the real space of the objective world in these operations imagination association attention and selection play a decisive part and although they nowhere add any new material to the spacedata of sense they so shuffle and manipulate these data and hide present ones behind imagined ones that it is no wonder if some authors have gone so far as to think that the sensedata have no spatial worth at all and that the intellect since it makes the subdivisions also gives the spatial quality to them out of resources of its own

as for ourselves having found that all our sensations however as yet unconnected and undiscriminated are of extensive objects our next problem is how do we arrange these at first chaotically given spaces into the one regular and orderly world of space which we now know

to begin with there is no reason to suppose that the several sensespaces of which a sentient creature may become conscious each fined with its own peculiar content should tend simply because they are many to enter into any definite spatial intercourse with each other or lie in any particular order of positions even in ourselves we can recognize this different feelings may coexist in us without assuming any particular spatial order the sound of the brook near which i write the odor of the cedars the comfort with which my breakfast has fined me and my interest in this paragraph all lie distinct in my consciousness but in no sense outside or alongside of each other their spaces are interfused and at most fin the same vaguely objective world even where the qualities are far less disparate we may have something similar if me take our subjective and corporeal sensations alone there are moments when as we lie or sit motionless we find it very difficult to feel distinctly the length of our back or the direction of our feet from our shoulders by a strong effort we can succeed in dispersing our attention impartially over our whole person and then we feel the real shape of our body in a sort of unitary way but in general a few parts are strongly emphasized to consciousness and the rest sink out of notice and it is then remarkable how vague and ambiguous our perception of their relative order of location is obviously the orderly arrangement of a multitude of sensespaces in consciousness something more than their mere separate existence is required what is this further condition
if a number of sensible extents are to be perceived alongside of each other and in definite order they must appear as parts in a vaster sensible extent which can enter the mind simply and ad at once i think it will be seen that the difficulty of estimating correctly the form of ones body by pure feeling arises from the fact that it is very hard to feel its totality as a unit at all the trouble is similar to that of thinking forwards and backwards simultaneously when conscious of our head we tend to grow unconscious of our feet and there enters thus an element of timesuccession into our perception of ourselves which transforms the latter from an act of intuition to one of construction this element of constructiveness is present in a still higher degree and carries with it the same consequences when we deal with objective spaces too great to be grasped by a single look the relative positions of the shops in a town separated by many tortuous streets have to be thus constructed from data apprehended in succession and the result is a greater or less degree of vagueness

that a sensation be discriminated as part from out of a larger enveloping space is then the condition sine quâ non of its being apprehended in a definite spatial order the problem of ordering our feelings in space is then in the first instance a problem of discrimination but not of discrimination pure and simple for then not only coexistent sights but consistent sounds would necessarily assume web order which they notoriously do not whatever is discriminated will appear as a small space within a larger space it is true but this is but the very rudiment of order for the location of it within that space to become precise other conditions still must supervene and the best way to study what they are will be to pause for a little and analyze what the expression spatial order means

spatial order is an abstract term the concrete perceptions which it covers are figures directions positions magnitudes and distances to single out any one of these things from a total vastness is partially to introduce order into the vastness to subdivide the vastness into a multitude of these things is to apprehend it in a completely orderly way now what are these things severally to begin with no one can for an instant hesitate to say that some of them are qualities of sensation just as the total vastness is in which they lie take figure a square a circle and a triangle appear in the best instance to the eye simply as three different kinds elf impressions each so peculiar that we should recognize it if it were to return when nunnerys patient had his cataracts removed and a cube and a sphere were presented to his notice he could at once perceive a difference in their shapes and though he could not say which was the cube and which the sphere he saw they were not of the same figure so of lines if we can notice lines at all in our field of vision it is inconceivable that a vertical one should not affect us differently from an horizontal one and should not be recognized as affecting us similarly when presented again although we might not yet know the name vertical or any of its connotations beyond this peculiar affection of our sensibility so of angles an obtuse one affects our feeling immediately in a different way from an acute one distanceapart too is a simple sensation  the sensation of a line joining the two distant points lengthen the line you alter the feeling and with it the distance felt

spacerelations

but with distance and direction we pass to the category of spacerelations and are immediately confronted by an opinion which makes of all relations something tote coelo different from all facts of feeling or imagination whatsoever a relation for the platonizing school in psychology is an energy of pure thought and as such is quite incommensurable with the data of sensibility between which it may be perceived to obtain we may consequently imagine a disciple of this school to say to us at this point suppose you have made a separate specific sensation of each line and each angle what boots it you have still the order of directions and of distances to account for you have still the relative magnitudes of all these felt figures to state you have their respective positions to define before you can be said to have brought order into your space and not one of these de terminations can be effected except through an act of relating thought so that your attempt to give an account of space in terms of pure sensibility breaks down almost at the very outset position for example can never be a sensation for it has nothing intrinsic about it it can only obtain between a spot line or other figure and extraneous coordinates and can never be an element of the sensible datum the line or the spot in itself let us then confess that thought alone can unlock the riddle of space and that thought is an adorable but unfathomable mystery such a method of dealing with the problem has the merit of shortness let us however be in no such hurry but see whether we cannot get a little deeper by patiently considering what these spacerelations are

relation is a very slippery word it has so many different concrete meanings that the use of it as an abstract universal may easily introduce bewilderment into our thought we must therefore be careful to avoid ambiguity by making sure wherever we have to employ it what its precise meaning is in that particular sphere of application at present we have to do with spacerelations and no others most relations are feelings of an entirely different order from the terms they relate the relation of similarity eg may equally obtain between jasmine and tuberose or between mr brownings verses and mr storys it is itself neither odorous nor poetical and those may well be pardoned who have denied to it all sensational content whatever but just as in the field of quantity the relation between two numbers is another number so in the field of space the relations are facts of the same order with the facts they relate if these latter be catches in the circle of vision the former are certain other patches between them when we speak of the relation of direction of two points toward each other we mean simply the sensation of the line that joins the two points together the line is the relation feel it and you feel the relation see it and you see the relation nor call you in any conceivable way think the latter except by imagining the former however vaguely or describe or indicate the one except by pointing to the other and the moment you have imagined the line the relation stands before you in all its completeness with nothing further to be done just so the relation of direction between two lines is identical with the peculiar sensation of shape of the space enclosed between them this is commonly called an angular relation

if these relations are sensations no less so are the relations of position the relation of position between the top and bottom points of a vertical line is that line and nothing else the relations of position between a point and a horizontal line below it are potentially numerous there is one more important than the rest called its distance this is the sensation ideal or actual of a perpendicular drawn from the point to the line 16 two lines one from each extremity of the horizontal to the point give us a peculiar sensation of triangularity this feeling may be said to constitute the locus of all the relations of position of the elements in question rightness and leftness upness and downness are again pure sensations differing specifically from each other and generically from everything else like all sensations they can only be indicated not described if we take a cube and label one side top another bottom a third front and a fourth back there remains no form of words by which we can describe to another person which of the remaining sides is right and which left we can only point and say here is right and there is left just as we should say this is red and that blue of two points seen beside each other at all one is always affected by one of these feelings and the other by the opposite the same is true of the extremities of any line 17

thus it appears indubitable that all spacerelations except those of magnitude are nothing more or less than pure sensational objects but magnitude appears to outstep this narrow sphere we hare relations of muchness and littleness between times numbers intensities and qualities as well as spaces it is impossible then that such relations should form a particular kind of simply spatial feeling this we must admit the relation of quantity is generic and occurs in many categories of consciousness whilst the other relations we have considered are specific and occur in space alone when our attention passes from a shorter line to a longer from a smaller spot to a larger from a feebler light to a stronger from a paler blue to a richer from a march tune to a galop the transition is accompanied in the synthetic field of consciousness by a peculiar feeling of difference which is what we call the sensation of more  more length more expense more light more blue more motion this transitional sensation of more must be identical with itself under all these different accompaniments or me should not give it the same name in every case we get it when we pass from a short vertical line to a long horizontal one from a small square to a large circle as well as when we pass between those figures whose shapes are congruous but when the shapes are congruous our consciousness of the relation is a good deal more distinct and it is most distinct of all when in the exercise of our analytic attention we notice first a part and then the whole of a single line or shape then the more of the whole actually sticks out as a separate piece of space and is so envisaged the same exact sensation of it is given when we are able to superpose one line or figure on another this indispensable condition of exact measurement of the more has led some to think that the feeling itself arose in every case from original experiences of superposition this is probably not an absolutely true opinion but for our present purpose that is immaterial so far as the subdivisions of a sensespace are to be measured exactly against each other objective forms occupying one subdivision must directly or indirectly be superposed upon the other and the mind must get the immediate feeling of an outstanding plus and even where we only feel one subdivision to be vaguely larger or less the mind must pass rapidly between it and the other subdivision and receive the immediate sensible shock of the more

we seem thus to have accounted for all spacerelations and made them clear to our understanding they are nothing but sensations of particular lines particular angles particular forms of transition or in the case of a distinct more of particular outstanding portions of space after two figures have been superposed these relationsensations may actually be produced as such as when a geometer draws new lines across a figure with his pencil to demonstrate the relations of its parts or they may be ideal representations of lines not really drawn but in either case their entrance into the mind is equivalent to a more detailed subdivision cognizance and measurement of the space considered the bringing of subdivisions to consciousness constitutes then the entire process by which we pass from our first vague feeling of a total vastness to a cognition of the vastness in detail the more numerous the subdivisions are the more elaborate and perfect the cognition becomes but inasmuch as all the subdivisions are themselves sensations and even the feeling of more or less is where not itself a figure at least a sensation of transition between two sensations of figure it follows for aught we can as yet see to the contrary that all spatial knowledge is sensational at bottom and that as the sensations lie together in the unity of consciousness no new material element whatever comes to them from a suprasensible source 18

the bringing of subdivisions to consciousness this then is our next topic they may be brought to consciousness under three aspects in respect of their locality in respect of their size in respect of their shape

the meaning of localization

confining ourselves to the problem of locality for the present let us begin with the simple case of a sensitive surface only two points of which receive stimulation from without how first are these two points felt as alongside of each other with an interval of space between them we must be conscious of two things for this of the duality of the excited points and of the extensiveness of the unexcited interval the duality alone although a necessary is not a sufficient condition of the spatial separation we may for instance discern two sounds in the same place sweet and sour in the same lemonade warm and cold round and pointed contact in the same place on the skin etc 19 in all discrimination the recognition of the duality of two feelings by the mind is the easier the more strongly the feelings are contrasted in quality if our two excited points awaken identical qualities of sensation they must perforce appear to the mind as one and not distinguished at all they are a fortiori not localized apart spots four centimetres distant on the back have no qualitative contrast at all and fuse into a single sensation points less than three thousandths of a millimetre apart awaken on the retina sensations so contrasted that we apprehend them immediately as two now these unlikenesses which arise so slowly when we pass from one point to another in the back so much faster on the tongue and fingertips but with such inconceivable rapidity on the retina what are they can we discover anything about their intrinsic nature

the most natural and immediate answer to make is that they are unlikeness of place pure and simple in the words of the german physiologist 20 to who psychophysics owes much
 the sensations are from the outset von vornherein localized every sensation as such is from the very beginning affected with the spatial quality so that this quality is nothing like an external attribute coming to the sensation from a higher faculty but must be regarded as something immanently residing in the sensation itself

and yet the moment we reflect on this answer an insuperable logical difficulty seems to present itself no single quail of sensation can by itself amount to a consciousness of position suppose no feeling but that of a single point ever to be awakened could that possibly be the feeling of any special whereness or thereness certainly not only when a second point is felt to arise can the first one acquire a determination of up down right or left and these determinations are all relative to that second point each point so far as it is placed is then only by virtue of what it is not namely by virtue of another point this is as much as to say that position has nothing intrinsic about it and that although a feeling of absolute bigness may a feeling of place cannot possibly form an immanent element in any single isolated sensation the very writer we have quoted has given heed to this objection for he continues p 335 by saying that the sensations thus originally localized are only so in themselves but not in the representation of consciousness which is not yet present they are in the first instance devoid of all mutual relations with each other but such a localization of the sensation in itself would seem to mean nothing more than the susceptibility or potentiality of being distinctly localized when the time came and other conditions became fulfilled can we now discover anything about such susceptibility in itself before it has borne its ulterior fruits in the developed consciousness

local signs

to begin with every sensation of the skin and every visceral sensation seems to derive from its topographic seat a peculiar shade of feeling which it would not have in another place and this feeling per se seems quite another thing from the perception of the place says wundt 21

if with the finger we touch first the cheek and then the palm exerting each time precisely the same pressure the sensation shows notwithstanding a distinctly marked difference in the two cases similarly when we compare the palm with the back of the hand the nape of the neck with its anterior surface the breast with the back in short any two distant parts of the skin with each other and moreover we easily remark by attentively observing that spots even tolerably close together differ in respect of the quality of their feeling if we pass from one point of our cutaneous surface to another we find a perfectly gradual and continuous alteration in our feeling notwithstanding the objective nature of the contact has remained the same even the sensations of corresponding points on opposite sides of the body though similar are not identical if for instance we touch first the back of one hand and then of the other we remark a qualitative unlikeness of sensation it must not be thought that such differences are mere matters of imagination and that we take the sensations to be different because we represent each of them to ourselves as occupying a different place with sufficient sharpening of the attention we may confining ourselves to the quality of the feelings alone entirely abstract from their locality and yet notice the differences quite as markedly

whether these local contrasts shade into each other with absolutely continuous gradations we cannot say but we know continues wundt that

they change when we pass from one point of the skin to its neighbor with very different degrees of rapidity on delicatelyfeeling parts used principally for touching such as the fingertips the difference of sensation between two closely approximate points is already strongly pronounced whilst in parts of lesser delicacy as the arm the back the legs the disparities of sensation are observable only between distant spots

the internal organs too have their specific qualia of sensation an inflammation of the kidney is different from one of the liver pains in joints and muscular insertions are distinguished pain in the dental nerves is wholly unlike the pain of a burn but very important and curious similarities prevail throughout these differences internal pains whose seat we cannot see and have no means of knowing unless the character of the pain itself reveal it are felt where they belong diseases of the stomach kidney liver rectum prostate etc of the bones of the brain and its membranes are referred to their proper position nervepains describe the length of the nerve such localizations as those of vertical frontal or occipital headache of intracranial origin force us to conclude that parts which are neighbors whether inner or outer may possess by mere virtue of that fact a common peculiarity of feeling a respect in which their sensations agree and which serves as a token of their proximity these local colorings are moreover so strong that we cognize them as the same throughout all contrasts of sensible quality in the accompanying perception cold and heat are wide as the poles asunder yet if both fall on the cheek there mixes with them something that makes them in that respect identical just as contrariwise despite the identity of cold with itself wherever found when we get it first on the palm and then on the cheek some difference comes which keeps the two experiences for ever asunder 22

and now let us revert to the query propounded a moment since can these differences of mere quality in feeling varying according to locality yet having each sensibly and intrinsically and by itself nothing to do with position constitute the susceptibilities we mentioned the conditions of being perceived in position of the localities to which they belong the numbers on a row of houses the initial letters of a set of words have no intrinsic kinship with points of space and yet they are the conditions of our knowledge of where any house is in the row or any word in the dictionary can the modifications of feeling in question be tags or labels of this kind which in no wise originally reveal the position of the spot to which they are attached but guide us to it by what berkeley would call a customary tie many authors have unhesitatingly replied in the affirmative lotze who in his medzinische psychologie 23 first described the sensations in this way designating them thus conceived as localsigns this term has obtained wide currency in germany and in speaking of the localsign theory hereafter i shall always mean the theory which denies that there can be in a sensation any element of actual locality of inherent spatial order any tone as it were which cries to us immediately and without further ado i am here or i am there if as may well be the case we by this time and ourselves tempted to accept the localsign theory in a general way we have to clear up several farther matters if a sign is to lead us to the thing it means we must have some other source of knowledge of that thing either the thing has been given in a previous experience of which the sign also formed partthey are associated  or it is what reid calls a natural sign that is a feeling which the first time it enters the mind evokes from the native powers thereof a cognition of the thing that hitherto had lain dormant in both cases however the sign is one thing and the thing another in the instance that now concerns us the sign is a quality of feeling and the thing is a position now we have seen that the position of a point is not only revealed but created by the existence of other points to which it stands in determinate relations if the sign can by any machinery which it sets in motion evoke consciousness either of the other points or of the relations or of both it would seem to fulfil its function and reveal to us the position we seek

but such a machinery is already familiar to us it is neither more nor less than the law of habit in the nervous system when any point of the sensitive surface has been frequently excited simultaneously with or immediately before or after other points and afterwards comes to be excited alone there will be a tendency for its perceptive nervecentre to irradiate into the nervecentres of the other points subjectively considered this is the same as if we said that the peculiar feeling of the first point suggests the feeling of the entire region with whose stimulation its own excitement has been habitually associated

take the case of the stomach when the epigastrium is heavily pressed when certain muscles contract etc the stomach is squeezed and its peculiar local sign awakes in consciousness simultaneously with the local signs of the other squeezed parts there is also a sensation of total vastness aroused by the combined irritation and somewhere in this the stomachfeeling seems to lie suppose that later a pain arises in the stomach from some nonmechani cal cause it will be tinged by the gastric local sign and the nervecentre supporting this latter feeling will excite the centre supporting the dermal and muscular feelings habitually associated with it when the excitement was mechanical from the combination the same peculiar vastness will again arise in a word something in the stomachsensation reminds us of a total space of which the diaphragmatic and epigastric sensations also form a part or to express it more briefly still suggests the neighborhood of these latter organs 24

revert to the case of two excited points on a surface with an unexcited space between them the general result of previous experience has been that when either point was impressed by an outward object the same object also touched the immediately neighboring parts each point together with its local sign is thus associated with a circle of surrounding points the association fading in strength as the circle grows larger each will revive its own circle but when both are excited together the strongest revival will be that due to the combined irradiation now the tract joining the two excited points is the only part common to the two circles and the feelings of this whole tract will therefore awaken with considerable vividness in the imagination when its extremities are touched by an outward irritant the mind receives with the impression of the two distinct points the vague idea of a line the twoness of the points comes from the contrast of their local signs the line comes from the associations into which experience has wrought these latter if no ideal line arises me have duality without sense of interval if the line be excited actually rather than ideally we have the interval given with its ends in the form of a single extended object felt e h weber in the famous article in which he laid the foundations of all our accurate knowledge of these subjects laid it down as the logical requisite for the perception of two separated points that the mind should along with its consciousness of them become aware of an unexcited interval as such i have only tried to show how the known laws of experience may cause this requisite to be fulfilled of course if the local signs of the entire region offer but little qualitative contrast inter se the line suggested will be but dimly defined or discriminated in length or direction from other possible lines in its neighborhood this is what happens in the back where consciousness can sunder two spots whilst only vaguely apprehending their distance and direction apart

the relation of position of the two points is the suggested interval or line turn now to the simplest case that of a single excited spot how can it suggest its position not by recalling any particular line unless experience have constantly been in the habit of marking or tracing some one line from it towards some one neighboring point now on the back belly viscera etc no such tracing habitually occurs the consequence is that the only suggestion is that of the whole neighboring circle ie the spot simply recalls the general region in which it happens to lie by a process of successive construction it is quite true that we can also get the feeling of distance between the spot and some other particular spot attention by reinforcing the local sign of one part of the circle can awaken a new circle round this part and so de proche en proche we may slide our feeling down from our cheek say to our foot but when we first touched our cheek we had no consciousness of the foot at all 25 in the extremities the lips the tongue and other mobile parts the case is different we there have an instinctive tendency when a part of lesser discriminative sensibility is touched to move the member so that the touching object glides along it to the place where sensibility is greatest if a body touches our hand we move the hand over it tin the fingertips are able to explore it if the sole of our foot touches anything we bring it towards the toes and so forth there thus arise lines of habitual passage from all points of a member to its sensitive tip these are the lines most readily recalled when any point is touched and their recall is identical with the consciousness of the distance of the touched point from the tip i think anyone must be aware when he touches a point of his hand or wrist that it is the relation to the fingertips of which he is usually most conscious points on the forearm suggest either the fingertips or the elbow the latter being a spot of greater sensibility 26  in the foot it is the toes and so on a point can only be cognized in its relations to the entire body at once by awakening a visual image of the whole body such awakening is even more obviously than the previously considered cases a matter of pure association

this leads us to the eye on the retina the fovea and the yellow spot about it form a focus of exquisite sensibility towards which every impression falling on an outlying portion of the field is moved by an instinctive action of the muscles of the eyeball few persons until their attention is called to the fact are aware how almost impossible it is to keep a conspicuous visible abject in the margin of the field of view the moment volition is relaxed we find that without our knowing it our eyes have turned so as to bring it to the centre this is why most persons are unable to keep the eyes steadily converged upon a point in space with nothing in it the objects against the walls of the room invincibly attract the foveæ to themselves if we contemplate a blank wall or sheet of paper we always observe in a moment that we are directly looking at some speck upon it which unnoticed at first ended by catching our eye thus whenever an image falling on the point p of the retina excites attention it more habitually moves from that point towards the fovea than in any one other direction the line traced thus by the image is not always a straight line when the direction of the point from the fovea is neither vertical nor horizontal but oblique the line traced is often a curve with its concavity directed upwards if the direction is upwards downwards if the direction is downwards this may be verified by anyone who will take the trouble to make a simple experiment with a luminous body like a candleflame in a dark enclosure or a star gazing first at some point remote from the source of light let the eye be suddenly turned full upon the latter the luminous image will necessarily fall in succession upon a continuous series of points reaching from the one first affected to the fovea but by virtue of the slowness with which retinal excitements die away the entire series of points will for an instant be visible as an afterimage displaying the above peculiarity of form according to its situation 27 these radiating lines are neither regular nor invariable in the same person nor probably equally curved in different individuals we are incessantly drawing them between the fovea and every point of the held of view objects remain in their peripheral indistinctness only so long as they are unnoticed the moment we attend to them they grow distinct through one of these motions  which leads to the idea prevalent among uninstructed persons that we see distinctly all parts of the field of view at once the result of this incessant tracing of radii is that whenever a local sign p is awakened by a spot of light falling upon it it recalls forthwith even though the eyeball be unmoved the local signs of all the other points which lie between p and the fovea it recalls them in imaginary form just as the normal reflex movement would recall them in vivid form and with their recall is given a consciousness more or less faint of the whole line on which they lie in other words no ray of light can fall on any retinal spot without the local sign of that spot revealing to us by recalling the line of its most habitual associates its direction and distance from the centre of the held the fovea acts thus as the origin of a system of polar coordinates in relation to which each and every retinal point has through an incessantlyrepeated process of association its distance and direction determined were p alone illumined and all the rest of the field dark we should still even with motionless eyes know whether p lay high or low right or left through the ideal streak different from all other streaks which p alone has the power of awakening 28

and with this we can close the first great division of our subject we have shown that within the range of every sense experience takes ab initio the spatial form we have also shown that in the cases of the retina and skin every sensible total may be subdivided by discriminative attention into sensible parts which are also spaces and into relations between the parts these being sensible spaces too furthermore we have seen in a footnote that different parts once discriminated necessarily fall into a determinate order both by reason of definite gradations in their quality and by reason of the fixed order of timesuccession in which movements arouse them but in all this nothing has been said of the comparative measurement of one sensible spacetotal against another or of the way in which by summing our divers simple sensible spaceexperiences together we end by constructing what we regard as the unitary continuous and infinite objective space of the real world to this more difficult inquiry we next pass

the construction of real space

the problem breaks into two subordinate problems

1 how is the subdivision and measurement of the several sensorial spaces completely effected and

2 how do their mutual addition and fusion and reduction to the same scale in a word how does their synthesis occur

i think that as in the investigation just finished we found ourselves able to get along without invoking any data but those that pure sensibility on the one hand and the ordinary intellectual powers of discrimination and recollec tion on the other were able to yield so here we shall emerge from our more complicated quest with the conviction that all the facts can be accounted for on the supposition that no other mental forces have been at work save those we find everywhere else in psychology sensibility namely for the data and discrimination association memory and choice for the rearrangements and combinations which they undergo

1 the subdivision of the original sensespaces

how are spatial subdivisions brought to consciousness  in other words how does spatial discrimination occur the general subject of discrimination has been treated in a previous chapter here we need only inquire what are the conditions that make spatial discrimination so much finer in sight than in touch and in touch than in hearing smell or taste

the first great condition is that different points of the surface shall differ in the quality of their immanent sensibility that is that each shall carry its special localsign if the skin felt everywhere exactly alike a footbath could be distinguished from a total immersion as being smaller but never distinguished from a wet face the localsigns are indispensable two points which have the same localsign will always be felt as the same point we do not judge them two unless we have discerned their sensations to be different 29 granted none but homogeneous irritants that organ would then distinguish the greatest multiplicity of irritants  would count most stars or compasspoints or best compare the size of two wet surfaces  whose local sensibility was the least even a skin whose sensibility shaded rapidly off from a focus like the apex of a boil would be better than a homogeneous integument for spatial perception the retina with its exquisitely sensitive fovea has this peculiarity and undoubtedly owes to it a great part of the minuteness with which we are able to subdivide the total bigness of the sensation it yields on its periphery the local differences do not shade off very rapidly and we can count there fewer subdivisions

but these local differences of feeling so long as the surface is unexcited from without are almost null i cannot feel them by a pure mental act of attention unless they belong to quite distinct parts of the body as the nose and the lip the fingertip and the ear their contrast needs the reinforcement of outward excitement to be felt in the spatial muchness of a colic  or to call it by the more spacioussounding vernacular of a bellyache  one can with difficulty distinguish the northeast from the southwest corner but can do so much more easily if by pressing ones finger against the former region one is able to make the pain there more intense

the local differences require then an adventitious sensation superinduced upon them to awaken the attention after the attention has once been awakened in this way it may continue to be conscious of the unaided difference lust as a sail on the horizon may be too faint for us to notice until someones finger placed against the spot has pointed it out to us but may then remain visible after the finger has been withdrawn but all this is true only on condition that separate points of the surface may be exclusively stimulated if the whole surface at once be excited from without and homogeneously as for example by immersing the body in salt water local discrimination is not furthered the local signs it is true all awaken at once but in such multitude that no one of them with its specific quality stands out in contrast with the rest if however a single extremity be immersed the contrast between the wet and dry parts is strong and at the surface of the water especially the localsigns attract the attention giving the feeling of a ring surrounding the member similarly two or three wet spots separated by dry spots or two or three hard points against the skin will help to break up our consciousness of the latters bigness in eases of this sort where points receiving an identical kind of excitement are nevertheless felt to be locally distinct and the objective irritants are also judged multiple  eg compasspoints on skin or stars on retina  the ordinary explanation is no doubt just and we judge the outward causes to be multiple because we have discerned the local feelings of their sensations to be different

capacity for partial stimulation is thus the second condition favoring discrimination a sensitive surface which has to be excited in all its parts at once can yield nothing but a sense of undivided largeness this appears to be the case with the olfactory and to all intents and purposes with the gustatory surfaces of many tastes and flavors even simultaneously presented each affects the totality of its respective organ each appears with the whole vastness given by that organ and appears interpenetrated by the rest 30

i should have been wining some years ago to name with out hesitation a third condition of discriminationsaying it would be most developed in that organ which is susceptible of the most various qualities of feeling the retina is un questionably such an organ the colors and shades it perceives are infinitely more numerous than the diversities of skinsensation and it can feel at once white and black whilst the ear can in nowise so feel sound and silence but the late researches of donaldson blix and goldscheider 31 on specific points for heat cold pressure and pain in the skin the older ones of czermak repeated later by klug in ludwigs laboratory showing that a hot and a cold compasspoint are no more easily discriminated as two than two of equal temperature and some unpublished experiments of my own  all disincline me to make much of this condition now 32 there is however one quality of sensa tion which is particularly exciting and that is the feeling of motion over any of our surfaces the erection of this into a separate elementary quality of sensibility is one of the most recent of psychological achievements and is worthy of detaining us a while at this point

the sensation of motion over surfaces

the feeling of motion has generally been assumed by physiologists to be impossible until the positions of terminus ad quem and terminus ad quem are severally cognized and the successive occupancies of these positions by the moving body are perceived to be separated by a distinct interval of time 33 as a matter of fact however we cognize only the very slowest motions in this way seeing the hand of a clock at xii and afterwards at vi we judge that it has moved through the interval seeing the sun now in the east and again in the west i infer it to have passed over my head but we can only infer that which we already generically know in some more direct fashion and it is experimentally certain that we have the feeling of motion given us as a direct and simple sensation czermak long ago pointed out the difference between seeing the motion of the secondhand of a watch when we look directly at it and noticing the fact of its having altered its position when we fix our gaze upon some other point of the dialplate in the first case we have a specific quality of sensation which is absent in the second if the reader will find a portion of his skin  the arm for example  where a pair of compasspoints an inch apart are felt as one impression and if he will then trace lines a tenth of an inch long on that spot with a pencilpoint he will be distinctly aware of the points motion and vaguely aware of the direction of the motion the perception of the motion here is certainly not derived from a preexisting knowledge that its starting and ending points are separate positions in space because positions in space ten times wider apart fail to be discriminated as such when excited by the dividers it is the same with the retina ones fingers when cast upon its peripheral portions cannot be counted  that is to say the five retinal tracts which they occupy are not distinctly apprehended by the mind as five separate positions in space  and yet the slightest movement of the fingers is most vividly perceived as movement and nothing else it is thus certain that our sense of movement being so much more delicate than our sense of position cannot possibly be derived from it a curious observation by exner 34 completes the proof that movement in a primitive form of sensibility by showing it to be much more delicate than our sense of succession in time this very able physiologist caused two electric sparks to appear in rapid succession one beside the other the observer had to state whether the righthand one or the lefthand one appeared first when the interval was reduced to as short a time as 0044 the discrimination of temporal order in the sparks became impossible but exner found that if the sparks were brought so close together in space that their irradiationcircles overlapped the eye then felt their flashing as if it were the motion of a single spark from the point occupied by the first to the point occupied by the second and the timeinterval might then be made as small as 0015 before the mind began to be in doubt as to whether the apparent motion started from the right or from the left on the skin similar experiments gave similar results

vierordt at almost the same time 35 called attention to certain persistent illusions amongst which are these if another person gently trace a line across our wrist or finger the latter being stationary it will feel to us as if the member were moving in the opposite direction to the tracing point if on the contrary we move our limb across a fixed point it will be seen as if the point were moving as well if the reader will touch his forehead with his forefinger kept motionless and then rotate the head so that the skin of the forehead passes beneath the fingers tip he will have an irresistible sensation of the latter being itself in motion in the opposite direction to the head so in abducting the fingers from each other some may move and the rest be still still but the still ones will feel as if they were actively separating from the rest these illusions according to vierordt are survivals of a primitive form of perception when motion was felt as such but ascribed to the whole content of consciousness and not yet distinguished as belonging exclusively to one of its parts when our perception is fully developed we go beyond the mere relative motion of thing and bound and can ascribe absolute motion to one of these components of our total object and absolute rest to another when in vision for example the whole background moves together we think that it is ourselves or our eyes which are moving and any object in the foregound which may move relatively to the background is judged by us to be still but primitively this discrimination cannot be perfectly made the sensation of the motion spreads over all that we see and infects it any relative motion of object and retina both makes the object seem to move and makes us feel ourselves in motion even now when our whole object moves we still get giddy and we still see an apparent motion of the entire held of view whenever we suddenly jerk our head and eyes or shake them quickly to and fro pushing our eyeballs gives the same illusion we know in all these cases what really happens but the conditions are unusual so our primitive sensation persists unchecked so it does when clouds float by the moon we know the moon is still but we see it move even faster than the clouds even when we slowly move our eyes the primitive sensation persists under the victorious conception if we notice closely the experience we find that any object towards which we look appears moving to meet our eye but the most valuable contribution to the subject is the paper of g h schneider 36 who takes up the matter zoologically and shows by examples from every branch of the animal kingdom that movement is the quality by which animals most easily attract each others attention the in stinct of shamming death is no shamming of death at all but rather a paralysis through fear which saves the insect crustacean or other creature from being noticed at all by his enemy it is paralleled in the human race by the breathholding stillness of the boy playing i spy to whom the seeker is near and its obverse side is shown in our involuntary waving of arms jumping up and down and so forth when we wish to attract someones attention at a distance creatures stalking their prey and creatures hiding from their pursuers alike show how immobility diminishes conspicuity in the woods if we are quiet the squirrels and birds will actually touch us flies will light on stuffed birds and stationary frogs 37 on the other hand the tremendous shock of feeling the thing we are sitting on begin to move the exaggerated start it gives us to have an insect unexpectedly pass over our skin or a cat noiselessly come and snuffle about our hand the excessive reflex effects of tickling etc show how exciting the sensation of motion is per se a kitten cannot help pursuing a moving ball impressions too faint to be cognized at all are immediately felt if they move a fly sitting is unnoticed  we feel it the moment it crawls a shadow may be too faint to be perceived as soon as it moves however we see it schneider found that a shadow with distinct outline and directly fixated could still be perceived when moving although its objective strength might be but half as great as that of a stationary shadow so faint as just to disappear with a blurred shadow in indirect vision the difference in favor of motion was much greater  namely 133407 if me hold a finger between our closed eyelid and the sunshine we shall not notice its presence the moment we move it to and fro however we discern it such visual perception as this reproduces the conditions of sight among the radiates 38

enough has now been said to show that in the education of spatial discrimination the motions of impressions across sensory surfaces must have been the principal agent in breaking up our consciousness of the surfaces into a consciousness of their parts even today the main function of the peripheral regions of our retina is that of sentinels which when beams of light move over them cry who goes there  and call the fovea to the spot most parts of the skin do but perform the same of office for the fingertips of course fingertips and fovea leave some power of direct perception to marginal retina and skin respectively but it is worthy of note that such perception is best developed on the skin of the most movable parts the labors of vierordt and his pupils have well shown this and that in the blind whose skin is exceptionally discriminative it seems to have become so through the inveterate habit which most of them possess of twitching and moving it under whatever object may touch them so as to become better acquainted with the con formation of the same czermak was the first to notice this it may be easily verified of course movement of surface under object is for purposes of stimulation equivalent to movement of object over surface in exploring the shapes and sizes of things by either eye or skin the movements of these organs are incessant and unrestrainable every such movement draws the points and lines of the object across the surface imprints them a hundred times more sharply and drives them home to the attention the immense part thus played by movements in our perceptive activity is held by many psychologists 39 to prove that the muscles are themselves the spaceperceiving organ not surfacesensibility but the muscular sense is for these writers the original and only revealer of objective extension but they have all failed to notice with what peculiar intensity muscular contractions call surfacesensibilities into play and that the mere discrimination of impressions quite apart from any question of measuring the space between them largely depends on the mobility of the surface upon which they fall 40

2 the measurement of the sensespaces against each other

what precedes is all we can say in answer to the problem of discrimination turn now to that of measurement of the several spaces against each other that being the first step in our constructing out of our diverse spaceexperiences the one space we believe in as that of the real world

the first thing that seems evident is that we have no immediate power of comparing together with any accuracy the extents revealed by different sensations our mouthcavity feels indeed to itself smaller and to the tongue larger than it feels to the finger or eye our tympanic membrane feels larger than our fingertip our lips feel larger then a surface equal to them on our thigh so much comparison is immediate but it is vague and for anything exact we must resort to other help

the great agent in comparing the extent felt by one sensory surface with that felt by another is superpositionsuperposition of one surface upon another and superposition of one outer thing upon many surfaces thus are exact equivalencies and common measures introduced and the way prepared for numerical results

could we not superpose one part of our skin upon another or one object on both parts we should hardly succeed in coming to that knowledge of our own form which we possess the original differences of bigness of our different parts would remain vaguely operative and we should have no certainty as to how much lip was equivalent to so much forehead how much finger to so much back

but with the power of exploring one part of the surface by another we get a direct perception of cutaneous equivalencies the primitive differences of bigness are overpowered when we feel by an immediate sensation that a certain length of thighsurface is in contact with the entire palm and fingers and when a motion of the opposite fingertips draws a line first along this same length of thigh and then along the whole of the hand in question we get a new manner of measurement less direct but confirming the equivalencies established by the first in these ways by superpositions of parts and by tracing lines on different parts by identical movements a person deprived of sight can soon learn to reduce all the dimensions of his body to a homogeneous scale by applying the same methods to objects of his own size or smaller he can with equal ease make himself acquainted with their extension stated in terms derived from his own bulk palms feet cubits spans paces fathoms armspreads etc in these reductions it is to be noticed that when the resident sensations of largeness of two opposed surfaces conflict one of the sensations is chosen as the true standard and the other treated as illusory thus an empty toothsocket is believed to be really smaller than the fingertip which it will not admit although it may feel larger and in general it may be said that the hand as the almost exclusive organ of palpation gives its own magnitude to the other parts instead of having its size determined by them in general it is as fechner says the extent felt by the more sensitive part to which the other extents are reduced 41

but even though exploration of one surface by another were impossible we could always measure our various surfaces against each other by applying the same extended object first to one and then to another we should of course have the alternative of supposing that the object itself waxed and waned as it glided from one place to another cf above p 141 but the principle of simplifying as much as possible our world would soon drive us out of that assumption into the easier one that objects as a rule keep their sizes and that most of our sensations are affected by errors for which a constant allowance must be made

in the retina there is no reason to suppose that the bignesses of two impressions lines or blotches falling on different regions are primitively felt to stand in any exact mutual ratio it is only when the impressions come from the same object that we judge their sizes to be the same and this too only when the relation of the object to the eye is believed to be on the whole unchanged when the object by moving changes its relations to the eye the sensation excited by its image even on the same retinal region becomes so fluctuating that we end by ascribing no absolute import whatever to the retinal spacefeeling which at any moment we may receive so complete does this overlooking of retinal magnitude become that it is next to impossible to compare the visual magnitudes of objects at different distances without making the experiment of superposition we cannot say beforehand how much of a distant house or tree our finger will cover the various answers to the familiar question how large is the moon  answers which vary from a cartwheel to a wafer  illustrate this most strikingly the hardest part of the training of a young draughtsman is his learning to feel directly the retinal ie primitively sensible magnitudes which the different objects in the held of view subtend to do this he must recover what ruskin calls the innocence of the eye  that is a sort of childish perception of stains of color merely as such without consciousness of what they mean with the rest of us this innocence is lost out of all the visual magnitudes of each known object we have selected one as the real one to think of and degraded all the others to serve as its signs this real magnitude is determined by aesthetic and practical interests it is that which we get when the object is at the distance most propitious for exact visual discrimination of its details this is the distance at which we hold anything we are examining farther than this we see it too smell nearer too large and the larger and the smaller feeling vanish in the act of suggesting this one their more important meaning as i look along the dining table i overlook the fact that the farther plates and glasses feel so much smaller than my own for i know that they are all equal in size and the feeling of them which is a present sensation is eclipsed in the share of the knowledge which is a merely imagined one

if the inconsistencies of sightspaces inter se can thus be reduced of course there can be no difficulty in equating sightspaces with spaces given to touch in this equation it is probably the touchfeeling which prevails as real and the sight which serves as sign  a reduction made necessary not only by the far greater constancy of felt over seen magnitudes but by the greater practical interest which the sense of touch possesses for our lives as a rule things only benefit or harm us by coming into direct contact with our skin sight is only a sort of anticipatory touch the letter is in mrspencers phrase the mothertongue of thought and the handmaids idiom must be translated into the language of the mistress before it can speak clearly to the mind 42

later on we shall see that the feelings excited in the joints when a limb moves are used as signs of the path traversed by the extremity but of this more anon as for the equating of sound smell and tastevolumes with those yielded by the more discriminative senses they are too vague to need any remark it may be observed of pain however that its size has to be reduced to that of the normal tactile size of the organ which is its seat a finger with a felon on it and the pulses of the arteries therein both feel larger than we believe they really are

it will have been noticed in the account given that when two sensorial senseimpressions believed to come from the same object differ then the one most interesting practically or æsthetically is judged to be the true one this law of interest holds throughout  though a permanent interest like that of touch may resist a strong but fleeting one like that of pain as in the case just given of the felon

3 the summation of the sensespaces

now for the next step in our construction of real space how are the various sensespaces added together into a consolidated and unitary continuum for they are in man at all events incoherent at the start

here again the first fact that appears is that primitively our spaceexperiences form a chaos out of which we have no immediate faculty for extricating them objects of different senseorgans experienced together do not in the first instance appear either inside or alongside or far outside of each other neither spatially continuous nor discontinuous in any definite sense of these words the same thing is almost as true of objects felt by different parts of the same organ before discrimination has done its finished work the most we can say is that all our spaceexperiences together form an objective total and that this objective total is vast

even now the space inside our mouth which is so intimately known and accurately measured by its inhabitant the tongue can hardly be said to have its internal directions and dimensions known in any exact relation to those of the larger world outside it forms almost a little world by itself again when the dentist excavates a small cavity in one of our teeth we feel the hard point of his instrument scraping in distinctly differing directions a surface which seems to our sensibility vaguely larger than the subsequent use of the mirror tells us it really is and though the directions of the scraping differ so completely inter se not one of them can be identified with the particular direction in the outer world to which it corresponds the space of the toothsensibility is thus really a little world by itself which can only become congruent with the outer space world by farther experiences which shall alter its bulk identify its directions fuse its margins and finally embed it as a definite part within a definite whole and even though every joints rotations should be felt to vary inter se as so many differences of direction in a common room even though the same were true of diverse tracings on the skin and of diverse tracings on the retina respectively it would still not follow that feelings of direction on these different surfaces are intuitively comparable among each other or with the other directions yielded by the feelings of the semicircular canals it would not follow that we should immediately judge the relations of them all to each other in one spaceworld

if with the arms in an unnatural attitude we feel things we are perplexed about their shape size and position let the reader lie on his back with his arms stretched above his head and it will astonish him to find how in able he is to recognize the geometrical relations of objects placed within reach of his hands but the geometrical relations here spoken of are nothing but identities recognized between the directions and sizes perceived in this way and those perceived in the more usual ways the two ways do not fit each other intuitively

how lax the connection between the system of visual and the system of tactile directions is in man appears from the facility with which microscopists learn to reverse the movements of their hand in manipulating things on the stage of the instrument to move the slide to the seen left they must draw it to the felt right but in a very few days the habit becomes a second nature so in tying our cravat shaving before a mirror etc the right and left sides are inverted and the directions of our hand movements are the opposite of what they seen yet this never annoys us only when by accident we try to tie the cravat of another person do we learn that there are two ways of combining sight and touch perceptions let any one try for the first time to write or draw while looking at the image of his hand and paper in a mirror and he will be utterly bewildered but a very short training will teach him to undo in this respect the associations of his previous lifetime

prisms show this in an even more striking way if the eyes be armed with spectacles containing slightly prismatic glasses with their bases turned for example towards the right every object looked at will be apparently translocated to the left and the hand put forth to grasp ally which object will make the mistake of passing beyond it on the left side but less than an hour of practice in wearing such spectacles rectifies the judgment so that no more mistakes are made in fact the newformed associations are already so strong that when the prisms are first laid aside again the opposite error is committed the habits of a lifetime violated and the hand now passed to the right of every object which it seeks to touch

the primitive chaos thus subsists to a great degree through life so far as our immediate sensibility goes we feel our various objects and their bignesses together or in succession but so soon as it is a question of the order and relations of many of them at once our intuitive apprehension remains to the very end most vague and incomplete whilst we are attending to one or at most to two or three objects all the others lapse and the most we feel of them is that they still linger on the outskirts and can be caught again by turning in a certain way nevertheless throughout all this confusion we conceive of a world spread out in a perfectly fixed and orderly fashion and we believe in its existence the question is how do this conception and this belief arise how is the chaos smoothed and straightened out

mainly by two operations some of the experiences are apprehended to exist out and alongside of each other and others are apprehended to interpenetrate each other and to occupy the same room in this way what was incoherent and irrelative ends by being coherent and definitely related  nor is it hard to trace the principles by which the mind is guided in this arrangement of its perceptions in detail

in the first place following the great intellectual law of economy we simplify unify and identify as much as we possibly can whatever sensible data can be attended to together we locate together their several extents seem one extent the place at which each appears is held to be the same with the place at which the others appear they become in short so many properties of one and the same real thing this is the first and great commandment the fundamental act by which our world gets spatially arranged

in this coalescence in a thing one of the coalescing sensations is held to be the thing the other sensations are taken for its more or less accidental properties or modes of appearance 43 the sensation chosen to be the thing essentially is the most constant and practically important of the lot most often it is hardness or weight but the hardness or weight is never without tactile bulk and as we can always see something in our hand when me feel something there we can always see something there when we essence of the thing frequently a shape so figures sometimes a temperature a taste etc but for the most part temperature smell sound color or whatever other phenomena may vividly impress us simultaneously with the bulk felt or seen figure among the accidents smell and sound impress us it is true when we neither see nor touch the thing but they are strongest when we see or touch so we locate the source of these properties within the touched or seen space whilst their properties themselves we regard as overflowing in a weakened form into the spaces fined by otherthings in all this it will be observed the sensedata whose spaces coalesce into one are yield by different senseorgans such data have no tendency to displace each other from consciousness but can be attended to together all at once often indeed they vary concomitantly and reach a maximum together we may be sure therefore that the general rule of our mind is to locate in each other all sensations which are associated in simultaneous experience and do not interfere with each others perception 44

different impressions on the same senseorgan do interfere with each others perception and cannot well be attended to at once hence we do not locate them in each others spaces but arrange them in a serial order of exteriority each alongside of the rest in a space larger than that which any one sensation brings this larger space however is an object of conception rather than of direct intuition and bears all the marks of being constructed piecemeal by the mind the blind man forms it out of tactile locomotor and auditory experiences the seeing men out of visual ones almost exclusively as the visual construction is the easiest to understand let us consider that first

every single visual sensation or field of view is limited to get a new field of view for our object the old one must disappear but the disappearance may be only partial let the first field of view be a b c if we carry our attention to the limit c it ceases to be the limit and becomes the centre of the field and beyond it appear fresh parts where there were none before 45 a b c changes in short to c d e but although the parts a b are lost to sight yet their image abides in the memory and if we think of our first object a b c as having existed or as still existing at all we must think of it as it was originally presented namely as spread out from c in one direction just as c d e is spread out in another a b and d e can never coalesce in one place as they could were they objects of different senses because they call never be perceived at once we must lose one to see the other so the letters standing now for things we get to conceive of the successive fields of things after the analogy of the several things which we perceive in a single field they must be out and alongside of each other and we conceive that their juxtaposed spaces must make a larger space a b c  c d e must in short be imagined to exist in the form of a b c d e or not imagined at all

we can usually recover anything lost from sight by moving our attention and our eyes back in its direction and through these constant changes every field of seen things comes at last to be thought of as always having a fringe of other things possible to be seen spreading in all directions round about it meanwhile the movements concomitantly with which the various fields alternate are also felt and remembered and gradually through association this and that movement come in our thought to suggest this or that extent of fresh objects introduced gradually too since the objects vary indefinitely in kind we abstract from their several natures and think separately of their mere extents of which extents the various movements remain as the only constant introducers and associates more and more therefore do we think of movement and seen extent as mutually involving each other until at last with bain and j s mill we may get to regard them as synonymous and say what is the meaning of the word extent unless it be possible movement 46 we forget in this conclusion that whatever intrinsic extensiveness the movements may appear endowed with that seen spreadoutness which is the pattern of the abstract extensiveness which we imagine came to us originally from the retinal sensation

the muscular sensations of the eyeball signify this sort of visible spreadoutness just as this visible spreadoutness may come in later experience to signify the real bulks distances lengths and breadths known to touch and locomotion 47 to the very end however in us seeing men the quality the nature the sort of thing we mean by extensiveness would seem to be the sort of feeling which our retinal stimulations bring

in one deprived of sight the principles by which the notion of real space is constructed are the same skinfeelings take in him the place of retinal feelings in giving the quality of lateral spreadoutness as our attention passes from one extent of them to another awakened by an object sliding along usually the moving object is our hand and feelings of movement in our joints invariably accompany the feelings in the skin but the feeling of the skin is what the blind man means by his skin so the size of the skinfeelings stands as the absolute or real size and the size of the jointfeelings becomes a sign of these suppose for example a blind baby with to make the description shorter a blister on his toe exploring his leg with his fingertip and feeling a pain shoot up sharply the instant the blister is touched the experiment gives him four different kinds of sensation  two of them protracted two sudden the first pair are the movementfeeling in the joints of the upper limb and the movementfeeling on the skin of the leg and foot these attended to together have their extents identified as one objective space  the hand moves through the same space in which the leg lies the second pair of objects are the pain in the blister and the peculiar feeling the blister gives to the finger their spaces also fuse and as each marks the end of a peculiar movementseries arm moved leg stroked the movementspaces are emphatically identified with each other at that end were there other small blisters distributed down the leg there would be a number of these emphatic points the movementspaces would be identified not only as totals but point for point 48

just so with space beyond the bodys limits continuing the jointfeeling beyond the toe the baby hits another object which he can still think of when he brings his back to its blister again that object at the end of that joint feeling means a new place for him and the more such objects multiply in his experience the wider does the space of his conception grow if wandering through the woods today by a new path i find myself suddenly in a glad which affects my senses exactly as did another i reached last week at the end of different walk i believe the two identical affection to present the same persisting glade and infer that i have attained it by two differing roads the case in whit differs when shorter movements are concerned if moving first one arm and then another the blind child gets the same kind of sensation upon the hand and gets it again as often as he repeats either process he judges that he has touched the same object by both motions and concludes that the motions terminate in a common place from place to place marked in this way he moves and adding the places moved through one to another he builds up his notion of the extent of the outer world the seeing mans process is identical only his units which may be successive birdseye view are much larger than in the case of the blind

feelings in joints and feelings in muscles

1 feelings of movement in joints

i have been led to speak of feelings which arise in joints as these feeling have too much neglecting psychology hitherto in entering now somewhat minutely in the interest of the reader which under the rather dry abstractions of the previous pages may presumably have flagged

when by simply flexing my right forefinger on its metacarpal joint i trace with its tip an inch on the palm of my left hand is my feeling of the size of the inch purely and simply a feeling in the skin of the palm or have the muscular contractions of the right hand and forearm anything to do with it in the preceding pages i have constantly assumed spatial sensibility to be an affair of surfaces at first starting the consideration of the muscular sense as a spacemeasurer was postponed to a later stage many writers of whom the foremost was thomas brown in his lectures on the philosophy of the human mind and of whom the latest is no less a psychologist than prof delboeuf 49 hold that the consciousness of active muscular motion aware of its own amount is the fons et origo of all spatial measurement it would seem to follow if this theory were true that two skinfeelings one of a large patch one of small one possess their difference of spatiality not as an immediate element but solely by virtue of the fact that the large to get its points successively excited demands more muscular contraction than the small one does fixed associations with the several amounts of muscular contractions required in this particular experience would thus ex plain the apparent sizes of the skinpatches which sizes would consequently not be primitive data but derivative results

it seems to me that no evidence of the muscular measurements in question exists but that all the facts may be explained by surfacesensibility provided we take that of the jointsurfaces also into account the most striking argument and the most obvious one which an upholder of the muscular theory is likely to produce is undoubtedly this fact if with closed eyes we trace figures in the air with the extended forefinger the motions may occur from the metacarpal the wrist the elbow or the shoulderjoint indifferently what we are conscious of in each case and indeed most acutely conscious of is the geometric path described by the fingertip its angles its subdivisions are all as distinctly felt as if seen by the eye and yet the surface of the fingertip receives no impression at all 50 but with each variation of the figure the muscular contractions vary and so do the feelings which these yield are not these latter the sensible data that make us aware of the lengths and directions we discern in the traced line

should we be tempted to object to this supposition of the advocate of perception by muscular feelings that we have learned the spatial significance of the feelings by reiterated experiences of seeing what figure is drawn when each special muscular grouping is felt so that in the last resort the muscular space feelings would be derived from retinalsurface feelings our opponent might immediately hush us by pointing to the fact that in persons born blind the phenomenon in question is even more perfect than in ourselves if we suggest that the blind may have originally traced the figures on the cutaneous surface of cheek thigh or palm and may now remember the specific figure which each present movement formerly caused the skinsurface to perceive he may reply that the delicacy of the motor percep tion far exceeds that of most of the cutaneous surfaces that in fact we can feel a figure traced only in its differentials so to speak  a figure which we merely start to trace by our fingertip a figure which traced in the same way on our fingertip by the hand of another is almost if not wholly unrecognizable

the champion of the muscular sense seems likely to be triumphant until we invoke the articular cartilages as internal surfaces whose sensibility is called in play by every movement we make however delicate the latter may be

to establish the part they play in our geometrizing it is necessary to review a few facts it has long been known by medical practitioners that in patients with cutaneous anæsthesia of a limb whose muscles also are insensible to the thrill of the faradic current a very accurate sense of the way in which the limb may be flexed or extended by the hand of another may be preserved 51 on the other hand we may have this sense of movement impaired when the tactile sensibility is well preserved that the pretended feeling of outgoing innervation can play in these cases no part is obvious from the fact that the movements by which the limb changes its position are passive ones imprinted on it by the experimenting physician the writers who have sought a rationale of the matter have consequently been driven by way of exclusion to assume the articular surfaces to be the seat of the perception in question 52

that the jointsurfaces are sensitive appears evident from the fact that in inflammation they become the seat of excruciating pains and from the perception by everyone who lifts weights or presses against resistance that every increase of the force opposing him betrays itself to his consciousness principally by the startingout of new feelings or the increase of old ones in or about the joints if the structure and mode of mutual application of two articular surfaces be taken into account it will appear that granting the surfaces to be sensitive no more favorable mechanical conditions could be possible for the delicate calling of the sensibility into play than are realized in the minutely graduated rotations and firmly resisted variations of pressure involved in every act of extension or flexion nevertheless it is a greet pity that we have as yet no direct testimony no expressions from patients with healthy joints accidentally laid open of the impressions they experience when the cartilage is pressed or rubbed

the first approach to direct evidence so far as i know is contained in the paper of lewinski 53 published in 1879 this observer had a patient the inner half of whose leg was anæsthetic when this patient stood up he had a curious illusion about the position of his limb which disappeared the moment he lay down again he thought himself knockkneed if as lewinski says we assume the inner half of the joint to share the insensibility of the corresponding part of the skin then he ought to feel when the jointsurfaces pressed against each other in the act of standing the outer half of the joint most strongly but this is the feeling he would also get whenever it was by any chance sought to force his leg into a knockkneed attitude lewinski was led by this case to examine the feet of certain ataxic patients with imperfect sense of position he found in every instance that when the toes were flexed and drawn upon at the same time the jointsurfaces drawn asunder all sense of the amount of flexion disappeared on the contrary when he pressed a toe whilst flexing it the patients appreciation of the amount of flexion was much improved evidently because the artificial increase of articular pressure made up for the pathological insensibility of the parts

since lewinskis paper an important experimental research by a goldscheider 54 has appeared which completely establishes our point this patient observer caused his fingers arms and legs to be passively rotated upon their various joints in a mechanical apparatus which registered both the velocity of movement impressed and the amount of angular rotation no active muscular contraction took place the minimal felt amounts of rotation were in all cases surprisingly small being much less than a single angular degree in all the joints except those of the fingers such displacements as these the author says p 490 can hardly be detected by the eye the point of application of the force which rotated the limb made no difference in the result rotations round the hipjoint for example were as delicately felt when the leg was hung by the heel as when it was hung by the thigh whilst the movements were performed anæsthesia of the skin produced by inductioncurrents also had no disturbing effect on the perception nor did the various degrees of pressure of the moving force upon the skin affect it it became in fact all the more distinct in proportion as the concomitant pressurefeelings were eliminated by artificial anæsthesia when the joints themselves however were made artificially anæsthetic the perception of the movement grew obtuse and the angular rotations had to be much increased before they were perceptible all these facts prove according to herr goldscheider that the joint surfaces and these alone are the starting point of the impressions by which the movements of our members are immediately perceived

applying this result which seems invulnerable to the case of the tracing fingertip we see that our perception of the latter gives no countenance to the theory of the muscular sense we indubitably localize the fingertip at the successive points of its path by means of the sensations which we receive from our joints but if this is so it may be asked why do we feel the figure to be traced not within the joint itself but in such an altogether different place and why do we feel it so much larger than it really is

i will answer these questions by asking another why do we move our joists at all surely to gain something more valuable than the insipid jointfeelings themselves and these more interesting feelings are in the main produced upon the skin of the moving part or of some other part over which it passes or upon the eye with movements of the fingers we explore the configuration of all real objects with which we have to deal our own body as well as foreign things nothing that interests us is located in the joint everything that interests us either is some part of our skin or is something that we see as we handle it the cutaneously felt and the seen extents come thus to figure as the important things for us to concern ourselves with every time the joint moves even though we neither see nor feel cutaneously the reminiscence of skinevents and sights which formerly coincided with that extent of movement ideally awaken as the movements import and the mind drops the present sign to attend to the import alone the jointsensation itself as such does not disappear in the process a little attention easily detects it with all its fine peculiarities hidden beneath its vaster suggestions so that really the mind has two spaceperceptions before it congruent in form but different in scale and place either of which exclusively it may notice or both at once  the jointspace which it feels and the real space which it means

the jointspaces serve so admirably as signs because of their capacity for parallel variation to all the peculiarities of external motion there is not a direction in the real world nor a ratio of distance which cannot be matched by some direction or extent of jointrotation jointfeelings like all feelings are roomy specific ones are contrasted inter se as different directions are contrasted within the same extent if i extend my arm straight out at the shoulder the rotation of the shoulderjoint will give me one feeling of movement if then i sweep the arm forward the same joint will give me another feeling of movement both these movements are felt to happen in space and differ in specific quality why shall not the specificness of the quality just consist in the feeling of a peculiar direction 55 why may not the several jointfeelings be so many perceptions of movement in so many different directions that we cannot explain why they should is no presumption that they do not for we never can explain why any senseorgan should awaken the sensation it does

but if the jointfeelings are directions and extents standing in relation to each other the task of association in interpreting their import in eye or skinterms is a good deal simplified let the movement bc of a certain joint derive its absolute spacevalue from the cutaneous feeling it is always capable of engendering then the longer movement abcd of the same joint will be judged to have a greater spacevalue even though it may never have wholly merged with a skinexperience so of differences of direction so much jointdifference  so much skindifference therefore more jointdifference  more skindifference in fact the jointfeeling can frequently serve as a map on a reduced scale of a reality which the imagination can identify at its pleasure with this or that sensible extension simultaneously known in some other way

when the jointfeeling in itself acquires an emotional interest  which happens whenever the joint is inflamed and painful  the secondary suggestions fail to arise and the movement is felt where it is and in its intrinsic scale of magnitude 56

the localization of the jointfeeling in a space simultaneously known otherwise ie to eye or skin is what is commonly called the extradition or eccentric projection of the feeling in the preceding chapter i said a good deal on this subject but we must now see a little more closely just what happens in this instance of it the content of the jointfeeling to begin with is an object and is in itself a place for it to be placed say in the elbow the elbow as seen or handled must already have become another object for the mind and with its place as thus known the place which the joint feeling fins must coalesce that the latter should be felt in the elbow is therefore a projection of it into the place of another object as much as its being felt in the fingertip or at the end of a cane can be but when we say projection we generally have in our mind the notion of a there as contrasted with a here what is the here when we say that the jointfeeling is there the here seems to be the spot which the mind has chosen for its own post of observation usually some place within the head but sometimes within the throat or breast  not rigorously fixed spot but a region from any portion of which it may send forth its various acts of attention extradition from either of these regions is the common law under which we perceive the whereabouts of the north star of our own voice of the contact of our teeth with each other of the tip of our finger of the point of our cane on the ground or of a movement in our elbowjoint

but for the distance between the here and the there to be felt the entire intervening space must be itself an object of perception the consciousness of this intervening space is tile sine guâ non of the jointfeelings projection to the farther end of it when it is fined by our own bodily tissues as where the projection only goes as far as the elbow or fingertip we are sensible of its extent alike by our eye by our exploring movements and by the resident sensations which fin its length when it reaches beyond the limits of our body the resident sensations are lacking but limbs and hand and eye suffice to make it known let me for example locate a feeling of motion coming from my elbowjoint in the point of my cane a yard beyond my hand either i see this yard as i flourish the cane and the seen end of it then absorbs my sensation just as my seen elbow might absorb it or i am blind and imagine the cane as an object continuing my arm either because i have explored both arm and cane with the other hand or because i have pressed them both along my body and leg if i project my jointfeeling farther still it is by a conception rather than a distinct imagination of the space i think farther thrice as far etc and thus get a symbolic image of a distant path at which i point 57 but the absorption of the joint feeling by the distant spot in whatever terms the latter may be apprehended is never anything but that coalescence into one thing already spoken of on page 184 of whatever different sensible objects interest our attention at once

2 feelings of muscular contraction

readers versed in psychological literature will have missed in our account thus far the usual invocation of the muscular sense this word is used with extreme vagueness to cover all resident sensations whether of motion or position in our members and even to designate the supposed feeling of efferent discharge from the brain we shall later see good reason to deny the existence of the latter feeling we have accounted for the better part at least of the resident feelings of motion in limbs by the sensibility of the articular surfaces the skin and ligaments also must have feelings awakened as they are stretched or squeezed in flexion or extension and i am inclined to think that the sensations of our contracting muscles themselves probably play as small a part in building up our exact knowledge of space as any class of sensations which we possess the muscles indeed play an allimportant part but it is through the remote effect of their contractions on other sensitive parts not through their own resident sensations being aroused in other words muscular contraction is only indirectly instrumental in giving us spaceperceptions by its effects on surfaces in skin and retina it produces a motion of the stimulus upon the surface in joints it produces a motion of the surfaces upon each other  such motion being by far the most delicate manner of exciting the surfaces in question one is tempted to doubt whether the muscular sensibility as such plays even a subordinate part as sign of these more immediately geometrical perceptions which are so uniformly associated with it as effects of the contraction objectively viewed

for this opinion many reasons can be assigned first it seems a priori improbable that such organs as muscles should give us feelings whose variations bear any exact proportion to the spaces traversed when they contract as g e müller says 58 their sensory nerves must be excited either chemically or by mechanical compression whilst the contractions last and in neither case can the excitement be proportionate to the position into which the limb is thrown the chemical state of the muscle depends on the previous work more than on the actually present contraction and the internal pressure of it depends on the resistance offered more than on the shortening attained the intrinsic muscular sensation are likely therefore to be merely those of massive strain or fatigue and to carry no accurate discrimination with them of lengths of path moved through

empirically we find this probability confirmed by many facts the judicious a w volkman observes 59 that

muscular feeling gives tolerably fine evidence as to the existence of movement but hardly any direct information about its extent or direction we are not aware that the contractions of a supinator longus have a wider range than those of a supinator brevis and that the fibres of a bipenniform muscle contract in opposite directions is a fact of which the muscular feeling itself gives not the slightest intimation musclefeeling belong to that class of general sensations which tell us of our inner states but not of outer relations  it does not belong among the senseperceiving senses

e h weber in his article tastsinn called attention to the fact that muscular movements as large and strong as those of the diaphragm go on continually without our perceiving them as motion

g h lewes makes the same remark when we think of our muscular sensations as movements in space it is because we have ingrained with them in our imagination a movement on a surface simultaneously felt

thus whenever we breathe there is a contraction of the muscles of the ribs and the diaphragm since we see the chest expanding we know it as a movement and can only think of it as such but the diaphragm itself is not seen and consequently by no one who is not physiologically enlightened on the point is this diaphragm thought of in movement nay even when told by a physiologist that the diaphragm moves at each breathing every one who has not seen it moving down ward pictures it as an upward movement because the chest moves upward 60

a personal experience of my own seems strongly to corroborate this view for years i have been familiar during the act of gaping with a large round smooth sensation in tile region of the throat a sensation characteristic of gaping and nothing else but which although i had often wondered about it never suggested to my mind the motion of anything the reader probably knows from his own experience exactly what feeling i mean it was not till one of my students told me that i learned its objective cause if we look into the mirror while gaping we see that at the moment we have this feeling the hanging palate rises by the contraction of its intrinsic muscles the contraction of these muscles and the compression of the palatine mucous membrane are what occasion the feeling and i was at first astonished that coming from so small an organ it could appear so voluminous now the curious point is this  that no sooner had i learned by the eye its objective spacesignificance than i found myself enabled mentally to feel it as a movement upwards of a body in the situation of the uvula when i now have it my fancy injects it so to speak with the image of the rising uvula and it absorbs the image easily and naturally in a word a muscular contraction gave me a sensation whereof i was unable during forty years to interpret a motor meaning of which two glances of the eye made me permanently the master to my mind no further proof is needed of the fact that muscular contraction merely as such need not be perceived directly as so much motion through space

take again the contractions of the muscles which make the eyeball rotate the feeling of these is supposed by many writers to play the chief part in our perceptions of extent the space seen between two things means according to these authors nothing but the amount of contraction which is needed to carry the fovea from the first thing to the second but close the eyes and note the contractions in themselves even when coupled as they still are with the delicate surface sensations of the eyeball rolling under the lids and we are surprised standing how vague their space import appears shut the eyes and roll them and you call with no approach to accuracy tell the outer object which shall first be seen when you open them again 61 moreover if our eyemusclecontractions had much to do with giving us our sense of seen extent we ought to have a natural illusion of which we and no trace since the feeling in the muscles grows disproportionately intense as the eyeball is rolled into an extreme eccentric position all places on the extreme margin of the field of view ought to appear farther from the centre than they really are for the fovea cannot get to them without an amount of this feeling altogether in excess of the amount of actual rotation 62 when we turn to the muscles of the body at large we find the same vagueness goldscheider found that the minimal perceived rotation of size depend on a comparison of a limb about a joint was no less when the movement was active or produced by muscular contraction than when it was passively impressed 63 the consciousness of active movement became so blunt when the joint alone was made anæsthetic by faradization that it became evident that the feeling of contraction could never be used for fine discrimination of extents and that it was not used for coarse discriminations appeared clear to goldscheider from certain other results which are too circumstantial for me to quote in detail 64 his general conclusion is that we feel our movements exclusively in our articular surfaces and that our muscular contractions in all probability hardly occasion this sort of perception at all 65

my conclusion is that the muscular sense must fall back to the humble position from which charles bell raised it and no longer figure in psychology as the leading organ in space perception which it has been so long cracked up to be

before making a minuter study of space as apprehended by the eye we must turn to see what we can discover of space as known to the blind but as we do so let us cast a glance upon the results of the last pages and ask ourselves once more whether the building up of orderly spaceperceptions out of primitive incoherency requires any mental powers beyond those displayed in ordinary intellectual operations i think it is obvious  granting the spacial qualia to exist in the primitive sensations  that discrimination association addition multiplication and division blending into generic images substitution of similars selective emphasis and abstraction from uninteresting details are quite capable of giving us all the spacepercep tions we have so far studied without the aid of any mysterious mental chemistry or power of synthesis to create elements absent from the original data of feeling it cannot be too strongly urged in the face of mystical attempts however learned that there is not a landmark not a length not a point of the compass in real space which is not some one of our feelings either experienced directly as a presentation or ideally suggested by another feeling which has come to serve as its sign in degrading some sensations to the rank of signs and exalting others to that of realities signified we smooth out the wrinkles of our first chaotic impressions and make a continuous order of what was a rather incoherent multiplicity but the content of the order remains identical with that of the multiplicity  sensational both through and through

how the blind perceive space

the blind mans construction of real space differs from that of the seeing man most obviously in the larger part which synthesis plays in it and the relative subordination of analysis the seeing babys eyes take in the whole room at once and discriminative attention must arise in him before single objects are visually discerned the blind child on the contrary must form his mental image of the room by the addition piece to piece of parts which he learns to know successively with our eyes we may apprehend instantly in an enormous birdseye view a landscape which the blind man is condemned to build up bit by bit after weeks perhaps of exploration we are exactly in his predicament however for spaces which exceed our visual range we think the ocean as a whole by multiplying mentally the impression we get at any moment when at sea the distance between new york and san francisco is computed in days journeys that from earth to sun is so many times the earths diameter etc and of longer distances still we may be said to have no adequate mental image whatever but only numerical verbal symbols but the symbol will often give us the emotional effect of the perception such expressions as the abysmal vault of heaven the endless expanse of ocean etc summarize many computations to the imagination and give the sense of an enormous horizon so it seems with the blind they multiply mentally the amount of a distinctly felt freedom to move anti gain the immediate sense of a vaster freedom still thus it is that blind men are never without the consciousness of their horizon they all enjoy travelling especially with a companion on the prairies the feel the great openness in valleys they feel closed in and one has told me that he thought few seeing people could enjoy the view from a mountaintop more than he a blind person on entering a house or room immediately receives from the reverberations of his voice and steps an impression of its dimensions and to a certain extent of its arrangement the tympanic sense noticed on p 140 supra comes in to help here and possibly other forms of tactile sensibility not yet understood mr hank levy the blind author of blindness and the blind london gives the following account of his powers of perception

whether within a house or in the open air whether walking or standing still i can tell although quite blind when i am opposite an object and can perceive whether it be tall or short slender or bulky i can also detect whether it be a solitary object or a continuous fence whether it be a close fence or composed of open rails  and often whether it be a wooden fence a brick or stone wall or a quickset hedge i cannot usually perceive objects if much lower than my shoulder but sometimes very low objects can be detected this may depend on the nature of the objects or on some abnormal state of the atmosphere the currents of air can have nothing to do with this power as the state of the wind does not directly affect it the sense of hearing has nothing to do with it as when snow lies thickly on the ground objects are more distinct although the footfall cannot be heard i seem to perceive objects through the skin of my face and to have the impressions immediately transmitted to the brain the only part of my body possessing this power is my face this i have ascertained by suitable experiments stopping my ears does not interfere with it but covering my face with a thick veil destroys it altogether none of the five senses have anything to do with the existence of this power and the circumstances above named induce me to call this unrecognized sense by the name of facial perception when passing along a street i can distinguish shops from private houses and even point out the doors and windows etc and this whether the doors be shut or open when a window consists of one entire sheet of glass it is more difficult to dis cover than one composed of a number of small panes from this it would appear that glass is a bad conductor of sensation or at any rate of the sensation specially connected with this sense when objects below the face are perceived the sensation seems to come in an oblique line from the object to the upper part of the face while walking with a friend in forest lane stratford i said pointing to a fence which separated the road from a field those rails are not quite as high as my shoulder he looked at them and said they were higher we however measured and found them about three inches lower than my shoulder at the time of making this observation i was about four feet from the rails certainly in this instance facial perception was more accurate than sight when the lower part of a fence is brickwork and the upper part rails the fact can be detected and the line where the two meet easily perceived irregularities in height and projections and indentations in walls call also be discovered

according to mr levy this power of seeing with the face is diminished by a fog but not by ordinary darkness at one time he could tell when a cloud obscured the horizon but he has now lost that power which he has known several persons to possess who are totally blind these effects of aqueous vapor suggest immediately that fluctuations in the heat radiated by the objects may be the source of the perception one blind gentleman mr kilburne an instructor in the perkins institution in south boston who has the power spoken of in an unusual degree proved however to have no more delicate a sense of temperature in his face than ordinary persons he himself supposed that his ears had nothing to do with the faculty until a complete stoppage of them not only with cotton but with putty on top of it by abolishing the perception entirely proved his first impression to be erroneous many blind men say immediately that their ears are concerned in the matter sounds certainly play a far more prominent part in the mental life of the blind than in our own in taking a walk through the country the mutations of sound far and near constitute their chief delight and to a great extent their imagination of distance and of objects moving from one distant spot to another seems to consist in thinking how a certain sonority would be modified by the change of place it is unquestionable that the semicircularcanal feelings play a great part in determining the points of the com pass and the direction of distant spots in the blind as in us we start towards them by feelings of this sort and so many directions so many differentfeeling starts 66

the only point that offers any theoretic difficulty is the prolongation into space of the direction after the start we saw ten pages back that for extradition to occur beyond the skin the portion of skin in question and the space beyond must form a common object for some other sensory surface the eyes are for most of us this sensory surface for the blind it can only be other parts of the skin coupled or not with motion but the mere gropings of the hands in every direction must end by surrounding the whole body with a sphere of felt space and this sphere must become enlarged with every movement of locomotion these movements gaining their spacevalues from the semicircularcanal feelings which accompany them and from the farther and farther parts of large fixed objects such as the bed the wainscoting or a fence which they bring within the grasp it might be supposed that a knowledge of space acquired by so many successive discrete acts would always retain a somewhat jointed and so to speak granulated character when we who are gifted with sight think of a space too large to come into a single field of view we are apt to imagine it as composite and fined with more or less jerky stoppings and startings think for instance of the space from here to san francisco or else we reduce the scale symbolically and imagine how much larger on a map the distance would look than others with whose totality we are familiar

i am disposed to believe after interrogating many blind persons that the use of imaginary maps on a reduced scale is less frequent with them than with the rest of us possibly the extraordinary changeableness of the visual magnitudes of things makes this habit natural to us while the fixity of tactile magnitudes keeps them from falling into it when the blind young mall operated on by dr franz was shown a portrait in a locket he was vastly surprised that the face could be put into so small a compass it would have seemed to him he said as impossible as to put a bushel into a pint be this as it may however the space which each blind man feels to extend beyond his body is felt by him as one smooth continuum  all trace of those muscular startings and stoppings and reversals which presided over its formation having been eliminated from the memory it seems in other words a generic image of the spaceelement common to all these experiences with the unessential particularities of each left out in truth where in this space a start or a stop may have occurred was quite accidental it may never occur just there again and so the attention lets it drops altogether even as long a space as that traversed in a severalmile walk will not necessarily appear to a blind mans thought in the guise of a series of locomotor acts only where there is some distinct locomotor difficulty such as a step to ascend a difficult crossing or a disappearance of the path will distinct locomotor images constitute the idea elsewhere the space seems continuous and its parts may even all seem coexistent though as a very intelligent blind friend once remarked to me to think of such distances involves probably more mental wear and tear and brainwaste in the blind than in the seeing this seems to point to a greater element of successive addition and construction in the blind mans idea

our own visual explorations go on by means of innumerable stoppings and startings of the eyeballs yet these are all effaced from the final spacesphere of our visual imagination they have neutralized each other we can even distribute our attention to the right and left side simultaneously and think of those two quarters of space as coexistent does the smoothing out of the locomotor interruptions from the blind mans tactile spacesphere offer any greater paradox surely not and it is curious to note that both in him and in us there is one particular locomotor feeling that is apt to assert itself obstinately to the last we and he alike spontaneously imagine space as lying in front of us for reasons too obvious to enumerate if we think of the space behind us we as a rule have to turn round mentally and in doing so the front space vanishes but in this as in the other things of which we have been talking individuals differ widely some in imagining a room can think of all its six surfaces at once others mentally turn round or at least imagine the room in several successive and mutually exclusive acts cf p 54 above

sir william hamilton and j s mill after him have quoted approvingly an opinion of platner an eighteenthcentury philosopher regarding the spaceperceptions of the blind platner says

the attentive observation of it person born blind has convinced me that the sense of touch by itself is altogether incompetent to afford us the representation of extension and space in fact to those born blind time serves instead of space vicinity and distance mean in their mouths nothing more than the shorter or longer time necessary to attain from some one feeling to some other

after my own observation of blind people i should hardly have considered this as anything but an eccentric opinion worthy to pair off with that other belief that color is primitively seen without extent had it not been for the remarkable essay on tactile and visual space by m ch dunan which appeared in the revue philosophique for 1888 this author quotes 67 three very competent witnesses all officials in institutions for the blind it does not appear from the text that more than one of them was blind himself 68 who say that blind people only live in time m dunan himself does not share exactly this belief but he insists that the blind mans and the seeing mans representation of space have absolutely naught in common and that we are deceived into believing that what they mean by space is analogous to what we mean by the fact that so many of them are but semiblind and still think in visual terms and from the farther fact that they all talk in visual terms just like ourselves but on examining m dunans reasons one finds that they all rest on the groundless logical assumption that the perception of a geometrical form which we get with our eyes and that which a blind man gets with his fingers must either be absolutely identical or absolutely unlike they cannot be similar in diversity for they are simple notions and it is of the essence of such to enter the mind or leave it all at once so that one who has a simple notion at all possesses it in all its completeness therefore since it is impossible that the blind should have of the forms in question ideas completely identical with our seeing ones it follows that their ideas must be radically different from and wholly irreducible to our own 69 hereupon m dunan has no difficulty in finding a blind man who still preserves a crude sensation of diffused light and who says when questioned that this light has no extent having no extent appears however on farther questioning to signify merely not enveloping any particular tactile objects nor being located within their outline so that allowing for latitude of expression the result tallies perfectly with our own view a relatively stagnant retinal sensation of diffused light not varying when different objects are handled would naturally remain an object quite apart if the word extent were habitually used to denote tactile extent this sensation having no tactile associates whatever would naturally have extent denied of it and yet all the while it would be analogous to the tactile sensations in having the quality of bigness of course it would have no other tactile qualities just as the tactile objects have no other optical qualities than bigness all sorts of analogies obtain between the spheres of sensibility why are sweet and soft used so synonymously in most languages and why are both these adjectives applied to objects of so many sensible kinds bough sounds heavy smells hard lights cold colors are other examples nor does it follow from such analogies as these that the sensations compared need be composite and have some of their parts identical we saw in chapter xiii that likeness and difference are an elementary relation not to be resolved in every case into a mixture of absolute identity and absolute heterogeneity of content cf vol i pp 4923

i conclude then that although in its more superficial determinations the blind mans space is very different from space yet a deep analogy remains between the two big and little far and near are similar contents of consciousness in both of us but the measure of the bigness and the farness is very different in him and in ourselves he for example can have no notion of what we mean by objects appearing smaller as they move away because he must always conceive of them as of their constant tactile size nor whatever analogy the two extensions involve should we expect that a blind man receiving sight for the first time should recognize his newgiven optical objects by their familiar tactile names molyneux wrote to locke

suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere so as to tell when he felt one and the other which is the cube which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see query whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube

this has remained in literature as molyneuxs query molyneux answered no and locke says 70

i agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them though he could unerringly name them by his touch and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt

this opinion has not lacked experimental confirmation from chesseldens case downwards patients operated for congenital cataract have been unable to name at first the things they saw so puss i shall know you another time said chesseldens patient after catching the cat looking at her steadfastly and setting her down some of this incapacity is unquestionably due to general mental confusion at the new experience and to the excessively unfavorable conditions for perception which an eye with its lens just extirpated affords that the analogy of inner nature between the retinal and tactile sensations goes beyond mere extensity is proved by the cases where tile patients were the most intelligent as in the young man operated on by dr franz who named circular triangular and quadrangular figures at first sight 71

visual space

it is when we come to analyze minutely the conditions of visual perception that difficulties arise which have made psychologists appeal to new and quasimythical mental powers but i firmly believe that even here exact investigation will yield the same verdict as in the cases studied hitherto this subject will close our survey of the facts and if it give the result i foretell we shall be in the best of positions for a few banal pages of critically historical review

if a common person is asked how he is enabled to see things as they are he will simply reply by opening his eyes and looking this innocent answer has however long since been impossible for science there are various paradoxes and irregularities about what we appear to perceive under seemingly identical optical conditions which immediately raise questions to say nothing now of the timehonored conundrums of why we see upright with an inverted retinal picture and why we do not see double and to leave aside the whole field of colorcontrasts and ambiguities as not directly relevant to the spaceproblem  it is certain that the same retinal image makes us see quite differentlysized and differentlyshaped objects at different times and it is equally certain that the same ocular movement varies in its perceptive import it ought to be possible were the act of perception completely and simply intelligible to assign for every distinct judgment of size shape and position a distinct optical modification of some kind as its occasion and the connection between the two ought to be so constant that given the same modification we should always have the same judgment but if we study the facts closely we soon and no such constant connection between either judgment and retinal modification or judgment and muscular modification to exist the judgment seems to result from the combination of retinal muscular and intellectual factors with each other and any one of them may occasionally overpower the rest in a way which seems to leave the matter subject to no simple law the scientific study of the subject if we omit descartes began with berkeley and the particular perception he analyzed in his new theory of vision was that of distance or depth starting with the physical assumption that a difference in the distance of a point can make no difference in the nature of its retinal image since distance being a line directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of the eye  which point remains invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter he concluded that distance could not possibly be a visual sensation but must be an intellectual suggestion  from custom of some nonvisual experience according to berkeley this experience was tactile his whole treatment of the subject was excessively vague  no shame to him as a breaker of fresh ground  but as it has been adopted and enthusiastically hugged in all its vagueness by nearly the whole line of british psychologists who have succeeded him it will be well for us to begin our study of vision by refuting his notion that depth cannot possibly be perceived in terms of purely visual feeling

the third dimension

berkeleyans unanimously assume that no retinal sensation can primitively be of volume if it be of extension at all which they are barely disposed to admit it call be only of two not of three dimensional extension at the beginning of the present chapter we denied this and adduced facts to show that all objects of sensation are voluminous in three dimensions cf p 136 if it is impossible to lie on ones back on a hill to let tile empty abyss of blue ones whole visual field and to sink deeper and deeper into the merely sensational mode of consciousness regarding it without feeling that an indeterminate palpitating circling depth is as indefeasibly one of its attributes as its breadth we may artificially exaggerate this sensation of depth rise and look from the hilltop at the distant view represent to yourself as vividly as possible the distance of the uttermost horizon and then with inverted head look at the same there will be a startling increase in the perspective a most sensible recession of the maximum distance and as you raise the head you can actually see the horizonline again draw near 72

mind i say nothing as yet about our estimate of the real amount of this depth or distance i only want to confirm its existence as a natural and inevitable optical consort of the two other optical dimensions the held of view is always a volumeunit whatever be supposed to be its absolute and real size the relative sizes of its dimensions are functions of each other indeed it happens perhaps most often that the breadth and heightfeeling take their absolute measure from the depthfeeling if we plunge our head into a washbasin the felt nearness of the bottom makes us feel the lateral expanse to be small if on the contrary we are on a mountaintop the distance of the horizon carries with it in our judgment a proportionate height and length in the mountainchains that bound it to our view but as aforesaid let us not consider the question of absolute size now  it must later be taken up in a thorough way let us confine ourselves to the way in which the three dimensions which are seen get their values fixed relatively to each other

reid in his inquiry into tile human mind has a section of the geometry of visibles in which he assumes to trace what the perceptions would be of a race of idomenians reduced to the sole sense of sight agreeing with berkeley that sight alone can give no knowledge of the third dimension he humorously deduces various ingenious absurdities in their interpretations of the material appearances before their eyes

now i firmly believe on the contrary that one of reids idomenians would frame precisely the same conception of the external world that we do if he had our intellectual powers 73 even were his very eyeballs fixed and not movable like ours that would only retard not frustrate his education for the same object by alternately covering in its lateral movements different parts of his retina would determine the mutual equivalencies of the first two dimensions of the held of view and by exciting the physiological cause of his perception of depth in various degrees it would establish a scale of equivalency between the first two and the third

first of all one of the sensations given by the object is chosen to represent its real size and shape in accordance with the principles laid down on pp 178 and 179 one sensation measures the thing present and the thing then measures the other sensations the peripheral parts of the retina are equated with the central by receiving the image of the same object this needs no elucidation in case the object does not change its distance or its front but suppose to take a more complicated case that the object is a stick seen first in its whole length and then rotated round one of its ends let this fixed end be the one near the eye in this movement the sticks image will grow progressively shorter its farther end will appear less and less separated laterally from its fixed near end soon it will be screened by the latter and then reappear on the opposite side and finally on that side resume its original length suppose this movement to become a familiar experience the mind will presumably react upon it after its usual fashion which is that of unifying all data which it is in any way possible to unify and consider it the movement of a constant object rather than the transformation of a fluctuating one now the sensation of depth which it receives during the experience is awakened more by the far than by the near end of the object but how much depth what shall measure its amount why at the moment the far end is ready to be eclipsed the difference of its distance from the near ends distance must be judged equal to the sticks whole length but that length has already been judged equal to a certain optical sensation of breadth thus we find that given amounts of the visual depthfeeling become signs of given amounts of the visual depthfeeling the measurement of distance is as berkeley truly said a result of suggestion and experience but visual experience alone is adequate to produce it and this he erroneously denied

suppose a colonel in front of his regiment at dressparade and suppose he walks at right angles towards the midmost mall of the line as he advances and surveys the line in either direction he looks more and more down it and less and less at it until when abreast of the midmost man he feels the end men to be most distant then when the line casts hardly any lateral image on his retina at all what distance shall lie judge to be that of the end men why half the length of the regiment as it was originally seen of course but this length was a moment ago a retinal object spread out laterally before his sight he has now merely equated a retinal depthfeeling with a retinal breadthfeeling if the regiment moved and the near end of the object colonel stood still the result would be the same in such ways as these a creature endowed with eyes alone could hardly fail of measuring out all three dimensions of the space he inhabited and we ourselves i think although we may often realize distance in locomotor terms as berkeley says we must always do yet do so no less often in terms of our retinal map and always in this the more spontaneously were this not so the three visual dimensions could not possibly feel to us as homogeneous as they do nor as commensurable inter se

let us then admit distance to be at least as genuinely optical a content of consciousness as either height or breadth the question immediately returns can any of them be said in any strictness to be optical sensations we have contended all along for the affirmative reply to this question but must now cope with difficulties greater than any that have assailed us hitherto

helmholtz and reid on sensations

a sensation is as we have seen in chapter xvii the mental affection that follows most immediately upon the stimulation of the sensetract its antecedent is directly physical no psychic links no acts of memory inference or association intervening accordingly if suppose the nexus between neural process in the senseorgan on the one hand and conscious affection on the other to be by nature uniform the same process ought always to give the same sensation and conversely if what seems to be a sensation varies whilst the process in the senseorgan remains unchanged the reason is presumably that it is really not a sensation but a higher mental product whereof the variations depend on events occurring in the system of higher cerebral centres

now the size of the field of view varies enormously in all three dimensions without our being able to assign with any definiteness the process in the visual tract on which the variation depends we just saw how impossible such assignment was in the case where turning down the head produces the enlargement in general the maximum feeling of depth or distance seems to take the lead in determining the apparent magnitude of the whole field and the two other dimensions seem to follow if to use the former instance i look close into a washbasin the lateral extent of the field shrinks proportionately to its nearness if i look from a mountain the things seen are vast in height and breadth in proportion to the farness of the horizon but when we ask what changes in the eye determine how great this maximum feeling of depth or distance which is undoubtedly felt as a unitary vastness shall be we find ourselves unable to point to any one of them as being its absolutely regular concomitant convergence accommodation double and disparate images differences in the parallactic displacement when we move our head faintness of tint dimness of outline and smallness of the retinal image of objects named and known are all processes that have something to do with the perception of far and of near but the effect of each and ally one of them in determining such a perception at one moment may at another moment be reversed by the presence of some other sensible quality in the object that makes us evidently by reminding us of past experience judge it to be at a different distance and of another shape if we paint the inside of a pasteboardmask like the outside and look at it with one eye the accommodation and parallaxfeelings ape there but fail to make us see it hollow as it is our mental knowledge of the fact that human faces are always convex overpowers them and we directly perceive the nose to be nearer to us than the cheek instead of farther of

the other organic tokens of farness and nearness are proved by similar experiments of which we shall ere long speak more in detail to have an equally fluctuating import they lose all their value whenever the collateral circumstances favor a strong intellectual conviction that the object presented to the gaze is improbable  cannot be either what or where they would make us perceive it to be

now the query immediately arises can the feelings of these processes in the eye since they are so easily neutralized and reversed by intellectual suggestions ever have been direct sensations of distance at all ought we not rather to assume since the distances which me see in spite of them are conclusions from past experience that the distances which we see by means of them are equally such conclusions ought we not in short to say unhesitatingly that distance must be an intellectual and not a sensible content of consciousness and that each of these eyefeelings serves as a mere signal to awaken this content our intellect being so framed that sometimes it notices one signal more readily and sometimes another

reid long ago inquiry c vi sec 17 said

it may be taken for a general rule that things which are produced by custom may be undone or changed by disuse or by contrary custom on the other hand it is a strong argument that an effect is not owning to custom but to the constitution of nature when a contrary custom is found neither nor to weaken it

more briefly a way of seeing things that can be unlearned was presumably learned and only what we cannot unlearn is instinctive

this seems to be helmholtzs view for he confirms reids maxim by saying in emphatic print

no elements in our perception can he sensational which may be overcome or reversed by factors of demonstrably experimental origin whatever can be overcome by suggestions of experience must be regarded as itself a product of experience and custom if we follow this rule it will appear that only qualities are sensational whilst almost all spatial attributes are results of habit and experience 74

this passage of helmholtzs has obtained it seems to me an almost deplorable celebrity the reader will please observe its very radical import not only would he and does he for the reasons we have just been ourselves considering deny distance to be an optical sensation but extending the same method of criticism to judgments of size shape and direction and finding no single retinal or muscular process in the eyes to be indissolubly linked with any one of these he goes so far as to say that all optical spaceperceptions whatsoever must have an intellectual origin and a content that no items of visual sensibility can account for 75

as wundt and others agree with helmholtz here and as their conclusions if true are irreconcilable with all the sensationalism which i have been teaching hitherto it clearly devolves upon me to defend my position against this new attack but as this chapter on space is already so overgrown with episodes and details i think it best to reserve the refutation of their general principle for the next chapter and simply to assume at this point its untenability this has of course an arrogant look but if the reader will bear with me for not very many pages more i shall hope to appease his mind meanwhile i affirm confidently that the same outer objects actually feel different to us according as our brain reacts on them in one way or another by making us perceive them as this or as that sort of thing so true is this that one may well with stumpf 76 reverse helmholtzs query and ask what would become of our senseperceptions in case experience were not able so to transform them  stumpf adds all wrong perceptions that depend on peculiarities in the organs are more or less perfectly corrected by the influence of imagination following the guidance of experience

if therefore among the facts of optical spaceperception which we must now proceed to consider in more detail we find instances of an identical organic eyeprocess giving us different perceptions at different times in consequence of different collateral circumstances suggesting different objective facts to our imagination we must not hastily conclude with the school of helmholtz and wundt that the organic eyeprocess pure and simple without the collateral circumstances is incapable of giving us any sensation of a spatial kind at all we must rather seek to discover by what means the circumstances can so have transformed a spacesensation which but for their presence would probably have been felt in its natural purity and i may as well say now in advance that we shall find the means to be nothing more or less than association  the suggestion to the mind of optical objects not actually present but more habitually associated with the collateral circumstances than the sensation which they now displace and being imagined now with a quasihallucinatory strength but before this conclusion emerges it will be necessary to have reviewed the most important facts of optical spaceperception in relation to the organic conditions on which they depend readers acquainted with german optics will excuse what is already familiar to them in the following section 77 let us begin the long and rather tedious inquiry by the most important case physiologists have long sought for a simple law by which to connect the seen direction and distance of objects with the retinal impressions they produce two principal theories have been held of this matter the theory of identical points and the theory of projection  each incompatible with each other and each beyond certain limits becoming inconsistent with the facts

the theory of identical points

this theory starts from the truth that on both retinæ an impression on the upper half makes us perceive an object as below on the lower half as above the horizon and

on the right half an object to the left on the left half one to the right of the median line thus each quadrant of one retina corresponds as a whole to the similar quadrant of the other and within two similar quadrants al and ar for example there should if the correspondence were consistently carried out be geometrically similar points which if impressed at the same time by light emitted from the same object should cause that object to appear in the same direction to either eye experiment verifies this surmise i we look at the starry vault with parallel eyes the stars all seem single and the laws of perspective show that under the circumstances the parallel lightrays coming from each star must impinge on points within either retina which are geometrically similar to each other the same result may be more artificially obtained if we take two exactly similar pictures smaller or at least no larger than those on an ordinary stereoscopic slide and if we look at them as stereoscopic slides are looked at that is at one with each eye a median partition confining the view of either eye to the picture opposite it we shall see but one flat picture all of whose parts appear sharp and single 78 identical points being impressed both eyes see their object in the same direction and the two objects consequently coalesce into one

the same thing may be shown in still another way with fixed head converge the eyes upon some conspicuous objective point behind a pane of glass then close either eye alternately and make a little inkmark on the glass covering the object as seen by the eye which is momentarily open on looking now with both eyes the inkmarks will seem single and in the same direction as the objective point conversely let the eyes converge on a single ink spot on the glass and then by alternate shutting of them let it be noted what objects behind the glass the spot covers to the right and left eye respectively now with both eyes open both these objects and the spot will appear in the same place one or other of the three becoming distinct according to the fluctuations of retinal attention 79

now what is the direction of this common place the only way of defining the direction of an object is by pointing to it most people if asked to look at an object over the horizontal edge of a sheet of paper which conceals their hand and arm and then to point their finger at it raising the hand gradually so that at lest a fingertip will appear above the sheet of paper are found to place the finger not between either eye and the object but between the latter and the root of the nose and this whether both eyes or either alone be used hering and helmholtz express this by saying that we judge of the direction of objects as they would appear to an imaginary cyclopean eye situated between our two real eyes and with its optical axis bisecting the angle of convergence of the latter our two retinæ act according to hering as if they were superposed in the place of this imaginary doubleeye we see by the corresponding points of each situated far asunder as they really are just as we should see if they were superposed and could both be excited together

the judgment of objective singleness and that of identical direction seem to hang necessarily together and that of identical direction seems to carry with it the necessity of a common origin between the eyes or elsewhere from which all the directions felt may seem to be estimated this is why the cyclopean eye is really a fundamental part of the formulation of the theory of identical retinal points and why hering the greatest champion of this theory lays so much stress upon it

it is an immediate consequence of the law of identical pro projection of images on geometrically similar points that images which fall upon geometrically disparate points of the two retinæ should be projected in disparate directions and that their objects should consequently appear in two places or look double take the parallel rays from a star falling upon two eyes which converge upon a near object 0 instead of being parallel as in the previously instanced case if sl and sr in fig 55 be the parallel rays each of them will fall upon the nasal half of the retina which it strikes

but the two nasal halves are disparate geometrically symmetrical not geometrically similar the image on the left one will therefore appear as if lying in a direction leftward of the cyclopean eyes line of sight the image of the right one will appear far to the right of the same direction the star will in short be seen double  homonymously double

conversely if the star be looked at directly with parallel axes o will be seen double because its images will effect the outer or cheek halves of the two retinæ instead of one outer and one nasal half the position of the images will here be reversed from that of the previous case the right eyes image will now appear to the left the left eyes to the right  the double images will be heteronymous

the same reasoning and the same result ought to apply where the objects place with respect to the direction of the two optic axes is such as to make its images fall not on nonsimilar retinal halves but on nonsimilar parts of similar halves here of course the directions of projection will be less widely disparate than in the other case and the double images will appear to lie less widely apart

careful experiments made by many observers according to the socalled haploscopic method confirm this law and show that corresponding points of single visual direction exist upon the two retinæ for the detail of these one must consult the special treatises

note now an important consequence if we take a stationary object and allow the eyes to vary their direction and convergence a purely geometrical study will show that there will be some positions in which its two images impress corresponding retinal points but more in which they impress disparate points the former constitute the socalled horopter and their discovery has been attended with great mathematical difficulty objects or parts of objects which lie in the eyes horopter at any given time cannot appear double objects lying out of the horopter would seem if the theory of identical points were strictly true necessarily and always to appear double

here comes the first great conflict of the identitytheory with experience were the theory true we ought ail to have an intuitive knowledge of the horopter as the line of distinctest vision objects placed elsewhere ought to seem if not actually double at least blurred and yet no living man makes any such distinction between the parts of his field of vision to most of us the whole field appears single and it is only by rare accident or by special education that we ever catch a glimpse of a double image in 1838 wheatstone in his truly classical memoir on binocular vision and the stereoscope 80 showed that the disparateness of the points on which the two images of an object fall does not within certain limits affect its seen singleness at all but rather the distance at which it shell appear wheatstone made an observation moreover which subsequently became the bone of much hot contention in which he strove to show that not only might disparate images fuse but images on corresponding or identical points might be seen double 81

i am unfortunately prevented by the weakness of my own eyes from experimenting enough to form a decided personal opinion on the matter it seems to me however that the balance of evidence is against the wheatstonian interpretation and that disparate points may fuse without identical points for that reason ever giving double images the two questions can we see single with disparate points and can we see double with identical points although at the first blush they may appear as to helmholtz they appear to be but two modes of expressing the same inquiry are in reality distinct the first may quite well be answered affirmatively and the second negatively

add to this that the experiment quoted from helmholtz above by no means always succeeds but that many individuals place their finger between the object and one of their eyes oftenest the right 82 finally observe that the identitytheory with its cyclopean starting point for all lines of direction gives by itself no ground for the distance on any line at which an object shall appear and has to be helped out in this respect by subsidiary hypotheses which in the hands of hering and others have become so complex as easily to fall a prey to critical attacks and it will soon seem as if the law of identical seen directions by corresponding points although a simple formula for expressing concisely many fundamental phenomena is by no means an adequate account of the whole matter of retinal perception 83

the projectiontheory

does the theory of projection fare any better this theory admits that each eye sees the object in a different direction from the other along the line namely passing from the object through the middle of the pupil to the retina a point directly which these two optical axes have in common and that is the point to which they converge everything directly looked at is seen at this point and is thus seen both single and at its proper distance it is easy to show the incompatibility of this theory with the theory of identity take an objective point like o in fig 50 when the star is looked at casting its images r and l on geometrically dissimilar parts of the two retinæ and affecting the outer half of each eye on the identitytheory it ought necessarily to appear double whilst on the projectiontheory there is no reason whatever why it should not appear single provided only it be located by the judgment on each line of visible direc tion neither nearer nor farther than its point of intersection with the other line

every point in the field of view ought in truth if the projectiontheory were uniformly valid to appear single entirely irrespective of the varying positions of the eyes for from every point of space two lines of visible direction pass to the two retinæ and at the intersection of these lines or just where the point is there according to the theory it should appear the objection to this theory is thus precisely the reverse of the objection to the identitytheory if the latter ruled we ought to see most things double all the time if the projectiontheory ruled we ought never to see anything double as a matter of fact we get too few double images for the identitytheory and too many for the projectiontheory

the partisans of the projectiontheory beginning with

aguilonius have always explained double images as the result of an erroneous judgment of the distance of the object the images of the latter being projected by the imagination along the two lines of visible direction either nearer or farther than the point of intersection of the latter diagram will make this clear

let o be the point looked at m an object farther and n an object nearer than it then m and n will send the lines of visible direction mm and nn to the two retinæ if n be judged as far as o it must necessarily lie where the two lines of visible direction nn intersect the plane of the arrow or in two places at n and at n if m be judged as near as o it must for the same reason form two images at m and m

it is as a matter of fact true that we often misjudge the distance in the way alleged if the reader will hold his forefingers one beyond the other in the median line and fixate them alternately he will see the one not looked at double and he will also notice that it appears nearer to the plane of the one looked at whichever the latter may be than it really is its changes of apparent size as the convergence of the eyes alter also prove the change of apparent distance the distance at which the axes converge seems in fact to exert a sort of attraction upon objects situated elsewhere being the distance of which we are most acutely sensible it invades so to speak the whole held of our perception if two halfdollars be laid on the table an inch or two apart and the eyes fixate steadily the point of a pen held in the median line at varying distances between the coins and the face there will come a distance at which the pen stands between the left halfdollar and the right eye and the right halfdollar and the left eye the two halfdollars will then coalesce into one and this one will show its apparent approach to the penpoint by seeming suddenly much reduced in size 84

yet in spite of this tendency to inaccuracy we are never actually mistaken about the halfdollar being behind the penpoint it may not seem far enough off but still it is farther than the point in general it may be said that where the objects are known to us no such inclusion of distance occurs in any one as the theory would require and in some observers hering for example it seems hardly to occur at all if i look into infinite distance and get my finger in double images they do not seem infinitely far off to make objects at different distances seem equidistant careful precautions must be taken to have them alike in appearance and to exclude all outward reasons for ascribing to the one a different location from that ascribed to the other thus donders tries to prove the law of projection by taking two similar electric sparks one behind the other on a dark ground one seen double or an iron rod placed so near to the eyes that its double images seem as broad as that of a fixated stovepipe the top and bottom of the objects being cut off by screens so as to prevent all suggestions of perspective etc the three objects in each experiment seem in the same plane 85

add to this the impossibility recognized by all observers of ever seeing double with the foveæ and the fact that authorities as able as those quoted in the note on wheatstones observation deny that they can see double then with identical points and we are forced to conclude that the projectiontheory like its predecessor breaks down neither formulates exactly or exhaustively a law for all our perceptions ambiguity of retinal impressions

what does each theory try to do to make of seen location a fixed function of retinal impressions other facts may be

brought forward to show how far from fixed are the perceptive functions of retinal impressions we alluded a while ago to the extraordinary ambiguity of the retinal image as a revealer of magnitude produce an afterimage of the sun and look at your fingertip  it will be smaller than your nail project it on the table and it will be as big as a strawberry on the wall as large as a plate on yonder mountain bigger than a house and yet it is an unchanged retinal impression prepare a sheet with the figures shown in fig 57 strongly marked upon it and get by direct fixation a distinct afterimage of each

project the afterimage of the cross upon the upper left hand part of the well it min appear as in fig 58 on the upper righthand it will appear as in fig 59 the circle

similarly projected will be distorted into two different ellipses if the two parallel lines be projected upon the ceiling or floor far in front the farther ends will diverge and if the three parallel lines be thrown on the same surfaces the upper pair will seem farther apart than the lower adding certain lines to others has the same distorting effect in what is known as zöllners pattern pig 60 the long parallels tip towards each other the moment we draw the short slanting lines over them yet their retinal images

are the same they always were a similar distortion of parallels appears in pig 61 drawing a square inside the circle fig 52 gives to the outline of the latter an indented appearance where the squares corners touch it drawing the radii of one

of the right angles in the same figure makes it seem larger than the other in fig 63 the retinal image of the space between the extreme dots is in all three lines the same yet it seems much larger the moment it is filled up with other dots

in the stereoscope certain pairs of lines which look single under ordinary circumstances immediately seem double when we add certain other lines to them 86

ambiguous import of eyemovements

these facts show the indeterminateness of the spaceimport of various retinal impressions take now the eyes movements and we find a similar vacillation when we follow a moving object with our gaze the motion is voluntary when our eyes oscillate to and fro after we have made ourselves dizzy by spinning around it is reflex and when the eyeball is pushed with the finger it is passive now in all three of these cases we get a feeling from the movement as it effects itself but the objective perceptions to which the feeling assists us are by no means the same in the worst case we may see a stationary field of view with one moving object in it in the second the total held swimming more or less steadily in one direction in the third a sudden lump or twist of the same total held

the feelings of convergence of the eyeballs permit of the same ambiguous interpretation when objects are near we converge strongly upon them in order to see them when far we set our optic axes parallel but the exact degree of convergence fails to be felt or rather being felt fails to tell us the absolute distance of the object we are regarding wheatstone arranged his stereoscope in such a way that the size of the retinal images might change without the convergence altering or conversely the convergence might change without the retinal image altering under these circumstances he says 87 the object seemed to approach or recede in the first case without altering its size in the second to change its size without altering its distance  just but the objective total same the reverse of what might have been expected wheatstone adds however that fixing the attention converted each of these perceptions into its opposite the same perplexity occurs in looking through prismatic glasses which alter the eyes convergence he cannot decide whether the object has come nearer or grown larger or both or neither and our judgment vacillates in the most surprising way we may even make our eyes diverge and the object will none the less appear at a definite distance when we look through the stereoscope the picture seems at no determinate distance these and other facts have led helmholtz to deny that the feeling of convergence has any very exact value as a distancemeasurer 88

with the feelings of accommodation it is very much the same donders has shown 89 that the apparent magnifying power of spectacles of moderate convexity hardly depends at all upon their enlargement of the retinal image but rather on the relaxation they permit of the muscle of accommodation this suggests an object farther off and consequently a much larger one since its retinal size rather increases than diminishes but in this case the same vacillation of judgment as in the previously mentioned case of convergence takes place the recession made the object seem larger but the apparent growth in size of the object now makes it look as if it came nearer instead of receding the effect thus contradicts its own cause everyone is conscious on first putting on a pair of spectacles of a doubt whether the field of view draws near or retreats 90

there is still another deception occurring in persons who have had one eyemuscle suddenly paralyzed has led wundt to affirm that the eyeballfeeling proper the incoming sensation of effected rotation tells us only of the direction of our eyemovements but not of their whole extent 91 for this reason and because not only wundt but many other authors think the phenomena in these partial paralyses demonstrate the existence of a feeling of innervation a feeling of the outgoing nervous current opposed to every different sensation whatever it seems proper to note the facts with a certain degree of detail

suppose a man wakes up some morning with the external rectus muscle of his right eye half paralyzed what will be the result he will be enabled only with great effort to rotate the eye so as to look at objects lying far off to the right something in the effort he makes will make him feel as if the object lay much farther to the right than it really is if the left and sound eye be closed and he be asked to touch rapidly with his finger an object situated towards his right he will point the finger to the right of it the current explanation of the something in the effort which causes this deception is that it is the sensation of the outgoing discharge from the nervous centres the feeling of innervation to use wundts expression requisite for bringing the open eye with its weakened muscle to bear upon the object to be touched if that object be situated 20 degrees to the right the patient has now to innervate as powerfully to turn the eye those 20 degrees as formerly he did to turn the eye 30 degrees he consequently believes as before that he has turned it 30 degrees until by a newlyacquired custom he learns the altered spatial import of all the discharges his brain makes into his right abducens nerve the feeling of innervation maintained to exist by this and other observations plays an immense part in the spacetheories of certain philosophers especially wundt i shall elsewhere try to show that the observations by no means warrant the conclusions drawn from them and that the feeling in question is probably a wholly fictitious entity 92 meanwhile it suffices to point out that even those who set most store by it are compelled by the readiness with which the translocation of the field of view becomes corrected and further errors avoided to admit that the precise spaceimport of the supposed sensation of outgoing energy is as ambiguous and indeterminate as that of any other of the eyefeelings we have considered hitherto

i have now given what no one will call an understatement of the facts and arguments by which it is sought to banish the credit of directly revealing space from each and every kind of eyesensation taken by itself the reader will confess that they make a very plausible show and most likely wonder whether my own theory of the matter can rally from their damaging evidence but the case is far from being hopeless and the introduction of a discrimination hitherto unmade will if i mistake not easily vindicate the view adopted in these pages whilst at the same time it makes ungrudging allowance for all the ambiguity and illusion on which so much stress is laid by the advocates of the intellectualisttheory

the choice of the visual reality

we have native and fixed optical spacesensations but experience leads us to select certain one from among them to be the exclusive bearers of reality the rest become mere signs and suggesters of these the factor of selection on which we have already laid so much stress here as elsewhere is the solving word of the enigma if helmholtz wundt and the rest with an ambiguous retinal sensation before them meaning now one size and distance and now another had not contented themselves with merely saying  the size and distance are not this sensation they are something beyond it which it merely calls up and whose own birthplace is afar  in synthesis wundt or in experience helmholtz as the case may be if they had gone on definitely to ask and definitely to answer the question what are the size and distance in their proper selves they would not only have escaped the present deplorable vagueness of their spacetheories but they would have seen that the objective spatial attributes signified are simply and solely certain other optical sensations now absent but which the present sensations suggest

what for example is the slantlegged cross which we think we see on the well when we project the rectangular afterimage high up towards our right or left figs 58 and 59 is it not in very sooth a retinal sensation itself  an imagined sensation not a felt one it is true but none the less essentially and originally sensational or retinal for that  the sensation namely which we should receive if a real slantlegged cross stood on the wall in front of us and threw its image on our eye that image is not the one our retina now holds our retina now holds the image which a cross of square shape throws when in front but which a cross of the slantlegged pattern would throw provided it were actually on the wall in the distant place at which we look call this actual retinal image the square image the square image is then one of the innumerable images the slantlegged cross can throw why should another one and that an absent one of those innumerable images be picked out to represent exclusively the slantlegged crosss true shape why should that absent and imagined slantlegged image displace the present and felt square image from our mind why when the objective cross gives us so many shapes as it varies its position should we think we feel the true shape only when the cross is directly in front and when that question is answered how can the absent and represented feeling of a slantlegged figure so successfully intrude itself into the place of a presented square one

before answering either question let us be doubly sure about our facts and see how true it is that in our dealings with objects we always do pick out one of the visual images they yield to constitute the real form or size

the matter of size has been already touched upon so that no more need be said of it here as regards shape almost all the retinal shapes that objects throw are perspective distortions square tabletops constantly present two acute and two obtuse angles circles drawn on our wallpapers our carpets or on sheets of paper usually show like ellipses parallels approach as they recede human bodies are foreshortened and the transitions from one to another of these altering forms are infinite and continual out of the flux however one phase always stands prominent it is the form the object has when we see it easiest and best and that is when our eyes and the object both are in what may be called the normal position in this position our head is upright and our optic axes either parallel or symmetrically convergent the plane of the object is perpendicular to the visual plane and if the object is one containing many lines it is turned so as to make them as far as possible either parallel or perpendicular to the visual plane in this situation it is that we compare all shapes with each other here every exact measurement and decision is made 93

it is very easy to see why the normal situation should have this extraordinary preeminence first it is the position in which we easiest hold anything we are examining in our hands second it is a turningpoint between all right and all lefthand perspective views of a given object third it is the only position in which symmetrical figures seem symmetrical and equal angles seem equal fourth it is often that startingpoint of movements from which the eye is least troubled by axial rotations by which superposition 94 of the retinal images of different lines and different parts of the same line is easiest produced and consequently by which the eye can make the best comparative measurements in its sweeps all these merits single the normal position out to be chosen no other point of view offers so many aesthetic and practical advantages here we believe we see the object as it is elsewhere only as it seems experience and custom soon teach us however that the seeming appearance passes into the real one by continuous gradations they teach us moreover that seeming and being may be strangely interchanged now a real circle may slide into a seeming ellipse now an ellipse may by sliding in the same direction become a seeming circle now a rectangular cross grows slantlegged now a slantlegged one grows rectangular

almost any form in oblique vision may be thus a derivative of almost any other in primary vision and we must learn when we get one of the former appearance to translate it into the appropriate one of the latter class we must learn of what optical reality it is one of the optical signs having learned this me do but obey that law of economy or simplification which dominates our whole psychic life when we attend exclusively to the reality and ignore as much as our consciousness will let us the sign by which we came to apprehend it the signs of each probable real thing being multiple and the thing itself one and fixed we gain the same mental relief by abandoning the former for the latter that we do when we abandon mental images with all their fluctuating characters for the definite and unchangeable names which they suggest the selection of the several normal appearances from out of the jungle of our optical experiences to serve as the real sights of which we shall think is psychologically a parallel phenomenon to the habit of thinking in words and has a like use both are substitutions of terms few and fixed for terms manifold and vague sensations which we ignore

this service of sensations as mere signs to be ignored when they have evoked the other sensations which are their significates was noticed first by berkeley and remarked in many passages as the following

signs being little considered in themselves or for their own sake but only in their relative capacity and for the sake of those things whereof they are signs it comes to pass that the mind overlooks them so as to carry its attention immediately on to the things signified which in truth and strictness are not seen but only suggested and apprehended by means of the proper objects of sight which alone are seen divine visual language §12

berkeley of course erred in supposing that the thing suggested was not even originally an object of sight as the sign now is which calls it up reid expressed berkeleys principle in yet clearer language

 the visible appearances of objects are intended by nature only as signs or indications and the mind passes instantly to the things sig nified without making the least reflection upon the sign or even perceiving that there is any such thing the mind has acquired a confirmed and inveterate habit of inattention to them the signs for they no sooner appear than quick as lightning the thing signified succeeds and engrosses all our regard they have no name in language and although we are conscious of them when they pass through the mind yet their passage is so quick and so familiar that it is absolutely unheeded nor do they leave any footsteps of themselves either in the memory or imagination inquiry chap v §§2 3

if we review the facts we shall find every grade of nonattention between the extreme form of overlooking mentioned by reid or forms even more extreme still and complete conscious perception of the sensation present sometimes it is literally impossible to become aware of the latter sometimes a little artifice or effort easily leads us to discern it together or in alternation with the object it reveals sometimes the present sensation is held to be the object or to reproduce its features in undistorted shape and then of course it receives the minds full glare

the deepest inattention is to subjective optical sensations strictly so called or those which are not signs of outer objects at all helmholtzs treatment of these phenomena muscæ volitantes negative afterimages double images etc is very satisfactory he says

 we only attend with any ease and exactness to our sensations in so far forth as they can be utilized for the knowledge of outward things and we are accustomed to neglect all those portions of them which have no significance as regards the external world so much is this the case that for the most part special artifices and practice are required for the observation of these latter more subjective feelings although it might seem that nothing should be easier than to be conscious of ones own sensations experience nevertheless shows that often enough either a special talent like that showed in eminent degree by purkinje or accident or theoretic speculation are necessary conditions for the discovery of subjective phenomena thus for example the blind spot on the retina was discovered by mariotte by the theoretic way  similarly by me the existence of summationtones in acoustics in the majority of cases accident is what first led observers whose attention was especially exercised on subjective phenomena to discover this one or that only where the subjective appearances are so intense that they interfere with the perception of objects are they noticed by all men alike but if they have once been discovered it is for the most part easy for subsequent observers who place themselves in proper conditions and bend their attention in the right direction to perceive them but in many cases  for example in the phenomena of the blind spot in the discrimination of overtones and combinationtones from the ground tone of musical sounds etc  such a strain of the attention is required even with appropriate instrumental aids that most persons fail the very afterimages of bright objects are by most men perceived only under exceptionally favorable conditions and it takes steady practice to see the fainter images of this kind it is a commonly recurring experience that persons smitten with some eyedisease which impairs vision suddenly remark for the first time the muscæ volitantes which all through life their vitreous humor has contained but which they now firmly believe to have arisen since their malady the truth being that the latter has only made them more observant of all their visual sensations there are also cases where one eye has gradually grown blind and the patient lived for an indefinite time without knowing it until through the accidental closure of the healthy eye alone the blindness of the other was brought to attention

most people when first made aware of binocular double images are uncommonly astonished that they should never have noticed them before although all through their life they had been in the habit of seeing singly only those few objects which were about equally distant with the point of fixation and the rest those nearer and farther which constitute the great majority had always been double

we must then learn to turn our attention to our particular sensations and we learn this commonly only for such sensations as are means of cognition of tile outer world only so far as they serve this end hale our sensations any importance for us in ordinary life subjective feelings are mostly interesting only to scientific investigators were they remarked in the ordinary use of the senses they could only cause disturbance whilst therefore we reach an extraordinary degree of dryness and security in objective observation we not only do not reach this where subjective phenomena are concerned but we actually attain in a high degree the faculty of overlooking these altogether and keeping ourselves independent of their influence in judging of objects even in cases where their strength might lend them easily to attract our attention physiol optik pp 4312

even where the sensation is not merely subjective as in the cases of which helmholtz speaks but is a sign of something outward we are also liable as reid says to overlook its intrinsic quality and attend exclusively to the image of the thing it suggests but here everyone can easily notice the sensation itself if he will usually we see a sheet of paper as uniformly white although a part of it may be in shadow but we can in an instant if we please notice the shadow as local color a man walking towards us does not usually seem to alter his size but we can by setting which impairs our attention in a peculiar way make him appear to do so the whole education of the artist consists in his learning to see the presented signs as well as the represented things no matter what the held of view means he sees it also as it feels  that is as a collection of patches of color bounded by lines  the whole terming an optical diagram of whose intrinsic proportions one who is not an artist has hardly a conscious inkling the ordinary mans attention passes over them to their import the artists turns back and dwells upon them for their own sake dont draw the thing as it is but as it looks is the endless advice of every teacher to his pupil forgetting that what it is is what it would also look provided it were placed in what we have called the normal situation for vision in this situation the sensation as sign and the sensation as object coalesce into one and there is no contrast between them

sensations which seem suppressed

but a great difficulty has been made of certain peculiar cases which we must now turn to consider they are cases in which a present sensation whose existence is supposed to be proved by its outward conditions being there seems absolutely suppressed or changed by the image of the thing it suggests

this matter carries us back to what was said on p 218 the passage there quoted from helmholtz refers to these cases he thinks they conclusively disprove the original and intrinsic spatiality of any of our retinal sensations for if such a one actually present had an immanent and essential spacedetermination of its own that might well be added to and overlaid or even momentarily eclipsed by suggestions of its sensation but how could it possibly be altered or completely suppressed thereby of actually present sensations he says being suppressed by suggestions of experience 

we have not a single wellattested example in all those illusions which are provoked by sensations in the absence of their usually exciting objects the mistake never vanishes by the better understanding of the object really present and by insight into the cause of deception phosphenes provoked by pressure on the eyeball by traction on the entrance of the optic nerve afterimages etc remain projected into their apparent place in the held of vision just as the image projected from a mirrors surface continues to be seen behind the mirror although we know that to all these appearances no outward reality corresponds true enough we can remove our attention and keep it removed from sensations that have no reference to the outer world those eg of the weaker afterimages and of entoptic objects etc but what would become of our perceptions at all if we had the power not only of ignoring but of transforming into their opposites any part of them that differed from that outward experience the image of which as that of a present reality accompanies them in the mind  95

and again

on the analogy of all other experience we should expect that the conquered feelings would persist to our perception even if only in the shape of recognized illusions but this is not the case one does not see how the assumption of originally spatial sensations can explain our optical cognitions when in the last resort those who believe in these very sensations and themselves obliged to assume that they are overcome by our better judgment based on experience

these words coming from such a quarter necessarily carry great weight but the authority even of a helmholtz ought not to shake ones critical composure and the moment one abandons abstract generalities and comes to close quarters with the particulars i think one easily sees that no such conclusions as those we have quoted follow from the latter but probably to conduct the discussion we must divide the alleged instances into groups

a with helmholtz colorperception is equally with spaceperception an intellectual affair the socalled simultaneous colorcontrast by which one color modifies another alongside of which it is said is explained by him as an unconscious inference in chapter xvii we discussed the colorcontrast problem the principles which applied to its solution will prove also applicable to part of the present problem in my opinion hering has definitively proved that when one color is laid beside another it modifies the sensation of the latter not by virtue of any mere mental suggestion as helmholtz would have it but by actually exciting a new nerveprocess to which the modified feeling of color immediately corresponds the explanation is physiological not psychological the transformation of the original color by the inducing color is due to the disappearance of the physiological conditions under which the first color was produced and to the induction under the new conditions of a genuine new sensation with which the suggestions of experience have naught to do

that processes in the visual apparatus propagate themselves laterally if one may so express it is also shown by the phenomena of contrast which occur after looking upon motions of various kinds here are a few examples if over the rail of a moving vessel we look at the water rushing along the side and then transfer our gaze to the deck a band of planks will appear to us moving in the opposite direction to that in which a moment previously we had been seeing the water move whilst on either side of this band another band of planks will move as the water did looking at a waterfall or at the road from out of a carwindow in a moving train produces the same illusion which may be easily verified in the laboratory by a simple piece of apparatus a board with a window five or six inches wide and of any convenient length is supported upright on two feet on the back side of the board above and below the window are two rollers one of which is provided with a crank an endless band of any figured stuff is passed over these rollers one of which can be so adjusted on its bearings as to keep the stuff always taut and not liable to slip and the surface of the front board is also covered with stuff or paper of a nature to catch the eye turning the crank now sets the central band in continuous motion whilst the margins of the field remain really at rest but after a while appear moving in the contrary way stopping the crank results in an illusory appearance of motion in reverse directions all over the field

a disk with an archimedean spiral drawn upon it whirled round on an ordinary rotating machine produces still more startling effects

if the revolution is in the direction in which the spiral line approaches the centre of the disk the entire surface of the latter seems to expand during revolution and to contract after it has ceased and vice versâ if the movement of revolution is in the opposite direction if in the former case the eyes of the observers are turned from the rotating disk towards any familiar object  e g the face of a friend  the latter seems to contract or recede in a somewhat striking manner and to expand or approach after the opposite motion of the spiral 96

an elementary form of these motor illusions seems to be the one described by helmholtz on pp 568571 of his optik the motion of anything in the field of vision along an acute angle towards a straight line sensibly distorts

that line thus in fig 66 let ab be a line drawn on paper cde the tracing made over this line by the point of a compass steadily followed by the eve as it moves as the compasspoint passes from c to d the line appears to move downwards as it passes from d to e the line appears to move upwards at the same time the whole line seems to incline itself in the direction fg during the first half of the compasss movement and in the direction hi during its last half the change from one inclination to another being quite distinct as the compasspoint passes over d

any line across which we draw a pencilpoint appears to be animated by a rapid movement of its own towards the pencilpoint this apparent movement of both of two things in relative motion to each other even when one of them is absolutely still reminds us of the instances quoted from vierordt on page 188 and seems to take us back to a primitive stage of perception in which the discriminations we now make when we feel a movement have not yet been made if we draw the point of a pencil through zöllners pattern fig 60 p 232 and follow it with the eye the whole figure becomes the scene of the most singular apparent unrest of which helmholtz has very carefully noted the conditions the illusion of zöllners figure vanishes entirely or almost so with most people if they steadily look at one point of it with an unmoving eye and the same is the case with many other illusions

now all these facts taken together seen to show  vaguely it is true but certainly  that present excitements and after effects of former excitements may alter the result of processes occurring simultaneously at a distance from them in the retina or other portions of the apparatus for optical sensation in the cases last considered the moving eye as it sweeps the fovea over certain parts of the figure seems thereby to determine a modification in the feeling which the other parts confer which modification is the figures distortion it is true that this statement explains nothing it only keeps the cases to which it applies from being explained spuriously the spurious account of these illusions is that they are intellectual not sensational that they are secondary not primary mental facts the distorted figure is said to be one which the mind is led to imagine by falsely drawing an unconscious inference from certain premises of which it is not distinctly aware and the imagined figure is supposed to be strong enough to suppress the perception of whatever real sensations there may be but helmholtz wundt delboeuf zöllner and all the advocates of unconscious inference are at variance with each other when it comes to the question what these unconscious premises and inferences may be that small angles look proportionally larger than larger ones is in brief the fundamental illusion to which almost all authors would reduce the peculiarity of fig 67 89 of figs 60 61 62 pp 232 233 this peculiarity of small angles is by wundt treated as the case of a fined space seeming larger than an empty one as in fig 68 and this according to both delboeuf and wundt is owing to the fact that more muscular innervation is needed for the eye to traverse a filled space than so empty one because the points and lines

in the filled space inevitably arrest and constrain the eye and this makes us feel as if it were doing more work ie traversing a longer distance 97 when however we recol

lect that muscular movements are positively proved to have no share in the waterfall and revolvingspirals illusions and that it is hard to see how wundts and delboeufs particular form of muscleexplanation can possibly apply to the compasspoint illusion considered a moment ago we must conclude that these writers have probably exaggerated to say the least the reach of their muscleexplanation in the case of the subdivided angles and lines never do we get such strong muscular feelings as when against the course of nature we oblige our eyes to be still but fixing the eyes on one point of the figure so far from making that part of the latter seem larger dispels in most persons the illusion of these diagrams altogether

as for helmholtz he invokes to explain the enlargement of small angles 98 what he calls a law of contrast between directions and distances of lines analogous to that between colors and intensities of light lines cutting another line make the latter seem more inclined away from them than it really is moreover clearly recognizable magnitudes appear greater than equal magnitudes which we but vaguely apprehend but this is surely a sensationalistic law a native function of our seeingapparatus quite as little as the negative afterimage of the revolving spiral could such contrast be deduced from any association of ideas or recall of past objects the principle of contrast is criticised by wundt 99 who says that by it small spaces ought to appear to us smaller and not larger than they really are helmholtz might have retorted had not the retort been as fatal to the uniformity of his own principle as to wundts that if the muscleexplanation were true it ought not to give rise to just the opposite illusions in the skin we saw on p 141 that subdivided spaces appear shorter than empty ones upon the skin to the instances there given add this divide a line on paper into equal halves puncture the extremities and make punctures all along one of the halves then with the fingertip on the opposite side of the paper follow the line of punctures the empty half will seem much longer than the punctured half this seems to bring things back to unanalyzable laws by reason of which our feeling of size is determined differently in the skin and in the retina even when the objective conditions are the same herings explanation of zöllners figure is to be found in hermanns handb d physiologie iii i p 579 lipps 100 gives another reason why lines cutting another line make the latter seem to bend away from them more than is really the case if he says we draw fig 69 the line pm upon the line ab and follow the latter with our eye we shall on reaching the point m tend for a moment to slip off ab and to follow mp without distinctly realizing that we are not still on the main line this makes us feel as if the remainder mb of the main line were bent a little away from its original direction the illusion is apparent in the shape of a seeming

approach of the ends b b of the two main lines this to my mind would be a more satisfactory explanation of this class of illusions than any of those given by previous authors were it not again for what happens in the skin

considering all the circumstances i feel justified in discarding his entire batch of illusions as irrelevant to our present inquiry whatever they may prove they do not prove that our visual percepts of form and movement may not be sensations strictly so called they much more probably fall into line with the phenomena of irradiation and of colorcontrast and with vierordts primitive illusions of movement they show us if anything a realm of sensations in which our habitual experience has not yet made traces and which persist in spite of our better knowledge unsuggestive of those other spacesensations which we all the time know from extrinsic evidence to constitute the real spacedeterminations of the diagram very likely if these sensations were as frequent and as practically important as they now are insignificant and dare we should end by substituting their significates  the real spacevalues of the diagrams  for them these latter me should then seem to see directly and the illusions would disappear like that of the side of a toothsocket when the tooth has been out a week

b another batch of cases which we may discard is that of double images a thoroughgoing antisensationalist ought to deny all native tendency to see double images when disparate retinal points are stimulated because he should say most people never get them but see all things single which experience has led them to believe to be single can a doubleness so easily neutralized by our knowledge ever be a datum of sensation at all such an antisensationalist might ask

to which the answer is that it is a datum of sensation but a datum which like many other data must first be discriminated as a rule no sensible qualities are discriminated without a motive 101 and those that later we learn to discriminate were originally felt confused as well pretend that a voice or an odor which we have learned to pick out is no sensation now one may easily acquire skin in discriminating double images though as hering somewhere says it is an art of which one cannot become master in one year or in two for masters like hering himself or le conte the ordinary stereoscopic diagrams are of little use instead of combining into one solid appearance they simply cross each other with their doubled

lines volkmann has shown a great variety of ways in which the addition of secondary lines differing in the two fields helps us to see the primary lines double the effect is analogous to that shown in the cases which we despatched sic a moment ago where given lines have their spacevalue changed by the addition of new lines without our being able to say why except that a certain mutual adhesion of the lines and modification of the resultant feeling takes place by psychophysiologica1 laws thus if in fig 66 l and r be crossed by an horizontal line at the same level and viewed stereoscopically they appear as a single pair of lines l in space but if the horizontal be at different levels as in l r three lines appear as in s 102 let us then say no more about double images all that the facts prove is what volkmann says 103 that although there may be sets of retinal fibres so organized as to give an impression of two separate spots yet the excitement of other retinal fibres may inhibit the effect of the first excitement and prevent us from actually making the discrimination still farther retinal processes may however bring the doubleness to the eye of attention and once there it is as genuine a sensation as any that our life affords 104

c these groups of illusions being eliminated either as cases of defective discrimination or as changes of one spacesensation into another when the total retinal process changes there remain but two other groups to puzzle us the first is that of the afterimages distorted by projection on to oblique planes the second relates to the instability of our judgments of relative distance and size by the eye and includes especially what are known as pseudoscopic illusions

the phenomena of the first group were described on page 232 a w volkmann has studied them with his accustomed clearness and care 105 even an imaginarily inclined wall in a picture will if an afterimage be thrown upon it distort the shape thereof and make us see a form of which our afterimage would be the natural projection on the retina were that form laid upon the wall thus a signboard is painted in perspective on a screen and the eye after steadily looking at a rectangular cross is turned to the painted signboard the afterimage appears as an obliquelegged cross upon the signboard it is the converse phenomenon of a perspective drawing like fig 71 in which

really obliquelegged figures are seen as rectangular crosses

the unstable judgments of relative distance and size were also mentioned on pp 2312 whatever the size may be of the retinal image which an object makes the object is seen as of its own normal size a man moving towards us is not sensibly perceived to grow for example and my finger of which a single joint may more than conceal him from my view is nevertheless seen as a much smaller object than the man as for distances it is often possible to make the farther part of an object seem near and the nearer part far a human profile in intaglio looked at steadily with one eye or even both soon appears irresistibly as a bas relief the inside of a common pasteboard mask painted like the outside and viewed with one eye in a direct light also looks convex instead of hollow so strong is the illu sion after long fixation that a friend who painted such a mask for me told me it soon became difficult to see how to apply the brush bend a visitingcard across the middle so that its halves form an angle of 90° more or less set it upright on the table as in fig 72 and view it with one eye

you can make it appear either as if it opened towards you or away from you in the former case the angle ab lies

upon the table b being nearer to you than a in the latter case ab seems vertical to the table  as indeed it really is  with a nearer to you than b 106 again look with either one or two eyes at the opening of a wineglass or tumbler fig 73 held either above or below the eyes level the retinal image of the opening is an oval but we can see the oval in either of two ways as if it were the perspective view of a circle whose edge b were farther from us than its edge a in which case we should seem to be looking down on the circle or as if its edge a were the more distant edge in which case we should be looking up at it through the b side of the glass as the manner of seeing the edge changes the glass itself alters its form in space and looks straight or seems bent towards or from the eye 107 according as the latter is placed beneath or above it

plane diagrams also can be conceived as solids and that in more than one way figs 74 75 76 for example are am

biguous perspective projections and may each of them remind us of two different natural objects whichever of these objects we conceive clearly at the moment of looking at the figure we seem to see in all its solidity before us a little practice will enable us to flap the figures so to speak backwards end forwards from one object to the other at will we need only attend to one of the angles represented and imagine it either solid or hollow  pulled towards us out of the plane of the paper or pushed back behind the same  and the whole figure obeys the cue and is instantaneously transformed beneath our gaze 108

the peculiarity of all these cases is the ambiguity of the perception to which the fixed retinal impression gives rise with our retina excited in exactly the same way whether by afterimage mask or diagram we see now this object and now that as if the retinal image per se had no essential spaceimport surely if form and length were originally retinal sensations retinal rectangles ought not to become acute or obtuse and lines ought not to alter their relative lengths as they do if relief were an optical feeling it ought not to flap to and fro with every optical condition unchanged here if anywhere the deniers of spacesensation ought to be able to make their final stand 109

it must be confessed that their plea is plausible at first sight but it is one thing to throw out retinal sensibility altogether as a spaceyielding function the moment we find an ambiguity in its deliverances and another thing to examine candidly the conditions which may have brought the ambiguity about the former way is cheap wholesale shallow the latter difficult and complicated but full of instruction in the end let us try it for ourselves in the case of the diagrams 72 73 74 75 76 the real object lines meeting or crossing each other on a plane is replaced by an imagined solid which we describe as seen really it is not seen but only so vividly conceived as to approach a vision of reality we feel all the while however that the solid suggested is not solidly there the reason why one solid may seem more easily suggested than another and why it is easier in generally to perceive the diagram solid than flat seems due to probability 110 those lines have countless times in our past experience been drawn on our retina by solids for once that we have seen them flat on paper and hundreds of times we have looked down upon the upper surface of parallelopipeds stairs and glasses for once that we have looked upwards at their bottom  hence we see the solids easiest as if from above

habit or probability seems also to govern the illusion of the intaglio profile and of the hollow mask we have never seen a human face except in relief  hence the case with which the present sensation is overpowered hence too the obstinacy with which human faces and forms and other extremely familiar convex objects refuse to appear hollow when viewed through wheatstones pseudoscope our perception seems wedded to certain total ways of seeing certain objects the moment the object is suggested at all it takes possession of the mind in the fulness of its stereotyped habitual form this explains the suddenness of the transformations when the perceptions change the object shoots back and forth completely from this to that familiar thing and doubtful indeterminate and composite things are excluded apparently because we are unused to their existence

when we turn from the diagrams to the actual folded visitingcard and to the real glass the imagined form seems fully as real as the correct one the card flaps over tile glass rim tilts this may or that as if some inward spring suddenly became released in our eye in these changes the actual retinal image receives different comments from the mind but the remarkable thing is that the complement and the image combine so completely that the twain are one flesh as it were and cannot be discriminated in the result if the complement be as we have called it on pp 2378 a set of imaginary absent eyesensations they seem no whit less vividly there than the sensation which the eye now receives from without

the case of the afterimages distorted by projection upon an oblique plane is even more strange for the imagined perspective figure lying in the plane seems less to combine with the one a moment previously seen by the eye than to suppress it and take its place 111 the point needing explanation then in all this is how it comes to pass that when imagined sensations are usually so inferior in vivacity to reel ones they should in these few experiences prove to be almost or quite their match

the mystery is solved when we note the class to which all these experiences belong they are perceptions of definite things definitely situated in tridimensional space the mind uniformly uses its sensations to identify things by the sensation is invariably apperceived by the idea name or normal aspect p 238 of the thing the peculiarity of the optical signs of things is their extraordinary mutability a thing which we follow with the eye never doubting of its physical identity will change its retinal image incessantly a cross a ring waved about in the air will pass through every conceivable angular and elliptical form all the while however as we look at them we hold fast to the perception of their real shape by mentally combining the pictures momentarily received with the notion of peculiar positions in space it is not the cross and ring pure and simple which we perceive but the cross so held the ring so held from the day of our birth we have sought every hour of our lives to correct the apparent form of things and trans it into the real form by keeping note of the way they are placed or held in no other class of sensations does this incessant correction occur what wonder then that the notion so placed should invincibly exert its habitual corrective effect even when the object with which it combines is only an afterimage and make us perceive the latter under a changed but more real form the real form is also a sensation conjured up by memory but it is one so probable so habitually conjured up when we have just this combination of optical experiences that it partakes of the invincible freshness of reality and seems to break through that law which elsewhere condemns reproductive processes to being so much fainter than sensations

once more these cases form an extreme somewhere in the list of our imaginations of absent feelings there must be found the vividest of all these optical reproductions of real forms are the vividest of all it is foolish to reason from cases lower in the scale to prove that the scale can contain no such extreme cases as these and particularly foolish since we can definitely see why these imaginations ought to be more vivid than any others whenever they recall the forms of habitual and probable things these latter by incessantly repeated presence and reproduction will plough deep grooves in the nervous system there will be developed to correspond to them paths of least resistance of unstable equilibrium liable to become active in their totality when any point is touched off even when the objective stimulus is imperfect we shall still see the full convexity of a human face the correct inclination of an angle or sweep of a curve or the distance of two lines our mind will be like a polyhedron whose facets are the attitudes of perception in which it can most easily rest these are worn upon it by habitual objects and from one of these it can pass only by tumbling over into another 112

hering has well accounted for the sensationally vivid character of these habitually reproduced forms he says after reminding us that every visual sensation is correlated to a physical process in the nervous apparatus if this psychophysical process is aroused as usually happens by lightrays impinging on the retina its form depends not only on the nature of these rays but on the constitution of the entire nervous apparatus which is connected with the organ of vision and on the state in which it finds itself the same stimulus may excite widely different sensations according to this state

the constitution of the nervous apparatus depends naturally in part upon innate predisposition but the ensemble of effects wrought by stimuli upon it in the course of life whether these come through the eyes or from elsewhere is a cofactor of its development to express it otherwise involuntary and voluntary experience and exercise assist in determining the material structure of the nervous organ of vision and hence the ways in which it may react on a retinal image as an outward stimulus that experience and exercise should be possible at all in vision is a consequence of the reproductive power or memory of its nervesubstance every particular activity of the organ makes it more suited to a repetition of the same ever slighter touches are required to make the repetition occur the organ habituates itself to the repeated activity

suppose now that in the first experience of a complex sensation produced by a particular retinal image certain portions were made the special objects of attention in a repetition of the sensible experience it will happen that notwithstanding the identity of the outward stimulus these portions will be more easily and strongly reproduced and when this happens a hundred times the inequality with which the various constituents of the complex sensation appeal to consciousness grows ever greater

now in the present state of our knowledge we cannot assert that in both the first and the last occurrence of the retinal image in question the same pure sensation is provoked but that the mind interprets it differently the last time in consequence of experience for the only open thing we know are on the one hand the retinal image which is both times the same and on the other the mental percept which is both times different  of a third thing such as a pure sensation interpolated between image and percept we know nothing we ought therefore if we wish to avoid hypotheses simply to say that the nervous apparatus reacts the last time differently from the first and gives us in consequence it different group of sensations

but not only by repetition of the same retinal image but by that of similar ones will the law obtain portions of the image common to the successive experiences will awaken as it were a stronger echo in the nervous apparatus than other portions hence it results that reproduction is usually elective the more strongly reverberating parts of the picture yield stronger feelings than the rest this may result in the latter being quite overlooked and as it were eliminated from perception it may even come to pass that instead of these parts eliminated by election a feeling of entirely different elements comes to consciousness  elements not objectively contained in the stimulus a group of sensations namely for which a strong tendency to reproduction has become by frequent repetition ingrained in the nervous system will easily revive as a whole when not its whole retinal image but only an essential part thereof returns in this case we get some sensations to which no adequate stimulus exists in the retinal image and which owe their being solely to the reproductive power of the nervous apparatus this is complementary ergänzende reproduction

thus a few points and disconnected strokes are sufficient to make us see a human face and without specially directed attention we fail to note that we see much that really is not drawn on the paper attention will show that the outlines were deficient in spots where we thought them complete the portions of the percept supplied by complementary reproduction depend however just as much as its other portions on the reaction of the nervous apparatus upon the retinal image indirect though this reaction may in the case of the supplied portions be and so long as they are present we have a perfect right to call them sensations for they differ in no wise from such sensations as correspond to an actual stimulus in the retina often however they are not persistent many of them may be expelled by more close observation but this is not proved to be the case with all in vision with one eye the distribution of parts within the third dimension is essentially the work of this complementary reproduction ie of former experience when a certain way of localizing a particular group of sensations has become with us a second nature our better knowledge our judgment our logic are of no avail things actually diverse may give similar or almost identical retinal images eg an object extended in three dimensions and its hat perspective picture in such cases it often depends on small accidents and especially on our will whether the one or the other group of sensations shall be excited we can see a relief hollow as a mould or vice versâ for a relief illuminated from the left can look just like its mould illuminated from the right reflecting upon this one may infer from the direction of the shadows that one has a relief before one and the idea of the relief will guide the nerveprocesses into the right path so that the feeling of the relief is suddenly aroused whenever the retinal image is of such a nature that two diverse modes of reaction on the part of the nervous apparatus are so to speak equally or nearly equally imminent it must depend on small accidents whether the one or the other reaction is realized in these cases our previous knowledge often has a decisive effect and helps the correct perception to victory the bare idea of the right object is itself a feeble reproduction which with the help of the proper retinal picture develops into clear and lively sensation but if there be not already in the nervous apparatus a disposi tion to the production of that percept which our judgment tells us is right our knowledge strives in vain to conjure up the feeling of it we then know that we see something to which no reality corresponds but we see it all the same 113

note that no object not probable no object which we are not incessantly practised in reproducing can acquire this vividness in imagination objective corners are ever changing their angles to the eyes spaces their apparent size lines their distance but by no transmutation of position in space does an objective straight line appear bent and only in one position out of an infinity does a broken line look straight accordingly it is impossible by projecting the afterimage

of a straight line upon two surfaces which make a solid angle with each other to give the line itself a sensible kink look with it at the corner of your room the afterimage which may overlap all three surfaces of the corner still continues straight volkmann constructed a complicated surface of projection like that drawn in fig 77 but he found it impossible so to throw a straight after image upon it as to alter its visible form

one of the situations in which we oftenest see things is spread out on the ground before us we are incessantly drilled in making allowance for this perspective and reducing things to their real form in spite of optical foreshortening hence if the preceding explanations are true we ought to find this habit inveterate the lower half of the retina which habitually sees the farther half of things spread out on the ground ought to have acquired a habit of enlarging its pictures by imagination so as to make them more than equal to those which fall on the upper retinal surface and this habit ought to be hard to escape from even when both halves of the object are equidistant from the eye as in a vertical line on paper delboeuf has found accordingly that if we try to bisect such a line we place the point of division about 116 of its length too high 114

similarly a square cross or a square drawn on paper should look higher than it is broad and that this is actually the case the reader may verify by a glance at fig 78

for analogous reasons the upper and lower halves of the letter s or of the figure 8 hardly seem to differ but when turned upside down as upsidedown s and 8 the upper half looks much the larger 115

hering has tried to explain our exaggeration of small angles in the same way we have more to do with right angles than with any others right angles in fact have an altogether unique sort of interest for the human mind nature almost never begets them but we think space by means of them and put them everywhere consequently obtuse and acute ones liable always to be the images of right ones foreshortened particularly easily revive right ones in memory it is hard to look at such figures as a b c in fig 79 without seeing them in perspective as

approximations at least to foreshortened rectangular forms 116

at the same time the genuine sensational form of the lines before us can in all the cases of distortion by suggested perspective be felt correctly by a mind able to abstract from the notion of perspective altogether individuals differ in this abstracting power artistic training improves it so that after a little while errors in vertical bisection in estimating height relatively to breadth etc become impossible in other words we learn to take the optical sensation before us pure 117

we may then sum up our study of illusions by saying that they in no wise undermine our view that every spatial determination of things is originally given in the shape of a sensation of the eyes they only show how very potent certain imagined sensations of the eyes may become

these sensations so far as they bring definite forms to the mind appear to be retinal exclusively the movements of the eyeballs play a great part in educating our perception it is true but they have nothing to do with constituting any one feeling of form their function is limited to exciting the various feelings of form by tracing retinal streaks and to comparing them and measuring them off against each other by applying different parts of the retinal surface to the same objective thing helmholtzs analysis of the facts of our measurement of the field of view is bating a lapse or two masterly and seems to prove that the movements of the eye have had some part in bringing our sense of retinal equivalencies about  equivalencies mind of different retinal forms and sizes not forms and sizes themselves superposition is the way in which the eyemovements accomplish this result an object traces the line ab on a peripheral tract of the retina quickly we move the eye so that the same object traces the line ab on a central tract forthwith to our mind ab and ab are judged equivalent but as helmholtz admits the equivalencejudgment is independent of the way in which we may feel the form and length of the several retinal pictures themselves

the retina is like a pair of compasses whose points we apply in succession to the ends of several lines to see whether they agree or not in length all we need know meanwhile about the compasses is that the distance of their points remains unchanged what that distance is and what is the shape of the compasses is a matter of no account 118

measurement implies a stuff to measure retinal sensations give the stuff objective things form the yardstick motion does the measuring operation which can of course be well performed only where it is possible to make the same object fall on many retinal tracts this is practically im possible where the tracts make a wide angle with each other but there are certain directions in the held of view certain retinal lines along which it is particularly easy to make the image of an object slide the object then be comes ruler for these lines as helmholtz puts it 119 making them seem straight throughout if the object looked straight to us in that pert of them at which it was most distinctly seen

but all this need of superposition shows how devoid of exact spaceimport the feelings of movement are per se as we compare the spacevalue of two retinal tracts by super posing them successively upon the same objective line so we also hare to compare the spacevalue of objective angles and lines by superposing them on the same retinal tract neither procedure would be required if our eyemovements were apprehended immediately by pure muscular feeling or innervation for example as distinct lengths and directions in space to compare retinal tracts it would then suffice simply to notice how it feels to move any image over them and two objective lines could be compared as well by moving different retinal tracts along them as by laying them along the same it would be as easy to com pare nonparallel figures as it now is to judge of those which are parallel 120 those which it took the same amount of movement to traverse would be equal in whatever direction the movement occurred

general summary

with this we may end our long and i fear to many readers tediously minute survey the facts of vision form a jungle of intricacy and those who penetrate deeply into physiological optics will be more struck by our omissions than by our abundance of detail but for students who may have lost sight of the forest for the trees i will recapitulate briefly the points of our whole argument from the beginning and then proceed to a short historical survey which will set them in relief

all our sensations are positively and inexplicably extensive wholes

the sensations contributing to spaceperception seem exclusively to be the surface of skin retina and joints muscular feelings play no appreciable part in the generation of our feelings of form direction etc

the total bigness of a cutaneous or retinal feeling soon becomes subdivided by discriminative attention

movements assist this discrimination by reason of the peculiarly exciting quality of the sensations which stimuli moving over surfaces arouse

subdivisions once discriminated acquire definite relations of position towards each other within the total space these relations are themselves feelings of the subdivisions that intervene when these subdivisions are not the seat of stimuli the relations are only reproduced in imaginary form

the various sensespaces are in the first instance incoherent with each other and primitively both they and their subdivisions are but vaguely comparable in point of bulk and form

the education of our spaceperception consists largely of two processes  reducing the various sensefeelings to a common measure and adding them together into the single allincluding space of the real world

both the measuring and the adding are performed by the aid of things

the imagined aggregate of positions occupied by all the actual or possible moving or stationary things which we know is our notion of real space  a very incomplete and vague conception in all minds

the measuring of our spacefeelings against each other mainly comes about through the successive arousal of different ones by the same thing by our selection of certain ones as feelings of its real size and shape and by the degradation of others to the status of being merely signs of these

for the successive application of the same thing to different spacegiving surfaces motion is indispensable and hence plays a great pert in our spaceeducation especially in that of the eye abstractly considered the motion of the object over the sensitive surface would educate us quite as well as that of the surface over the object but the self mobility of the organ carrying the surface accelerates immensely the result

in completely educated spaceperception the present sensation is usually just what helmholtz physiol optik p 797 calls it a sign the interpretation of whose meaning is left to the understanding but the understanding is exclusively reproductive and never productive in the process and its function is limited to the recall of previous spacesensations with which the present one has been associated and which may be judged more real than it

finally this reproduction may in the case of certain visual forms be as vivid or almost so as actual sensation is

the third dimension forms an original element of all our spacesensations in the eye it is subdivided by various discriminations the more distant subdivisions are often shut out altogether and in being suppressed have the effort of diminishing the absolute spacevalue of the total field of view 121

historical

let us now close with a brief historical survey the first achievement of note in the study of spaceperception was berkeleys theory of vision this undertook to establish two points first that distance was not a visual but a tactile form of consciousness suggested by visual signs secondly that there is no one quality or idea common to the sensations of touch and sight such that prior to experience one might possibly anticipate from the look of an object anything about its felt size shape or position or from the touch of it anything about its look

in other words that primitively chaotic or semichaotic condition of our various sensespaces which we have demonstrated was established for good by berkeley and he bequeathed to psychology the problem of describing the manner in which the deliverances are harmonized so as all to refer to one and the same extended world

his disciples in great britain have solved this problem after berkeleys own fashion and to a great extent as we have done ourselves by the ideas of the various senses suggesting each other in consequence of association but either because they were intoxicated with the principle of association or because in the number of details they lost their general bearings they have forgotten as a rule to state under what sensible form the primitive spatial experiences are found which later became associated with so many other sensible signs heedless of their master lockes precept that the mind can frame unto itself no one new simple idea they seem for the most part to be trying to explain the extensive plurality itself account for it and evolve it by the mere association together of feelings which originally possessed it not they first evaporate the nature of extension by making it tantamount to mere coexistence and then they explain coexistence as being the same thing as succession provided it be an extremely rapid or a reversible succession spaceperception thus emerges without being anywhere postulated the only things postulated are unextended feelings and time says thomas brown lecture xxiii i am inclined to reverse exactly the process commonly supposed  and instead of deriving the measure of time from extension to derive the knowledge and original measure of extension from time brown and both the mills think that retinal sensations colors in their primitive condition are felt with no extension and that the latter merely becomes inseparably associated with them john mill says whatever may be the retinal impression conveyed by a line which bounds two colors i see no ground for thinking that by the eye alone we could acquire the conception of what we now mean when we say that one of the colors is outside beside122 the other 123

whence does the extension come which gets so inseparably associated with these nonextended colored sensations from the sweep and movements of the eye  from muscular feelings but as prof bain says if movementfeelings give us any property of things it would seem to be not space but time 124 and john min says that the idea of space is at bottom one of time 125 space then is not to be found in any elementary sensation but in bains words as a quality it has no other origin and no other meaning then the association of these different nonspatial 126 motor and sensitive effects 127

this phrase is mysticalsounding enough to one who understands association as producing nothing but only as knitting together things already produced in separate ways the truth is that the english associationist school in trying to show how much their principle can accomplish have altogether overshot the mark and espoused a kind of theory in respect to spaceperception which the general tenor of their philosophy should lead them to abhor really there are but three possible kinds of theory concerning space either 1 there is no spatial quality of sensation at all and space is a mere symbol of succession or 2 there is an extensive quality given immediately in certain particular sensations  or finally 3 there is a quality produced out of the inward resources of the mind to envelop sensations which as given originally are not spatial but which on being cast into the spatial form become united and orderly this last is the kantian view stumpf admirably designates it as the psychic stimulus theory the crude sensations being considered as goads to the mind to put forth its slumbering power

brown the mills and bain amid these possibilities seem to have gone astray like lost sheep with the mental chemistry of which the mills speak  precisely the same thing as the psychical synthesis of wundt which as we shall soon see is a principle expressly intended to do what association can never perform  they hold the third view but again in other places imply the first and between the impossibility of getting from mere association anything not contained in the sensations associated and the dislike to allow spontaneous mental productivity they flounder in a dismal dilemma mr sully joins them there in what i must call a vague and vacillating way mr spencer of course is bound to pretend to evolve all mental qualities out of antecedents different from themselves so that we need perhaps not wonder at his refusal to accord the spatial quality to any of the several elementary sensations out of which our spaceperception grows thus psychology ii 168 172 218

no idea of extension can arise from a simultaneous excitation of a multitude of nerveterminations like those of the skin or the retina since this would imply a knowledge of their relative positions  that is a preexistent idea of a special extension which is absurd no relation between successive states of consciousness gives in itself any idea of extension the muscular sensations accompanying motion are quite distinct from the notions of space and time associated with them

mr spencer none the less inveighs vociferously against the kantian position that space is produced by the minds own resources and yet he nowhere denies space to be a specific affection of consciousness different from time

such incoherency is pitiful the fact is that at bottom all these authors are really psychical stimulists or kantists the space they speak of is a supersensational mental product this position appears to me thoroughly mythological but let us see how it is held by those who know more definitely what they mean schopenhauer expresses the kantian view with more vigor and clearness than anyone else he says

a man must be forsaken by all the gods to dream that the world we see outside of us fining space in its three dimensions moving down the inexorable stream of time governed at each step by causalitys invariable law  but in all this only following rules which we may prescribe for it in advance of all experience  to dream i say that such a world should stand there outside of us quite objectively real with no complicity of ours and thereupon by a subsequent act through the instrumentality of mere sensation that it should enter our head and reconstruct a duplicate of itself as it was outside for what a povertystricken thing is this mere sensation  even in the noblest organs of sense it is nothing more than a local and specific feeling susceptible within its kind of a few variations but always strictly subjective and containing in itself nothing objective nothing resembling a perception for sensation of every sort is and remains a process in the organism itself as such it is limited to the territory inside the skin and can never accordingly per se contain anything that lies outside the skin or outside ourselves only when the understandingis roused to activity and brings its sole and only form the law of causality into play only then does the mighty transformation take place which makes out of subjective sensation objective intuition the understanding namely grasps by means of its innate a priori anteexperiential form the given sensation of the body as an effect which as such must necessarily have a cause at the same time the understanding summons to its aid the form of the outer sense which similarly lies already preformed in the intellect or brain and which is space in order to locate that cause outside of the organism in this process the understanding as i shall soon show takes note of the most minute peculiarities of the given sensation in order to construct in the outer space a cause which shall completely account for them this operation of the understanding is however not one that takes place discursively reflectively in abstracto by means of words and concepts but is intuitive and immediate thus the understanding must drat create the objective world never can the latter already complete in se simply promenade into our heads through the senses and organic apertures for the senses yield us nothing further than the raw material which must be first elaborated into the objective conception of an orderly physical worldsystem by means of the aforesaid simple forms of space time and causality let me show the great chasm between sensation and perception by showing how raw the material is out of which the fair structure is upreared sic only two senses serve objective perception touch and sight they alone furnish the data on the basis whereof the understanding by the process indicated erects the objective world these data in themselves are still no perception  that is the understandings work if i press with my hand against the table the sensation i receive has no analogy with the idea of the firm cohesion of the parts of this mass only when my understanding passes from the sensation to its cause does it create for itself a body with the properties of solidity impenetrability and hardness when in the dark i lay my hand on a surface or grasp a ball of three inches diameter in either case the same parts of the band receive the impression but out of the different contraction of the hand in the two cases my understanding constructs the form of the body whose contact caused the feeling and confirms its construction by leading me to move my hand over the body if one born blind handles a cubical body the sensations of his hand are quite uniform on all sides and in all directions  only the corners press upon a smaller part of his skin in these sensations as such there is nothing whatever analogous to a cube but from the felt resistance his understanding infers immediately and intuitively a cause thereof which now presents itself as a solid body and from the movements of exploration which the arms made whilst the feelings of the hands remained constant he constructs in the space known to him a priori the bodys cubical shape did he not bring with him readymade the idea of a cause and of a space with the laws thereof there never could arise out of those successive feelings in his hand the image of a cube if we let a string run through our closed hand we immediately construct as the cause of the friction and its duration in such an attitude of the hand a long cylindrical body moving uniformly in one direction but never out of the pure sensation in the hand could the idea of movement that is of change of position in space by means of time arise such a content can never lie in sensation nor come out of it our intellect antecedently to all experience must bear in itself the intuitions of space and time and therewithal of the possibility of motion and no less the idea of causality to pass from the empirically given feeling to its cause and to construct the latter as a so moving body of the designated shape for how great is the abyss between the mere sensation in the hand and the ideas of causality materiality and movement through space occurring in time the feeling in the hand even with different contacts and positions is something far too uniform and poor in content for it to be possible to construct out of it the idea of space with its three dimensions of the action of bodies on each other with the properties of extension impenetrability cohesion shape hardness softness rest and motion  in short the foundations of the objective world this is only possible through space time and causalitybeing preformed in the intellect itself from whence it again follows that the perception of the external world is essentially an intellectual process a work of the understanding to which sensation furnishes merely the occasion and the data to be interpreted in each particular case 128

i call this view mythological because i am conscious of no such kantian machineshop in my mind and feel no call to disparage the powers of poor sensation in this merciless way i have no introspective experience of mentally producing or creating space my spaceintuitions occur not in two times but in one there is not one moment of passive inextensive sensation succeeded by another of active extensive perception but the form i see is as immediately felt as the color which fins it out that the higher parts of the mind come in who can deny  they add and subtract they compare and measure they reproduce and abstract they inweave the spacesensations with intellectual relations but these relations are the same when they obtain between the elements of the spacesystem as when they obtain between any of the other elements of which the world is made

the essence of the kantian contention is that there are not spaces but space  one infinite continuous unit  and that our knowledge of this cannot be a piecemeal sensational affair produced by summation and abstraction to which the obvious reply is that if any known thing bears on its front the appearance of piecemeal construction and abstraction it is this very notion of the infinite unitary space of the world it is a notion if ever there was one and no intuition most of us apprehend it in the barest symbolic abridgment and if perchance we ever do try to make it more adequate we just add one image of sensible extension to another until we are tired most of us are obliged to turn round and drop the thought of the space in front of us when we think of that behind and the space represented as near to us seems more minutely subdivisible than that we think of as lying far away

the other prominent german writers on space are also psychical stimulists herbert whose influence has been widest says the resting eye sees no space 129 and ascribes visual extension to the influence of movements combining with the nonspatial retinal feelings so as to form graduated series of the latter a given sensation of such a series reproduces the idea of its associates in regular order and its idea is similarly reproduced by any one of them with the order reversed out of the fusion of these two contrasted reproductions comes the form of space 130  heaven knows how

the obvious objection is that mere serial order is a genus and spaceorder a very peculiar species of that genus and that if the terms of reversible series became by that fact coexistent terms in space the musical scale the degrees of warmth and cold and all other ideally graded series ought to appear to us in the shape of extended corporeal aggregates  which they notoriously do not though we may of course symbolize their order by a spatial scheme w volkmann von volkmar the herbartian takes the bull here by the horns and says the musical scale is spatially extended though he admits that its space does not belong to the real world 131 i am unacquainted with any other herbartian so bold

to lotze we owe the muchused term local sign he insisted that space could not emigrate directly into the mind from without but must be reconstructed by the soul and he seemed to think that the first reconstructions of it by the soul must be supersensational but why sensations themselves might not be the souls original spatial reconstructive acts lotze fails to explain

wundt has all his life devoted himself to the elaboration of a spacetheory of which the neatest and most final expression is to be found in his logik ii 45760 he says

in the eye spaceperception has certain constant peculiarities which prove that no single optical sensation by itself possesses the extensive form but that everywhere in our perception of space heterogene ous feelings combine if we simply suppose that luminous sensations per se feel extensive our supposition is shattered by that influence of movement in vision which is so clearly to be traced in many normal errors in the measurement of the field of view if we assume on the other hand that the movements and their feelings are alone possessed of the extensive quality we make an unjustified hypothesis for the phenomena compel us it is true to accord an influence to movement but give us no right to call the retinal sensations indifferent for there are no visual ideas without retinal sensations if then we wish rigorously to express the given facts we can ascribe a spatial constitution only to combinations of retinal sensations with those of movement

thus wundt dividing theories into nativistic and genetic calls his own a genetic theory to distinguish it from other theories of the same class he names it a theory of complex local signs

it supposes two systems of local signs whose relations  taking the eye as an example  we may think as the measuring of the manifold localsign system of the retina by the simple localsign system of the movements in its psychological nature this is a process of associative synthesis it consists in the fusion of both groups of sensations into a product whose elementary components are no longer separable from each other in idea in melting wholly away into the product which they create they become consciously undistinguishable and the mind apprehends only their resultant the intuition of space thus there obtains a certain analogy between this psychic synthesis and that chemical synthesis which out of simple bodies generates a compound that appears to our immediate perception as a homogeneous whole with new properties

now let no modest reader think that if this sounds obscure to him it is because he does not know the full context and that if a wise professor like wundt can talk so fluently and plausibly about combination and psychic synthesis it must surely be because those words convey a so much greater fulness of positive meaning to the scholarly than to the unlearned mind really it is quite the reverse all the virtue of the phrase lies in its mere sound and skin learning does but make one the more sensible of its inward unintelligibility wundts theory is the flimsiest thing in the world it starts by an untrue assumption and then corrects it by an unmeaning phrase retinal sensations are spatial and were they not no amount of synthesis with equally spaceless motor sensations could intelligibly make them so wundts theory is in short but an avowal of impotence and an appeal to the inscrutable powers of the soul 132 it confesses that we cannot analyse the constitution or give the genesis of the spatial quality in consciousness but at the same time it says the antecedents thereof are psychical and not cerebral facts in calling the quality in question a sensational quality our own account equally disclaimed ability to analyse it but said its antecedents were cerebral not psychical  in other words that it was a first psychical thing this is merely a question of probable fact which the reader may decide

and now what shall be said of helmholtz can i find fault with a book which on the whole i imagine to be one of the four or five greatest monuments of human genius in the scientific line if truth impels i must fain try and take the risks it seems to me that helmholtzs genius moves most securely when it keeps close to particular facts at any rate it shows least strong in purely speculative passages which in the optics in spite of many beauties seem to me fundamentally vacillating and obscure the empiristic view which helmholtz defends is that the spacedeterminations we perceive are in every case products of a process of unconscious inference 133 the inference is similar to one from induction or analogy 134 we always see that form before us which habitually would have caused the sensation we now have 135 but the latter sensation can never be intrinsically spatial or its intrinsic spacedeterminations would never be overcome as they are so often by the illusory spacedeterminations it so often suggests 136 since the illusory determination can be traced to a suggestion of experience the real one must also be such a suggestion so that all space intuitions are due sole ly to experience 137 the only psychic activity required for this is the association of ideas 138

but how it may be asked can association produce a spacequality not in the things associated how can we by induction or analogy infer what we do not already generically know  can suggestions of experience reproduce elements which no particular experience originally contained this is the point by which helmholtzs empiristic theory as a theory must he judged no theory is worthy of the name which leaves such a point obscure

well helmholtz does so leave it at one time he seems to fall back on inscrutable powers of the soul and to range himself with the psychical stimulists he speaks of gent as having made the essential step in the matter in distinguishing the content of experience from that form  space course  which is given it by the peculiar faculties of the mind 139 but elsewhere again 140 speaking of sensationalistic theories which would connect spatially determinate feelings directly with certain neural events he says it is better to assume only such simple psychic activities as we know to exist and gives the association of ideas as an instance of what he means later 141 he reinforces this remark by confessing that he does not see how any neural process can give rise without antecedent experience to a readymade fertige perception of space and finally in a single momentous sentence he speaks of sensations of touch as if they might be the original material of our spacepercepts  which thus from the optical point of view may be assumed as given 142

of course the eyeman has a right to fall back on the skinman for help at a pinch but doesnt this means that he is a mere eyeman and not a complete psychologist  in other words helmholtzs optics and the empiristic theory there professed are not to be understood as attempts at answering the general question of how spaceconsciousness enters the mind they simply deny that it enters with the first optical sensations 143 our own account has affirmed stoutly that it enters then but no more than helmholtz have we pretended to show why who calls a thing a first sensation admits he has no theory of its production helmholtz though all the while without an articulate theory makes the world thing he has one he beautifully traces the immense part which reproductive processes play in our vision of space and never  except in that one pitiful little sentence about touch  does he tell us just what it is they reproduce he limits himself to denying that they reproduce originals of a visual sort and so difficult is the subject and so magically do catchwords work on the popularscientist ear that most likely had he written physiological instead of nativistic and spiritualistic instead of empiristic which synonyms hering suggests numbers of his present empirical evolutionary followers would fail to find in his teaching anything worthy of praise but since he wrote otherwise they hurrah for him as a sort of second locke dealing another deathblow at the old bugaboo of innate ideas his nativistic adversary hering they probably imagine  heaven save the mark   to be a scholastic in modern disguise

after wundt and helmholtz the most important antisensationalist spacephilosopher in germany is professor lipps whose deduction of space from an order of nonspatial differences continuous yet separate is a wonderful piece of subtlety and logic and yet he has to confess that continuous differences form in the first instance only a logical series which need not appear spatial and that whenever it does so appear this must be accounted a fact due merely to the nature of the soul 144

lipps and almost all the antisensationalist theorists except helmholtz seem guilty of that confusion which mr shadworth hodgson has done so much to clear away viz the confounding the analysis of an idea with the means of its production lipps for example finds that every space we think of can be broken up into positions and concludes that in some undefined way the several positions must have preexisted in thought before the aggregate space could have appeared to perception similarly mr spencer defining extension as an aggregate of relations of coexistent position says every cognition of magnitude is a cognition of relations of position 145 and no idea of extension can arise from the simultaneous excitation of many nerves unless there is a knowledge of their relative positions 146 just so prof bain insists that the very meaning of space is scope for movement 147 and that therefore distance and magnitude can be no original attributes of the eyes sensibility similarly because movement is analyzable into positions occupied at successive moments by the mover philosophers eg schopenhauer as quoted above have repeatedly denied the possibility of its being an immediate sensation we have however seen that it is the most immediate of all our spacesensations because it can only occur in a definite direction the impossibility of perceiving it without perceiving its direction has been decreed  a decree which the simplest experiment overthrows 148 it is a case of what i have called the psychologists fallacy mere acquaintance with space is treated as tantamount to every sort of knowledge about it the conditions of the latter are demanded of the former state of mind and all sorts of mythological processes are brought in to help 149 as well might one say that because the world consists of all its parts there fore we can only apprehend it at all by having unconsciously summed these up in our head it is the old idea of our actual knowledge being drawn out from a preexistent potentiality an idea which whatever worth it may metaphysically possess does no good in psychology

my own sensationalistic account has derived most aid and comfort from the writings of hering a w volkmann stumpf leconte and schön all these authors allow ample scope to that experience which berkeleys genius saw to be a present factor in all our visual acts but they give experience some grist to grind which the soidistant empiristic school forgets to do stumpf seems to me the most philosophical and profound of all these writers and i owe him much i should doubtless have owed almost as much to mr james ward had his article on psychology in the encyclopædia britannica appeared before my own thoughts were written down the literature of the question is in all languages very voluminous i content myself with referring to the bibliography in helmholtzs and auberts works on physiological optics for the visual part of the subject and with naming in a note the ablest works in the english tongue which have treated of the subject in a general way 150

11 that the sensation in question is one of tactile rather than of acoustic sensibility would seem proved by the fact that a medical friend of the writer both of whose membranæ tympani are quite normal but one of whose ears is almost totally deaf feels the presence and withdrawal of objects as well at one ear as at the other

12 the skin seems to obey a different law from the eye here if a given retinal tract be excited first by a series of points and next by the two extreme points with the interval between them unexcited this interval will seem considerably less in the second case than it seemed in the first in the skin the unexcited interval feels the larger the reader may easily verify the facts in this case by taking a visitingcard cutting one edge of it into a sawtooth pattern and from the opposite edge cutting out all but the two corners and then comparing the feelings aroused by the two edges when held against the skin

14 it is worth while at this point to call attention with some emphasis to the fact that though the anatomical condition of the feeling resembles the feeling itself such resemblance cannot be taken by our understanding to explain why the feeling should be just whet it is we hear it untiringly reiterated by materialists and spiritualists alike that we can see no possible inward reason why a certain brainprocess should produce the feeling of redness and another of anger the one process is no more red than the other is angry and the coupling of process and feeling is as far as other understanding goes a juxtaposition pure and simple but in the matter of spatial feeling where the retinal patch that produces a triangle in the mind is itself a triangle etc it looks at first sight as if the sensation might be a direct cognition of its own neural condition were this true however our sensation should be one of multitude rather than of continuous extent for the condition is number of optical nervetermini and even this is only a remote condition and not an immediate condition the immediate condition of the feeling is not the process in the retina but the process in the brain and the process in the brain may for aught we know be as unlike a triangle  nay it probably is so  as it is unlike redness or rage it is simply a coincidence that in the case of space one of the organic conditions viz the triangle impressed on the skin or the retina should lend to a representation in the mind of the subject observed similar to that which it produces in the psychological observer in no other kind of case is the coincidence found even should we admit that we cognize triangles in space because of our immediate cognition of the triangular shape of our excited group of nervetips the matter would hardly be more transparent for the mystery would still remain why are we so much better cognizant of triangles on our fingertips than on the nervetips of our back on our eye than on our ear and on any of these parts than in our brain thos brown very rightly rejects the notion of explaining the shape of the space perceived by the shape of the nervous expansion affected  if this alone were necessary we should have square inches and half inches and various other forms rectilinear and curvilinear of fragrance and sound lectures xxii

16 the whole science of geometry may be said to owe its being to the exorbitant interest which the human mind takes in lines we cut space up in every direction in order to manufacture them

17 kant was i believe the first to call attention to this last order of facts after pointing out that two opposite spherical triangles two gloves of a pair two spirals wound in contrary directions have identical inward determinations that is have their parts defined with relation to each other by the same law and so must be conceived as identical he showed that the impossibility of their mutual superposition obliges us to assign to each figure of a symmetrical pair a peculiar difference of its own which can only consist in an outward determination or relation of its parts no longer to each other but to the whole of an objectively outlying space with its points of tire compass given absolutely this inconceivable difference is perceived only through the relation to right and left which is a matter of immediate intuition in these last words welches unmittelbar auf anschauung geht  prolegomena § 12 kant expresses all that we have meant by speaking of up and down right and left as sensations he is wrong however in invoking relation to extrinsic total space as essential to the existence of these contrasts in figures relation to our own body is enough

18 in the eyes of many it will have seemed strange to call a relation a mere line and a line a mere sensation we may easily learn a great deal about any relation say that between two points we may divide the line which joins these and distinguish it and classify it and find out its relations by drawing or representing new lines and so on but all this further industry has naught to do with our acquaintance with the relation itself in its first intention so cognized the relation is the line and nothing more it would indeed be fair to call it something less and in fact it is easy to understand how most of us come to feel as if the line were a much grosser thing than the relation the line is broad or narrow blue or red made by this object or by that alternately in the course of our experience it is therefore independent of any one of these accidents and so from viewing it as no one of such sensible qualities we may end by thinking of it as something which cannot be defined except as the negation of all sensible quality whatever and which needs to be put into the sensations by a mysterious act of relating thought

another reason why we get to feel as if a spacerelation must be something other than the mere feeling of a line or angle is that between two positions we can potentially make any number of lines and angles or and to suit our purposes endlessly numerous relations the sense of this indefinite potentiality cleaves to our words when we speak in a general way of relations of place and misleads us into supposing that not even any single one of them can be exhaustively equated by a single angle or a single line

24 maybe the localization of intracranial pain is itself due to such association as this of local signs with each other rather than to their qualitative similarity in neighboring parts supra p 19 though it is conceivable that association and similarity itself should here have one and the same neural basis if we suppose the sensory nerves from those parts of the body beneath any patch of skin to terminate in the same sensorial braintract as those from the skin itself and if the excitement of any one fibre tends to irradiate through the whole of that tract the feelings of all fibres going to that tract world presumably both have a similar intrinsic quality and at the same time tend each to arouse the other since the same nervetrunk in most cases supplies the skin and the parts beneath the anatomical hypothesis presents nothing improbable

25 unless indeed the foot happen to be spontaneously tingling or something of the sort at the moment the whole surface of the body is always in a state of semiconscious irritation which needs only the emphasis of attention or of some accidental inward irritation to become strong at any point

26 it is true that the inside of the forearm though its discriminative sensibility is often less than that of the outside usually rises very prominently into consciousness when the latter is touched its æsthetic sensibility to contact is a good deal finer we enjoy stroking it from the extensor to the flexor surface around the ulnar side more than in the reverse direction pronating movements give rise to contacts in this order and are frequently indulged in when the back of the forearm feels an object against it

27 these facts were first noticed by wundt see his beiträge p 140 208 see also lamansky pflügers archiv xi 418

28 so far all has been plain sailing but our course begins to be so tortuous when we descend into minuter detail that i will treat of the more precise determination of locality in a long note when p recalls an ideal line leading to the fovea the line is felt in its entirety and but vaguely whilst p which we supposed to be a single star of actual light stands out in strong distinction from it the ground of the distinction between p and the ideal line which it terminates is manifest p being vivid while the line is faint but why should p hold the particular position it does at the end of the line rather than anywhere else  for example in its middle that seems something not at all manifest

to clear up our thoughts about this latter mystery let us take the case of an actual line of light none of whose parts is ideal the feeling of the line is produced as we know when a multitude of retinal points are excited together each of which when excited separately would give rise to one of the feelings called local signs each of these signs is the feeling of a small space from their simultaneous arousal we might well suppose a feeling of larger space to result but why is it necessary that in this larger spaciousness the sign a should appear always at one end of the line z at the other and m in the middle for though the line be a unitary streak of light its several constituent points can nevertheless break out from it and become alive each for itself under the selective eye of attention

the uncritical render giving his first careless glance at the subject will say that there is no mystery in this and that of course local signs must appear alongside of each other each in its own place  there is no other way possible but the more philosophic student whose business it is to discover difficulties quite as much as to get rid of them will reflect that it is conceivable that the partial factors might fuse into a larger space and yet not each be located within it any more than a voice is located in a chorus he will wonder how after combining into the line the points can become severally alive again the separate puffs of a sirene no longer strike the ear after they have fused into a certain pitch of sound he will recall the fact that when after looking at things with one eye closed we double by opening the other eye the number of retinal points affected the new retinal sensations do not as a rule appear alongside of the old ones and additional to them but merely make the old ones seem larger and nearer why should the affection of new points on the same retina have so different a result in fact we will see no sort of logical connection between l the original separate local signs 2 the line as a unit 3 the line with the points discriminated in it and 4 the various nerveprocesses which subserve all these different things we will suspect our local sign of being a very slippery and ambiguous sort of creature positionless at first it no sooner appears in the midst of a gang of companions than it is found maintaining the strictest position of its own and assigning place to each of its associates how is this possible must we accept what we rejected a while ago as absurd and admit the points each to have position in se or must we suspect that our whole construction has been fallacious and that we have tried to conjure up out of association qualities which the associates never contained

there is no doubt a real difficulty here and the shortest way of dealing with it would be to confess it insoluble and ultimate even if position be not an intrinsic character of any one of those sensations we have called local signs we must still admit that there is something about every one of them that stands for the potentiality of position and is the ground why the local sign when it gets placed at all gets placed here rather than there if this something be interpreted as a physiological something as a mere nerve process it is easy to say in a blank way that when it is excited alone it is an ultimate fact l that a positionless spot will appear that when it is excited together with other similar processes but without the process of discriminative attention it is another ultimate fact 2 that a unitary line will come and that the final ultimate fact 3 is that when the nerveprocess is excited in combination with that other process which subserves the feeling of attention what results will be the line with the local sign inside of it determined to a particular place thus we should escape the responsibility of explaining by falling back on the everlasting inscrutability of the psycheneural nexus the moment we call the ground of localization physiological we need only point out how in those cases in which localization occurs the physiological process differs from those in which it does not to have done all we can possibly do in the matter this would be unexceptionable logic and with it we might let the matter drop satisfied that there was no selfcontradiction in it but only the universal psychological puzzle of how a new mode of consciousness emerges whenever a fundamentally new mode of nervous action occurs

but blameless as such tactics would logically be on our part let us see whether we cannot push our theoretic insight a little farther it seems to me we can we cannot it is true give a reason why the line we feel when process 2 awakens should have its own peculiar shape nor can we explain the essence of the process of discriminative attention but we can see why if the brute facts be admitted that a line may have one of its parts singled out by attention at all and that that part may appear in relation to other parts at all the relation must be in the line itself  for the line and the parts are the only things supposed to be in consciousness and we can furthermore suggest a reason why parts appearing thus in relation to each other in a line should fall into an immutable order and each within that order keep its characteristic place

if a lot of such local signs all have any quality which evenly augments as we pass from one to the other we can arrange them in an ideal serial order in which any one local sign must lie below those with more above those with less of the quality in question it must divide the series into two parts  unless indeed it have a maximum or minimum of the quality when it either begins or ends it

such an ideal series of local signs in the mind is however not yet identical with the feeling of a line in space touch a dozen points on the skin successively and there seems no necessary reason why the notion of a definite line should emerge even though we be strongly aware of a gradation of quality among the touches we may of course symbolically arrange then in a line in our thought but we can always distinguish between a line symbolically thought and a line directly felt

but note now the peculiarity of the nerveprocesses of all these local signs though they may give no line when excited successively when excited together they do give the actual sensation of a line in space the sum of them is the neural process of that line the sum of their feelings is the feeling of that line and if we begin to single out particular points from the line and notice them by their rank it is impossible to see how this rank can appear except as an actual fixed spaceposition sensibly felt as a bit of the total line the scale itself appearing as a line rank in it must appear as a definite part of the line if the seven notes of an octave when heard together appeared to the sense of hearing as an outspread line of sound  which it is needless to say they do not  why then no one note could be discriminated without being localized according to its pitch in the line either as one of its extremities or as some part between

but not alone the gradation of their quality arranges the localsign feelings in a scale our movements arrange them also in a timescale whenever a stimulus passes from point a of the skin or retina to points it awakens the localsign feelings in the perfectly definite timeorder abcdef it cannot excite f until cde have been successively aroused the feeling c sometimes is preceded by ab sometimes followed by ba according to the movements direction the result of it being that we never feel either a c or f without there clinging to it faint reverberations of the various timeorders of transition in which throughout past experience it has been aroused to the local sign n there clings the tinge or tone the penumbra or fringe of the transition bcd to f to c there cling quite different tones once admit the principle that a feeling may be tinged by the reproductive consciousness of an habitual transition even when the transition is not made and it seems entirely natural to admit that if the transition be habitually in the order abcdef and if a c and f be felt separately at all a will be felt with an essential earliness f with an essential lateness and that c will fall between thus those psychologists who set little stores by local signs and great store by movements in explaining spaceperception would have a perfectly definite timeorder due to motion by which to account for time definite order of positions that appears when sensitive spots are excited all at once without however the preliminary admission of the ultimate fact that this collective excitement shall feel like a line and nothing else it can never be explained why the new order should needs be an order of positions and not of merely ideal serial rank we shall hereafter have any amount of opportunity to observe bow thoroughgoing is the participation of motion in all our spatial measurements whether the local signs have their respective qualities evenly graduated or not the feelings of transition must be set down as among the veræ causæ in localization but the gradation of the local signs is hardly to be doubted so we may believe ourselves really to possess two sets of reasons for localizing any point we may happen to distinguish from out the midst of any line or any larger space

29 m binet revue philosophique sept 1880 page 291 says we judge them locally different as soon as their sensations differ enough for us to distinguish them as qualitatively different when successively excited this is not strictly true skinsensations different enough to be discriminated when successive may still fuse locally if excited both at once

30 it may however be said that even in the tongue there is a determination of bitter flavors to the back and of acids to the front edge of the organ spices likewise affect its sides and front and a taste like that of slum localizes itself by its styptic effect on the portion of mucous membrane which it immediately touches more sharply than roast pork for example which stimulates all parts alike the pork therefore tastes more spacious than the alum or the pepper in the nose too certain smells of which vinegar may be taken as the type seem less spatially extended than heavy suffocating odors like musk the reason of this appears to be that the former inhibit inspiration by their sharpness whilst the fatter are drawn into the lungs and thus excite an objectively larger surface the ascription of height and depth to certain notes seems due not to any localization of the sounds but to the fact that a feeling of vibration in the chest and tension in the gullet accompanies the singing of a bass note whilst when we sing high the palatine mucous membrane is drawn upon by the muscles which move the larynx and awakens a feeling in the roof of the mouth

the only real objection to the law of partial stimulation laid down in the text is one that might be drawn from the organ of hearing for according to modern theories the cochlea may have its separate nervetermini exclusively excited by sounds of differing pitch and yet the sounds seem all to fin a common space and not necessarily to be arranged alongside of each other at most the high note is felt as a thinner brighter streak against a darker background in an article on space published in the journal of speculative philosophy for january 1879 i ventured to suggest that possibly tile auditory nervetermini might be excited all at once by sounds of any pitch as the whole retina would be by every luminous point if there were no dioptric apparatus affixed and i added  notwithstanding the brilliant conjectures of the last few years which assign different acoustic endorgans to different rates of airwave we are still greatly in the dark about the subject and i for my part would much more confidently reject a theory of hearing which violated the principles advanced in this article than give up those principles for the sake of any hypothesis hitherto published about either organs of corti or basilar membrane professor rutherfords theory of hearing advanced at the meeting of the british association for 1886 already furnishes an alternative view which would make hearing present no exception to the spacetheory i defend and which whether destined to be proved true or false ought at any rate to make us feel that the helmholtzian theory is probably not the last word in the physiology of hearing stepano ff hermann und schwalbes jahresbericht xv 404 literature 1886 reports a case in which more than the upper half of one cochlea was lost without any such deafness to deep notes on that side as helmholtzs theory would require

32 i tried on nine or ten people making numerous observations on each what difference it made in the discrimination of two points to have them alike or unlike the points chosen were 1 two large needleheads 2 two screwheads and 3 a needlehead and a screwhead the distance of the screwheads was measured from their centres i found that when the points gave diverse qualities of feeling as in 3 this facilitated the discrimination but much less strongly than i expected the difference in fact would often not be perceptible twenty times running when however one of the points was endowed with a rotary movement the other remaining still the doubleness of the points became much more evident than before to observe this i took an ordinary pair of compasses with one point blunt and the movable leg replaced by a metallic rod which could at any moment be made to rotate in situ by a dentists drillingmachine to which it was attached the compass had then its points applied to the skin at such a distance apart as to be felt as one impression suddenly rotating the drilling apparatus then almost always made them seem as two

40 m ch dunan in his forcibly written essay lespace visuel et lespace tactile in the revue philosophique for 1888 endeavors to prove that surfaces alone give no perception of extent by citing the way in which the blind go to work to gain an idea of an objects shape if surfaces were the percipient organ he says both the seeing and the blind ought to gain an exact idea of the size and shape of an object by merely laying their hand flat upon it provided of course that it were smaller than the hand and this because of their direct appreciation of the amount of tactile surface affected and with no recourse to the muscular sense but the fact is that a person born blind never proceeds in this way to measure objective surfaces the only means which he has of getting at the size of a body is that of running his anger along the lines by which it is bounded for instance if you put into the hands of one born blind a book whose dimensions are unknown to him he will begin by resting it against his chest so as to hold it horizontal then bringing his two hands together in the middle of the edge opposite to the one against his body he will draw them asunder tin they reach the ends of the edge in question and then and not tin then will he be able to say what the length of the object is  vol xxv p 148 i think that anyone who will try to appreciate the size and shape of an object by simply lying his hand flat upon it will find that the great obstacle is that he feels the contours so imperfectly the moment however the hands move the contours are emphatically and distinctly felt all perception of shape and size is perception of contours and ant of all these must be made sharp motion does this  and the impulse to move our organs in perception is primarily due to the craving which we feel to get our surfacesensations sharp when it comes to the naming and measuring of objects in terms of some common standard we shall see presently how movements help also but no more in this case than the other do they help because the quality of extension itself is contributed by the muscular sense

41 fechner describes psychophysik i 132 a method of equivalents for measuring tile sensibility of the skin two compasses are used one on the part a another on the part r of the surface the points on b must be adjusted so that their distance apart appears equal to that between the points on a with the place a constant the second pair of points must be varied a great deal for every change in the place b though for the same a and b the relation of the two compasses is remarkably constant and continues unaltered for months provided but few experiments are made on each day if however we practise daily their difference grows less in accordance with the law given in the text

42 prof jastrow gives as the result of his experiments this general conclusion am journal of psychology iii 53 the spaceperceptions of disparate senses are themselves disparate and whatever harmony there is amongst them we are warranted in regarding as the result of experience the spacial notions of one deprived of the sense of sight and reduced to the use of the other spacesenses must indeed be different from our own but he continues the existence of the striking disparities between our visual and our other spaceperceptions without confusing us and indeed without usually being noticed can only be explained by the tendency to interpret all dimensions into their visual equivalents but this author gives no reasons for saying visual rather than tactile and i must continue to think that probabilities point the other way so far as what we call real magnitudes are concerned

47 when for example a baby looks at its own moving hand it sees one object at the same time that it feels another both interest its attention and it locates them together but the felt objects size is the more constant size just as the felt object is on the whole the more interesting and important object and so the retinal sensations become regarded as its signs and have their real space values interpreted in tangible terms

48 the incoherence of the different primordial sensespaces inter se is often made a pretext for denying to the primitive bodily feelings any spatial quality at all nothing is commoner than to hear it said  babies have originally no spatial perception for when a babys toe aches he does not place the pain in the toe he makes no definite movements of defence and may be vaccinated without being held the facts are true enough but the interpretation is all wrong what really happens is that the baby does not place his toe in the pain for he knows nothing of his toe as yet he has not attended to it as a visual object he has not handled it with his fingers nor have its normal organic sensations or contacts yet become interesting enough to be discriminated from the whole massive feeling of the foot or even of the leg to which it belongs in short the toe is neither a member of the babes optical space of his handmovement space nor an independent member of his legandfoot space it has actually no mental existence yet save as this little painspace what wonder then if the pains seems a little spaceworld all by itself but let the pain once associate itself with these other spaceworlds and its space will become part of their space let the baby feel the nurse stroking the limb and awakening the pain every time her finger on the toe every time the pain shoots up let him handle his foot himself and get the whenever the toe comes into his fingers or his mouth let moving the leg exacerbate the pain  and all is changed the space of the pain becomes identified with that part of each of the other spaces which gets felt when it awakens and by their identity with it these parts are identified with each other and grow systematically connected as members of a larger extensive whole

56 i have said hardly anything about associations with visual space in the foregoing account because i wished to represent a process which the blind and the seeing man might equally share it is to be noticed that the space suggested to the imagination when the joint moves and projected to the distance of the fingertip is not represented as any specific skintract what the seeing men imagines is a visible path what the blind man imagines is rather a generic image an abstraction from many skin spaces whose local signs have neutralized each other and left nothing but their common vastness behind we shall see as we go on that this generic abstraction of spacemagnitude from the various local peculiarities of feeling which accompanied it when it was for the first time felt occurs on a considerable scale in the acquired perceptions of blind as well as of seeing men

72 what may be the physiological process connected with this increased sensation of depth is hard to discover it seems to have nothing to do with the parts of the retina affected since the mere inversion of the picture by mirrors reflecting prisms etc without inverting the head does not seem to bring it about nothing with sympathetic axial rotation of the eyes which might enhance the perspective through exaggerated disparity of the two retinal images see j j müller raddrehung u tiefendimension leipzig acad berichte 1875 page 124 for oneeyed persons get it as strongly as those with two eyes i cannot find it to be connected with any alteration in the pupil or with any ascertainable strain in the muscles of the eye sympathizing with those of the body the exaggeration of distance is even greater when we throw the head over backwards and contract our superior recti in getting the view than when we bend forward and contract the inferior recti making the eyes diverge slightly by weak prismatic glasses has no such effect to me and to all whom i have asked to repeat the observation the result is so marked that i do not well understand how such au observer its helmboltz who has carefully examined vision with inverted head can have overlooked it see his phys optik pp 433 723 728 772 i cannot help thinking that anyone who can explain the exaggeration of the depthsensation in this case will at the same time throw much light on its normal constitution

77 before embarking on this new topic it will be well to shelve once for all the problem of what is the physiological process that underlies the distancefeeling since oneeyed people have it and are inferior to the twoeyed only in measuring its gradations it can have no exclusive connection with the double and disparate images produced by binocular parallax since people with closed eyes looking at an afterimage do not usually see it draw near or recede with varying convergence it cannot be simply constituted by the convergencefeeling for the same reason it would appear nonidentical with the feeling of accommodation the differences of apparent parallactic movement between far and near objects as we move our head cannot constitute the distancesensation for such differences may be easily reproduced experimentally in the movements of visible spots against a background without engendering any illusion of perspective finally it is obvious that visible faintness dimness and smallness are not per se the feeling of visible distance however much in the case of wellknown objects they may serve as signs to suggest it

a certain maximum distancevalue however being given to the field of view of the moment whatever it be the feelings that accompany the processes just enumerated become so many local signs of the gradation of distances within this maximum depth they help us to subdivide and measure it itself however is felt as a unit a total distancevalue determining the vastness of the whole field of view which accordingly appears as an abyss of a certain volume and the question still persists what neural process is it that underlies the sense of this distancevalue

hering who has tried to explain the gradations within it by the interaction of certain native distancevalues belonging to each point of the two retinæ seems willing to admit that the absolute scale of the spacevolume within which the natively fixed relative distances shall appear is not fixed but determined each time by experience in the widest sense of the word  beiträge p 344 what he calls the kernpunkt of this spacevolume is the point we are momentarily fixating the absolute scale of the whole volume depends on the absolute distance at which this kernpunkt is judged to be from the person of the looker by an alteration of the localization of the kernpunkt the inner relations of the seen space are nowise altered this space in its totality is as a fixed unit so to speak displaced with respect to the self of the looker p 345 but what constitutes the localization of the kernpunkt itself at any given time except experience ie higher cerebral and intellectual processes involving memory hering does not seek to define

stumpf the other sensationalist writer who has best realized the difficulties of the problem thinks that the primitive sensation of distance must have an immediate physical antecedent either in the shape of an organic alteration accompanying the process of accommodation or else given directly in the specific energy of the optic nerve in contrast with hering however he thinks that it is the absolute distance of the spot fixated which is thus primitively immediately and physiologically given and not the relative distances of other things about this spot these he thinks are originally seen in what broadly speaking may be termed one plane with it whether the distance of this plane considered as a phenomenon of our primitive sensibility be an invariable datum or susceptible of fluctuation he does not if i understand him rightly undertake dogmatically to decide but inclines to the former view for him then as for hering higher cerebral processes of association under the name of experience are the authors of fully onehalf part of the distanceperceptions which we at any given time must have

herings and stumpfs theories are reported for the english reader by mr sully in mind iii pp 1726 mr abbott in his sight and touch pp 968 gives a theory which is to me so obscure that i only refer the reader to its piece adding that it seems to make of distance a fixed fluctuation of retinal sensation as modified by focal adjustment besides these three authors i am ignorant of any except panum who may have attempted to define distance as in any degree an immediate sensation and with them the direct sensational share is reduced to a very small proportional part in our completed distancejudgments

professor lipps in his singularly acute psychologische studien p 69 ff argues as ferrier in his review of berkeley philosophical remains 11 330 ff had argued before him that it is logically impossible we should perceive the distance of anything from the eye by sight for a seen distance can only be between seen termini and one of the termini in the case of distance from the eye is the eye itself which is not seen similarly of the distance of two points behind each other the near one hides the far one no space is seen between them for the space between two objects to be seen both must appear beside each other then the space in question will be visible on no other condition is its visibility possible the conclusion is that things can properly be seen only in what lipps calls a surface and that our knowledge of the third dimension must needs be conceptual not sensational or visually intuitive

but no arguments in the world can prove a feeling which actually exists to be impossible the feeling of depth or distance of farness or awayness does actually exist as a fact of our visual sensibility all that professor lippss reasonings prove concerning it is that it is not linear in its character or in its immediacy fully homogeneous and consubstantial with the feeling of literal distance between two seen termini in short that there are two sorts of optical sensation each inexplicably due to a peculiar neural process the neural process is easily discovered in the case of lateral extension or spreadoutness to be the number of retinal nerveends affected by the light in the case of pretension or mere farness it is more complicated and as we have concluded is still to seek the two sensible qualities unite in the primitive visual bigness the measurement of their various amounts against each other obeys the general laws of all such measurements we discover their equivalencies by means of objects apply the same units to both and translate them into each other so habitually that at first they get to seem to us even quite similar in kind this final appearance of homogeneity may perhaps be facilitated by the fact that in binocular vision two points situated on the prolongation of the optical axis of one of the eyes so that the near one hides the far one are by the other eye seen laterally apart each eye has in fact a foreshortened lateral view of the others line of sight in the london times for feb 8 1884 is an interesting letter by j d dougal who tries to explain by this reason why twoeyed rifleshooting has such advantages over shooting with one eye closed

78 just so a pair of spectacles held an inch or so from the eyes seem like one large median glass the faculty of seeing stereoscopic slides single without an instrument is of the utmost utility to the student of physiological optics and persons with strong eyes can easily acquire it the only difficulty lies in dissociating the degree of accommodation from the degree of convergence which it usually accompanies if the right picture is focussed by the right eye the left by the left eye the optic axes must either be parallel or converge upon an imaginary point same distance behind the plane of the pictures according to tile size and distance apart of the pictures the accommodation however has to be made for the plane of the pictures itself and a near accommodation with a faroff convergence is something which the ordinary use of our eyes never teaches us to effect

79 these two observations prove the law of identical direction only for objects which excite the foveæ or lie in the line of direct looking observers skilled in indirect vision can however more or less easily verify the law for outlying retinal points

83 professor joseph le conte who believes strongly in the identitytheory has embodied the latter in r pair of laws of the relation between positions seen single and double near or far on the one hand and convergences and retinal impressions on the other which though complicated seems to me by far the best descriptive formulation yet made of the normal facts of vision his account is easily accessible to the reader in his volume sight in the international scientific series bk ii c 3 so i say no more about it now except that it does not solve any of the difficulties we are noting in the identitytheory nor account for the other fluctuating perceptions of which we go on to treat

96 bowditch and hall in journal of physiology vol iii p 299 helmholtz tries to explain this phenomenon by unconscious rotations of the eyeball but movements of the eyeball can only explain such appearances of movements as are the same over the whole field in the windowed board one part of the held seems to move in one way another part in another the same is true when we torn from the spiral to look at the wall  the centre of the field alone swells onto or contracts the margin does the reverse or remains at rest mach and dvorak have beautifully proved the impossibility of eyerotations in this case  sitzunger d wiener aksd bd ixr see also bowditch and halls paper as a above p 300

108 loeb pflügers archiv xl 274 has proved that muscular changes of adaptation in the eye for near and far distance are what determine the form of the relief

109 the strongest passage in helmholtzs argument against sensations of space is relative to these fluctuations of seen relief ought one not to conclude that if sensations of relief exist at all they must be so faint and vague as to have no influence compared with that of past experience ought we not to believe that the perception of the third dimension may have arisen without them since we now see it taking place as well against them as with them  physiol optik p 817

111 i ought to say that i seem always able to see the cross rectangular at will but this appears to come from an imperfect absorption of the rectangular afterimage by the inclined plane at which the eyes look the cross with me is apt to detach itself from this and then look square i get the illusion better from the circle whose afterimage becomes in various ways elliptical on being projected upon the different surfaces of the room and cannot then be easily made to look circular again

112 in chapter xviii p 74 i gave a reason why imaginations ought not to be as vivid as sensations it should be borne in mind that that reason does not apply to these complemental imaginings of the real shape of things actually before our eyes

115 wundt seeks to explain all these illusions by the relatively stronger feeling of innervation needed to move the eyeballs upwards a careful study of the muscles concerned is taken to prove this  and a consequently greater estimate of the distance traversed it suffices to remark however with lipps that were the innervation all a column of ss placed on top of each other should look each larger than the one below it and a weathercock on a steeple gigantic neither of which is the case only the halves of the same object look different in size because the customary correction for foreshortening bears only on the relations of the parts of special things spread out before us of wundt physiol psych 2te aufl ii 968 th lipps frundtatsschen etc p 535

116 hering would pertly solve in this way the mystery of figs 60 61 and 87 no doubt the explanation pertly applies but the strange cessation of the illusion when we fix the gaze fails to be accounted for thereby

117 helmholtz has sought physiol optik p 715 to explain the divergence of the apparent vertical meridians of the two retinæ by the manner in which an identical line drawn on the ground before us in the median plane will throw its images on the two eyes respectively the matter is too technical for description here the unlearned reader may be referred for it to j le contes sight in the internat scient series p 198 ff but for the benefit of those to whom verbatum sat i cannot help saying that it seems to me that the exactness of the relation of the two meridians  whether divergent or not for their divergence differs in individuals and often in one individuals at diverse times  precludes its being due to the mere habitual fallingoff of the image of one objective line on both le conte eg measures their position down to a sixth of a degree others to tenths this indicates an organic identity in the sensations of the two retinæ which the experience of median perspective horizontals may roughly have agreed with but hardly can have engendered wundt explains the divergence as usual by the innervationsgefühl op cit ii 99 ff

119 we can with a short ruler draw a line as long as we please on a plane surface by first drawing one as long as the ruler permits and then sliding the ruler somewhat along the drawn line and drawing again etc if the ruler is exactly straight we get in this way a straight line if it is somewhat curved we get a circle now instead of the sliding ruler we use in the field of sight the central spot of distinctest vision impressed with a linear sensation of sight which at times may be intensified tin it becomes an afterimage we follow in looking the direction of this line and in so doing we slide the line dong itself and get a prolongation of its length on a plane surface we can carry on this procedure on any sort of a straight or curved ruler but in the held of vision there is for each direction and movement of the eye only one sort of line which it is possible for us to slide along in its own direction continually these are what helmholtz calls the circles of direction on the visual held  lines which he has studied with his usual care cf physiol optik p 648 ff

121 this shrinkage and expansion of the absolute spacevalue of the optical sensation remains to my mind the most obscure part of the whole subject it is a real optical sensation seeming introspectively to have nothing to do with locomotor or other suggestions it is easy to say that the intellect produces it but what does that mean the investigator who will throw light on this one point will probably clear up other difficulties as well
