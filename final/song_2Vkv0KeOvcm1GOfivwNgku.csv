that now i cant tell the truth
and it ate me inside so one soft drunken night
i slept with a man you knew

and in the morning i walked home alone
and the businessmen saw my bones
with my skirt in their eyes they remembered the nights
when they were that man you knew

you told me once
you were happy to have me
but i never gave me away

theres the lie that i told to you

i would give you my heart i think
but its up in a branch of a tree
it was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
put my heart where i couldnt reach

i didnt mind i adored him so
we forgot and we left for home
and that was so long ago now the tree it has grown
and nobody knows my lover is buried underground
nobody knows my lover is buried underground
nobody knows my lover is buried underground
