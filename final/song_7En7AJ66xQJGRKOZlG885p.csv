right down santa claus lane
vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer
are pullin on the reins
bells are ringin children singin
all is merry and bright
hang your stockings and say your prayers
cause santa claus comes tonight
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
hes got a bag that is filled with toys
for boys and girls again
hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle what a beautiful sight
so jump in bed and cover your head
cause santa claus comes tonight tonight
santa claus comes tonight
happy days happy times
listen to the bells and shine
as santa clause comes your way today
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he doesnt care if youre rich or poor
for he loves you just the same
santa knows that were all gods children that makes everything right
so fill your hearts with christmas cheer
cause santa claus comes tonight tonight
santa clauss comes tonight stand bye
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
hell come around when the chimes ring out
then its christmas morn again
peace on earth will come to all
if we just follow the light
lets give thanks to the lord above
â€cause santa claus comes tonight
happy days happy times
listen to the bells and shine
