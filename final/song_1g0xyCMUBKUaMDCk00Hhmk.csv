forced from me your body leaves
fold to your knees
your body needs to embody me

decorated in your bed
every second that we had was newlywed

oh where’ve you been
all soaked marine in kerosine
stow your love with me
my body needs your body heat

decorated in your bed
every second that we had was newlywed
separated in your head
in every present that you had i was a wreck
oh im in agony your anatomy has gone
and the hold that you had of me didn’t have any at allsee novo amor liveget tickets as low as 45embed"
