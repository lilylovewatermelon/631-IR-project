dont know what im doin back in the studio
gettin greedy cause he said he had another sick flow
so i had to hollaback guess i didnt get enough
still feel the wonderland alice and the ticktock
if you gimme a clap im gonna give an encore
dont want it to end i wanna stank some more
im trippin on the best dream that i never had
i guess behind the orange curtain its not so bad
from the west side anaheim a small world after all
hangin at the hotel selling makeup at the mall
makin out to purple rain just like everybody else
dame un beso no stop im trying to save myself
ordinary common girl way back in the 714 days
trying to figure out what i wanna be
hangin in the garage me and nd
