been travelling these wide roads
for so long
my hearts been far from you
ten thousand miles gone

refrain
oh i wanna come near and give
every part of me
but theres blood on my hands
and my lips are unclean

verse 2
in my darkness i remember
mommas words reoccur to me
surrender to the good lord
and hell wipe your slate clean

chorus
take me to your river
i wanna go
oh go take me to your river
i wanna know

verse 3
dip me in your smooth water
as i go in
as a man with many crimes come up for air
as my sins flow down the jordan
