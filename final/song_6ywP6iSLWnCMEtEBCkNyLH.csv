verse 1
black dress white lies
loose friends and some cheap wine
ive always been so trusting my dear
a back room on your backside
im backstabbed as you backslide
your knees are always bruised and red dear

prechorus 1
ive never been the one to doubt
but i wonder wonder wonder
i wanna to hear it from the whore horses mouth

chorus 1
i caught you sleeping around
you had me fooled until now
its over were over and im done

verse 2
give em sex give me lies
i know the truth behind those eyes
you always pass the blame so well dear
save your tears
dont waste your breath
youve said it all
and theres nothing left
youre lying in the bed you made dear
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeprechorus 2
thanks for ending all my doubt
