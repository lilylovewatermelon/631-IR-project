when youre quiet but your eyes
are saying everything i need to know
i want to burrow like a sparrow
dodging alley cats and whiskers
why do we talk in whispers
is it painful hearing voices ring
so early in the morning

verse 2
ive been waiting for the day
when i can throw away these numbers
that line my dresser drawers and cupboards
start me over
life seems so much slower
with your toothbrush by the mirror
can i make it any clearer

chorus
and i just might say it tonight
i just might say it tonight
and i just might tell you tonight
that i love you
and you should stay all my life

verse 3
theyll tell you that youll maybe make it
if you just cut your clothes and change your hair
but i wont fuss and moan
bout what you wear
i feel so much better
when i read your dirty letters
just wear your sweaters in the winter
you might also likeverse 4
cause i wouldnt want you to get cold
i hope that were together when were old
i would have sold all my possessions
never took piano lessons
but baby youre a grand
and i will learn to play the good notes
and tune you up the best i can

chorus
and i just might say it tonight
i just might say it tonight
i just might tell you tonight
that i love you
and you should stay all my life

and i just might say it tonight
i just might say it tonight
i just might tell you tonight
that i love you
and you should stay all my lifeembed"
