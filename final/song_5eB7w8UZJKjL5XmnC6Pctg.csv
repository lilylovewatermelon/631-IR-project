is it still me that makes you sweat
am i who you think about in bed
when the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
as youre sliding off your dress
then think of what you did
and how i hope to god he was worth it
when the lights are dim and your heart is racing
as your fingers touch his skin

verse 2
ive got more wit a better kiss a hotter touch a better fuck
than any boy youll ever meet sweetie you had me
girl i was it look past the sweat a better love deserving of
exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
no no no you know it will always just be me
