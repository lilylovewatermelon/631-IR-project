i only stopped just to look around
and as i walked along the thoroughfare
there was music playing everywhere

the music came from within my heart
how did it happen how did it start
i only know that i fell in love
i guess the answer lies up above

oh what a feeling
my heart was reeling
the bells were ringing
the birds were singing

and so the music keep goes on and on
and through the night until the break of dawn
i hear a bird up in the tree
i hear him sing this melody

and so he sings
yayayaya

oh what a feeling
my heart was reeling
the bells were ringing
the birds were singing

and through the night until the break of dawn
and every evening when the sun goes down
im with my love in my home town

and so i sing
yayayayaembed"
