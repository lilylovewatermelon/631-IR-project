i hold my anger in my stomach
and im starting to have side effects
from hating you this much
no explanation just a quote in a magazine
where you said you only dated me for fun
and im paraphrasing now
but the gist of it was how you never loved me
only in it for the sex
and i really dont get how
you can say that and be proud of it
we both know you were in deeper than that

chorus
nobody likes a secret
and i was always yours
its almost been a year
and even so
i still dont know what foryou might also likeembed"
