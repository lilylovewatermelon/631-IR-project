verse 1
crazy but thats how it goes
millions of people living as foes
maybe its not too late
to learn how to love and forget how to hate

prechorus
mental wounds not healing lifes a bitter shame

chorus
im going off the rails on a crazy train
im going off the rails on a crazy train
lets go

verse 2
ive listened to preachers ive listened to fools
ive watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
one person conditioned to rule and control
the media sells it and you live the role

prechorus
mental wounds still screaming driving me insane
