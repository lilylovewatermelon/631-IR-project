good lord that poor childs dress is in flitters underfed she looks too potatoes and marge marge and potatoes its after they feel it proof of the pudding undermines the constitution

as he set foot on oconnell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet brewery barge with export stout england sea air sours it i heard be interesting some day get a pass through hancock to see the brewery regular world in itself vats of porter wonderful rats get in too drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating dead drunk on the porter drink till they puke again like christians imagine drinking that rats vats well of course if we knew all the things

looking down he saw flapping strongly wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls gulls rough weather outside if i threw myself down reuben js son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage one and eightpence too much hhhhm its the droll way he comes out with the things knows how to tell a story too

they wheeled lower looking for grub wait

—two apples a penny two for a penny

his gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand australians they must be this time of year shiny peels polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief

wait those poor birds

he halted again and bought from the old applewoman two banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the liffey see that the gulls swooped silently two then all from their heights pouncing on prey gone every morsel

aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands they never expected that manna live on fish fishy flesh they have all seabirds gulls seagoose swans from anna liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves no accounting for tastes wonder what kind is swanmeat robinson crusoe had to live on them

they wheeled flapping weakly im not going to throw any more penny quite enough lot of thanks i get not even a caw they spread foot and mouth disease too if you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that eat pig like pig but then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty how is that

mrs breen nodded

—she was taken bad on the tuesday

mr bloom touched her funnybone gently warning her

—mind let this man pass

a bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head from his arm a folded dustcoat a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride

—watch him mr bloom said he always walks outside the lampposts watch

he watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts denis breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of harrisons hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs blown in from the bay like old times he suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly

meshuggah off his chump

nosey flynn pursed his lips

—he doesnt buy cream on the ads he picks up you can make bacon of that

—how so davy byrne asked coming from his book

nosey flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers he winked

—hes in the craft he said

—do you tell me so davy byrne said

—very much so nosey flynn said ancient free and accepted order hes an excellent brother light life and love by god they give him a leg up i was told that by a—well i wont say who

—o its a fine order nosey flynn said they stick to you when youre down i know a fellow was trying to get into it but theyre as close as damn it by god they did right to keep the women out of it

davy byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one

—iiiiiichaaaaaaach

—there was one woman nosey flynn said hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing but be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason that was one of the saint legers of doneraile

davy byrne sated after his yawn said with tearwashed eyes

—and is that a fact decent quiet man he is i often saw him in here and i never once saw him—you know over the line

—god almighty couldnt make him drunk nosey flynn said firmly slips off when the fun gets too hot didnt you see him look at his watch ah you werent there if you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe declare to god he does

—there are some like that davy byrne said hes a safe man id say

—hes not too bad nosey flynn said snuffling it up hes been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow give the devil his due o bloom has his good points but theres one thing hell never do

his hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog

—i know davy byrne said

—nothing in black and white nosey flynn said

paddy leonard and bantam lyons came in tom rochford followed frowning a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat

—day mr byrne

—well whatll it be paddy leonard asked

—ill take a stone ginger bantam lyons said

—how much paddy leonard cried since when for god sake whats yours tom

for answer tom rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped

—would i trouble you for a glass of fresh water mr byrne he said

—certainly sir

paddy leonard eyed his alemates

—lord love a duck he said look at what im standing drinks to cold water and gingerpop two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg he has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the gold cup a dead snip

—zinfandel is it nosey flynn asked

tom rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him

—that cursed dyspepsia he said before drinking

—breadsoda is very good davy byrne said

tom rochford nodded and drank

—is it zinfandel

—say nothing bantam lyons winked im going to plunge five bob on my own

—tell us if youre worth your salt and be damned to you paddy leonard said who gave it to you

mr bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting

the others turned

—thats the man now that gave it to me bantam lyons whispered

—prrwht paddy leonard said with scorn mr byrne sir well take two of your small jamesons after that and a

—stone ginger davy byrne added civilly

—ay paddy leonard said a suckingbottle for the baby

mr bloom walked towards dawson street his tongue brushing his teeth smooth something green it would have to be spinach say then with those rontgen rays searchlight you could

at duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest surfeit returned with thanks having fully digested the contents first sweet then savoury mr bloom coasted warily ruminants his second course their upper jaw they move wonder if tom rochford will do anything with that invention of his wasting time explaining it to flynns mouth lean people long mouths ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free course then youd have all the cranks pestering

he hummed prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars

bare clean closestools waiting in the window of william miller plumber turned back his thoughts they could and watch it all the way down swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes but the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show science

—a cenar teco

today today not think

tour the south then what about english wateringplaces brighton margate piers by moonlight her voice floating out those lovely seaside girls against john longs a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought gnawing a crusted knuckle handy man wants job small wages will eat anything

mr bloom turned at grays confectioners window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend thomas connellans bookstore why i left the church of rome birds nest women run him they say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews same bait why we left the church of rome

a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane no tram in sight wants to cross

—do you want to cross mr bloom asked

the blind stripling did not answer his wallface frowned weakly he moved his head uncertainly

—youre in dawson street mr bloom said molesworth street is opposite do you want to cross theres nothing in the way

the cane moved out trembling to the left mr blooms eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before dragos where i saw his brillantined hair just when i was horse drooping driver in john longs slaking his drouth

—theres a van there mr bloom said but its not moving ill see you across do you want to go to molesworth street

—yes the stripling answered south frederick street

—come mr bloom said

he touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward

say something to him better not do the condescending they mistrust what you tell them pass a common remark

—the rain kept off

no answer

stains on his coat slobbers his food i suppose tastes all different for him have to be spoonfed first like a childs hand his hand like millys was sensitive sizing me up i daresay from my hand wonder if he has a name van keep his cane clear of the horses legs tired drudge get his doze thats right clear behind a bull in front of a horse

—thanks sir

knows im a man voice

—right now first turn to the left

the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again

mr bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed poor young fellow how on earth did he know that van was there must have felt it see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume weight or size of it something blacker than the dark wonder would he feel it if something was removed feel a gap queer idea of dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones could he walk in a beeline if he hadnt that cane bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest

penrose that was that chaps name

look at all the things they can learn to do read with their fingers tune pianos or we are surprised they have any brains why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say of course the other senses are more embroider plait baskets people ought to help workbasket i could buy for mollys birthday hates sewing might take an objection dark men they call them

sense of smell must be stronger too smells on all sides bunched together each street different smell each person too then the spring the summer smells tastes they say you cant taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure

and with a woman for instance more shameless not seeing that girl passing the stewart institution head in the air look at me i have them all on must be strange not to see her kind of a form in his minds eye the voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves his hands on her hair for instance say it was black for instance good we call it black then passing over her white skin different feel perhaps feeling of white

postoffice must answer fag today send her a postal order two shillings half a crown accept my little present stationers just here too wait think over it

with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears again fibres of fine fine straw then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek downy hair there too not smooth enough the belly is the smoothest noone about there he goes into frederick street perhaps to levenstons dancing academy piano might be settling my braces

walking by dorans publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly but i know its whitey yellow want to try in the dark to see

he withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to
