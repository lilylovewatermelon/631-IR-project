verse 1
sometimes you gotta fight for your right when youre
not sure youre in a fight for your life right
if you aint packin any tactics you might get your ass kicked
even if you are a little knucklehead
im kinda sick of being aggravated
im glad im hated i guess im doin somethin right
thats what happened back in columbine
you gotta know when to stop and dont go over the top
cause theres a chamber deep inside the brain
thats covered with chains so dont be shakin em loose
and if ya do id be runnin for the hills
cause im ready to rock and now im playin for real

prechorus
i gotta fight fight
youd better watch out when my adrenaline kicks
i gotta fight fight
its too late you already been hit damn

verse 2
this world can make you stick to your stomach so i
put on my headphones listen to the deftones
its gettin crowded in my spaceship
livin in a dream runnin from a hate machine
ya know its such a drag when theres people talking down to ya
such a drag thinking everything sucks
do ya walk away with the spit on your face
or do ya draw the line just to give em a taste
cause i know its never gonna end
if it happens again im going straight for the throat
another note dont forget you had a chance
now im off of the side lines and ready to dance

prechorus
i gotta fight fight
youd better watch out when my adrenaline kicks
i gotta fight fight
its too late you already been hit damn
