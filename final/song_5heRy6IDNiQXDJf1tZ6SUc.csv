all our secrets they are tailored trouble
draped loose now around your hips
your spotless instincts are valid
we coexist
got 26 days to work with got 26 days
weve got 26 days to work with
it moves it moves it moves
well see what all gets done

prechorus
im an addict for dramatics
i confuse the two for love
you cant tell me that you dont beg

chorus
liar liar
if were keeping score
then were all choir boys at best
intrusive and arrogant
liar liar
if were keeping score
then were all choir boys at best
intrusive and arrogant

verse 2
got 26 days to work with got 26 days
then back on that island that you swear by
still barely can afford
its still a question of how long will this hold
well is it any different now that we are i said we are patient
oh dont you go there not here not now
it moves it moves it moves
not here not now
