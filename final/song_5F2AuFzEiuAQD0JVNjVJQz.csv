sometimes i dont really know myself
devil on my back pray for me need help
angel in the front tryna guide my steps

who do you call when you by yourself

verse
got a devil on my left and a angel on my right
im just tryna live my life im just hangin in the fight yuh
swingin off the web of life glidin through the breeze breeze
my uncle always told me that it never would be easy nah
now im lookin to the sky hoping that he rest in peace
violence in the streets i just wanna calm the beast
all these problems im just fightin with myself and enemies
looking for my peace while im looking for my peace while im
