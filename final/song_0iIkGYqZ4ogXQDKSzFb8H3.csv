remember when we waltzed in the rain
you know i am nobodys girl
just wasnt made for no diamonds or pearls

gasoline
it dont burn as fast as me
poor boy
maybe ill meet my maker on the bedroom floor

oh with my bloodshot eyes
youd rock me and youd roll me through the night
was only just then that i could see
as alone and feeling so lonely

gasoline
it dont burn as fast as me
poor boy
maybe ill meet my maker on the bedroom floor

time come to tell you the truth
tell you what you already knew
im a fool
im a fool
wrapped up in you
when the morning comes ill be gone

it dont burn as fast as me

maybe ill meet my maker on the bedroom floor
oh oh
maybe ill meet my maker on the bedroom floorembed"
