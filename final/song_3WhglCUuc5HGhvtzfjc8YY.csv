stayed up late patiently waitin
wishin you could call
dreamin of memories lost in time
knowin theyre all gone
so i take this bottle and drown my sorrows
and throw it against the wall
the higher you fly the harder you fall
til theres nothin left at all

verse 1
four in the mornin i cannot sleep
i am depressed sittin up in my bed
my demons are roarin theyre botherin me
im sittin here with a gun to my head
finger on trigger what if i squeeze
does that mean that my problems will leave
and get rid of whats botherin me
does that mean that im finally free
i think of my daughter i think of my wife
i think of my brothers i think of my life
cant leave em with bad news
my life is a crapshoot im just shakin the dice
had a dream last night had a dream last night
i could hear you say i could hear you say
son just be strong son just be strong
you gon be okay you gon be okay
tell the truth i dont feel that way
i still feel fucked up til this day
even when im high i just sit and cry
and i wonder why i still feel this pain
i wish heaven wasnt so far away
i wish i could visit just for a day
i still had so much left to say
bow our heads and let us pray
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
stayed up late patiently waitin
wishin you could call
dreamin of memories lost in time
knowin theyre all gone
so i take this bottle and drown my sorrows
and throw it against the wall
the higher you fly the harder you fall
til theres nothin left at all

verse 2
i feel like my past will allow me to grow
feel like this liquor is drownin my soul
why am i spiralin out of control
i cannot get myself out of this hole
i keep tryin i keep crawlin
the sound of silence i hear it callin
i was flyin now im fallin
my healths declinin im an alcoholic
theres no one else its just myself
alone in thought i stand and dwell
im the goto guy so who do i
go to when i need some help
no one gives a fuck about me im on my own
if misery loves company then why am i alone
i pour another drink just to get in my zone
i swear that ima change but i know that i wont
let me face the facts face the facts
wish i could take it back take it back
wish i could fade to black fade to black
wish i could change the past wish i could change the past
but in my mind i wish that i could rewind
press pause and live my life inside a moment of time
but i cant
chorus
stayed up late patiently waitin
wishin you could call
dreamin of memories lost in time
knowin theyre all gone
so i take this bottle and drown my sorrows
and throw it against the wall
the higher you fly the harder you fall
til theres nothin left at allembed"
