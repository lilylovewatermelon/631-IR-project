corys eyes are like a jungle
he smiles its like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
theres pretty girls on every corner
they watch him as hes walking home
saying does he know
will you ever know

chorus
youre beautiful every little piece love
dont you know youre really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh but if it dont
stay beautiful

verse 2
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
im taking pictures in my mind
so i can save em for a rainy day
its hard to make a conversation
when hes taking my breath away
i should say hey by the way

youre beautiful every little piece love
dont you know youre really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh but if it dont
stay beautiful
