verse 1
we dug these holes we crawled into
now theyre my home
now here i cannot feel the wind
cant feel the rain or cold

bridge
and i believe in gentle harmony
how i loathe all this obscenity
is this the way my life has got to be
have i a single opportunity

chorus
look at me oh look at me is this the way ill always be
oh no oh no
now im dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
oh no oh no
everyday i lie awake and pray to god todays the day
oh no oh no
here i am oh here i am oh when will someone understand
oh no oh no

verse 2
and all at once i feel this
oh how it clings to me
it reels and calls me towards it
confounding destiny

and i can feel the madness inch by inch
the more i run the more i am convinced
i’ve coloured all these like the branchs twist
just like we settle in the foggy mist

chorus
look at me oh look at me is this the way ill always be
oh no oh no
now im dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
oh no oh no
everyday i lie awake and pray to god todays the day
oh no oh no
here i am oh here i am oh when will someone understand
oh no oh no
