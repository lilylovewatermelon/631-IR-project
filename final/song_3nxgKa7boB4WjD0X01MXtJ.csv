girl i told you what it was i let you know
i kept it all the way real cause i been here before
i gave you every chance for you to let it go
im too busy living life and fuckin hoes
yeah but i know i treat you so good
and i know i eat you so good
and i know its hard to find a nigga like me cause i keep it so hood
and i aint into breaking hearts i swear i would take it all back if i could
lets get this understood right now were misunderstood

verse 1

everything was all good just a week ago
