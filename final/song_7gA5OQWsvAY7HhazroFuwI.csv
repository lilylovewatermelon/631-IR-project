i used to love the tenderloin
til i made some tender coin
then i met some ladies from marin
we took the highway to the one
up the coast to catch some sun
they left me with these blisters on my skin

verse 2
dont know what i was on
but i think it grows in oregon
so i kept on going going gone right through
i drove into seattle rain
fell in love then missed the train
that couldve took me right back home to you

chorus
ive been high ive been low
ive been yes and ive been oh hell no
ive been rock n roll and disco
wont you save me san francisco

every days so caffeinated
i wish they were golden gated
fillmore couldnt feel more miles away
so wrap me up return to sender
lets forget this fiveyear bender
take me to my city by the bay

verse 4
i never knew all that i had
now alcatraz dont sound so bad
at least theyd have a hella fine merlot
if i could wish upon a star
i would hitch a cable car
to the place that i can always call my own

chorus
ive been high ive been low
ive been yes and ive been oh hell no
ive been rock n roll and disco
wont you save me san francisco
ive been up ive been down
ive been so damn lost since youre not around
ive been reggae and calypso
wont you save me san francisco
bridge
to tell you the truth
i miss everything everything
its a wild wide beautiful world
but theres a wideeyed girl back there
and she means everything everything

chorus
ive been stop ive been go
ive been yes and ive been oh hell no
ive been rock n roll and disco
wont you save me san francisco
ive been up ive been down
ive been so damn lost since youre not around
ive been reggae and calypso
wont you save me san francisco
