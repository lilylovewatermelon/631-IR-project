agnes just stop and think a minute
why dont you light that cigarette and
calm down now stop and breathe a second
go back to the very beginning
cant you see what was different then
you were just popping percocet
maybe just four a week at best
maybe a smoke to clear the head

prechorus
your head is so numb that nervous breath you try to hide
between the motions that trembling tender little sigh
and so it goes a choking rose back
to be reborn i want to hold you like youre mine

verse 2
you see the sad in everything
a genius of love and loneliness and
this time you overdid the liquor
this time you pulled the fucking trigger
these days youre rolling all the time
so low so you keep getting high
where went that cheeky friend of mine
where went that billiondollar smile

guess life is long when soaked in sadness
on borrowed time from mister madness
and so it goes a choking rose back
to be reborn i want to hold you like youre mine

chorus
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why
youre gone but youre on my mind
im lost but i dont know why46embed"
