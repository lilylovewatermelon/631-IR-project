verse 1
the young boy just turned sixteen and i got uh
six fours and hot bikes that i rock uh
keep three or four sweeties on my clock uh
but all that swinging in that bikini just make em vicious
slow all the traffic down to a complete stop uh
cause you speak in that slang that i talk uh
that sassy tempo with that walk uh
may be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

chorus
