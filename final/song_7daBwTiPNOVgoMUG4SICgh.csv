i am on an island no one to confide
eight days straight eight hours each and not one line
i can feel pressure start to possess my mind
so ill take this beat i should delete to exercise

chorus
no i move slow
i want to stop time
ill sit here til i find the problem
no i move slow
i want to stop time
ill sit here til i find the problem

verse 2
ive got a pet cheetah down in my basement
ive raised him and bathed him and named him jason
statham ive trained him to make me these beats
now my pet cheetahs quicker in the studio than on his feet
ima get mine and get going
im showing my faces in just enough places
im done with tiptoeing ill stay in my room
my house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
get behind me i bet this nepotistic mindset
will help us get ours as were growing
this clique means so much to this dude
it could make him afraid of his music
and be scared to death he could lose it
