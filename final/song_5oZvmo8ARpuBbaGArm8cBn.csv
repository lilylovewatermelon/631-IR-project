dance with me you better know your place
look around think youve lost your way
i play no games ive got many names
wanna swim in fire dont take all day
jump on me and dont be afraid
still got time to walk away
lucifer leviathan yeah
he is i girl and i am him

verse 1 geazy
yeah
be careful you dont want this
carefree but theres a dark side that haunts this
paparazzi gossip loves to watch this
but drugs take me away when i pop this
rock n roll lifestyle at a fast pace
rari like a nascar in a drag race
zoom zoom why the fuck are you in last place
need to catch up where im at thats a fast chase
uh take a shot cause youre drinking slow
pour a glass but nothings chasing my whiskey though
so if you didnt know now im a savage
and this has already been established
your friends tried to dip but you here youre not trying to go
if you aint ready for it all good let me know
i looked her in her eyes she stared back all silent
when i told her im the devil i was smiling

dance with me you better know your place

wanna swim in fire dont take all day
trouble me and dont be afraid
still got time to walk away
lucifer leviathan yeah
he is i girl and i am him
lucifer yeah and i am him

verse 2 geazy
drugs on the table on a wednesday
long nights and advil for the next day
youd be scared if you listen what youre friends say
the worst thing to happen to you in the best way
yeah but no lie youre attracted to it
a good girl but youre scared that its bad to do it
life is sin every night we get back into it
but see i live in this place you just passin through it
welcome to my world let me walk you through it
if you step inside the matrix aint no dodgin bullets
aint no fairytale welcome to the darker side
moon rocks a glass of water now shes on a ride
yeah shes like damn yall are wildin
we live a little different living on my own island
but clearly its working cause the money keep piling
when i told her im the devil i was smiling
chorus sam martin
dance with me you better know your place
look around think youve lost your way
i play no games ive got many names
wanna swim in fire dont take all day
trouble me and dont be afraid
still got time to walk away
lucifer leviathan yeah
he is i girl and i am him
lucifer and i am him
lucifer leviathan

bridge geazy
woo woo
its a monster its not safe here
run for the hills but not these hills
land of afterparties and the cheap thrills woo
liquor red cups endless refills refills

looks sweet but the devils in the details
the flow switch pace when the beat builds yeah woo
