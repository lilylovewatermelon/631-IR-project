now i done gained more than done i lost but i still feel the opposite
even with the stack of accomplishments i dont really feel too confident
i dont even think i profited cuz the shit thats gone worth more than the shit i got
it get lonely the more that you sit up top
yet niggas still creepin tryna get my spot thats wild
i might just throw in the towel and let a nigga have it right now
dont know if the shit worthwhile til you get it and you aint too proud
til you look around and you stuck in the crowd
that love when you up give a fuck when you down
that leave when you lost then come back when you found
they say thats how it look at the top of the mound
but i done spent days and nights putting my all in the shit i write
praying i ball just how i would like
pray i dont fall trynna get this life
and i done went through hard and harder
most of my life i aint have my father
had bloodline but i barely saw them
so the fam i met i felt a part of
and thats how its gon be forever
let go of the pain i would never
cuz thats whats keeping us together
stickin to the plan through whatever
told em all ill stay in the worse
if i had to leave them for the better
told em all ill walk in first
through whatever struggle we endeavor

now is this shit worth it life aint ever gon be perfect this cant be all that its bout
one thing for certain ill never give up my purpose for no type of money or clout
no type of lifestyle or house no type of millionaire route

this cant be all that its bout
one thing for certain ill never give up my purpose for no type of money or clout
no type of lifestyle or house no type of millionaire route
imma say fuck the amount
if the fam down bad then im down there too shit
we gon figure it out3embed"
