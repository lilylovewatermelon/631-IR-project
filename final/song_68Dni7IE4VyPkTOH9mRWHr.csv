verse 2
no role models and im here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin through my memory my memory i couldnt find one
last night i was gettin my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
not trina but i swear to god this bitchll make you call your girl up
and tell her hey whats good
sorry im never comin home ima stay for good
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like 911 in white neighborhoods
aint got no shame bout it
she think im spoiled and im rich cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said nah i was the same without it
but then i thought back back to a better me
before i was a blist celebrity
fore i started callin bitches bitches so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody you wadnt sweatin me
