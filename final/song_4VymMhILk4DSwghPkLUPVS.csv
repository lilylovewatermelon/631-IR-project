shh quiet you might piss somebody off
like me motherfucker youve been at it for too long
while you feed off others insecurities
you stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

prechorus m shadows
selfrighteousness is wearing thin
lies inside your head your best friend
heart bleeds but not for fellow men
broken glass your fake reflection

chorus the rev
ive had enough its time for something real
i dont respect the words youre speaking
gone too far a clone

postchorus m shadows  the rev
so how does it feel to know that someones kid in the heart of america has blood on their hands fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle that insults his familys existence
well where im from we have a special salute
we aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
fuck you

verse 2 m shadows and the rev
shh quiet you might piss somebody off
like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
youll be damned if you count me in as part of your
generous hypocrisy collecting enemies

tabloid gossip queen worthless man
theres no need for us to bury you
selfish agenda once again
right this way you dug your own grave

chorus the rev
ive had enough its time for something real
i dont respect the words youre speaking

postchorus m shadows
all the way from the east to the west we got this high society lookin down on their very foundation
constantly reminding us that our actions are the cause of all their problems
pointing their fingers in every direction
blamin their own nation for who wins elections
theyve never contributed a fuckin thing to the country they love to criticize

bridge m shadows
excuse the obscene ignore the untrue
depictions we see try and get through
admitting mistakes can hurt
im not the last but i sure aint the first
