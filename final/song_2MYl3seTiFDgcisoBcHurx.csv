from hard luck tricks
to trust fund freaks
bathroom stalls to penthouse suites
i been around
i been around
from the bottom of the barrel
to the cream of the crop
theyve picked me up
and ive watched them drop
i been around
i been around
i sang them all a song or two
about simple things
still i feel im being used
aint a damn thing changed

prechorus
im an outlaw
bad leroy brown
the only cool hand luke left in this town
i get my loving on the run
im a low down
mister fly by night
baby slow down
let me show you right
i sure dont want to hurt no one
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
so dont tell me you love me
dont tell me you love love me do
dont tell me you love me
because loves one thing that i cannot do
and its the only thing that i cant give to you

verse 2
from hollywood hoes to backstage jive
jacked up trucks and gulf stream 5s
i been around
i been around
from silly little girls who play them games
to the rich and famous
i wont say no names
i been around
i been around
you got to touch the stove to learn they say
get burnt and learn that way
you better keep your feelings at bay
or honey you going to pay

prechorus

chorus
outro
so dont tell me you love meembed"
