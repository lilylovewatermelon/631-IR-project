i tried ice cold silver bullet cuervo gold
but it dont seem to fix the situation
ive tried self help
got a hundred books up on my shelf
i practice transcendental meditation
but shes gone
shes still gone

chorus
i need something thatll take me back to the night she left
rewind the sound of every step
i wanna watch her walking backwards back to mee
i need something thatll stop the world throw it in reverse
undo the wrong unsay the words
what i really need are roses and a time machine

verse 2
now im on craigslist looking for deloreans
and brushing up on my education
turns out theres time space black holes that lead back to the place before i made a mess of our relations

chorus
i need something thatll take me back to the night she left
rewind the sound of every step
i wanna watch her walking backwards back to mee
i need something thatll stop the world throw it in reverse
undo the wrong unsay the words
what i really need are roses and a time machine

chorus
i need something thatll take me back to the night she left
rewind the sound of every step
