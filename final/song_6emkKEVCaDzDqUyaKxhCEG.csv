two nights ago i was shot
a bullet sunk straight through my skull
a friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
no pain as i awoke but dead
seeing the face of the man
the time as he lays down his gun
i knew this was going to take place
white silence so peaceful so numb

no one knows the time theyre changing
no one will see through

verse 2
youre all gone to me gone to me
ive been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
intuition and a warning to believe i will believe
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears

verse 3
no this gun has stopped time in its tracks
has altered the course of my fate
destiny is shattered and timeless
closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

ill watch you call calling for me
you cant bring back time
close your eyes or look away
fate exposed wont let me stay
hope will fall tonight with broken wings
descending entity in me

my voice has been taken from me
the more i listen the more i have to say

verse 4
youre all gone to me gone to me
ive been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
intuition and a warning to believe i will believe
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay
moving on seemed to be somber bliss
without one goodbye
i watch my mother shed tears
and taste the blood that she cries
and taste the blood that she cries

chorus
ill watch you call calling for me
you cant bring back time
close your eyes and look away
fate exposed wont let me stay
hope will fall tonight with broken wings
descending entity in me
