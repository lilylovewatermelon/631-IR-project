to be close

instrumental

verse 1
in the light menre crossing over lone shadows
wearing veiled slight hopes for intimacy
talking how theyve seen the blue saints
above cold ground wondering if light flows down

in the light menre crossing over dried river
without hope for water to stay long
they all feel thirst looking over dried river
now that only seeks for intimacy

hook
want to be close want to be close

to be close

verse 2
at the last moment their souls sing
along haunting voices of lone shadows
hoping they could search for lost minds
will they come through intimacy
