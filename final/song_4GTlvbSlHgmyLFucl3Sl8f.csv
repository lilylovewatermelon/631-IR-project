verse 1 angus stone
hit up the bottolo
scored us the finest herb
jumped aboard that rolling stone
took to the sky like a bird

now the wheels are in full spin
were off to play a thousand shows
took a drag fell in a dream
took to the sky like a crow

chorus angus  julia stone
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the road

verse 2 angus
turn up the radio
play a horse with no name
ten miles to the show
were running late in a running late game
you might also likethat road can burn through your heart
make you forget what youre doing it for
but ill keep walking through the dark
ill keep knocking at that door yes i will

chorus angus  julia
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the road
she dont like it when im on the roadembed"
