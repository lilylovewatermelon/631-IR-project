well i couldnt tell you
why she felt that way
she felt it every day
and i couldnt help her
i just watched her make
the same mistakes again

prechorus
whats wrong whats wrong now whats
too many too many problems wrong
dont know where she belongs now
where she belongs

chorus
she wants to go home but nobodys home
thats where she lies broken inside
with no place to go no place to go
to dry her eyes broken inside

verse 2
open your eyes open your eyes
and look outside
find the reasons why
youve been rejected youve been rejected
and now you cant find
what youve left behind
