this was an accident
not the kind where sirens sound
tell me how youve never felt
delicate or innocent

prechorus
never felt so lonely i
wish that you could show me love

hook
show me love show me love
theres no way to turn around
show me love show me love
show me love show me love
keep
theres no way to turn around

prechorus
staring at your photograph
everything now in the past
never felt so lonely i
wish that you could show me love
tell me nothing ever counts
lashing out or breaking down
tell me how youve never felt
delicate or innocent
like a game of pickupsticks
played by fuckin lunatics
you might also likehook
show me love show me love
theres no way to turn around
show me love show me love
show me love show me love
keep holding on
theres no way to turn around

show me love show me love
keep holding on
show me love show me love
keep holding on
show me love show me love
keep holding on
show me love show me love
till im screaming for moreembed"
