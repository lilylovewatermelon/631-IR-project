surrounds these pieces of my life
that often change
or maybe ive changed

sometimes seeming happy
can be selfdestructive
even when youre sane
or only insane

but dont bother waking me today

here i am
im so young
i know ive been bitter
ive been jaded
im alone
everyday i bite my tongue
if you only knew
my mind was full of razors
to cut you like a
word if only sung

but this is my song
it is my song
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likenow i live everyday
like therell never be a last one
till theyre gone
and theyre gone
im not too proud to beg for
your attention and your friendship
and your time
so you can come and get it from now on

here i am
im so young
i know ive been bitter
ive been jaded
im alone
everyday i bite my tongue
if you only knew
my mind was full of razors
to cut you like a
word if only sung

this is my song
its my song

and its you
it is you
here i am
im so young
i know ive been bitter
ive been jaded
im alone
everyday i bite my tongue
if you only knew
my mind was full of razors
im not sure i can take it
ive nothing strong to hold to
im way too old to hate you
my mind is full of razors
to cut you like a
word if only sung

but this is my songembed"
