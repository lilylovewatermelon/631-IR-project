intro
in my life ive seen it all
and now its time
for me to pass on this knowledge to you
all my sisters
my troubled sisters
this is my gift to you

verse 1
been many days couldnt take the pain
felt i should take my life away
see it every day in every other young sisters fate
young sister sister
see im cryin now mind full of doubt
runnin in the streets no selfesteem
thinkin that used to be me
what a shame

prechorus
damn life is a mutha its hard to sit back
and see the same thing that happened to me happen to you
this aint love but heres the love i wanna give to you

chorus
it doesnt matter what they say or do do
dont let it get to you you
dont be afraid you can you can you can break through
take what i been through through
to see that
you cant hold a good woman down down
went through the same point of giving up up up
felt like i had enough nough
went to the edge of the ledge but i didnt jump
my life will sum it up up
you cant hold a good woman down

damn life is a mutha its hard to sit back
and see the same thing that happened to me happen to you

looking at you resembles me
but you gotta hold on
