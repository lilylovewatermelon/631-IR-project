all that you want is a love i cant provide
and no matter what i try feels like were falling
cause im leaving home one more talk and ill be gone
and ill be saving all these ashes til the morning

prechorus
when the sun comes from the west
thats where youll find my silhouette
ill ride a cloud come back to you without a warning warning

chorus
dont speak cause it only makes my heart bleed
no matter what you say ill be only just a call away
i need to know that ive got you with me
no matter what they say ill be only just a call away

verse 2
close your eyes in the night and ill be right in front of you
so sit back enjoy the view until the morning

prechorus
when the sun comes from the west
thats where youll find my silhouette
ill ride a cloud come back to you without a warning warning

no matter what you say ill be only just a call away

well take it one day at a time
so just sit back until you cry
ive come too far to let you down
oh baby dont you know that

chorus
dont speak cause it only makes my heart bleed
no matter what you say ill be only just a call away
i need to know that ive got you with me
no matter what they say ill be only just a call away1embed"
