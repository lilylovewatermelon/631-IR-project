verse 3 eminem
thats why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still
thats why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed
thats why we dont call it detroit we call it amityville ville
you can get capped after just havin a cavity filled ahahahahahaha
thats why were crowned the murder capital still still
this aint detroit this is motherfuckin hamburger hill hill
we dont do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot shoot
and when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with em too too
thats the mentality here here thats the reality here here
did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh
while im holdin a pistol with this many calibers here here
plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year year
cause once i snap i cant be held accountable for my actions
thats when accidents happen happen when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around you and they found you
and your family in it goddammit he meant it when he told you
