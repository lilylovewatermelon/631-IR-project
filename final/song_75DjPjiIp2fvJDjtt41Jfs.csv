verse 3 ludacris
yeah uh huh okay
once upon a time in college park
where they live life fast and they scared of dark
there was a little nigga by the name of chris
nobody paid him any mind no one gave a shit
knowin he could rap no one lifted hands
so he went about his business and devised a plan
made a cd and then he hit the block
fifty thousand sold seven dollars a pop
hold the phone three years later
stepped out the swamp in tenandahalf gators
now all around the world on the microphone
he leave the booth smellin like burberry cologne
still ridin chrome
got bitches in the kitchen never home alone
and hes on the grind
please let me know if hes on your mind
and respect youll give me
ludacris i live loud like timmay uh
fuck have to clear these rumors
i got a headache and its not a tumor
get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
sprayed so i never let the bedbugs bite
hard to the core core to the rotten
jump down turn around pick a bale of cotton
yahh
