verse 1 ramirez
you dont really want no problem with a g like me
born and raised in the city known as the sucka free
take a trip to the hunters point and get yo ass blast
this shit is gettin drastic light a blunt and pass it
i need that cash inside my hand cause i dont play that shit
grew up round my uncle mac told me get it out a bitch
workin til the break of dawn gotta get my hustle on
pimpin bitches and countin digits the muscle movin strong ho
