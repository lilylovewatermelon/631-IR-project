dont know why youre scared to let me love you
you know i could treat you right
i know that youre good at bein lonely
i can see it in your eyes

prechorus
you want somebody to hold you
cause when youre drinkin you slip up and put your hands on me
aint your mama ever told you
just because youre out here runnin doesnt make you free

chorus
i know youre fine doin life on your own
but that doesnt mean you should spend it alone
cause boy youve been flyin solo for so long
but i think its time to give your heart your heart what it wants
your heart what it wants
your heart what it wants

verse 2
doesnt all that running make you dizzy
come and read between the lines
i can see exactly what youre missin
when you gonna realize

that you want somebody to love you
cause when its late i bet youre thinking bout calling me
aint your mama ever told you
just because youre out here runnin doesnt make you free

chorus
i know youre fine doin life on your own
but that doesnt mean you should spend it alone
cause boy youve been flyin solo for so long
but i think its time to give your heart your heart what it wants
your heart what it wants
but i think its time to give your heart your heart what it wants
your heart what it wants2embed"
