playing piano and staring out your window
in the middle of the night
from your house on the hill
i was hoping
hoping that you wouldn’t forget me
but i know you will

so don’t go around saying
there’s no such thing as love
you can’t go trading me places
don’t forget that i
i am the cynical one

wine and roses are fine
but i like the harder stuff
and i can still remember
when too much too much was never enough
so don’t go around saying
there’s no such thing as love
you can’t go trading me places

don’t forget that i
i am the cynical one
don’t forget that i
i am the cynical one
don’t forget that i
i am the cynical one
don’t forget that i
i am the cynical oneyou might also likeembed"
