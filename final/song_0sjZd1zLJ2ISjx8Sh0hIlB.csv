blank stares of broken men
so withered from the poisons
they cant remember when
there were once honest reasons
its all a lie
it died a hundred thousand miles ago

refrain
pretending im still here

chorus
justify
what ive become
sanctify
what ive become

verse 2
amazing disgrace how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
better lost if this is found
best blinded never to see
the race to save face
nothing now is what we meant it to be

refrain
pretending im still here
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likeguitar solo

prechorus
its a system now
intertwined
take your place in the line
to be ground
by the gears of the masterpiece
betrayal

chorus
justify
what ive become
sanctify
what ive become

bridge
suffered consequence
its been so long since
any piece of this
made any kind of sense
you anoint the king
ill burn everything
down to ashes
you giveth i taketh away
you giveth i taketh away
outro
its a system now
intertwined
take your place in the line
to be ground
by the gears of the masterpiece
betrayal1embed"
