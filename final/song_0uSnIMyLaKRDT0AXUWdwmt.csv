theres a stranger in my bed
theres a pounding in my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingos in the pool
i smell like a minibar
djs passed out in the yard
barbies on the barbecue
this a hickey or a bruise

prechorus
pictures of last night ended up online
im screwed oh well
its a blackedout blur but im pretty sure it ruled
damn

chorus
last friday night yeah we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots think we kissed but i forgot
last friday night yeah we maxed our credit cards
and got kicked out of the bar so we hit the boulevard
last friday night we went streaking in the park
skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
last friday night yeah i think we broke the law
always say were gonna stopop ohwoah

but this friday night

verse 2
trying to connect the dots
dont know what to tell my boss
think the city towed my car
chandelier is on the floor
ripped my favorite party dress
warrants out for my arrest
think i need a ginger ale
that was such an epic fail

prechorus
pictures of last night ended up online
im screwed oh well
its a blackedout blur but im pretty sure it ruled
damn
