baby girl

verse 1
ive seen a man cry ive seen a man die inside
ive seen him say to me that he is only mine
that he gotta do what is best for him
never let me in not even begin
to tell me im the one under his moon and sun
that i am the thing that revolves around him
but while on top of him i know whats best for him
ill show him how to win and let me in cause

chorus
i dont wanna be your baby girl i i i i i
i dont wanna be your little pearl
i just wanna be whats best for me i i i i i
to be winding down with my own star under my own sun

verse 2
were all sorry now i didnt mean to wow
make you cry like that its just a little spat
still i want you to know though i love you so
its mostly me dreaming forcing believing
that youre an ideal hell i never steal
but i stole you from from another one
so take yourself and wrap around my little finger
cause thats how it should swing
