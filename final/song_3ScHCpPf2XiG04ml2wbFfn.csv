i truly believe the lord sent you to me and kelly
the smile the laughter always makes me happy
when im too serious or too intense
with a voice that beautiful you was heaven sent
my sister my life couldnt be better

kelly the most beautifulest girl in the world
youre my survivor and i admire you

verse 2 kelly
michelle huh aint it funny
god always knows what he is doing
and he showed me some of that when you came into me and bs life
and just let us know that we can count on you
and actually say with a relaxed heart
together we are sisters
your smile has so much meaning so much life
you are the perfect fit
what more could we ask for we got michelle
your voice is like water your voice is like rain
and the world aint ready for you
i love you and i will always be here for you
beyoncé weve come so far together
and it feels so good to have travelled
half the road of life with an angel
walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
god is so awesome
and i thank him for answering my prayers as a child
i never told you this but i prayed for a lifelong friend as a child
and god just has his way of sending precious treasures
and i found mine and every day our relationship gets stronger
and i love you for the loyal unselfish generous gifted wise
and beautiful person you are
no one absolutely no one can take that away from us
you are the definition of a true friend
verse 3 michelle  beyoncé
b and kelly you two mean so much to me
only god knew that this union was meant to be
only god knew all the things we couldnt see
but if we pray together well stay together
beyoncé and kelly
you both exemplify coming from my eyes what love is
love is patient beyoncé thats what youve been
love is kind miss kelly thats what you have shown
it does not envy it does not boast
it is not proud it is not rude it is not selfseeking
and it is not easily angered
it keeps no record of wrongs
love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres
1 corinthians 1347 thank you
