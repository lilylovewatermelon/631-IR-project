mark
uh huh

angel
center of the universe

collins
sing it girl

angel
times are shitty
but im pretty sure they cant get worse

mark
i hear that

angel
its a comfort to know
when youre singing the hit the road blues
that anywhere else you could possibly go
after new york would be a pleasure cruise

collins
now youre talking
you might also likewell im thwarted by a metaphysic puzzle
and im sick of grading papers that i know
and im shouting in my sleep i need a muzzle
all this misery pays no salary so
lets open up a restaurant in santa fe
oh sunny santa fe would be nice
well open up a restaurant in santa fe
and leave this to the roaches and mice

ohoh

all
oh

angel
you teach

collins
yeah i teach computer age philosophy
while my students would rather watch tv

angel
america

all
america
collins
youre a sensitive aesthete
brush the sauce onto the meat
you could make the menu sparkle with a rhyme
you could drum a gentle drum
i could seat guests as they come
chatting not about heidegger but wine

lets open up a restaurant in santa fe
our labors would reap financial gain

all
gain gain gain

collins
well open up a restaurant in santa fe
and save from devastation our brains

homeless
save our brains

all
well pack up all our junk
and fly so far away
devote ourselves to projects that sell
well open up a restaurant in santa fe
forget this cold bohemian hell
oh
oh
collins
do you know the way to santa fe
you know tumbleweeds prairie dogs

all
