danny ran into some complications
he falls asleep during conversations
hes gotta search the street when hes on vacation
the worst thing is that im in the same situation

chorus
and all i do is sit and think about you
if i knew what youd do
collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes
its not living if its not with you

verse 2
and danny says were living in a simulation
but he works in a petrol station selling petrol
he says it all began with his operation
and i know you think youre sly but you need some imagination

chorus
and all i do is sit and think about you
if i knew what youd do
collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes
its not living if its not with you
all i do is sit and drink without you
if i choose then i lose
distract my brain from the terrible news
its not living if its not with you
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likebridge
i cant stop sweating or control my feet
got a twentystone monkey that i just cant beat
i can stage a situation but i just cant eat
and theres a feeling youre replacing embrace

chorus
its true that all i do is sit and think about you
if i knew what youd do
collapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes
its not living if its not with you
all i do is sit and drink without you
if i choose then i lose
distract my brain from the terrible news
its not living if its not with you

outro
oh and johnny got a job in a bank i think
and he spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
i feel sick and i know that ill lose but
its not living if its not with you
its not its not
its not living if its not with you
its not its not
its not its not
its not living if its not with you
its not living if its not with you
its not its not
its not its not
its not its not
its not living if its not with you95embed"
