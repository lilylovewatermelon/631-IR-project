please dont be scared please do not turn your head
we are the future the 21st century dyslexic glue sniffing cyber sluts
with homicidal minds and handguns
we are insane nothing will change
we are insane nothing will change
there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and i will tiptoe down that line but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am trippin down that tightrope
well there is nothing to save me now so i will not look down
and again and again and again and it happens again
and again and again
theres no beginning there is no end
there is only change
progression backwards is this where we are heading
take back your soul forget your emptiness
there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and i will tiptoe down that line but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am trippin down that tightrope
well there is nothing to save me now im fallin to the ground
fallin to the ground down to the ground yeah
i speak of madness my heart and soul
i cry for people who aint got control
lets take our sanity lets take compassion
and be responsible for every action
hell no no how no way no way no way no how no way no how
there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and i will tiptoe down that line but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am trippin down that tightrope
well there is nothing to save me now so i will not look down
there is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
and i will tiptoe down that line but i will feel unstable
my life is a circus and i am trippin down that tightrope
well there is nothing to save me now im falling to the ground
down to the ground all the way down hidden in the dirtyou might also likeembed"
