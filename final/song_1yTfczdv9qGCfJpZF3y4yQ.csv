lets go

intro keyshia cole
just to think about it
i would do things that i would regret tryna get you to
to understand how i felt for you
i tried real hard time and time again
but i didnt know
my love wouldnt grow i shoulda just let it go
but i stayed around thinkin you would learn to love

chorus keyshia cole
and we both knew youre wrong
theres nothing you can do to ever undo what youve done to me
i loved you deep in my heart i know you couldnt love me
but baby i just kept holding on i shoulda let you go
i shoulda let you go
i shoulda let you go
i shoulda let you go

verse 1 keyshia cole
couldnt do without it
felt i needed you in my world to get me by by
more and more i looked out for you
you tried to play me like a fool so i
didnt care that love wasnt there had to just let it go
couldnt stay around thinking you would learn to love
