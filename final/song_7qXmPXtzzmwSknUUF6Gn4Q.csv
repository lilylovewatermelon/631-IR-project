a picture paints a thousand words
as one door closes another door opens
and two wrongs dont make a right
now good things come to those who wait
take the highs with the lows dear
youll get what youre given and everythings gonna be alright

prechorus
what the fuck do you know
just cause youre old you think youre wise
but who the hell are you though
i didnt even ask for your advice
you wanna keep your mouth shut
you wanna take your thoughts elsewhere
cause youre doing in my nut
and do you think i care

chorus
say what you say
do what you do
feel what you feel
as long as its real
i said take what you take
and give what you give
just be what you want
just as long as its real

that all that glitters is not gold
and all that is to fear is fear itself
this horsey also told me
i should keep my friends close but keep my enemies closer
so as to protect myself
