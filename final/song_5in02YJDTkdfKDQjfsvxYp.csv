remember when youd sing just for the fuck of it
any joy it would bring honey the look of it
was as sweet as the sound
your head tilt back your funny mouth to the clouds
i couldnt hope to know that song or know its words
wouldnt claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
i couldnt name that feeling carried in that voice
was it that or just the act of makin noise that brought you joy

prechorus
you dont have to sing it right
but who could call you wrong
to put your emptiness to melody
your awful heart to song
you dont have to sing it nice but honey sing it strong
at best youll find a little remedy
at worst the world will sing along

chorus
so honey sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing

verse 2
remember when youd sing before wed move to it
and wed scuff up our shoes
honey the groove of it was whatever you choose
i wanna be your lover or the fishermans blues

you didnt always sing it right
but who could call you wrong
to put your emptiness to melody
your awful heart to song
you dont have to sing it nice but honey sing it strong
at best youll find a little remedy
at worst the world will sing along

chorus
so honey sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing

bridge
who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again
or honey hope even on this side of the grave again
and who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again
but stick around until you hear that music play again
chorus
so honey sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing
sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing remember when youd sing just for the love of it
sing sing sing sing sing
sing sing just for the love of it
sing sing sing sing sing
outro
remember when youd sing just for the love of it
and any joy it would bring10embed"
