trying to be strong
instead i act weak
dont know any better
just dont want you to be mad at me
dont bring the past up
its got nothing to do with us

verse 2
dont know how to be strong
i just want you here
dont know what i did wrong
tell me whats on your mind
just tell me whats on your mind
tell me whats on your mind

verse 3
kiss me like its the first time
you fell in love
kiss me like its the last time
youll fall in love

verse 4
i always want your love
even when we fight
i dont think of giving up
its gonna happen sometimes
sometimes well fight
