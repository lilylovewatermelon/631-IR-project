ill pick you up at the same time
at the same place the same old drive
well just talk about our day
to try to fill the awkward space tonight
well play the songs we used to love
while we try to fall in love again
we dont know whos wrong or right
we dont even care enough to fight

chorus
were going through the motions
cause we cant fix whats broken
and i know its gonna hurt
but darling ill go first
cause i wont keep on saying those three empty words
no i wont keep on saying those three empty words

verse 2
were still talking everyday
im running out of things to say to ya
whats really gonna break my heart
is to have to tell your little brother
it might be easier to stay
but itll never be the same no oh no
and if something doesnt change
then well keep on sinking further

cause we cant fix whats broken
and i know its gonna hurt
