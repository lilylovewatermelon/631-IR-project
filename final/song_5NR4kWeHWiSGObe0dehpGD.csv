the tall weeds lay flat down
on the hard flat kansas ground
and a sad song in her head
kept blowin round

she barely even knew his name
but she liked the way he played the game
everybody cheered
when he scored that last touchdown

chorus
indian summer
the wonder
the hunger
and the sound of distant thunder
indian summer

verse 2
tangled in a moment of truth
bottle of wine in a motel room
blue haze circled round
the cold gray moon

while the wind chased the leaves outside
passion found a place to hide
late september heat
couldnt be denied

oh indian summer
the wonder
the hunger
and the sound of distant thunder
indian summer

verse 3
she never even finished school
people like to talk they can be so cruel
heard california was a place
to start brand new

so she left that dust bowl town
sometimes when a long wind howls
i wonder where wed be
if i never scored that last
touchdown

outro
summer
the wonder
the hunger
and the sound of distant thunder
