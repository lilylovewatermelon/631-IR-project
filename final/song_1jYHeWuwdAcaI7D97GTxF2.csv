shes my yin yang girl she’s day shes night
just a shot in the dark shes a beam of light
she’s a hot contradiction a brand new addiction
like to sip that wine when i take her out fishin

verse 2
shes the last one there when they close the bar
got mud on the tires of her fancy car
shes a real good girl til shes had a few
likes church on sunday sits in the back pew
if the preacher only knew that man

chorus
shes an angel who can raise a little hell
a drive fast high class southern belle
shes crazy there ain’t no doubt about it
she’s a rock star dancin on the tailgate
a little bit a sinner and a little bit a saint
my yin yang girl
yeah she’s an angel who can raise a little hell

verse 3
shes a daddys little girl she can do no wrong
but i hope he never sees her camera phone
shes a real home maker a whiskey shot taker
a bed time story and a midnight shaker
shake it babe

and man she’s an angel who can raise a little hell

a little bit a sinner and a little bit a saint
shes my yin yang girl
yeah shes an angel who can raise a little hell
