oh i saw a shooting star
late last night
yeah she was pointing at the west coast
beamin’ like a street light
got my white denim jacket
and my bolo tie
snuck past mom and dad and told my little brothers goodbye

guitar interlude

verse 2
oh i hear a motor car
coming up the coast
you know i’ve seen other cities but i like this one most
there’s a girl down the valley says that we can take it slow
or we can push fast forward on it
love success and rock and roll

chorus
but it gets hard sometimes
don’t i know it
i been up for a week
i can’t get no sleep
i lose my cool

verse 3
oh i saw a shooting star
late last night
she’s like vanilla ice cream baby
milky white
i wanna love her all day
and all of the night
i wanna love her all day
for the rest of my life

chorus
and it gets hard sometimes
don’t i know it
i been up for a week
i can’t get no sleep
i lose my cool
i been up for a week
i can’t get no sleep
i lose my cool

outro

c’mon and tell it to me
