bitch im yung plague with the ak steady sinning
fuck life and everything that fucking comes with it
put the barrel in my mouth blow my fucking brains out
i dont give a fuck about anything now im finished
never killed a motherfucker but thats bout to fucking change
throw my ass in jail and just let me fucking decay
the world is fucking grey i grip the fucking blade
and carve a line across my neck and now im fucking saved

verse 2 charles lee ray
bitch i pull up in that motherfucking donk
florida to no we down to catch a homi
bipolar switching twitching now im tony with the tommy
demonic logic i might vomit from popping narcotics
biologic product of a savage my mamas psychotic
here to abolish killing trees with the touch of my finger
my shadows linger the crypt keeper its carecrow the reaper
burning infernos im eternal these fuckboys just verbal
grey hear the war cry of thousands thats burning

verse 3 denzel curry
my t is black hell is dark and so is my heart
but its switchin like the nigga with the yugioh cards
against all odds eyes on another when you go against god
the ultimate is watching so i guess im in charge
and if you think that youre hard then ima act retarded
why you ride bikes better off in a car bitch
im off it stop then im back in my starship
the ultimate martian in the hood when the hood is lookin like hobgoblin
steady mobbin push it to the limit i could talk about ross bitch
know a couple niggas that can afford the apartments
back from blvcklvnd so im black and im heartless
shots in the dark im an excellent marksman
chop a choppa down come around with karma
thats why a nigga vibe when a nigga want drama
but i wish a nigga would like cosmo and wanda
no timmy got a long black jimmy
smoking on that season milli and the plug is outta philly
and i still tote the semi when im runnin through the city
like a motherfucking renegade
reminiscing bout the violence of my old days
all black bring it back to my old ways
closed case kill a nigga like a young kane my nigga
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeoutro denzel curry
drowning in my thoughts around the sound will fill me endlessly
feeling all my days are numbered count until the end of me
angel wings broken but ill never let the devil creep
ult for life and ima rap until the death of me
drowning in my thoughts around the sound will fill me endlessly
feelin like all my days are numbered count until the end of me
angel wings broken but ill never let the devil creep
ultimately uicidal that means i can never sleep35embed"
