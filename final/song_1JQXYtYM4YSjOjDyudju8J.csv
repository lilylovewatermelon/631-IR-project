so toss me out and turn in
and therell be no rest for these tired eyes

verse 1
i dont think that i could take another empty moment
i dont think that i could fake another hollow smile
well its not enough just to be lonely
i dont think that i could take another talk about it

and just like me youve got needs
and theyre only a whisper away
and weve softly surrendered
to these lives that we have tendered away

chorus
but i would not sleep in this bed of lies
so toss me out and turn in
and therell be no rest for these tired eyes
im marking it down to learnin
im marking it down to learnin cause i can

verse 2
i dont want to be the one who turns the whole thing over
i dont want to be somewhere where i just dont belong
where its not enough just to be sorry
dont you know i feel the darkness closing in

to the worst part left of these winters that weve made

and therell be no rest for these tired eyes
im marking it down to learnin
im marking it down to learnin
