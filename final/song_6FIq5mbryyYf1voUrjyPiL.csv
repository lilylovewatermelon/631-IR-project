angels although i cant see them
theyre watching over everything i do
aint no easy street around the bend on my road
no pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
but i dont mind cause baby i got you

the rain keeps the flowers from dyin
the sun lights the world when it shines
the midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon
and baby i got you

i cant imagine one day without you in it
life alone just wouldnt be worth livin
love would be a wish that never came true
lord knows ive got more than i deserve
but i dont question the prayer that ive had ansered
i did something right cause
baby i got you

the rain keeps the flowers from dyin
the sun lights the world when it shines
the midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon
and baby i got you

the rain keeps the flowers from dyin
the sun lights the world when it shines
the midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon
