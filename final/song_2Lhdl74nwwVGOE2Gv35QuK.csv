chorus patrick stump
take a look at my girlfriend
shes the only one i got mbabarara
not much of a girlfriend
i never seem to get a lot mbabarara mbabarara

verse 1 travie mccoy
its been some time since we last spoke
this is gonna sound like a bad joke
but momma i fell in love again
its safe to say i have a new girlfriend
and i know it sounds so old
but cupid got me in a chokehold
and im afraid i might give in
towels on the mat my white flag is wavin mbabarara
i mean she even cooks me pancakes
and alkaseltzer when my tummy aches
if that aint love then i dont know what love is
we even got a secret handshake
and she loves the music that my band makes
i know im young but if i had to choose her or the sun
id be one nocturnal son of a gun mbabarara mbabarara

verse 2 travie mccoy
its been a while since we talked last
and im tryin hard not to talk fast
but dad im finally thinkin i may have found the one
type of girl thatll make you way proud of your son
and i know you heard the last song
about the girls that didnt last long
but i promise this is on a whole new plane
i can tell by the way she says my name mbabarara
i love it when she calls my phone
shes even got her very own ringtone
if that aint love then i dont know what love is mbabarara
its gonna be a long drive home
but i know as soon as i arrive home
and i open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
shell be back into my arms once more for sure like

bridge travie mccoy
shes got a smile thatll make the most senile
annoying old man bite his tongue im not done
shes got eyes comparable to sunrise
and it doesnt stop there man i swear
shes got porcelain skin of course shes a ten
now shes even got her own song but movin on
shes got the cutest laugh i ever heard
and we can be on the phone for three hours not sayin one word
and i would still cherish every moment
and when i start to build my future shes the main component
call it dumb call it luck call it love
or whatever you call it but
everywhere i go i keep her picture in my wallet like
