say things to me like a cowgirl would
and ill do tricks for you like a cowboy should
oh you look romantic laying in the hay
and i need you tonight in a new kinda way
when you look at me with those eyes
oh it makes me start to fantasize

prechorus
do it to me like i know you could
so i can do it to you baby like a cowboy should

verse 2
im ridin the range i think of you
i dig your chili and you know its true
yeah i make big money put it in the bank
yeah that longhorn caddy got a great big tank

prechorus
oh do it to me like i know you could
and i can do it to you baby like a cowboy should

chorus
oh youre the kinda woman whos above the rest
nothing for me but the best

do it you good like a cowboy man
