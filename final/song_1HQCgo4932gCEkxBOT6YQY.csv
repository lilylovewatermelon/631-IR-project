thibaut
thy sisters joan will soon be happy brides
i see them gladly they rejoice my age
but thou my youngest givst me grief and pain

raimond
what is the matter why upbraid thy child

thibaut
here is this noble youth the flower and pride
of all our village he hath fixed on thee
his fond affections and for three long years
has wooed thee with respectful tenderness
but thou dost thrust him back with cold reserve
nor is there one mong all our shepherd youths
who eer can win a gracious smile from thee
i see thee blooming in thy youthful prime
thy spring it is the joyous time of hope
thy person like a tender flower hath now
disclosed its beauty but i vainly wait
for loves sweet blossom genially to blow
and ripen joyously to golden fruit
oh that must ever grieve me and betrays
some sad deficiency in natures work
the heart i like not which severe and cold
expands not in the genial years of youth
raimond
forbear good father cease to urge her thus
a noble tender fruit of heavenly growth
is my johannas love and time alone
bringeth the costly to maturity
still she delights to range among the hills
and fears descending from the wild free heath
to tarry neath the lowly roofs of men
where dwell the narrow cares of humble life
from the deep vale with silent wonder oft
i mark her when upon a lofty hill
surrounded by her flock erect she stands
with noble port and bends her earnest gaze
down on the small domains of earth to me
she looketh then as if from other times
she came foreboding things of import high

thibaut
tis that precisely which displeases me
she shuns her sisters gay companionship
seeks out the desert mountains leaves her couch
before the crowing of the morning cock
and in the dreadful hour when men are wont
confidingly to seek their fellowmen
she like the solitary bird creeps forth
and in the fearful spiritrealm of night
to yon crossway repairs and there alone
holds secret commune with the mountain wind
wherefore this place precisely doth she choose
why hither always doth she drive her flock
for hours together i have seen her sit
in dreamy musing neath the druid tree
which every happy creature shuns with awe
for tis not holy there an evil spirit
hath since the fearful pagan days of old
beneath its branches fixed his dread abode
the oldest of our villagers relate
strange tales of horror of the druid tree
mysterious voices of unearthly sound
from its unhallowed shade oft meet the ear
myself when in the gloomy twilight hour
my path once chanced to lead me near this tree
beheld a spectral figure sitting there
which slowly from its long and ample robe
stretched forth its withered hand and beckoned me
but on i went with speed nor looked behind
and to the care of god consigned my soul
raimond pointing to the image of the virgin
yon holy image of the virgin blest
whose presence heavenly peace diffuseth round
not satans work leadeth thy daughter here

thibaut
no not in vain hath it in fearful dreams
and apparitions strange revealed itself
for three successive nights i have beheld
johanna sitting on the throne at rheims
a sparkling diadem of seven stars
upon her brow the sceptre in her hand
from which three lilies sprung and i her sire
with her two sisters and the noble peers
the earls archbishops and the king himself
bowed down before her in my humble home
how could this splendor enter my poor brain
oh tis the prelude to some fearful fall
this warning dream in pictured show reveals
the vain and sinful longing of her heart
she looks with shame upon her lowly birth
because with richer beauty god hath graced
her form and dowered her with wondrous gifts
above the other maidens of this vale
she in her heart indulges sinful pride
and pride it is through which the angels fell
by which the fiend of hell seduces man
raimond
who cherishes a purer humbler mind
than doth thy pious daughter does she not
with cheerful spirit work her sisters will
she is more highly gifted far than they
yet like a servant maiden it is she
who silently performs the humblest tasks
beneath her guiding hands prosperity
attendeth still thy harvest and thy flocks
and around all she does there ceaseless flows
a blessing rare and unaccountable

thibaut
ah truly unaccountable indeed
sad horror at this blessing seizes me
but now no more henceforth i will be silent
shall i accuse my own beloved child
i can do naught but warn and pray for her
yet warn i must oh shun the druid tree
stay not alone and in the midnight hour
break not the ground for roots no drinks prepare
no characters inscribe upon the sand
tis easy to unlock the realm of spirits
listening each sound beneath a film of earth
they lay in wait ready to rush aloft
stay not alone for in the wilderness
the prince of darkness tempted een the lordembed"
