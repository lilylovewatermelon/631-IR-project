yeah
im in the missoni room at the byblos

we goin from the vava to cinquantecinq then back to the vava
if you know you know baby i dont i dont know what to tell you
yeah
ayy

verse drake
look
long way from sette mezzo
meet tommaso and ernesto
short rigatoni with the pesto
these verses are my manifesto
hallways got an echo
me and smiggz on the loose in the city you know how the rest go
casual sex im like fuck a dress code
the first martini is an espresso
chill shot glasses with prosecco
niggas so ignorant in our hood they bе like why the fuck you makin techno
im worldwidе and this is just another cargo jet flow i had to let go
life insurance policies you niggas bout to need the gecko
i got some meaner threats though
me spiderman and leonardo im back tomorrow
i had the chopper to a wedding out in monaco or monte carlo
im losin track of where we all go
i wouldnt trade my life for none of yalls its an embargo
fiftynine bags on the 767 this is heavy cargo
yeah
fiftynine bags on the— ayy
swedish jail cell smellin like some carby musk
for your birthday your boyfriend got a party bus
bottle signs club lines shouldve come with us
we left that shit in 09 when we was comin up
i mean these just my suggestions of course
emrata here fresh off divorce
and im tryna look in her eyes maybe express my remorse
if she want a rebound with me im down to go get her some boards
im here for the moral support
whippin the vespa off of six tequilas
big benjamins like the pittsburgh steelers
drake you got it
robert kraft sent the jet for us that shit was patriotic
you would think we live in baltimore the way they ravin bout the latest product
teachin niggas how to mind they business and my latest stuff
might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
thats why im in hyde park buyin like half of harrods
you niggas are too concerned with makin sure yall outfits gon match in paris
if we dont like you you payin tax and tariffs
come to the 6 and im like the actin sheriff deputy
first got to america niggas wouldnt check for me
no chance the kidll make it here like vasectomy
they underestimated my trajectory
but now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
i send the label bills bills bills like the other two women standing next to bey that shit was just—
independent women is lovin the new appearance
matter of time before i go net a bey like a paris
like honey you gotta know that i never wore mike amiris or never hopped in a urus
i got my head in the clouds im serious
the lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
promise youll get that shit when the sky clears
this shit designed for divine ears
my favorite two words from you white boys is sign here
and then comes the sound of glass clinkin from a wine cheers
swear im pocket checkin yall for five years
and then we bout to kick this shit in high gear
eight karats like vegetarians nigga the earrings are droopy
contract lord of the rings think its a script for the movie
shout out tvgucci my cousin is spooky
i swear you dont even mean what yall say like yall dubbin a movie
sidebar serena your husband a groupie
he claim we dont got a problem but
no boo it is like you comin for sushi
we might pop up on em at will like suzuki
kawasaki sushi saké the money grow on trees like shiitake
they tried to get spicy with me so i wonder how they gon stop me
im really on a roll like hamachi
the fuck would yall really do without me
for your birthday your man got a table at hibachi
last time i ate there wayne was doin numbers off the cup like yahtzee
and paris hilton was steady duckin the paparazzi
quavo mightve sent me a song that he called versace
i really cant remember it properly
all i know is that god got me im sittin on large properties
treat me like a newborn lucian not droppin me
im goin pink floyd you niggas cannot rock with me
she could be givin me head and somehow you not toppin me
niggas see the 6ix god pass they highfivin me
need to be highsixin me
swear niggas highkey sick of me
they wifey on my head cause i vibe differently
feel like an amber alert the way that i can take her to the mall and she find tiffany
im like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me
they shouldve been in the fountain based on what yall wishin me
see drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likeoutro birdman
