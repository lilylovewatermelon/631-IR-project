you made your way in as i was leavin
you cut in line just as i was getting my stuff
and i couldnt decide if you were the most annoying human being id ever met
or just the best thing that ever happened
just the best thing that ever happened

verse 2

i could hear the rain on the windows
right then and there i made up my mind to just go with it
thinkin whats the worst thing that could happen
when the worst thing that could happen could be the best thing ever

refrain
were not forever youre not the one
were not forever youre not the one
were not forever youre not the one
you and i could be the best thing ever

prechorus

and we dont make plans cause were never gonna last
were not forever youre not the one
you and i were a time—

when something this good comes along
