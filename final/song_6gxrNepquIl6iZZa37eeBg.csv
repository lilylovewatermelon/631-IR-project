aint tryna rock no boats
aint tryna step on no toes
aint tryna bust no bowls
but im just trying to get home

prechorus
cause the moon is bright the streets are dark
the kids and theyre howling theyre howling
i walk the streets trying to find a place to sit
a person to talk to
but all i have is you this ghost inside my brain

chorus
im lost in the light
im feeling really bright
i dont wanna spend the night
i just want a cool breeze warm stream while were looking at the trees
im howling im howling
lost in the night
i really wanna cry
i dont sleep at night
im going out with those kids were howling were howling

verse 2
kids we do what is right
we do what is wrong
but what is right
please explain to me what is wrong
we do what we feel
we make our own path
our path now
were the indigo were the indigos and were all going to another place
not tryna find another name
not tryna get in another body
im going to ascension baby you cannot stop me
you cannot stop me

cause the moon is bright the streets are dark
the kids and theyre howling theyre howling
i walk the streets trying to find a place to sit
a person to talk to
but all i have is you this ghost inside my brain

chorus
im lost in the tide
i dont think i can get out
im swimming from that shark mouth
and that island of undal is really far away
i dont think i will make it at all

outro
but i fall
with some atlanteans nephilims the martians and some anunnaki we all fall
what happens when we fall
we go down in consciousness and we rise into a life like
what the heck is happening
why am i here why can i sing
why am i across the seas this is crazy
i wanna go home i wanna go home2embed"
