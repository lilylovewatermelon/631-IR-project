is it naive to make plans that seem so far away
theres a reason i feel this way
youre sleeping alone im awake
when you dream of me tonight am i close to where you are

chorus kellin quinn
lay me down
and tell me everything will be alright things will be alright
things will be alright things will be alright
lay me down
and tell me everything will be alright things will be alright
things will be alright things will be alright
this could mean everything or nothing at all
you take what is real ill give you my all

oh here where we lie
outstretched to wonder why we dont belong
you deserve much more and ill give until im all gone
forever know your face and ever take your place here by my side
like a ghost into the night
the poisoned apple to my bite
ill be the shadow at your door
ill be the moth into your light
cause you deserve much more
yeah you deserve much more

chorus kellin quinn

the poisoned apple to my bite
this could mean everything or nothing at all
