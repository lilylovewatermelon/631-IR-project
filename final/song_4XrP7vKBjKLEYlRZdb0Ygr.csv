i took a chance i took a shot
and you might think im bulletproof but im not
you took a swing i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are

chorus
im sick and tired of your attitude
im feeling like i dont know you
you tell me that you love me then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when youre around
and heres to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what youre doing to me
tell me why

verse 2
you could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what im trying to say oh

chorus
im sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when youre around
heres to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what youre doing to me
tell me why

so youre the only thing on my mind
