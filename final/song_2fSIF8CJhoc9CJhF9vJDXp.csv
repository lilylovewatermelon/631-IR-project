cocaine flame in my bloodstream
sold my coat when i hit spokane
bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early morning rain
lately my hands they dont feel like mine
my eyes been stung with dust im blind
held you in my arms one time
lost you just the same

prechorus
jolene
i aint about to go straight
its too late

chorus
i found myself face down in the ditch
booze in my hair
blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
still dont know what love means
still dont know what love means
jolene
ah la la la la la

been so long since i seen your face
or felt a part of this human race
ive been living out of this here suitcase for way too long
a man needs something he can hold onto
a nine pound hammer or a woman like you
either one of them things will do

prechorus
jolene
i aint about to go straight
its too late

chorus
i found myself face down in the ditch
booze in my hair
blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
still dont know what love means
still dont know what love means
