well do it all
everything
on our own
we dont need
anything
or anyone

chorus
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world

verse 2
i dont quite know
how to say
how i feel
those three words
are said too much
theyre not enough

chorus
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
forget what were told
before we get too old
show me a garden thats burstin into life
see snow patrol liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likeverse 3
lets waste time
chasin cars
around our heads
i need your grace
to remind me
to find my own

chorus
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world
forget what were told
before we get too old
show me a garden thats burstin into life
all that i am
all that i ever was
is here in your perfect eyes theyre all i can see
i dont know where
confused about how as well
just know that these things will never change for us at all

outro
if i lay here
if i just lay here
would you lie with me and just forget the world107embed"
