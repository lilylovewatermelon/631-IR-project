verse 1 travis scott
ride for it every night
visions and these angles tight
truth be told i never try
diamonds are the wife of life
all three rollies look alike hm
after two you get a hookup price
stripper never worked a ninetofive hm
delta and i ship it overnight hm
stop tryna be god almighty hm
fuck the money never leave your people behind yeah
its never love no matter what you try
still can see it comin down your eyes
cause they did not create commandments oohooh
when you hustle always make it fancy oohooh
the signals far from what you can be oohooh
cause air traffic controls the landing yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2 travis scott
stop tryna play god almighty
always keep your circle tight
i been wantin shit my whole life
im warning you better not try to play god tonight
if i love her ima pass on her
first rule of war you find an act on her
you cant win a trophy or a plaque off her
but never turn your back on her
cause they did not create commandments
when you hustle always make it fancy
the signals far from what you can be
cause air traffic controls the landing yeah yeah yeah yeah
you wont succeed tryna learn me
stick to the roads in my journey
stay out of court when you got the attorney
she say she love but want to really burn me

bridge james blake
is it the complex of the saint
thats keepin you so so so still still
is it a coat of old paint
thats peelin every day against our will
is it too long since the last
open conversation you had oh no
and did you see the void in the past
and can you ever see it comin back
well can you always be a step ahead of it for me
well can you always be a step ahead of it for me
