i put a bullet in my radio
somethin just hit me funny i dont know
just pulled the trigger goin down the road
you slam the door and knock me off the wire
been walkin lines and youve been burning tires
slow and easy aint that what you like

chorus
it’s insane
it’s in vain
you stay to maintain the pain

verse 2
i hear your name and then it burns a hole
i swear i hate you but i cant let go
the kind of feelings that you can’t console

chorus
it’s all in vain
it’s all insane
i swear youll stay swear youll stay to maintain the pain
it’s all in vain i hear your name and then it burns a hole
it’s all insane i swear i hate you but i cant let go
i swear youll stay swear youll stay to maintain the pain
the kind of feelings that you can’t console
