the heart is a bloom shoots up through the stony ground
theres no room no space to rent in this town
youre out of luck and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck and youre not moving anywhere
you thought youd found a friend to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

chorus
its a beautiful day
sky falls you feel like
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away

verse 2
youre on the road but youve got no destination
youre in the mud in the maze of her imagination
you love this town even if that doesnt ring true
youve been all over and its been all over you

chorus
its a beautiful day
dont let it get away
its a beautiful day

touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know im not a hopeless case

bridge
see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light
and see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colours came out

chorus
it was a beautiful day
dont let it get away
beautiful day

postchorus
touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know im not a hopeless case
outro
what you dont have you dont need it now
what you dont know you can feel it somehow
what you dont have you dont need it now
dont need it now
was a beautiful day27embed"
