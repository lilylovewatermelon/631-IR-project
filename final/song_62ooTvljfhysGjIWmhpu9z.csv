verse 4 j cole
and could i be a star
does fame in this game have to change who you are
or could i be the same one who came from a faraway life
just to make it in these broadway lights
now im shining in the broad daylight—go figure
a slow transition from a lil broke nigga from the ville
got a deal a real lifesaver
dreams of being behind the wheel like jada
i chill now cop a lil ice later
cole you got the glow like a lil lightsaber
so clap for him
then applaud hov he gave him a platform
flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him—no sir
the flow cold as the shoulders of golddigging hoes when a broke nigga proaches
told you i’m focused man
i’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for em

hook the world famous tony williams jayz  j cole
every day a star is born and you say new york city
