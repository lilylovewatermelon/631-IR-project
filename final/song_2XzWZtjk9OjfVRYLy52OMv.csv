i feel delirious
come let’s get out of here
we’re so anonymous but it’s all coming clear
were heading for the sky and well get lost in it
cause all i want all i want all i want is everything

prechorus
and i will pose if i wanna
and i will vogue like madonna
i might not dance like mj rip
but i will give the best of me

chorus
all i want is everything yes everything
too much is not enough
i’m sick of settling for in between and i’m not giving up
as long as it feels right at least we know that we’re alive
all i want is everything yes everything yeah whoa

verse 2
