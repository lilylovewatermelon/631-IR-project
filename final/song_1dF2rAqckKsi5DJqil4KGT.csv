you think that we cant see your face
i think you need to give us our space
you know that we can raze this place
and leave you without a trace
storm trooper storm trooper why are you here
the youth them getting restless and they dont want you near
your watching us your watching us it so improper
weve seen your kind before we call it informer
storm trooper storm trooper where will you go
this world she no like you so you better stay low
and up from the mountains and out from the trees
that is where you come from you crawl like the one disease

verse 2
so now you pass me the laser beam
and you want me to join the team
well im not used to these kinds of things
but this is what the evil brings
let me tell you bout the fire
you could bring the waters up above
ill bring my favorite people and im bringing all my love
you want a battle well dont look very far
you want to fight somebody come fight the superstar
i knew you wouldnt stand a chance you left without a passing glance
theres nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you
you might also likeverse 3
its so dark and lonely out here in outer space
but at least i got my keyboard and my low bot has his bass
playing street sweeper tunes and watching tie fighters fly by
things would be better if i was back at home with pepper
burning pakalolo not even noticing the weather
so far and so alone a million light years away
storm trooper storm trooper back up from my door
i got my blaster set im ready to start a minor war
this wont be the day you were hoping for so just walk away walk away
better run now cause your done now cause your standing in a bad mans town boy
time to get back to my daily routine have a beer at a bar on tattooine

chorus
you take away everything make my people scream out loud
just bring it back
lord just bring it back
you mess it up and you rearrange open your eyes and turn the page
just bring it back

chorus 2
i believe ill interject to talk about the word respect
its not a word thats in your hands
its more about the common man
you took your time and paved the way
making room for other man to play a
grip of bodies a mess of minds endless conversations to rock
na na na naembed"
