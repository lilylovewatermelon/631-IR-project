well she wants to be a singer in the band
maybe ill give the girl a hand and a microphone looks like shes all alone
she can bring a friend though shes not my kind of friend
she keeps on staring me out with her ol black n blue eyes

verse 2
and i can take her dancing just to give the girl a chance
and i was never that good at being nice when i should
i guess that shell forgive me right before she tries to kill me
cause i sold her on yesterdays cometakemehome eyes

verse 3
and i can take her waltzing just so she could kick my head in
oh i do believe i was drunk and both of my heads had shrunk
i guess her name was tina cause before id even seen her
i was lost in her whatsyourname just get me fucked eyes

hook
oh take me home eyes

chorus
and chelsea said shes got nowhere to go
and if she does shes getting there slow
and i can help her out but ive got somewhere to be
and thats the very thing when youre dealing with me

filthy heart and swollen hips and she said

that you wont kiss these rotten lips

and if she does shes getting there slow
