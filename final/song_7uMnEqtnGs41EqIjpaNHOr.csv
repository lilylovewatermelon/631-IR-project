life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
they try to show us the light but we dont like to hear it dont like to hear it
mama told me i was bright but despite her lyrics
a large heard across my sight i had to fight to clear it uh uh
like a runner a couple of summers i often wondered if it
really was winter and thats when i heard the thunder
a current was occurrin it was stirrin up my hunger
but i couldnt let the  bury a  under dont let it
used to cry hopin all of this would pass
and then i learned to use my tears to water up the grass
a part of my swag but apparently ive won
cause i took my shades off and now im starin at the sun

i seen a lot of people hustle but i left them things alone
i almost lost my friend to the struggle
but i guess that made me strong made me strong
i seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
taught me how to fight
and i thank god for my mama she showed me what was right
i coulda been in the dark but thank god for the light
