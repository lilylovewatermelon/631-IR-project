i just seen  to the left
get out of here report to the 
 you alright  report to the 

verse 1 joey bada
niggas dont want war im a martian with an army of spartans
sparring with a knife in a missile fight
get your intel right your intelligence is irrelevant
but its definite i spit more than speech impediments
brooklyns the residence the best and its evident
we got em niggas pe nuts like they elephants
throw em in a trunk if they hate though
we dont give a fuck as long as we collect our pay so
yall collect pesos your money aint right here
i got them girls next to the wood like they lightyear im right chea
tryna get a buzz tryna pollinate
steez got that presidential shit time to inaugurate
my pe conglomerates bout to pee on any wannabe weak mc
air em out or leave em empty congratulate the semiauto
fire flame spitter like komodo
no time for fake people they be simmin like kimora
im the emporah in search of theodora
my heart go baboom baboom baboomboom
its panic like dora when shots blast
see i was raised that way im from the place where they raised that k
like every day in every way and everywhere you go just aint safe
the only thing that i can say to you is pray
cause when niggas start equippin and throw the clip in
your blood drippin and catch you slippin
another victim dont know whats hit them—through his spinal
just another man who defeated by survival
thats your biggest rival in your whole life
these bars you cant handle you better hold tight
they sayin im the best im like youre so right
still aint got enough shine to last the whole night nigga
you might also likebridge joey bada  capital steez
yo fuck the police nigga
fuck every asscorrupt politician on wall street
pe public enemy assassinate us bitch
fuck that fuck everything son
fuck government fuck listenin and shit
you want fuckin energy dickheads
verse 2 capital steez
its like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
doomsday comin start investin in a few guns
new gats booby traps and bazooka straps
better play your cards right no booster packs
everybody claim they used to rap
but these aint even punchlines no more im abusing tracks
leaving instrumentals blue and black
im in marty mcfly mode so tell em that the futures back
riding on hoverboards wiping out motherboards
start spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
king arthur when he swung his sword
a king author i aint even use a pen in like a month or four
i had a hard time writing lyrics
now im way over heads science fiction
you can try and get it i been the flyest with it
wouldnt mind a feign of interest for your finest interest
they say hard work pays off
well tell the based god dont quit his day job
cause pes about to take off
with protons and electrons homie thats an abomb
ugh fuckin ridiculous
finger to the president screamin fuck censorship
if obama got that president election
then them pe boys bout to make an intervention
fuck what i once said i want the bloodshed
cause nowadays for respect you gotta pump lead
i guess columbine was listenin to chaka khan
and pokémon wasnt gettin recognized at comiccon
its like weve been content with losin
and half our students fallen victim to the institution
jobs are scarce since the scientific revolution
and little kids are shootin uzis cause its given to em
little weapon code name smith and wesson
and youll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
if your man’s tryna disrespect it
send a message and its over in a millisecond nigga
