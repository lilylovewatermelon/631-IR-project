this is a call to arms to live and love and sleep together
we could flood the streets with love or light or heat whatever
lock the parents out cut a rug twist and shout
wave your hands make it rain the stars will rise again

chorus
the youth are starting to change
are you starting to change are you
together together together
together together together together
the youth are starting to change
are you starting to change are you
together together together
together together together together

verse 2
in a couple of years tides have turned from boos to cheers
and in spite of the weather we can learn to make it together

chorus
the youth are starting to change
are you starting to change are you
together together together
together together together together
the youth are starting to change
are you starting to change are you
together together together
together together together together
together together together together
together together together together
