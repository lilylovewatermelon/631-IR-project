i dont know if you were looking at me or not
you probably smile like that all the time
i dont mean to bother you but
i couldnt just walk by
and not say hi
i know your name
cause everybody in here knows your name
youre not looking for anything right now
so i dont wanna come on strong
dont get me wrong
your eyes are so intimidating
my heart is pounding but
its just a conversation
no girl im not wasted
you dont know me
i dont know you
but i want to

chorus
i dont wanna steal your freedom
i dont wanna change your mind
i dont have to make you love me
i just want to take your time
i dont wanna wreck your friday
i aint gonna waste my lines
i dont have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time

i know it starts with hello
the next thing you know youre try to be nice
and some guys getting too close
trying to pick you up
trying to get you drunk
im sure one of your friends is about to come over here
cause shes supposed to save you from random guys
that talk too much
and wanna stay too long
its the same old song
and dance but i think you know it well
you couldve rolled your eyes
told me to go to hell
couldve walked away
but youre still here
and im still here
come on lets see where it goes

chorus
i dont wanna steal your freedom
i dont wanna change your mind
i dont have to make you love me
i just wanna take your time
i dont have to meet your mother
we dont have to cross that line
i dont wanna steal your covers
i just wanna take your time
bridge
i dont wanna go home with you
i just wanna be alone with you

chorus
i dont wanna steal your freedom
i dont wanna change your mind
i dont have to make you love me
i just wanna take your time
i dont wanna blow your phone up
i just wanna blow your mind
i dont have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time
no i aint gotta call you baby
i aint gotta call you mine
i dont have to take your heart
i just wanna take your time151embed"
