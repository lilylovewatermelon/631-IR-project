life is still spinning
your end my beginning
and everything i hoped for has been strangely set aside
reason for living
my mind is forgiving
and destiny is proving to be absent from my life

prechorus elena siegman
i know it i feel it

chorus elena siegman
i know when youre sleeping
i know the things youre dreaming
and i know you will never give up and die

verse 2 elena siegman
conscious fulfilling the darkness revealing
all thoughts and insecurities are shining like the sun
eyes are deceiving
your mind will stop breathing
and all that you are made of will now rightly become mine
