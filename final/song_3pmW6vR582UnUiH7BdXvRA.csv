learned the hard way love is blind
but you cant deny the bitter truth
when its right before your eyes

but i wish i was wrong
your love for me is gone
i know beyond a doubt
theres no use in hanging on
but i wish i was wrong

the world trembled there beneath me
it was more than i could stand
that youd take comfort in the arms
of another man

i searched my heart for answers
i looked deep down in my soul
from denial to revelation
that id have to let you go

but i wish i was wrong
your love for me is gone
i know beyond a doubt
theres no use in hanging on
but i wish i was wrong
yes i wish i was wrongsee travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeembed"
