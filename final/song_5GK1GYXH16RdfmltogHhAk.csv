once had a love and it was a gas
it soon turned out i had a heart of glass
seemed like the real thing only to find
much o mistrust loves gone behind
once had a love and it was divine
i soon found out i was losing my mind
it seemed like the real thing but i was so blind
much o mistrust loves gone behind

verse 1
in between what i find is pleasing and im feeling fine
love is so confusing theres no peace of mind
if i fear im losing you its just no good
you teasing like you do

chorus
once had a love and it was a gas
it soon turned out i had a heart of glass
seemed like the real thing only to find
much o mistrust loves gone bеhind

verse 2
lost inside adorable illusion and i cannot hide
im thе one youre using please dont push me aside
