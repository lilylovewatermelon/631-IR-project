home for seven days and i havent even seen your face
i guess ive got a flight to change
there aint nothin left to say
if you really dont have it figured out by now
theres no need for me to hang around
ive gotta get out of town

chorus
five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
half empty plane on new years eve
love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
the pilot comes on says the year is almost gone
five four three two one
looks like its just me and the whiskey
cause you aint here to kiss me
you aint here to kiss me

verse 2
raise a toast to the thought of you and me
this was just the way it had to be
90 proof to give me clarity
the flight attendant must know that somethings going on
cant hide the look of love gone wrong
so shes pouring them a little strong
see brett young liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likechorus
five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
half empty plane on new years eve
love birds in the row in front of me are driving me crazy
the pilot comes on says the year is almost gone
five four three two one
looks like its just me and the whiskey
cause you aint here to kiss me
you aint here to kiss me

bridge
at least we had a chance to know how it feels to love
but it turns out love aint always enough
so ill start getting over you

chorus 2
with another five dollar drink and a lonely window seat
half empty plane on new years eve
love birds in the row in front of me just like we used to be
the pilot comes on says the year is almost gone
five four three two one
looks like its just me and the whiskey
cause you aint here to kiss me yeah
you aint here to kiss me
you aint here to kiss meembed"
