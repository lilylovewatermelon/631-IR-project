sometimes tears say all there is to say
sometime your first scars wont ever fade away

tried to break my heart well its broke
tried to hang me high well im choked
wanted rain on me well im soaked soaked to the skin
its the end where i begin its the end where i begin

and sometimes weve no choice but to walk away away

tried to hang me high well im choked
wanted rain on me well im soaked soaked to the skin
its the end where i begin its the end where i begin

ive shed all the pain ive been holding on
the cure for a heart is to move along
so move along so move along
