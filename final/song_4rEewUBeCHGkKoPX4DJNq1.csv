you burn so bright i see stars
the way that you laugh its like a heavenly choir
you made me feel invincible
when youre with me i can take on the world

chorus
you were a comet and i lost it
watching for comets will i see you again
you burn so bright you burn me up tonight

verse 2
say my name ill be there
i didnt know you shouldve said that you cared
its not too late for broken hearts
take my hand make a wish on a star

chorus john cooper  jen ledger
you were a comet and i lost it
watching for comets will i see you again
everybody needs someone but they cant feel like this
how can i breathe with this burning in my chest
you were gone so fast i want you back
you were a comet and i lost it
time to spread my wings and fly
watching for comets will i see you again
time to fly away so high
see skillet liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
now i see you im frozen in time
all your colors burst into life
i dont dare close my eyes
cause a love like this happens once in a lifetime

chorus john cooper  jen ledger
you were a comet and i lost it
watching for comets will i see you again
everybody needs someone but they cant feel like this
how can i breathe with this burning in my chest
you were gone so fast i want you back
you were a comet and i lost it
time to spread my wings and fly
watching for comets will i see you again
time to fly away so high

you burn so bright you burn me up tonight9embed"
