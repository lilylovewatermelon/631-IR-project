all the fear and the fire of the end of the world
happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
happens great happens sweet
happily im unfazed here too

chorus
wasteland baby
im in love im in love with you
verse 2
all the things yet to come are the things that have passed
like the holding of hands like the breaking of glass
like the bonfire that burns that all words in the fight fell to

chorus
wasteland baby
im in love im in love with you
and i love too that love soon might end
be known in its aching
shown in the shaking
lately of my wasteland baby
be still my indelible friend you are unbreaking
though quaking though crazy
thats just wasteland baby
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeverse 3
and that day that well watch the death of the sun
that the cloud and the cold and those jeans youll have on
and youll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

chorus
wasteland baby
im in love im in love with you
and i love too that love soon might end
be known in its aching
shown in the shaking
lately of my wasteland baby
be still my indelible friend you are unbreaking
though quaking though crazy
thats wasteland baby

bridge
when the stench of the sea and the absence of green
are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
are the end but the start of all things that are left to do

chorus
wasteland baby
im in love im in love with you

outro
thats it14embed"
