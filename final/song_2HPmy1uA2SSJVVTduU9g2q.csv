verse pitbull
iiiim involved in the music business
but the funny thing is half of these fools dont know music
dont know business
have no business in music what is this
i learned from the best stayed away from the worst
now i send off every verse in a hearse
now that every day is 15th and the 1st
no more food stamps church
these boys cant get past third base
they a bunch of mcs searchin
i can care less and you can give
a fat babys ass if they cars got curtains
they rap for the block i speak to the globe
i got them models they holla at them hoes
better do your homework papito
i took the 305 worldwide
