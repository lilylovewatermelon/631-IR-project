read it in the paper
marked the date on the wall
to remind myself to celebrate
the day i lose it all
they made plans to be together
i made plans to be alone
she got a rock
im getting stoned
damn right ive got objections
but its awful too late now
yeah the cans are on the limo
and the rice is on the ground
theyre headed for the islands
but hell im already gone
she got a rock
im getting stoned

chorus
heres to happy ever after
and heres to balls and chains
and heres to all us haters
of old lovers new last names
and heres to holding up
and getting right where i belong
she got a rock
im getting stoned

when i heard those wedding bells
that preacher was my jailer

and the white horse they rode out on
