what is cinco cervezas i really dont know
but this pretty little senorita said it and i liked how it flowed
what is venga mi casa i really dont know
from the way that she smiled i could tell how the story would go

chorus rikrok  shaggy
chica bonita you pretty like a rose
mi senorita mi love how you a pose
dame un beso you hot and it shows
toca mi vida and everybody knows

verse 1 shaggy
baby baby baby
tell me what you wanna do and where you wanna go
aint no need to rush it baby we can take it slow
i swear it must be cupid shooting arrows with his bow
i notice in your eyes a certain glow
have me wondering now
is it really me or tell me do you feel the same
i feel like im in love and i dont even know your name
i know what i am saying to you may sound pretty lame
your love is like an everlasting flame

prechorus rikrok  shaggy
what is cinco cervezas i really dont know
but this pretty little senorita said it and i liked how it flowed
what is venga mi casa i really dont know
from the way that she smiled i could tell how the story would go

verse 2 shaggy
lovely lady would you
please give me a signal so i know you understand
maybe i should start by making gestures with my hand
girl youre like a rising star and im your biggest fan
my sweet bonita diva with the tan
got me thinking baby
we could make a life together on the ocean shore
paradise is where you are im ready to explore
can never get enough of you its all about amour
and happiness is knocking at your door
