know you wanna play round
well baby im on the playground
hop on up get on down
and wiggle that thing thats so round

verse 1
somethin in the way you treat me like you do
two can play the game when it feels so right next to you
and we can leave up out of here bring your body here
two can feel the same on nights where love is the plan

chorus
know you wanna play round
well baby im on the playground
hop on up get on down
and wiggle that thing thats so round
know you wanna play round
well baby im on the playground
hop on up get on down
and wiggle that thing thats so round

verse 2
remember all the days you left me by the phone
you love to hesitate now you are the second place
you must have saw me out holdin hands with someone else
baby blink without a doubt i see the signs you keep givin me
