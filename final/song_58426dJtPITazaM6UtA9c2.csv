mmmh
baby when you pull your hair back
kinda like red lipstick slow rollin on your lips
the mirror on a saturday night
oh you got that look in your eye
i see you slippin on your high heels
worn out of town edge of the bed showin some leg
when you doin that hallway walk
oh baby i can barely talk

chorus
makin me say mmm
i cant fight it
ill do anything you want to do tonight
so oh hell
little black dress got me in a mess cant even say yes
got me tongue tied and wideeyed
and cant lie i like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
i like it when you make me say mmm

verse 2
when you get a little ticked off
and a four letter word slips out of your mouth
i cant help but laugh
youre so sexy when youre mad
the way that you can get your buzz on one or two drinks
cute little dimple on your cheeks
start throwing flirty lines at me
saying baby come and dance with me
dance with me
see brett young liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likechorus
makin me say mmm
i cant fight it
ill do anything you want to do tonight
so oh hell
little black dress got me in a mess cant even say yes
got me tongue tied and wideeyed
and cant lie i like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
i like it when you make me say
mmmh
i like it when you make me say

bridge
girl you got me sayin good lord god bless amen
again and again
sayin good lord god bless amen

chorus
makin me say mmm
i cant fight it
ill do anything you want to do tonight
so oh hell
little black dress got me in a mess cant even say yes
got me tongue tied and wideeyed
and cant lie i like it when you make me say mmm ooooh
i like it when you make me say mmm
i like it when you make me say mmm
i like it when you make me say
oooh
i like it when you make me say mmmembed"
