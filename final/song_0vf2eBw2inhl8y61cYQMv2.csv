lifes alright in devil town
were right no ones gonna catch us now
dad has bought a new car now
were fine no ones gonna catch us now okay
hey

verse 1
you said something dumb again
shes mad at least thats what they say
mum and daddy arent in love
thats fine ill settle for two birthdays

chorus
devil town is colder in the summertime
ill lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight well make it another night
i still get a little scared of something new
but i feel a little safer when im with you
falling doesnt feel so bad when i know youve fallen this way too

verse 2
were all dead in devil town
thats fine cause nothings gonna scare us now
were all in our dressing gowns mines white and stripey
yours is green and brown
see cavetown liveget tickets as low as 86you might also likeverse 3
i forgot my name again
i think thats something worth remembering
spiders in your favourite shoes
just leave them be cause theyre more scared of you

chorus
devil town is colder in the summertime
ill lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight well make it another night
i still get a little scared of something new
but i feel a little safer when im with you
falling doesnt feel so bad when i know youve fallen this way too

outro
devil town is colder in the summertime
ill lose my mind at least another thousand times
hold my hand tight well make it another night
i still get a little scared of something new
but i feel a little safer when im with you
falling doesnt feel so bad when i know youve fallen this way too58embed"
