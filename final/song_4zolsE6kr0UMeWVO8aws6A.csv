our concentration it contains a deadly flaw
our conversations change from words to blah blah blah
we took prescription drugs but look how much good that did
well i think i had a point but i just got distracted
cause lately it just seems to me
like weve got the letters add
branded into our mentality
we simply cant focus on anything

prechorus
because its 17 18 19 routine
and here at 23 its the same old me
and the one thing in the moment that we all happen to like
will only very temporarily kinda break the cycle
of the doubleedged sword
of being lazy and being bored
we just want more and more and more
until its all we can afford

chorus
to keep our eyes open for just one more day
to keep on hoping that well stumble on our way
to keep our minds open for just one more day
cause its completely up to us
to maintain consciousness

no one can possibly listen to this
more than 4 reps is just monotonous
were losing interest
losing interest
losing interest

cause its 17 18 19 routine

we just want more and more and more

chorus
to keep our eyes open for just one more day
to keep on hoping that well stumble on our way
to keep our minds open for just one more day
cause its completely up to us
to maintain consciousness
keep our eyes open for just one more day
to keep on hoping that well stumble on our way
to keep our minds open for just one more day
cause its completely up to us
