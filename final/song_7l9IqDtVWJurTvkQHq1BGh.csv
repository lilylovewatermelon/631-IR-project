verse 1
you want the girl with the small waist
and the perfect smile
someone whos out every weekday
in her dads new car
you tell me i shouldnt stress out
say its not that hard
but i just got a feeling
this will leave an ugly scar

prechorus
if you say shes nothing to worry about
then whyd you close your eyes when you said it out loud

chorus
stupid boy making me so sad
didnt think you could change this fast
shes got everything that i dont have
how could i ever compete with that
i know youll go and change your mind
one day wake up and be bored with mine
shes got everything that i dont havе
and shes all i wanna be all i wanna be so bad so bad
shеs got everything that i dont have hmmm

you want someone you can show off
whenever you go out
shell wear a tight mini black dress
with all her friends around
and then youll probably spend the night at
her nice big house
and by then ill just be someone
youve forgotten about oh

prechorus
if you say shes nothing to worry about
then whyd you close your eyes when you said it out loud

chorus
stupid boy making me so sad
didnt think you could change this fast
shes got everything that i dont have
how could i ever compete with that
i know youll go and change your mind
one day wake up and be bored with mine
shes got everything that i dont have
and shes all i wanna be all i wanna be so bad so bad
shes got everything that i dont have
and shes all i wanna be all i wanna be
