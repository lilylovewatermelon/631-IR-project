seventeen we owned those streets
parking lot that was our spot
that’s where we’d always meet
and we’d roll on out in a pickup truck parade
stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of nowhere usa
we’d light the midnight up

chorus
wed drive too fast
wed get too loud
we thought we made the world go ‘round
nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
set up on the big hill
make a toast drink it down
say yeah man we run this town

verse 2
all the girls next door
they’d meet us out there
they couldn’t wait to get away
and come and let down their hair
we were rough around the edges
they were sweet as they could be
they were way too good
but they still let us steal a little kiss before they’d leave
guess they thought we were cool because

wed drive too fast
wed get too loud
yeah we thought we made the world go ‘round
drop it down in fourwheel
set up on a big hill
and make a toast drink it down
say yeah man we run this town

bridge
from crazy kids to dirt road kings
oh we didn’t know nothin
but we knew everything

chorus
wed drive too fast
wed get too loud
we thought we made the world go ‘round
nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
set up on the big hill
make a toast drink it down
say yeah man we run this town

outro
high five and look around
damn right we run this town
man i love this town
come on1embed"
