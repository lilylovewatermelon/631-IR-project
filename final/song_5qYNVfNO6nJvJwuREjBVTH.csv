no matter where i go
youre gettin your drinks for free
and just talkin with those rich folks you know
you did the bouncers and all of their friends now baby
bartenders too
so when they find out that youre only 19
there wont be anything they can do

but i dont come round here to meet nice people anyway
and what the hell am i doing drunk in the middle of the day
and i can feel the departure of all of my hardearned pay
but with the shades drawn everything just drifts away
and with the shades drawn everything just drifts away

but im sure that i will see you round town now baby
cause this towns way too small
im sure that ill run into you smokin and leanin on that bathroom wall
and heres hopin that tonight maybe you will drag some gorilla on home
so for about an hour or two you wont hafta feel like youre all alone
