come on yea ha ya busta rhymes baby yea ha

verse 1 busta rhymes
got a lot of niggas rollin with ya holla
cause you know we ripped it hotter than them other niggas
spot a nigga gettin dollars not another nigga
can do it the way that we cocked and shot another nigga
think he deserved the way he was boppin with a cherry copper
glitter blood fella send a cop to get em
its funny the way the iron just to drop you quicker
why i hit yall with the fire think i got a winner
stackin a crib with a chick that make a proper dinner
black in the range with tint and chrome aqua spinnin
parked right next to the benz with a soap opera and the tv
up in the dash costarrin a opera singer
that be the type of bullshit i be on and stay hot
i stop whippin a bentley to whip a mercedes maeboch
and keep runnin around the street like my name was mel patch nigga
come through your hood and take your whole block come on
and while we give it to ya
