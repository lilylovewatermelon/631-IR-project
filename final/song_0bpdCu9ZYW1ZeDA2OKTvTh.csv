i wanna take you down to the river
i wanna wash the blood from your hands
i wanna make you see you belong to me
and you wont ever win
i wanna walk out over the water
i wanna tear my heart from my chest
i wanna change my face
wanna leave this place
start all over again
well dont you know

chorus
youre wasted
got more than you asked for
wasted
youre in through the out door
ohohohohoh youre a lucky kid
wasted

verse 2
i wanna turn you into a corvette
i wanna drive you out of your mind
i wanna watch your face
when you reach that place
that you could never find
i wanna make you scream for mercy
i wanna break the silence within
and take you to your knees
just like you did me
and crawl around in your skin
oh dont you know
