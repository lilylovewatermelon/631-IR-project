usually never cry at all
i would say im pretty tough
but its been a couple weeks now and i still feel stuck in my lungs
and usually i go out on nights
and not think of you once
but if they start playin that song
i cant help but to think about us oh oh

prechorus
really thought id be done with the hardest part
when i pulled myself out of your arms
wish i knew that was only the start
and now im fallin apart cause

chorus
last night for the very first time
you didnt even try to call
oh i i wont lie
i thought i might die
i couldnt even sleep at all
and maybe ill get used to it ah ah ahah ah
but right now i just feel like shit ah ah ahah ah
oh oh

verse 2
so i kissed somebody else
just to see how it felt
but all that was goin through my brain
was your hands around my waist
you know how to do it so well
