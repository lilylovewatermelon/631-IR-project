verse 1 rick ross
i was birthed in a crackhouse
but what made it worse every first is a packed house
little brother knowin life illegal
no toys just playin with pipes and needles

five thousand on the paint just so life will see ya
green cards for the free lunch
now its green cards screen large and the seats crush
big guns for the other side
