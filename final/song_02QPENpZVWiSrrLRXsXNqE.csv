verse 1
sittin here alone im lookin back on where ive roamed

and there was not a stone i did not leave unturned
and i was havin a good time

but one day youre going to say i saw the light

verse 3
and now headin for that hill and i just cannot wait until
my children grow up to have children of their own
and ill be tellin them about the times i turned the party out
and how i stood against an army all alone all alone yeah
drinkin wine and staying high and realized it couldnt last
and how i turned myself around and went down another path
and the signs we must observe when lifes changes do occur
but most of all ill tell them just how proud i am of them
and always have a good time have a good time
its all the love and good times woo
lets all have a good time yeah
