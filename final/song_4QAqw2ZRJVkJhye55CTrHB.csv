friday night last orders at the pub
get in the car and drive to the club
theres a massive crowd outside so we get into the queue
its quarter past eleven now we wont get in til quarter to

verse 2
its quarter to and we get to the front
girl on the guest list dressed like a cunt
she asked security to check inside my shoes
you can play this game with me but you know youre gonna lose

prechorus
looked me up and down
i dont make a sound
theres a lesson that i want you to learn
is if youre gonna play with fire then youre gonna get burned

chorus
dont try and test me cause youll get a reaction
another drink and im ready for action
i dont know who you think you are
but making people scared wont get you very far

verse 3
in the club make our way to the bar
good dancing love but you shouldve worn a bra
guy on the mic and hes making too much noise
theres these girls in the corner want attention from the boys
you might also likeverse 4
i see these girls and theyre shouting through the crowd
dont understand why theyre being really loud
make their way over to me and try and push me out the way
i push her back she looks at me and says what ya tryna say

prechorus
looked me up and down
i dont make a sound
theres a lesson that i want you to learn
is if youre gonna play with fire then youre gonna get burned

chorus
dont try and test me cause youll get reaction
another drink and im ready for action
i dont know who you think you are
but making people scared wont get you very far
dont try and test me cause youll get reaction
another drink and im ready for action
i dont know who you think you are
but making people scared wont get you very far1embed"
