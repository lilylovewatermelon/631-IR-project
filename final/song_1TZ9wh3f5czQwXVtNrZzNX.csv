verse 3 de la soul
ha how you actually have the audacity to think
you can strut past me without lips trying to link
we know the lip service gets them
tingling in nervous system
every spot of ink on your legs and arms
is all mine a charm
and i plan to be in it
from every second of the minute
miss independent like record contracts
to contacts of lips is lunar
eclipse the moon
as soon as eyes clash we strum a new tune
makes my self all knee deep in the stroke knee deep
girl you know i cant sleep til i poke
dont fret come and creep with a bloke
lets go
