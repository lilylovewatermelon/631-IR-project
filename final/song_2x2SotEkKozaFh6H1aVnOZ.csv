up in the morning
up in the evening
picking up clocks
when the birds come back to eat
oh to eat
up on the mountain
down in the kings lair
pushing these blocks
in the heat of the afternoon
oh afternoon

prechorus
we were never welcome here
we were never welcome here at all

chorus 1
its who we are
doesnt matter if weve gone too far
doesnt matter if its all okay
doesnt matter if its not our day
oh wont you save us
what we are
dont look clear
cause its all uphill from here

up in the attic
down in the cellar
lost in the static
coming back for more
oh for more
out with the reason
in with the season
taking down names
in my book of jealousy

we were never welcome here
