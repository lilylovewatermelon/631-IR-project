fast
thats the kind of car you wanna drive when youre sixteen
fast
thats the kind of boys that you want on your home team
fast
yeah you think youre gonna catch your big dreams just like that
fast
and here you are looking back

chorus
sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
ticktock wont stop around it goes
sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
all you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
but you cant man
it just goes too fast

verse 2
fast
thats what your parents said when we were falling in love
its too fast
there aint no way the two of us were ever going to last
but we did and here we are and our only problem is
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
ticktock wont stop around it goes
sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
all you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
but you cant man
it just goes too fast

bridge
looking at you looking out the window right now
those eyes that dress that smile that laugh
if i could hit pause i would somehow
but it dont work like that

chorus
sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
ticktock wont stop around it goes
sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
all you keep trying to do is slow it down soak it in
youre trying to make the good times last as long as you can
but you cant man
it goes too fast
it just goes too fast
way too fast3embed"
