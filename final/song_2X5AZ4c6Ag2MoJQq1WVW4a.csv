ate lunch with the devil was dancin with death
im makin the most of the chance i have left
one hand to the sky one hand on my chest
if you ask if im scared then the answer is yes
i done been up i done been poor
not even a dollar i slept on the floor
im mounting the problems they cant be ignored
i came from the bottom to settle the score
lord gave me a shot with this music
i promise them no more excuses
im tryin so hard you can tell by my scars
and my past is so damn abusive
its time i tell you what the truth is
some days i swear i feel useless
my happiness has been elusive
i had an encounter with judas
somewhere in the dark along the line i lost my mind
the old me is a prisoner thats somewhere lost in time
i had family i treated right that tried to take my life
look at my back and you wont find no room to put another knife

prechorus
i lost my mind
i got no shame
and i keep tryin not to cry
got this ice runnin through my veins
and i got fire in my eyes
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
all the things that ive done in the darkness
all the nights that my mind wasnt whole
and down in my soul theres just one thing i know
heaven aint a place you go lookin for
they all fall down
just like a house of cards
they all fall down
and heaven aint a place you go lookin for

verse 2
hold up
throw me a second lets roll up
been struggling tryna get sober
fuck it pass me the drink and lets pour up
but dont ask whats in my styrofoam
you can tell the lights are on
but there aint nobody home
been smokin that killer shit
you can tell that im feelin it
you can tell that im really lit
out of body experience
back in my zone packin my bag
aint been the same since that happened to dad
ive been barefooted while walkin on glass
surrounded by flames with a can full of gas
ready for war put on my armor
im doin this for my son and my daughter
as i kneel down at the foot of the father
left all my problems right there at the alter
and he washed away every sin
now im back and im better than ive ever been
prechorus
i lost my mind
i got no shame
and i keep tryin not to cry
got this ice runnin through my veins
and i got fire in my eyes

chorus
all the things that ive done in the darkness
all the nights that my mind wasnt whole
and down in my soul theres just one thing i know
heaven aint a place you go lookin for
they all fall down
just like a house of cards
they all fall down
and heaven aint a place you go lookin for1embed"
