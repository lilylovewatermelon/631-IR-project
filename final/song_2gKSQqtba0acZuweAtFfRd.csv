we started in october
drowned our sins in cold november rain
thoughts all through december
prayed for snow to cover up the pain
been so long under winters night
waiting for the sun
watching the horizon

chorus
everybodys coming home for summer
but still feels a thousand miles away
what a feeling taste the freedom
there with every bite
finally were coming home

verse 2
we shadowboxed the enemy
swing until we extradite our fears
their backed into a corner
ring the bell we shed our blood and tears
like hibernating sunrays hoping for the sun
watching the horizon

chorus
everybodys coming home for summer
but still feels a thousand miles away
what a feeling taste the freedom
there with every bite
finally were coming home

oh we suffered in silence
through storms and through violence
weve stayed our way
the waves have subsided
the clouds have divided
found a reason to survive
found the will to stay alive
that will be the last thing that we do
heading for summer
back home for summer

chorus
everybodys coming home for summer
everybody
but still feels a thousand miles away
what a feeling what a feeling
taste the freedom freedom
there with every bite
finally were coming home
oh were coming home
oh im coming home3embed"
