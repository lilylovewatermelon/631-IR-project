oh oh ooh

we were together for a while you know
things didnt work out but
i cant even be mad with him you know ooh
cause we had some moments for true
its like a
yo ill explain listen

verse 1 natalie
we wrote fairy tales of how well live in castles
tight like hansel and gretel and grow old and settle
in a town that well title with our merry day
we got a love like that like every day like every way
i cannot stay at yours tonight
we can hold tight love bite and share some soul
we can pick and roll lose control or let me take it
like how i let you break it
dont forget we could get high on each other
and serve time for it through the night and
back into the morning
cant crack the habit you see im fiending
im needing some more and you got me grinning
like its money that im winning
no way is this ending cause you got me feeling purer than thou
show me how do you do this thing
cause you got me singing like

yo for real
he had me singing like
some kinda opera shit yo
i dont know where we went with it it was like
i used to turn to him and just whisper in his ear
cause yo i made him little promises like id say ummm

verse 2 natalie
ill crown you king of this throne
if you can take me home like run with no stripes
doesnt have to be tonight
hows about early morning im talking am
we can beat the dawn or
just chill through time barriers
cant help the whispers of i do
but you see through my poker test
got me making game faces
in london we say lacing you say making sense
this shits intense
i kinda  cause you move me so
i broke my role and got freaky with it
you chastise me with my own belt i aint gonna lie
i felt the universe move
you left me singing like opera like cleopatra or madam butterfly
yo this shits so good it brought tears to my eyes
i was like
spoken natalie
im telling you man its no lie

i just yo i i couldnt even let him walk pass me
i was like grabbing on him
and we were happy for a minute for true
after the session wed be like yo yo

verse 3 natalie
yo was that supposed to happen
all that foot tappin voice breakin
now im carving kamasutra diagrams with the headboard
ignored the buzzer 4 times got up hard telling lies
even surprised myself with my conniving ways
i dived in like he meant survival
like he was christened h20
like he could make the trees grow
and the clouds spit snow
he laid kisses on my chest like his name was zorro
got me saying hell no when he said he had to go
i was hiding clothes and play fighting like children
we were clashing our titans till weight we were losing
i had slum village album on repeat
we were knocking boots to hiphop beats
i even reached my maximum in my sleep yo
he had me singing like like
spoken natalie
yo for real
im not lying listen uh it was like
im gonna break it down the truth is
i almost got goose pimples now just thinking about that shit yo
just his voice if i could hear his voice right now
id answer the phone like
you know what i mean yo
listen if i knew where he was right now id find him
we split we split ways yo we went about you know
we went about business
i wanna know if hes making somebody else hit that opera likd
you know cause i aint had none of that in a minute
its like

outro natalie marsha
yo yo yo its like oh oh oh oh oh
im telling you bro could look at me across the room
nah mean he just put on the face and be like yo wed gotta go home
thats the truthembed"
