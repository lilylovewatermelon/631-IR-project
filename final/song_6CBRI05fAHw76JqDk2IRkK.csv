well im not talking bout locking down forever baby
that would be too demanding
im just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding
im not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether were wrong or were right
im not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out
im just talkin bout tonight

verse 1
you were sitting on your bar stool
talking to some fool who
didnt have a clue
i guess he couldnt see
you were looking right at me
cause i was looking at you too
then its do you wanna dance
have we ever met
you said hold your horses boy
i aint that easy to get

chorus
well im not talking bout locking down forever baby
that would be too demanding
im just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding
im not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether were wrong or were right
im not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out
im just talkin bout tonight
you might also likeverse 2
she said i only take it slow
by now you oughta know
that i aint digging this
if we can start as friends
the weekend just might end
with a little kiss
she said im a lady looking
for a man in my life
who will make a good husband
ill make a good wife
easy now

chorus
well im not talking bout locking down forever baby
that would be too demanding
im just talkin bout two lonely people
who might reach a little understanding
im not talkin bout knocking out heaven
with whether were wrong or were right
see im not talkin bout hooking up and hanging out
im just talkin bout tonight
yeah im just talkin bout a little bit later tonightembed"
