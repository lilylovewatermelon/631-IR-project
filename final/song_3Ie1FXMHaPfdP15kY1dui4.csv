asleep in your cradle
given the world
youre still ungrateful
you bitch and whine
youre always entitled
you blame mommy and daddy
you think youre jesus christ

youve been sucking tit
safe in your cradle
given the world
but somehow unable
if talk is the game
then you take the title
your day is coming
despite your denial

like a parasite you got the easy life
im the hand that feeds
youre the dog that bites

ill be breaking breaking breaking your pride
youre sucking sucking sucking me dry
one day youll realize
youre no jesus christ
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likei dream of the day
your eyes are ripped open
you eat your words
spit up and start choking
talk like a man
but walk like a child
your day is coming
despite your denial

ill be breaking breaking breaking your pride
youre sucking sucking sucking me dry
one day youll realize why cant you realize
youre no jesus christ

give up step back rewind repeat

and then youll see one day
that you could be like a star someday1embed"
