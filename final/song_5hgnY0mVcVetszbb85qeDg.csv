see me up in the club with fiftyleven girls
posted in the back diamond fangs in my grill

every boy in here with me got that smoke
and every girl in here got to look me up and down

verse 2

the man aint ever seen a booty like this
and why you think you keep my name rollin off the tongue
cause when he wanna smash ill just write another one

bridge
estce que tu aimes le sexe
le sexe je veux dire lactivité physique le coït tu aimes ça 
tu ne tintéresses pas au sexe 
les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais cest une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

chorus
take all of me
i just wanna be the girl you like
the kind of girl you like
take all of me
i just wanna be the girl you like
the kind of girl you like is right here with me hello
