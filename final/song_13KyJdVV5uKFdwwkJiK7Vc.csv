alright give me one minute let me load this truck up with the dog in there ill be right there son
im waitin on you 
see ya in a minute


chorus brantley gilbert
yeah im chilling on a dirt road
laid back swerving like im george jones
smoke rolling out the window
an ice cold beer sitting in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
got me reminiscing on the good times
said im turning off the real life drive and thats right
hitting easy street on mud tires

verse 1 colt ford
back in the day potts farm was the place to go
load the truck up hit the dirt road
jump the barbed wire spread the word
light the bonfire then call the girls
king in the can and the marlboro man
jack and jim were a few good men
we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
better watch out for the boys in blue
and all this small town he said she said
aint it funny how rumors spread
like i know something yall dont know
man that shit is getting old
man mind your business watch your mouth
before i have to knock your loud ass out
no time for talking yall aint listening
them old dirt roads is what yall missing
see brantley gilbert liveget tickets as low as 38you might also likechorus brantley gilbert
yeah im chilling on a dirt road
laid back swerving like im george jones
smoke rolling out the window
an ice cold beer sitting in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
got me reminiscing on the good times
said im turning off the real life drive and thats right
hitting easy street on mud tires

verse 2 colt ford
i sit back and think about them good ole days
the way we were raised and our southern ways
we like corn bread and biscuits
and if its broke round here we fix it
see i can take yall where you need to go
down to my hood or back in them woods
we do it different round here thats right
but we sure do it good and we do it all night
so if you really want to know how it feels
to get off the road and truck with four wheels
jump on in tell ya friends
that well be raisin hell where the black top ends

chorus brantley gilbert
yeah im chilling on a dirt road
laid back swerving like im george jones
smoke rolling out the window
an ice cold beer sitting in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
got me reminiscing on the good times
said im turning off the real life drive and thats right
hitting easy street on mud tires hell yeah
verse 3 brantley gilbert
i was brought up in a small town in north georgia
raised on southern baptist morals
in a front row pew for the sunday roll call
now everybody praise the lord
i grew up learned how to hunt and fish
bust a 12 gauge pump and not miss
a life without work thats just a myth
never listen when they talking shit
my dad taught me how to stand my ground
be a man boy and never back down
dont start up something but if hes talking trash
you better throw the first punch and whoop his ass
now be somebody make a name for yourself
life is hard you go through hell
there comes a time when youve got to slow down
thats what we doing now

chorus brantley gilbert
yeah im chilling on a dirt road
laid back swerving like im george jones
smoke rolling out the window
an ice cold beer sitting in the console
memory lane up in the headlights
got me reminiscing on the good times
said im turning off the real life drive and thats right
hitting easy street on mud tires
