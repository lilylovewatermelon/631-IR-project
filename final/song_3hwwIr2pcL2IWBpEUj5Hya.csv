chorus
nigga yous a window shopper
mad at me i think i know why
nigga yous a window shopper
in the jewelry store lookin at shit you cant buy
nigga yous a window shopper
in the dealership tryna get a test drive
nigga yous a window shopper
mad as fuck when you see me ride by

verse 1
summertime white porsche carrera is milky
im on the grind let my paper stack but im filthy
its funny how niggas get to screwfacin at me
anyhow they aint got the heart to get at me
ill get down southsides the hood that i come from
so i dont cruise through nobody hood without my gun
they know the kid aint goin for all that bullshit
try and stick me ima let off a full clip
it aint my fault you don fucked up your reup
at the dice game who told you put a g up
everybody mad when they paper dont stack right
but when i come around yall niggas better act right
when we got the tops down you can hear the systems thump
nigga when we rollin rollin rollin
shut your block down quick to put a hole in a chump
nigga when we rollin rollin rollin

verse 2
niggas love me in la as soon as i pop in
they come to scoop me up at lax and i hop in
now when it comes to bad bitches you know i got them
some from long beach some from watts some from compton
you know a nigga wanna see how cali girls freak off
after that five hour flight from new york
i start spittin g at a bitch like a pimp mane
tell her meet me at the mondrian so we can do our thang
she can bring the lingerie wit her i suppose
then we can go from fully dressed to just havin no clothes
then she can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
then her best friend could potentially be next mane
listen mane shit changed i came up im doin my thang
homie im holdin holdin holdin
oh shit mane the store owner watchin you
fore somethin get stolen stolen stolen
