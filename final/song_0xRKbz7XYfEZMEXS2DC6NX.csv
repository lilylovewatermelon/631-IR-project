you know that blame shit getting old you keep assuming i care
another chase unfolds when the moon is full again
a silver bullet painted gold another trapped in the snare
cause even jesus cant save us baby

prechorus
even jesus cant save even jesus cant save
even jesus cant save us baby

chorus
so when the wolves awaken
and the witches burn
now tell me could you face it
when you start to turn

verse 2
keeping up with the ghost a dozen dimes for the dead
an apparition cold when the moon is full again
and you belong with your bones another throne made of death
cause even jesus cant save us baby

prechorus
even jesus cant save even jesus cant save
even jesus cant save us baby
