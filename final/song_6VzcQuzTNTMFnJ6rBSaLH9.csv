put a price on emotion
im looking for something to buy
youve got my devotion
but man i can hate you sometimes
i dont want to fight you
and i dont want to sleep in the dirt
well get the drinks in
so ill get to thinking of her

chorus
well be a fine line
well be a fine line
well be a fine line
well be a fine line
well be a fine line
well be a fine line

verse 2
test of my patience
theres things that well never know
you sunshine you temptress
my hands at risk i fold
crisp trepidation
ill try to shake this soon
spreading you open
is the only way of knowing you

well be a fine line

well be a fine line
well be a fine line
