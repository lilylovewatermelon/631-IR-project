verse 1
sick of all the shit thats keeping me down
if youre dead from the waist down
its easy staying down
i never thought about it twice
but you do pay the price
it aint your weekly cash
that feeds my mum the rice

verse 2
yo dont be calling me desperate
when im knocking on the door
every wall you build
ill knock it down to the floor

see me see me bubbling quietly
see me see me acting like you aint met me
see me see me bubbling quietly
see me see me acting like you aint met me
