at night they would go walkin til the breakin of the day
the mornin is for sleepin
through the dark streets they go searchin to see god in their own way
save the nighttime for your weepin
your weepin

chorus
singin lalalalalalalay
and the night over london lay

verse 2
so we rode down to the river where victorian ghosts pray
for their curses to be broken
we go wander neath the arches where the witches are and they say
there are ghost towns in the ocean
the ocean

chorus
singin lalalalalalalay
and the night over london lay

guitar solo

verse 3
god is in the houses and god is in my head
and all the cemeteries of london
i see god come in my garden but i dont know what he said
for my heart it wasnt open
not open
