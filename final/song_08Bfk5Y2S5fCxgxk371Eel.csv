verse 1 rihanna
feels so good being bad ohohohohoh
theres no way im turning back ohohohohoh
now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure
oh oh ohohohohoh
love is great love is fine ohohohohoh
out the box outta line ohohohohoh
the affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
oh oh ohohohohoh

chorus rihanna
cause i may be bad but im perfectly good at it
sex in the air i dont care i love the smell of it
sticks and stones may break my bones
but chains and whips excite me
cause i may be bad but im perfectly good at it
sex in the air i dont care i love the smell of it
sticks and stones may break my bones
but chains and whips excite me
