verse 1 travis scott  the weeknd
pray for who lost they fate and died too young
pray for the ones i hate the ones i love
pray for my liver when im off in this club
i pray that the demons go away they hauntin us
man i cant take no more of this lifestyle we been living
man i cant take no more of the white powers in position
gotta grab up jwill gotta scoop up jrich
told chase we aint going back you know we gotta hitch
i mean im aggravated agitated i admit
intoxicated animated got me feeling kinda lit
contemplating fornicating might as well fuck up some shit
they looking at me way too crazy got me feeling communist
but im just trying to save the throne pray for bones pray for stix just ask the lonely
if my album never sell then we gon hit that lick
tell lamar call up cash tell him buzz me at the ritz just ask the lonely
its the weekend we off the deep end you need to pray for us

chorus the weeknd
oh oh dont pray for love
oh oh say it loud

verse 2 travis scott  the weeknd
let me tell the lost tale about jacques
let me tell you how i turned scott
how i went down on the block
waterfall around ten oclock
and how we came up getting all the knots dodging cops yeah
fore a nigga had the locks just ask the lonely
fore a nigga had the chain fore i had the bops
always kept my city on me like it was a swatch just ask the lonely
every time we in the party took it up a notch
now im thinking bout this new girl and she doing pop ohoh
wanna know my dick longer than a pringle box
dont pray for love
tired of seein these black kids on the face of fox ohoh
and fuck cnn they dont wanna see us win say it loud
mama dont you worry no no more worry no no more just ask the lonely
ima take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
you always told me what i plant that shit gotta grow just ask the lonely
and anything i detonate that shit gotta blow
pray for yall

bridge the weeknd  travis scott

verse 3 the weeknd
underrated is an understatement
they tryna test greatness a nigga tryna get paid
these niggas fiends watching all of my moves
cause the music like crack got me cooking all day
im right here you know where i stay
and if you dont then ask your girl she probably know the way
she like my show lights she wanna be wifey
she know that if she got me then she gon be good for life
so i pull out for the climax faster than a hihat
sorry baby i dont play
and if i did you know my kids would be ballin
and my daughter gon never meet a nigga like me
my niggas pull up in that rollsroyce
like they sell that coke boy shout out to the coke boys
they never pray for us nobody pray for us
nobody pray no no no no no

chorus the weeknd
oh oh dont pray for love oh oh
oh oh say it loud oh oh
just ask the lonely
just ask the lonely ohoh just ask the lonely96embed"
