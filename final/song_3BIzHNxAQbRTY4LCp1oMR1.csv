when his hand becomes a pool
in his head he aint a fool
pushing weight in hollywood
my gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
learning tricks from uncle donnie
and walt for our education
sloganeering on the lot
hes a nascent vagabond
motion picture babylon
when im twisted and alone
my gestalt is hanging on the edge of the fault
learning tricks from uncle donnie
and walt for a revelation
and if you thought this paradigm was out of the box
this rare design is only a block in the tesselationyou might also like2embed"
