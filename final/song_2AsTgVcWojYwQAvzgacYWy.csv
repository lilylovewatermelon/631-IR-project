realized i can never win
sometimes feel like i have failed
inside where do i begin
my mind is laughing at me
tell me why am i to blame
arent we supposed to be the same
thats why i will never tame
this thing thats burning in me

chorus
i am the one who chose my path
i am the one who couldnt last
i feel the life pulled from me
i feel the anger changing me

verse 2
sometimes i can never tell
if ive got something after me
thats why i just beg and plead
for this curse to leave me
tell me why am i to blame
arent we suppose to be the same
thats why i will never tame
this thing thats burning in me
