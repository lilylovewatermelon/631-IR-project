your little hands wrapped around my finger
and its so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
so i tuck you in turn on your favourite nightlight

prechorus
to you everythings funny
you got nothing to regret
id give all i have honey
if you could stay like that

chorus
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
i wont let nobody hurt you
wont let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up

postchorus
never grow up

verse 2
youre in the car on the way to the movies
and youre mortified your moms dropping you off
at fourteen theres just so much you cant do
and you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeprechorus
but dont make her drop you off around the block
remember that shes gettin older too
and dont lose the way that you dance around
in your pjs getting ready for school

chorus
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
no ones ever burned you
nothings ever left you scarred
and even though you want to
just try to never grow up

bridge
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps remember the words said
and all your little brothers favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone

verse 3
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city they just dropped me off
its so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
chorus
wish id never grown up
i wish id never grown up
oh i dont wanna grow up
wish id never grown up i could still be little
oh i dont wanna grow up
wish id never grown up it could still be simple
oh darling dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darlin dont you ever grow up
dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
i wont let nobody hurt you never grow up
wont let no one break your heart
and even though you want to
please try to never grow up

outro
oh oh never grow up
dont you ever grow up
oh never grow up
just never grow up24embed"
