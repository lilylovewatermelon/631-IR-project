but baby when youre done
you gotta be the first to run
rule number two
just dont get attached to
somebody you could lose
so lelet me tell you

this is how to be a heartbreaker
boys they like a little danger
well get him falling for a stranger a player
singing i lololove you

well get him falling for a stranger a player
singing i lololove you
