i just want to take you away from everyone
and keep you stashed under my pillow
and then id take you out simply for my own pleasure
and wear you when the occasions special

prechorus 1
then id put you on like a diamond
so i can sparkle and be the envy of my friends
id proudly hold the leash that id have you on
so you cant stray and follow me around all day

chorus
its too late now
i dont think it can fade
its too real now
fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

verse 2
compulsion has stained me im nervously cradling
our young love without known limits love
like a butterfly cupped in my hands i peek in
to see beauty trapped confined it flutters then

prechorus 2
it leaves behind colorful dust
to remind me of the special times weve spent
but of course it has to leave my clutch
but enoughs never enough to make a dent

and in time it will end
and there really isnt hope for the two of us
but right now i give inâ€¦

chorus
its too late now
i dont think it can fade
its too real now
fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
fulfillment just adds fuel to the
fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
