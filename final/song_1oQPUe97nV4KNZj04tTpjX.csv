fortune favors the bold
i guess that means that im meek as a lamb
or at least thats what ive been told
i guess thats just part of my circumstance
well some are born beautiful some are born fools
some play fair and some break the rules
but fortune favors the bold

chorus
i could sit here on my couch all day
wish my whole damn life away
or i could get up off my ass and grab the bull by the horns
still young enough and dumb enough to grow up fast
but ill save that part for last
im gonna take every chance i can for this rock n roll
fortune favors the bold

verse 2
well every dog has his day mine was on the 13th on a friday
and im like a chevrolet but id be more like a beamer if i had it my way
well some are in the clear some are still in the fog
some are in the gutter some are high on the hog
but fortune favors the bold

chorus
i could sit here on this couch all day
wish my whole damn life away
or i could get up off my ass and grab the bull by the horns
still young enough and dumb enough to grow up fast
but ill save that part for last
im gonna take every chance i can for this rock n roll
fortune favors the bold
