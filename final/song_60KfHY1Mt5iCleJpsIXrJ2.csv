it’s been five years since i’ve seen her face
she’s the holy ghost lost without a trace
and now we’re left with the “whatifs”
it’s been five years since she left for la
she’s an angel with a dirty face
and it seems to me
she’s a casualty of all the pressure
that we put on her
and now we’ve lost her for good

chorus 1
it’s such a shame shame shame
that our homecoming queen
was a lot like you and a lot like me
and she never walked on water
guess no one really saw her

verse 2
she was so adored by everyone
when it came to looks she was next to none
but loved partin’ and havin’ too much fun
then she hooked up with the wrong someone
and he promised everything under the sun
and it seems to me
she’s a casualty of all the pressure
that he put on her
and now we’ve lost her for good

it’s such a shame shame shame
that our homecoming queen
was a lot like you and a lot like me
and she never walked on water
guess no one really saw her
a shame shame shame
that our homecoming queen
had a lot to prove and so many to please
she’s just somebody’s daughter
just lookin’ for somebody to love her

well i never knew you
wish i could’ve saved you
from losers that drained you
before you got strung out
with so much potential
how could you let us down

chorus
it’s such a shame shame shame
that our homecoming queen
was a lot like you and a lot like me
and she never walked on water
guess no one really saw her
shame shame shame
that our homecoming queen
had a lot to prove and so many to please
she’s just somebody’s daughter
just lookin’ for somebody to love her
she’s just somebody’s daughter
just lookin’ for somebody to love her
