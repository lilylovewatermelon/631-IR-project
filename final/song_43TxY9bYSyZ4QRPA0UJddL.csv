what have we done with innocence
it disappeared with time it never made much sense
adolescent resident
wasting another night on plannin my revenge

prechorus

dont wanna be your monkey wrench
one more indecent accident
id rather leave than suffer this
ill never be your monkey wrench

all this time to make amends
what do you do when all your enemies are friends
now and then ill try to bend
under pressure wind up snapping in the end

one in ten

one last thing before i quit

i could fit into my head
i still remember every single word you said
and all the shit that somehow came along with it
still theres one thing that comforts me
since i was always caged and now im free

one more indecent accident
id rather leave than suffer this
ill never be your monkey wrench
