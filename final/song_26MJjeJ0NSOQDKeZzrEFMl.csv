its always on the tip of my tongue
i read an article on the internet
told me that thats how you know youre fallin in love
dont really trust whats on the internet
but maybe just this once

chorus lizzy mcalpine
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you

verse 2 lizzy mcalpine  finneas lizzy mcalpine
its always on the tip of my tongue
but i stop myself from sayin it
tell myself its not the right time or something dumb
but then you kiss me like you do
and were right back where we started from

chorus lizzy mcalpine  finneas
hatе to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knеw
hate to be lame but i might love you

bridge lizzy mcalpine
do i love him do i need him
do i want him do i care enough to say
that i love him that i need him
cause i dont but i want to feel okay
if i love him if i need him
maybe that will make him stay
if i lie will i still feel this way

its always in the back of my mind
maybe my mistakes are the reason
that i made it back to you in time
if i could rewind would there be some butterfly effect
what if we never met what if the stars never aligned

chorus lizzy mcalpine  finneas
hate to admit but it might be true
hate to admit but i think you knew
hate to be lame but i might love you
