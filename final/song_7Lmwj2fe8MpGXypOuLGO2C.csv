my old mans that old man spent his life livin off the land
dirty hands and a clean soul
it breaks his heart seein foreign cars filled with fuel that isnt ours
and wearin cotton we didnt grow

chorus
hes got the red white blue flyin high on the farm
semper fi tattooed on his left arm
spend a little more at the store for a tag
in the back that says usa
he wont buy nothin that he cant fix
with wd40 and a craftsman wrench
he aint prejudiced hes just
made in america

verse 2
he loves his wife but shes that wife that decorates on the 4th of july
but says every days independence day
shes golden rule teaches school some folks say it isnt cool
but she says the pledge of allegiance anyway

chorus
hes got the red white blue flyin high on the farm
semper fi tattooed on his left arm
spend a little more in the store for a tag
in the back that says usa
he wont buy nothin that he cant fix
with wd40 and a craftsman wrench
he aint prejudiced hes just
made in america

born in the heartland raised up a family
of king james and uncle sam

chorus
hes got the red white blue flyin high on the farm
semper fi tattooed on his left arm
spend a little more in the store for a tag
in the back that says usa
wont buy nothin that he cant fix
