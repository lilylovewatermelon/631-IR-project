you you got me
thinking itll be alright
you you told me
come and take a look inside
you believe me
in every single lie
but i i failed you this time

chorus
and it feels like tonight
i cant believe im broken inside
cant you see that theres nothing that i wanna do
but try to make it up to you
and it feels like tonight
tonight

verse 2
i was waiting
for the day youd come around
i was chasing
but nothing was all i found
from the moment you came into my life
you showed me whats right

chorus
and it feels like tonight
i cant believe im broken inside
cant you see that theres nothing that i wanna do
but try to make it up to you
and it feels like tonight
see daughtry liveget tickets as low as 158you might also likebridge
i never felt like this before
just when i leave im back for more
nothing else here seems to matter
in these everchanging days
youre the one thing that remains
i could stay like this forever

chorus
and it feels like tonight
i cant believe im broken inside
cant you see that theres nothing that i wanna do
but try to make it up to you
and it feels like tonight

outro
tonight feels like tonight
tonight feels like tonight
cant you see that theres nothing that i wanna do
but try to make it up to you
and it feels like tonight
tonight
