well i smoke and i fish
but not near enough to satisfy an itch
of a girl understand
i need something to do with my hands

verse 2
i dont work on a car
and im as bad at pool as i am at throwin darts
and golf not a fan
but i need something to do with my hands

so maybe i could stick em in your pockets
run em through your hair and we can get to rockin
there you are and baby here i am
and i need something to do with my hands

verse 3
i can play you a song
on this old guitar if it turns you on
if you want we could dance
but i need something to do with my hands

chorus
so maybe i could stick em in your pockets
run em through your hair and we can get to rockin
there you are and baby here i am
and i need something to do with my hands

so maybe i could stick em in your pockets
run em through your hair and we can get to rockin

and i need something to do with my hands
