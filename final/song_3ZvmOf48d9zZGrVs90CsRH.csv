verse 1
you dont have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
girl i know youre hurt
did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
it really works
lay your head back in my arms oh i know your worth
so just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
and lets leave this earth

hook
lets aim high oh girl
all you gotta do is close your eyes inhale the sigh and visualize
lets aim high

verse 2
you work so hard for your boss to him its just work
never considers your dreams selfish and mean
damn thats gotta hurt
just lay your head back in my arms girl
i know youre worth
so allow me to abduct your mind with these words
open your eyes youre now a bird

hook
lets aim high oh girl
all you gotta do is close your eyes inhale the sigh and visualize
lets aim high

outro
you possess the power to do
if you concentrate mountains will move
and if you just believe that its true
make no mistake ill be there too
