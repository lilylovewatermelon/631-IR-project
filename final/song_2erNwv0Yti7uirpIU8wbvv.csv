im sleeping my way out of this one
with anyone who will lie down
ill be stuck fixated on one star
when the world is crashing down

prechorus patrick stump brendon urie
i keep tellin myself i keep tellin myself
im not the desperate type
but youve got me looking in through blinds
i keep telling myself i keep telling myself
im not the desperate type

chorus patrick stump
sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isnt you
im not going home alone
cause i dont do too well
sitting out dances on the wall
trying to forget everything that isnt you
im not going home alone
cause i dont do too well on my own
