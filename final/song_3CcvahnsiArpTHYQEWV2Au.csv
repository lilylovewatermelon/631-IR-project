verse 1 ti
tip coming live from the vip
heard the nightlife lost life without me
both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
the whole city got bizzerk he got three
that other nigga got a hit but shawty he not me naw
who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
the king back now hoes dont even know how to act now
hit the club strippers getting naked fore i sat down
still balling money stack taller than shaq now
still push a button to let the roof on the lac down
im on the road doing shows putting my mack down
mississippi to philly albuquerque to chatttown
