verse 1 yung mutt
i got money on my mind bitch im blinded by the dollar signs
ill work a fucking ninetofive instead of signin dotted lines
by ninetofive i mean ive come to paint the town grey
with five fucking 9s im tryna take whats mine
which happens to be everythin that i see
might be selfish of me but if i dont pick a side
someone else is gettin cash and pine
dine and dash scraps is rationed
slash and gash scratchin rashes catchin rats
and slash its throat end up like a maxipad soaked

verse 2 ramirez
211 oneeightseven send them bustas straight to heaven
if that nigga talkin shit then he gon meet my smith  wesson
creepin out the fucking darkness
smurkin all these bustas ho
fucking with the devil son i rolls up on the flames fo sho
psychopathic lunatic im looking for a soul to steal
i put that glock up to yo grill and watch yo punk ass fucking squeal
look into my eyes see the thang that burns inside
fuckin with that triple six nigga this shall be your demise

verse 3 lick loth
havent had to kill yet but i was born a murderer
triple six my nation im the red devils chosen one
break in through the back give a fuck bout your burglar bars
when i was seventeen remember when we would burgle cars
my favorite gun that 45 i love how it bust
smoke leakin out your chest body stuffed in the trunk
im ridin round in hollygrove best believe i got that strap
cant fuck with you bitches but oddy got my back

verse 4 black smurf
still on that killa klan creep up behind shit
memphis made a nigga so you know im used to violence
ill fill ya up with slugs come play a thug
automatic to his chest have him coughin up a lung
catch a blast might for the cash it be ya ass
think fast for that four fifth lay ya in the grass
oneshot turned into ash so quick and fast
no joke my niggas soaked stay out my path nigga
