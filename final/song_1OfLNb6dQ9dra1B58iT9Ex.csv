darling ive just left the bar
and ive misplaced all my credit cards
my selfpreservation and all of my reservations
are sittin and contemplating what to do with me do with me
think i took it way too far
and im stumblin drunk getting in a car
my insecurities are hurtin me
someone please come and flirt with me
i really need a mirror thatll come along and tell me that im fine
i do it every time

prechorus
i keep on hanging on the line ignoring every warning sign
come on and make me feel alright again

chorus
cause its 3 am
and im callin everybody that i know
and here we go again
while im runnin through the numbers in my phone
and yeah ill take fake moans and dial tones
let em spill right down the microphone
i need it digital cause baby when its physical
i end up alone end up alone

verse 2
and every night i wanna live in color through a whiteblue screen
i got a technicolor vision going vivid in my whiteblue jeans
i know its complicated
cause everyone that ive dated says they hate it
cause they dont know what to do with me do with me
know that my identitys always getting the best of me
im the worst of my enemies
and i dont really know what to do with me
yeah i dont really know what to do with me

i keep on hanging on the line ignoring every warning sign
come on and make me feel alright again
