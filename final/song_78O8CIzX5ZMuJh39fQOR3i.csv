i breathe in slow to compose myself
but the bleeding heart i left on the shelf
started speeding now beating half to death
cause youre here and youre all mine
i press my lips down into your neck
and i stay there and i reconnect
bravery ive been trying to perfect
it can wait for a while

prechorus
scared of the hope in my head
its been making me sweat but it turns out
youre here with your head on my chest
i shouldve guessed

chorus
that the world will turn and well grow
well learn how to be
to be incomplete

verse 2
i breathe out now and we fall back in
just like before we can rebegin
let your lungs push slow up against my skin
let it all feel just right

gone is the emptiness
we just take whats best and we move on
all of the hurt gets left
i shouldve guessed

chorus
that the world will turn and well grow
well learn how to be
to be incomplete
this here now its where we
touch down you and me
lets be incomplete

bridge
howd we ever go without
i dont know but it looks like weve made it again
tell me youll never look down down

chorus
cause the world will turn and well grow
well learn how to be
to be incom

breakdown
i dont want to look down
i dont want us to break up in the clouds
all i want is to stay us to stay with you now
i dont want to look down
i dont want us to break up in the clouds
all i want is to stay us to stay with you now
chorus
and the world will turn and well grow
well learn how to be
to be incomplete
and this here now its where we
touch down you and me
lets be incomplete16embed"
