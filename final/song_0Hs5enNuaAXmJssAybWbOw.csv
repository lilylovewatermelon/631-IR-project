verse 1
shots of the henny bottles of patrón
blunts to your face you dont wanna sing no more lost your c notes
cabbed all day took the bus back home
evictions on your door blame it on the weed blame it on the booze
blame it on the night life lights passin you yeah
just dont blame it on me that you wanna come and party
with a nigga like me cause i get it
youre built like a goddess
and it seems like you been stressin
specially when your nose red
from that k special diet coke
you need more bread ‎now you got no rent
you blow that money money
you try to window shop you blow another hundred

and youre filled with regret
and you feel like you gotta go home oh
cause these nights pass so much quicker than the days did
same clothes you aint ready for your day shift
but you up you need money for ya face lift
lust over love is your mindset
waken up with most of your side wet
another room you hear your mom cryin
cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
and the bacardi from the last party
