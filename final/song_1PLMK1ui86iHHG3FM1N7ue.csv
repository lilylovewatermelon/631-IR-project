verse 1
wait wait a minute take a step back
you gotta think twice before you react
so stay stay a little while
cause a promise not kept is the road to exile
hey whats the circumstance
youll never be great without taking a chance so
wait you waited too long
had your hands in your pocket
when you shoulda been gone

prechorus

one push is all youll need
boomlay boomlay boom
a fist first philosophy
boomlay boomlay boom
we watch with wounded eyes
boomlay boomlay boom

verse 2
damn damn it all down
took one to the chest without even a sound
so what what are you worth
the things you love or the people you hurt
hey its like deja vu
a suicidal maniac with nothing to lose
so wait its the exception to the rule
everyone of us is expendable
