take your heart dont let me break it in two
im sure that i could possibly do nothin for you
im nearly on the edge im bout to jump in a few
im really not afraid of nothin

verse 1
look on everything
i gave everything and got nothing back
aint looking for no pat on backs
that aint how we got where the fuck we at
mama called where the fuck you at
on the road and i aint coming back
until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
and that hundred racks bring a bundle back
i was blowin gas like the honey badger
jid bitch the money snatcher
cest la vie shit im coming after everybody
dont get the bloody splatter
im fly and i got my niggas fly too
shit is like buddy passes
i wanna cry cause im numb inside ugh
if you wonder why ask whats the matter yeah

chorus
cause i been working hella hard shit aint really working out
i been praying to the lord shit aint really working out
i been looking to the stars keep my head up in the clouds
shit aint really working out shit aint really working out
shit aint really working out

verse 2
shit shit aint really working out huh
now i got a little bread got my niggas working outta town
baby your ass fat i can see you working out shit
and you got a new job tell me how that shit working out heh
heard you doing pretty good yeah people talk word of mouth
wasnt round when you had the dirty house
now they wont leave when you kick em out
these type of people cant stick around
only down when theres liquor round or the spliff around
thats why i dont fuck with niggas now
well i fuck with all my niggas you know the difference
you been living with tunnel vision
you and all of your friends are like wonder women
wonder woman working for it if you ever wanted something
searching for a purpose i see what you on
the difference in how you be using your gifts
in the midst of the shit that you dealing with
really specific you paid attention panoramic
you got the vision like a ferdelance
you attack and you kill it sinkin your teeth with the venom
kinda like me with these instrumentals
or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
pimpin since been pimpin keep it sensible
since you winning you a object of ridicule
objects appearing closer than you ready for
obviously you dont know whats ahead
but thats the reason you can work til you dead
chorus
i been working hella hard shit aint really working out
i been praying to the lord shit aint really working out
i been looking to the stars keep my head up in the clouds
shit aint really working out shit aint really working out
shit aint really working out
