shes got tickets to her own show
but nobody wants to go
and im stuck sitting in the front row
im singing along like theres no tomorrow

verse 1
its funny how you say that you made it on your own
when you havent worked for anyone your daddy didnt know
you say you got a job but i dont know what you do
such a fufufucking snob that youll never know the truth

prechorus
youre perfect on the outside but nothing at the core
its easy to forget when you show up at my door
stop messing with my mind cause youll never have my heart
but your perfect little body mamamakes me fall apart
your perfect little body mamamakes me fall apart

chorus
shes got tickets to her own show
but nobody wants to go
and im stuck sitting in the front row
im singing along like theres no tomorrow
