know why ive been blue
ive been praying for someone baby
exactly like you
why should we spend money on a show or two
while no one does those love scenes baby
exactly like you

you make me feel so grand
i wanna give this world to you
you seem to understand
each foolish little dream im dreaming
and the schemes im scheming

now i know why mother taught me to be true
she meant me for someone baby
exactly like you

just like you baby oh

mother meant me for someone exactly like you
