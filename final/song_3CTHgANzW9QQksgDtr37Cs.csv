a little heartache goes a long way
guess this is what love is all about
i missed on monday a terrible tuesday
maybe someday i can work it out
but here we go again its finally sinking in

chorus
thats just my kind of luck
but im not given up
i dont know what im thinkin
she got over me
thats no way to look
when you start addin up
i guess i must be dreamin
she got over me
whoa im over this feelin

verse 2
yes ill admit it hard to handle it
i stood my ground anything goes now
you dont ever let it get me down
maybe someday i can work it out
but here we go again
whoa its finally sinkin in

thats just my kind of luck
but im not given up
i dont know what im thinkin
she got over me
thats no way to look
when you start addin up
i guess i must be dreamin
she got over me
whoa im over this feelin

bridge
are you starin at the ceilin
are you counting all the stars
knowing im there in your heart
all is fair in love and war youll find your way
thanks for the battle scars

chorus
thats just my kind of luck
but im not given up
i dont know what im thinkin
she got over me
thats no way to look
when you start addin up
i guess i must be dreamin
she got over me
she got over me
whoa im over this feelin
she got over meembed"
