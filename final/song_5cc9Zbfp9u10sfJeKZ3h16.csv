no matter what you say or what you do
when im alone id rather be with you
fuck these other niggas ill be right by your side
til 3005 hol up

verse 1
okay hold up wait a minute all good just a week ago
crew at my house and we party every weekend so
on the radio thats my favorite song
make me bounce around like i dont know like i wont be here long
now the thrill is gone got no patience cause im not a doctor
girl why is you lying girl why you mufasa
yeah mi casa su casa got it stripping like gaza
got so high off volcanoes now the flow is so lava
yeah we spit that saliva iphone got message from viber
either the head is so hydra or we let bygones be bygones
my god you pay for your friends ill take that as a compliment
got a house full of homies why i feel so the opposite
incompetent aint the half of it
saturdays were young lavishing
saddest shit is im bad as it
beans they took from the cabinet woah
sorry im just scared of the future
til 3005 i got your back we can do this hol up

verse 2
i used to care what people thought but now i care more
i mean nobody out heres got it figured out
so therefore ive lost all hope of a happy ending
depending on whether or not its worth it
so insecure no ones perfect
we spend it with no shame we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine or leave it like cobain
and when im long gone whole crew sing a swan song
cause we all just ticking time bombs
got a lambo like lebrons mom
and no matter where all of my friends go
emily fam and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk at least i think so
cant tell
cause when them checks clear theyre not here
cause they dont care
its kinda sad but im laughing whatever happens
assassins im stabbed in the back of my cabin
labrador yapping im glad that it happened i mean it
between us i think theres something special
and if i lose my mental just hold my hand
even if you dont understand hol up
chorus
no matter what you say or what you do no no
when im alone id rather be with you you and me
fuck these other niggas ill be right by your side
til 3005 hol up hol up

hol up hol up hol up hol up
hol up hol up hol up hol up

no matter what you say or what you do
