brian top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
were grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder are you putting us under
cause we cant take our eyes off the tshirt and ties combination
well see you later innovator

verse 2
some want to kiss some want to kick you
theres not a net you couldnt slip through
or at least thats the impression i get cause youre smooth and youre wet
and shes not aware yet but shes yours
shell be saying use me show me the jacuzzi
i imagine that its there on a plate your whole rendezvous rate
means that youll never be frightened to make em wait for a while

bridge
i doubt its your style not to get what you set out to acquire
the eyes are on fire you are the unforecasted storm

verse 3
brian calm collected and commanding
top marks for not trying you leave the other story standing
with your renditions and jokes bet theres hundreds of blokes
that have wept cause youve stolen their thunder
are you putting us under
cause we cant take our eyes off the tshirt and ties combination
well see you later innovatoryou might also like54embed"
