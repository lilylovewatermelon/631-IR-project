its hard for me to see when im wrong
its hard for me to weep when im strong
but i could never sleep when youre gone
oh but still
if you were gonna crucify me
i wouldnt want nobody to see
cause you could kick me hard when im down
down down down

i dont want wanna be
nobodys fool
ive played that part so many times before
how i long to be
a shadow on the wall
i will make no sound at all
and when the sun goes down
the shadow on the wall
it cannot be seen at all
at all

over it
hey its not that you would mess with my head
i believe that you believe what you said
you think you know me best and you care
but thats not fair
cause i dont really want to be safe
it must have been the way i was raised
sleep with one eye open i say
hey hey hey
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likei dont wanna be
nobodys fool
ive played that part so many times before
how i long to be
a shadow on the wall
i will make no sound at all
and when the sun goes down
the shadow on the wall
it cannot be seen at all
at all

oh
how long to be
a shadow on the wall
i would make no sound at all
at allembed"
