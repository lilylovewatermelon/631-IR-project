warm yourself by the fire son
and the morning will come soon
ill tell you stories of a better time
in a place that we once knew
before we packed our bags
and left all this behind us in the dust
we had a place that we could call home
and a life no one could touch

chorus
dont hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i dont need your help now
you will let me down down down
dont hold me up now oh oh oh oh
i can stand my own ground
i dont need your help now
you will let me down down down down

verse 2
we are the angry and the desperate
the hungry and the cold
we are the ones who kept quiet
and always did what we were told oh oh oh
but weve been sweating while you slept so calm in the safety of your home
weve been pulling out the nails that hold up everything youve known

dont hold me up now
i can stand my own ground
i dont need your help now
you will let me down down down
dont hold me up now oh oh oh oh
i can stand my own ground
i dont need your help now
you will let me down down down

bridge
so open your eyes child lets be on our way hey hey
broken windows and ashes are guiding the way hey hey
keep quiet no longer well sing through the day hey hey
of the lives that weve lost and the lives weve reclaimed
