i speak for a man who gave for this land
took a bullet in the back for his pay
spilled his blood in the dirt and the dust
and hes come back to say

what he has seen is hard to believe
and it does no good to just pray
oh he asks of us to stand and we must
end this war today

chorus
with his mind hes saying no more
with his heart hes saying no more
with his life hes saying no more war

with his eyes hes saying no more
with his body hes saying no more
with his voice hes saying no more war
no more war

verse 2
yeah nothings too good for a veteran
yeah this is what they say
so nothing is what they will get
in this new american way
you might also likethe lies that were told to get us to go
were criminal let us be straight
lets get to the point where our voices are heard
behind the white house gates

chorus
with our minds were saying no more
with our hearts were saying no more
with our lives were saying no more war

with our eyes were saying no more
with our bodies were saying no more
with our voices were saying no more war
no more war

bridge
no more innocents dying
no more terrorizing
no more eulogizing
no more
no more evangelizing
no more
no more presidents lying
no more war

chorus
with our minds were saying no more
with our hearts were saying no more
with our lives were saying no more war
no more war
no more war
no more war
no more war
no more war
no more warembed"
