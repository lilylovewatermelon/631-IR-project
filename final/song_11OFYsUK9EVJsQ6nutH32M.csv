im not gonna lay around and whine and moan
cause somebody done done me wrong
dont think for a minute that im gonna sit around
and sing some old sad song

prechorus 1
i believe its half full not a half empty glass
every day i wake up knowing it could be my last

chorus
i aint here for a long time im here for a good time
so bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine
pour me some moonshine
when im gone put it in stone he left nothing behind
i aint here for a long time im here for a good time

verse 2
folks are always dreaming bout what theyd like to do
but i like to do just what i like
ill take the chance dance the dance
it might be wrong but then again it might be right

prechorus 2
theres no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
lifes too short to waste it i say bring on anything

i aint here for a long time im here for a good time
so bring on the sunshine to hell with the red wine
pour me some moonshine
when im gone put it in stone he left nothing behind
i aint here for a long time im here for a good time
i aint here for a long time im here for a good timeembed"
