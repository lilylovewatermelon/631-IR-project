verse 1
all of my exes they get to finding somebody till they realize that they need me
i’m on a island in mexico sexy hoes wit me you know that im sleazy
she wanna touch it and tease me i tell her fucking me aint easy
way out the border in canada ima still fuck her with stamina
im facing twentytwo years but i still fuck the pussy like i was fresh out
she finna come in the crib to come get it and i’m finna give her the rest now
dick her done sent her to sleep
soon as she said it was deep i went deeper to give her dick that last the rest of the week
mmm you having sex with a freak i be giving her neck while i speak
and she wanna give head on the highway im in the trenches too deep
we had a hell of a good time not moscato but the good wine
im going to work and she say that that pussy dont squirt
made it squirt but it took time
i just be serving you dick you just keep serving these bitches them looks
you dont need no one to get you to college you dont need no one to get you them books
sexy as hell your professor prolly test you and he give you a a for effort
i got no time to play in the night when we fucking im tryna make you stay forever
