trying to get the whole thing straight in my head
looking for a girl whod come with me swimming
and come and play tunes at the end of my bed oh

and all the hard men were drinking down petrol
bamming up the girls when in came the law
heading for the door and getting tongue tied
when they asked me what exactly i saw
so ill get some monte cristos
and we can all go see the band
well i may not be a looker yeah
but ill help you any way i can

well i was back at my room i was making me nervous
watching tv and picking my feet
wishing i was pretty and burning my shoes
and wishing for once id kept the receipt

i called myself and wondered out loud
tried to get the whole thing straight in my head
i left the tape running and played it back twice
but i couldnt make sense of what i had said

so ill get some monte cristos
and we can all go see the band
well i may not be a looker yeah
but ill help you any way i can
you might also likewell it may not make you handsome
and it may not even make you feel alive
you may not have the ransom
but you can always count on this
its him and them and she and me
and sick and muddy everybody

so ill get some monte cristos
and we can all go see the band
well i may not be a looker yeah
but ill help you any way i can

so you can bring your wasters banjo
bring your sister and her friend diane
well i may not have a big boys pistol
but ill help them any way i can
and you can call me cinderella
you can call me your best man
well you may be a right old queen
but ill help you any way i can well alrightembed"
