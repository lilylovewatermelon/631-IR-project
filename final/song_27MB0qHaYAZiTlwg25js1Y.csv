stay alive…
hamilton
i have never seen the general so despondent
i have taken over writing all his correspondence
congress writes “george attack the british forces”
i shoot back we have resorted to eating our horses
local merchants deny us equipment assistance
they only take british money so sing a song of sixpence

washington
the cavalry’s not coming

hamilton
but sir

washington
alex listen there’s only one way for us to win this
provoke outrage outright

hamilton

laurens
i stay at work with hamilton
we write essays against slavery
and every day’s a test of our camaraderie
and bravery

hamilton
we cut supply lines we steal contraband
we pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
and ev’ry day
“sir entrust me with a command”
and ev’ry day

washington

hamilton

laurens
a thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

lafayette
as we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

hamilton
charles lee was left behind
without a pot to piss in
he started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen

lee
washington cannot be left alone to his devices
indecisive from crisis to crisis
the best thing he can do for the revolution
is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in mount vernon

company
oo

washington
don’t do a thing history will prove him wrong

hamilton
but sir
washington
we have a war to fight let’s move along

laurens
