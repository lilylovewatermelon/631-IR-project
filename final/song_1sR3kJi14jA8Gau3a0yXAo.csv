well me and my lady had our first big fight
so i drove around til i saw the neon lights
of a corner bar and it just seemed right so i pulled up
not a soul around but the old bar keep
down at the end and looking half asleep
but he walked up and said whatll it be
i said the good stuff

prechorus 1
he didnt reach around for the whiskey
he didnt pour me a beer
his blue eyes kind of went misty
he said you cant find that here

chorus 1
cause its the first long kiss on a second date
mamas all worried when you get home late
and dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
cause your hands are shaking so much
and its the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
eating burnt suppers the whole first year
and asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
yeah man thats the good stuff

verse 2
he grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
and i smiled and said ill have some of that
we sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends
i saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
it was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
he said thats my bonnie
taken about a year after we were wed
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeprechorus 2
he said spent five years in the bottle
when the cancer took her from me
but ive been sober three years now
cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

chorus 2
was the sight of her holding my baby girl
the way she adored that string of pearls
i gave her the day that our youngest boy earl
married his high school love
and its a new tshirt saying im a grandpa
being right there as our time got small
and holding her hand when the good lord called her up
yeah man thats the good stuff

outro
he said when you get home shell start to cry
when she says im sorry say so am i
and look into those eyes so deep in love
and drink it up
cause thats the good stuff
thats the good stuff2embed"
