its strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just lookin at you feels wrong

prechorus
you say that youd take it all back
given one chance
it was a moment of weakness
and you said yes

chorus
you shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
you shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
you shouldve known that word
bout what you did with herd get back to me get back to me
and i shouldve been there in the back of your mind
i shouldnt be asking myself why
you shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you shouldve said no
baby and you might still have me

verse 2
you can see that ive been cryin
and baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
