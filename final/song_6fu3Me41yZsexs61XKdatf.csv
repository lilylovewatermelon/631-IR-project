daylight to nighttime to sunrise
to your eyes to my eyes
to your lips to my lips to your hips
till our hips are moving in time

chorus
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh

verse 2
skyline your moonlight
the sky bars were kicked out
police cars and sirens are breaking the silence
and two hearts with fire inside

chorus
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh

verse 3
hail a taxi where to go how the fuck should i know
stop here this is great oh no you have to pay
down down down the hill tripped over took a spill
passed out woke up with your bin on top
no baby dont stop lets not get up stay here forever
then we kiss
see icona pop liveget tickets as low as 438you might also likebridge
palm trees a new day sunrise at south bay
back at the same place looking for you as always
a tap on the shoulder its you

chorus
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh
then we kiss oh oh oh oh oh

chorus
then we kiss all i wanna do is have a good time oh oh oh oh oh
then we kiss all i wanna do is have a good time oh oh oh oh oh
