verse 1 eminem  kobe
who can catch lightning in a bottle set fire to water
comin out the nozzle on a fire hose flyer than swatters

smash an hourglass grab the sand take his hands and cup em
spit a rhyme to freeze a clock take the hands of time and cuff em
cinderella man cinderella man
cinderella man cinderella man
theres a storm comin that the weatherman couldnt predict
i start to bug prick you better flee cause i get ticked
its a wrap i was down when i was down i was kicked
i got up im back to punch you to the ground youre tricked
its a trap fuck my last cd the shits in my trash
ill be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
i hit the gas and i spit every rap as if its my last
you can die in the blink of an eye so bat your eyelashes
and keep winkin and blowin kisses cause youre flirtin with death
im destroyin your livelihood i aint just hurtin your rep
i catch a flow and get goin no remorse im showin aint slowin
for no one knowin theres nothin you can do about it
zero in on my target like a marksman the target is you
i shut your lane down took your spot parked in it too
arsenic flow lighter fluid saliva—what can you do
go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like woo
that boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too
fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
so you can hate him he dont blame you frankly he would too

to wrap the game up in cellophane raise hell from hell he came
but didnt come to bore you with the cinderella story
nor did he come to do the same old cant afford to be

mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly so say bye

in the sky keep em up time to bring the place alive
thanks for bein patient i wont make no more mistakes shit my
potatos baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
my filet is smokin weed—yeah faggot the stakes are high
