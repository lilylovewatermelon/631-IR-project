lets do it baby lets do it baby

verse 1
even if you were a million miles away
i could still feel you in my bed
near me touch me feel me
and even at the bottom of the sea
i could still hear inside my head
tellin me touch me feel me

prechorus
and all the time you were tellin me lies hey

so tonight im gonna find a way to make it without you
tonight im gonna find a way to make it without you
im gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
im gonna find a way to make it without you

verse 2
have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart
well you could try sleeping in my bed
lonely only nobody ever shut it down like you
you wore the crown
you made my body feel heaven bound
why dont you hold me
near me i thought you told me
youd never leave me
looking in the sky i could see your face
and i know right where i fit in
take me make me you know that ill always be in love
with you
right til the end
