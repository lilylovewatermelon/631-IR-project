just like the fringe on my boots
you move with every step i take
you walk in front of me to make sure
that i don’t fall and break my own heart
cause with you i could never

verse 2
just like the leather on my saddle
we get prettier with time
together in the weather
shiny on the other side
polished and changed for the better

break
with you i’m safe
with you i’m safe

verse 3
i follow you just like a shadow
only closer and
if you get tied and bound
ill find a way to free your hands
ill wash them clean
of everything but me
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 4
sometimes you might get thirsty
so i’ll catch the rain
just like the ice in your glass
ill rattle when you need a drink
you’ll never run dry of love or anything

chorus
i’ll keep you safe
i’ll keep you safe
i’ll keep you safe

verse 5
i keep a locket on my neck that holds your face
i’ll spend forever making sure i can erase
every tear you ever thought about crying

you make me feel like i’m the only girl in the whole wide world
i wanna hold you like a handful of diamonds and pearls
that i guard with my life or die trying

chorus
i’ll keep you safe
i’ll keep you safe
i’ll keep you safeembed"
