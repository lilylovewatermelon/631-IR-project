money comin in like i play ball but i dont play ball
and im supercharged im a real dope boy
with designer from my head to my toe i drip hard
i cant pull up in the hood no more thats what i grind for
feds tryna listen in on me think im a drug lord
had to make it to the finish line without no head start
man i really came from nothin all i know is to go hard

on the tour bus with them killers stay on twitter bitch boy
