yung germ

verse 1
woke up everythings fucked
goldfish dead and my chase accounts in the dust
credit started starting with a four
cant take a loan out cause i  need to get a higher score
and i really need a new car
my shit from 93 and it dont even start
at least i got my guitar
even though i need a new string and the cord dont go far
skateboard stolen at the park again
and i might resort to violence
it was my only transportation
and now im asking for a ride again oh well
i just need silence
i gotta go and chill inside again oh well
dont wanna try again
but i guess i gotta try again oh well

chorus
hello the universe to me wе can be friends i can tell
but you cant stand mе and thats something i can smell
the way you fear me and im fearing you as well
now lets make anarchy lets all make anarchy

verse 2
woke up everythings crap
let some dude ride my bike and he never came back
and my goldfish still dead
still in the red no bitch so no head
dont got money for a bike
got arthritis in my hand so i cant even type
well thats fine
im just a fisherman with no bait on his line
went to jiujitsu at three
got choked out with my own gi
went to muay thai at six
my legs red from the low kicks
i took shrooms and i need help
but i wanna be by myself
i took acid girl nice face
but id appreciate my space

chorus
hello the universe to me we can be friends i can tell
but you cant stand me and thats something i can smell
the way you fear me and im fearing you as well
now lets make anarchy lets all make anarchy
