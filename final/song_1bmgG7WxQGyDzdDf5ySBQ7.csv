she wont let me buy her jewelry
she dont want things that she can keep
she wears wildflowers in her hair
then throws them in the sea
shes the beginning and the end of me

chorus
shes a mystery
my most beautiful regret
i will never understand her
shes a mystery
the only promise i can keep
even in my dreams she ruins me

verse 2
i still dont know what to call her
she says that words dont mean a thing
she changes her name every day
and lies all the time
i feel lucky to call her mine

chorus

verse 3
shes anything in the world
that you cannot explain
but when she throws me a smile
its fire in the rain
you might also likechorus

outro
shes a mystery
theres no defense
its innocence
but she wont let you see
cause shes a mysteryembed"
