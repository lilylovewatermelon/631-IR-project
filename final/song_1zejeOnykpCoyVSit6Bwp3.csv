i knew a boy once when i was small
a towhead blond with eyes of salt
he played the drum in the marching band
his parents cared more about the bible
than being good to their own child
he wore long sleeves cause of his dad
and somehow we fell out of touch
hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
dont know if ill see you again someday
but if youre out there i hope that youre okay

verse 2
my middle school friend grew up alone
she raised her brothers on hеr own
her parents hated who shе loved
she couldnt wait to go to college
she was tired cause she was brought into a world
where family was merely blood
does she know how proud i am she was created
with the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
we dont talk much but i just gotta say
i miss you and i hope that youre okay

bridge
address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
nothings forever nothing is as good as it seems
and when the clouds wont iron out
and the monsters creep into your house
and every door is hard to close

well i hope you know how proud i am you were created
with the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
but god i hope that youre happier today
cause i love you
and i hope that youre okay95embed"
