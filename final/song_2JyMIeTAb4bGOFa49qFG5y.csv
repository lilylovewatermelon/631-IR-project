bartenders bar stools and barmaids
a jukebox and a pocket full of change
just a few of my favorite things
bartenders bar stools and barmaids

verse 1
bartenders listen when you talk
and bar stools are there when you cant walk
and ill always make a waitress my best
until the music stops and closing time begins

chorus

verse 2
outside lies a heart thats been broke
and in here its a world of song and smoke
that way my eyes and ears can lie to me
while i drink another shot of make believe
