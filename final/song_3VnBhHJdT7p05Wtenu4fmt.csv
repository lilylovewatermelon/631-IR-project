wake up

verse 1
oh how the times have changed
youre not the person i knew back then lets get this straight
this is a calling when will they stop falling for this
you lack all inspiration

prechorus
were not the same
ill do whatever it takes to get it through to you well call this a day
were not the same
you are worthless stay in your place

chorus
its like speaking in tongues to all of you now
to all of you now
when will we ever when will we ever
get what we deserve get what we deserve
how long until the tables turn the tables turn
when will we ever when will we ever
get what we deserve

verse 2

you bring out a side of me that no one should see
so quit stalling pack your bags keep walking away
your life leads to destruction
