when sky blue gets dark enough
to see the colors of the city lights
a trail of ruby red and diamond white
hits her like a sunrise

prechorus
she comes and goes and comes and goes
like no one can

verse 2
tonight shes out to lose herself
and find a high on peachtree street
from mixed drinks to techno beats its always
heavy into everything

prechorus
she comes and goes and comes and goes
like no one can
she comes and goes and no one knows
shes slipping through my hands

chorus
shes always buzzing just like
neon neon
neon neon
who knows how long how long how long
she can go before she burns away
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeverse 3
i cant be her angel now
you know its not my place to hold her down
and its hard for me to take a stand
when i would take her anyway i can

prechorus
she comes and she goes
like no one can
she comes and she goes
shes slipping through my hands

chorus
shes always buzzing just like
neon neon
neon neon
who knows how long how long how long
she can go before she burns away

prechorus
she comes and she goes
like no one can
she comes and she goes
shes slipping through my hands

chorus
shes always buzzing just like
neon neon
neon neon
who knows how long how long how long
she can go before she burns away10embed"
