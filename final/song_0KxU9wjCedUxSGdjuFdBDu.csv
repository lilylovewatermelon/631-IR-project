chorus fergie
we try to take it slow but were still losin control

verse 1 william fergie both
girl me and you were just fine you know
we wined and dined did them things
that couples do when in love you know
walks on the beach and stuff you know
things that lovers say and do
i love you boo i love you too
i miss you a lot i miss you even more
thats why i flew you out when we was on tour
but then something got outta hand
you started yellin why i would break plans what did you say to me
even though i had legitimate reasons bullshit
you know i had to make them dividends bullshit
how could you trust your private eyes girl
thats why you dont believe my lies and quick to say

verse 2 taboo kurtis blow  fergie
why does emotion gotta move so fast
love is progress if you could make it last
why is it that you just lose control
every time you agree on takin it slow
so why has it got to be so damn tough
cause fools in lust could never get enough
of love showin him the love that you be givin
changin up your livin for a lovin transition yeah yeah yeah
girl its a mission tryin to get you to listen
screamin at each other has become our tradition
you yell i yell everybody yells
got neighbors across the street sayin who the hell
who the hell what the hells goin down
too much of the bickering kill it with the sound and
