not a dollar to my name
my job got shipped off far away from home
and all the twotime bankers
all moan and complain
thats enough theyve got enough for two
with none left for me and you
and all you daytime workers
your backs breakin every day
aint but a passing thought in their mind
and when youre done atoiling
sorry sir youre on your own
you dont mind this and you dont mind that
you surely wont mind dying
and the years roll down
in this dusty town
its been worn down hard
and run away
and theres a girl beside me
lord shes the one i love
but i cant buy no flowers or a ring
and her mamas nice and friendly
and her daddy wants me dead
thats the way things go these days
and thats the way theyve been
and the years roll down
in this dusty town
its been worn down hard
and run away
my restless hands are grabbing
for a time thats never there
wishful thinking got me down so low
and of all my friends and lovers
im the only one left alive
it echoes through the halls and stairs
and looks me in the eye
and the years roll down
in this dusty town
its been worn down hard
and run away
and the years roll down
in this dusty town
its been worn down hard
and run awaysee trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
