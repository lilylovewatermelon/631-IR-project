stretch

verse 1
it took some time to realize
the bullshit in my eyes
until i got away from you
and then i guess you thought that youd be cool
and make me look like im the one the fool
but i dont care cause youre the one to blame

prechorus
i cant believe it all comes down to this
a penny for your thoughts would make me sick
anything less would be a crime

chorus
told me told you
shut up shut up
shut up shut up
shut up shut up shut up
told me told you
shut up shut up
shut up shut up
shut up shut up shut up

tomorrows another day
ill find my perfect way out
and then i guess you thought that youd be smooth
and make me look like im another fool
well i dont care cause i dont believe anything you say or do

prechorus
i cant believe it all comes down to this
a penny for your thoughts would make me sick

verse 3
i cut my losses to save face
ive found my perfect space
i crawl back inside of myself
and then i guess you tried to make me be
everything you wanted me to be
well look up from the ground and see whos laughing last

prechorus
i cant believe it all comes down to this
a penny for your thoughts would make me sick
anything less would be a crime

prechorus 2
i do what it takes to pull me through
no thanks to anything that you could do
ill never trust again

chorus
told me told you
shut up shut up
shut up shut up
shut up shut up shut up
told me told you
shut up shut up
shut up shut up
shut up shut up shut upembed"
