cant do it cant do it
she says she love me
then she loves me not
but she dont hate me if i kick her out my spot
cause darling lately seems weve been growing apart
i dont know how much more i could take this
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
but when i look in to her eyes eye eye eye eye eyes
just cant do it do it do it

verse 1
never felt this before
could it be that we lost the flame
that them true lovers have
how did it all just slip away away
seems so right at the beginning
now it seems so close to the ending
like we just friends i need to breathe again ohh yeah
these feelings im feeling starting to drive my crazy
just the thought of another man making other plans with my lady
and girl i tried and tried hard so we work this out
but i just dont know right now 

chorus
because at times you say you love me
then you love me not
but you dont hate me if i kick you out my spot
cause darling lately seems weve been growing apart
i dont know how much more i could take this
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
but when i look in to your eyes eye eye eye eye eyes
just cant do it do it do it

girl when i see your face
it reminds me of the long nights and the good ol love we made ohh yeah
and now i just cant forget it mind stuck with it
dont remember the last time i hit it
breathe again i need to breathe again ohh yeah
and when i call yah the voice mail i get you reached toya
and i dont ever want to leave my name and number
playing these childish games
you wanna freeze again nah i dont need him again

chorus
but then you say you love me
then you love me not
but you dont hate me if i kick you out my spot
cause darling lately seems weve been growing apart
i dont know how much more i could take this
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
but when i look in to your eyes eye eye eye eye eyes
just cant do it do it do it

speaks
well then again
i probably can
i dont know how longer i can be with you
i guess its all on you
with these mix signals and all
its kind of kinda hard to tell
you know cause one day 
you say you love me
then another  
then you love me not
damn
chorus
but you dont hate me if i kick you out my spot
cause darling lately seems weve been growing apart
i dont know how much more i could take this
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
i feel like saying buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh bye
but when i look in to your eyes eye eye eye eye eyes
just cant do it do it do itembed"
