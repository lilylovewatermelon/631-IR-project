i woke up this morning and i swore to god id never
ever take another drink again
i fought it like the devil but you know that youre in trouble
when youre fourteen and drunk by 10 am
tried to hide it from my mom and dad
all my friends said straighten up
i just laughed said you dont understand
thats a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

verse 2
at sixteen i was on my own and flying high and staying stoned
i knew everything there was to know
i did things that i cant talk about i wore my mom and daddy out
late nights they spent praying for my soul
stayed sober once for nine days in a row i quit cold turkey
and damn near almost made it to ten
but thats a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

chorus
i look into the mirror bottle in my hand
id like to pour it out i just dont think i can
cause thats a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

verse 3
i dont know when or where it was or how we met and fell in love
or why shed even fall for a guy like me
i tried to pull myself together hoping we could last forever
for a while i started to believe
her daddy said shes all i got son dont ever break her heart
promise me before you take her hand
but thats just too much to ask of a drinking man

i look into the mirror bottle in my hand
id like to pour it out i just dont think i can
cause thats a hell of a lot to ask of a drinking man

outro
i woke up this morning and i swore to god
id never ever take another drink againembed"
