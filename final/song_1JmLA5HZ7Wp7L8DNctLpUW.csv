i wish youd walk in again
imagine if you just did
id fill you in on the things you missed
oh sleepless knight a grown up man dressed in white
who i thought might just save your life
but he couldnt so you died

verse 2
i dont like it now youre dead
its not the same when i scratch my own head
i havent got the nails for it
and i know that god doesnt exist
and all the palaver surrounding it
but i like to think you hear me sometimes

bridge
so i reached for a borrowed fleece
from my dad or from denise
always trying to keep warm when youre the sun

verse 3
i sat with you beside your bed and cried
for things that i wish id said
you still had your nails red
and if i live past seventytwo i hope im half as cool as you
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeverse 4
i got my pen and thought that id write
a melody and line for you tonight
i think thats how i make things feel alright

outro
made in my room this simple tune
will always keep me close to you
the crowds will sing their voices ring
and its like you never left
but im bereft you see
i think you can tell
i havent been doing too well17embed"
