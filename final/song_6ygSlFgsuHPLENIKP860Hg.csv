in 2002 if you asked me to make a wish

big said damn niggas wanna stick me for my paper
and pray for my downfall i understand it all
but me im a little more flashy a nigga
so chances are ima have to blast me a nigga
im on that kevlar vest shit that wild wild west shit
theres 81 one karat stones in my necklace
i shine so hard i make motherfuckers wan kill me
every projects in every hood i go they feel me
know it sounds like rap but this shit is real b
i dont talk that rich shit but nigga im filthy
when i come out to play and my mob aint with me
you can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
homeboy frontin on mell shorten your lifespan
hold the mic with my left my knife in my right hand
yeah
