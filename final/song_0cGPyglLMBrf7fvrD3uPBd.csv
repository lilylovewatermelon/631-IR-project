delusional
i believe i could cure it all for you dear
coax or trick or drive or drag the demons from you
make it right for you sleeping beauty
truly thought i could magically heal you

chorus
youre far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
im failing miserably to rescue

postchorus
sleeping beauty

verse 2
drunk on ego
truly thought i could make it right
if i kissed you one more time
to help you face the nightmare
but youre far too poisoned for me
such a fool to think that i could wake you from your slumber
that i could actually heal you

prechorus
sleeping beauty
poisoned and hopeless

youre far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
failing miserably to find a way to comfort you
far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
and hiding from some poisoned memory

postchorus
poisoned and hopeless
