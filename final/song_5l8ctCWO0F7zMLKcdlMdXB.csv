take the key off the chain
leave it stuck in the door
dont even try to explain
what youre leaving me for
cause you wont cry
and you wont call
and you wont even miss me at all

chorus
but i will
in the middle of the night in the middle of the day
yeah i will
every second youre gone once you go away
i will love you still

verse 2
take those pictures of us
pull them down off the shelf
go wherever you want
go try to be somebody else
because you wont stay
and you wont fight
and you wont wonder
where im sleeping tonight

verse 3
i hope you never spend forever
wondering if he ever
wondering if he ever
wondering if you ever loved me at all

i will
in the middle of the night in the middle of the day
oh i will
every second youre gone once you go away
you know i will love you still
oh i know i know that i will love you still
i will love you stillembed"
