prechorus 1
not long ago youd find the answers were so crystal clear
within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
can you look at yourself now
can you look at yourself

when our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
we all have emptiness inside
we all have answers to find
but you cant win this fight
