there are children standing here
arms outstretched into the sky
tears drying on their face
he has been here
brothers lie in shallow graves
fathers lost without a trace
a nation blind to their disgrace
since hes been here

chorus
and i see no bravery
no bravery in your eyes anymore
only sadness
and i see no bravery
no bravery in your eyes anymore
only sadness
only sadness

verse 2
houses burnt beyond repair
the smell of death is in the air
a woman weeping in despair says
he has been here
tracers lighting up the sky
its another families turn to die
a child afraid to even cry out says
he has been here

and i see no bravery
no bravery in your eyes anymore
only sadness
and i see no bravery
no bravery in you eyes anymore
only sadness
only sadness

bridge
there are children standing here
arms outstretched into the sky
but no one asks the question why
he has been here
old men kneel to accept their fate
wives and daughters cut and raped
a generation drenched in hate
says he has been here

chorus
and i see no bravery
no bravery in your eyes any more
only sadness
and i see no bravery
no bravery in your eyes any more
only sadness
only sadness2embed"
