we swallow the spit
steal acceptance lend denial
telling me that my life is free and boundless
then im forced to stay between the lines
they construct death to demolish life
plant the seeds to harvest loss
found empty truth is full of
lies lies lies lies

verse 2
were hoping for despair starvations gluttony
subtle chaotic peace war divided unity

prechorus
prolife prochoice
blinded insight
left wing right wing
black white
leaders following

i am everything i am nothing
i am everything i am nothing

interlude
it’s all right to be afraid
but sometimes that’s what it takes for us to change
no power before the blacks and grays that shade our fate
they shape our lives in constrictive space
and hope prays we’ll count the days
then we play our life like it’s some kind of fucking game
point your finger at them and we’ll be the ones to assert the blame
so sorry you’ll be the one to absorb the tears your fears
the loss is stacked up like you carried bricks for years
once again you put your life on the line against the fate of time
bridge
praying for the end of time
praying for the end of time
praying for the end of time

chorus
