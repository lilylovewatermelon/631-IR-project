light of god dimming weak
nothings wrong go back to sleep
lost the will at infancy
drown them in charity
lend them comfort for sorrow
enthusiasm they borrow
i can clean impurity
wash away with kerosene

verse 2
cant offend my modesty
thank you for defiling me
language pure as binary
instruct with dishonesty
in nature theres no tragedy
bandage them in tapestry
trade comfort for identity
drown me in kerosene

refrain
ill protect you from
all the things ive seen

ill protect you from
all the things ive seen
and ill clean your wounds
rinse them with saline

and ill clean your wounds
rinse them with saline
ill protect you from
