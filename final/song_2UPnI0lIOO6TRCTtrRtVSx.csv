running back could only make them stay
forward now i run down a winding road
try to pay back everything that i have ever owed
and when your money runs will you buy a friend
and when your guns dont fire will that be the end
with no land left to burn and nowhere left to run
there then can we stand when its all said and done
well i hear the thunder roll i feel the cold winds blowing
but you wont find me there cause i wont go back again
while youre on smoky roads ill be out in the sun
where the trees still grow where they count by one
well you take from our schools to build a bigger bomb
you tell us fiery lies about the course were on
and youll kill all the world and youll reverse the sun
and which would you sell first your soul or your gun

well i hear the thunder roll i feel the cold winds blowing
but you wont find me there cause i wont go back again
while youre on smoky roads ill be out in the sun
where the trees still grow where they count by onesee trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
