come here girl i got a bottle of wine
we can pass it around till were feeling fine and crazy
mm hmm
been a long day let your hair fall down
we can dance for a while
lay around and be lazy
mm hm
we love all night yeah baby
sure feels good when ya take me
in your arms
oh and then we start

chorus
we kiss like first time lovers
tangled up in the covers
lets get it on
love me all night make me miss ya all day long

verse 2
give me a look with your bedroom eyes
gonna lock it away up in my mind
for a daydream
well come on girl come off of that sugar
take my hand baby now would you lay me down
we love all night yeah baby
sure feels good when ya take me in your arms
oh and then we start

tomorrow ill be watching that clock
on the wall
till we pick back up
right where we left off

tangled up in the covers
lets get it on
