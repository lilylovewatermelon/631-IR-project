we fall for each other at the wrong time
only for a moment but i dont mind
guess i dont know where to draw the line the line the line
and well play the same game every night

prechorus
up in the clouds
yeah you know how to make me want you
when we come down
oh i know yeah i know its over

you dont know how to love me when youre sober
when the bottles done you pull me closer
and youre saying all the things that youre supposed to
but you dont know how to love me when youre sober

verse 2
why is it so different when we wake up
same lips same kiss but not the same touch
dont you know that you do it just enough but not enough
but i know whats next and i want so much

when we come down
