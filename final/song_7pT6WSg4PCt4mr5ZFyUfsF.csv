she was 19 with a baby on the way
on the eastside of the city she was working every day
cleaning dishes in the evening she could barely stay awake
she was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
and cross town she would take the bus at night
to a one bedroom apartment and when shed turn on the light
she would sit down at the table tell herself that its alright
she was waiting on the day she hoped her baby would arrive

prechorus
shed never be alone
have someone to hold
and when nights were cold
shed say

chorus
the worlds not perfect but its not that bad
if we got each other and thats all we have
i will be your mother and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you
when the worlds not perfect when the worlds not kind
if we have each other then well both be fine
i will be your mother and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you

they were 90 and were living out their days
on the westside of the city next to where they got engaged
they had pictures on the walls of all the memories that theyd made
and though life was never easy they were thankful that they stayed
with each other and though some times were hard
even when she made him angry he would never break her heart
no they didnt have the money to afford a fancy car
but they never had to travel cause theyd never be apart
even at the end
their love was stronger than
the day that they first met
theyd say

chorus
the worlds not perfect but its not that bad
if we got each other and thats all we have
i will be your lover and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you
when the worlds not perfect when the worlds not kind
if we have each other then well both be fine
i will be your lover and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you

verse 3
im 23 and my folks are getting old
i know they dont have forever and im scared to be alone
so im thankful for my sister even though sometimes we fight
when high school wasnt easy shes the reason i survived
i know shed never leave me and i hate to see her cry
so i wrote this verse to tell her that im always by her side
i wrote this verse to tell her that im always by her side
i wrote this verse to tell her that

chorus
the worlds not perfect but its not that bad
if we got each other and thats all we have
i will be your brother and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you
when the worlds not perfect when the worlds not kind
if we have each other then well both be fine
i will be your brother and ill hold your hand
you should know ill be there for you
