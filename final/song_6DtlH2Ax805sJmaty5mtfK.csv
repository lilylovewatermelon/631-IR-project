pull the trigger budd dwyer hahaha
see you for a minute

verse 1 anthony mars
i just wanna see you for a minute
my minds been lost for a minute
for a minute for a minute
cant tell you whats going on
dont know what im feeling
money comes and goes
save a few spend a few
every time i go to sleep i dream of you
every time i close my eyes i just see you
inside of my heart
i been feeling through
rehab after rehab
come home just to relapse
if it was a choice all these drugs would be through
but its just so much deeper
carry too much baggage on my people
even though i love you
fill the void
even though i love you
smile at my casket
im at peace at my death and i know its just another sad song
may or may not sing along
and i know its just another sad song
may or may not sing along
im not living life this way
i dont care about the fame
i dont care about the pain
i just wanna see you for a minute
baby im sorry that im finished
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 norman atomic
dont know why you left
heroin heroin
but you always come back so ill give you back whatever is left in my chest
no heart no heart
probably go broke giving into false hope
choke
choking from the vomit in my throat i was too knocked out to notice
overdose into a comatose it seems to be my fucking slogan
im fucking broken
im fucking broken again
and i know never to forget
my foes my friends are the same in the end
i hope i regret leaving both when i am dead
all of the money and fame
are only fleeting ways to counteract my shame
all the drugs and bitches that i gain
are only fleeting ways to counteract my shame im so lame what
every day is the same is the same im going insane going insane
and nothing ever changes i hate it i gotta get out my own way
find a better way find a better way19embed"
