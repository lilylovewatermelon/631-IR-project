all the wrong things on fire
in sickness and in health
to be with you just to be with you

refrain
and in your wedding dress to have and to hold
even at my best i want to let go
and you hold me in your arms
when all that i can see
is my future in your hands
and all that i can feel
is how long ever after is
when its all that i can do
to be with you just to be with you

refrain
in your wedding dress to have and to hold
and even at my best i want to let go

bridge
thought i lost you
thought i lost you i gave you away
thought i lost you
been jealous of the moon for how it moves the waves
you might also likerefrain
in your wedding dress to have and to hold
even at my best i want to let go

and i want to be somebody else now
and i want to thicken my skin
and i want to wish it all just wish it all away again again again

and i want to be somebody else
and i want to be holding you in
and i want to be missing you love missing you love
with all that i have left to give to give to giveembed"
