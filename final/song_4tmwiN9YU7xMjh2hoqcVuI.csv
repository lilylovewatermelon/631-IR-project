indochina capa jumps jeep
two feet creep up the road
to photo to record meat lumps and war
they advance as does his chance
ooh very yellowwhite flash
a violent wrench grips mass
rips light tears limbs like rags
burst so high finally capa lands
mine is a watery pit
painless with immense distance
from medic from colleague friend enemy foe
him five yards from his leg

chorus
from you taro
oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh oh
do not spray into eyes
i have sprayed you into my eyes

verse 2
310 pm capa pends death
quivers last rattles last chokes
all colours and cares glaze to grey
shriveled and stricken to dots
the left hand grasps what the body grasps not
oh ohohoh oh oh oh oh
le photographe est mort
31415 alive no longer my amour
fated for home may of 54
doors open like arms my love
painless with a great closeness
to capa to capa capa dark after nothing
reunited with his leg
you might also likechorus
and with you taro
oh ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh ohohoh
taro ohohoh oh oh oh oh
ohohoh ohoh oh ohohoh
do not spray into eyes
i have sprayed you into my eyes
