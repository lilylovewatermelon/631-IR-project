why
why

verse 1 luke
switching into airplane mode again
were not alright but ill pretend
press my cheek against the glass
just be good till i get back

prechorus luke luke  calum
the ground disappears
i hold back the tears
i check my phone to see your face
staring back as if to say
dont worry you wont be lonely

chorus all
why wont you love me
why wont you love me
you imagine when you close your eyes
youre with me on the other side
so why wont you love me

verse 2 calum michael
few drinks deep at a table for one
in the place we like to go and you take yourself home again
three missed calls at 2am
and you say you never heard youre late to get to work and then
you might also likeprechorus calum calum  michael
the time disappears
you hold back the tears
your best girlfriend just got engaged
you say you cant wait and need to make a change
you told me its so hard to be lonely

chorus all
why wont you love me
why wont you love me
were together all alone tonight
so helpless from the other side
so why wont you love me

bridge all
can you tell me why my love
can you tell me why
i hold on to you and you hold on to me
can you tell me why my love
can you tell me why
i hold on to you and you hold on

breakdown luke  calum
oh why wont you love me

chorus all
why wont you love me
why wont you love me
you imagine when you close your eyes
youre with me on the other side
so why wont you love me
