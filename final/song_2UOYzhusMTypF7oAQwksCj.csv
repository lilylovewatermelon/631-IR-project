verse 2 kendrick lamar
hopped out the caddy just got my dick sucked
the little homies called and said the enemies done cliqued up
oh yeah puto want to squabble with mi barrio
oh yeah tell em they can run it for the cardio
oh yeah everything is everything its scandalous
slow motion for the ambulance the project filled with cameras
the lapd gamblin scramblin football numbers slanderin
niggas names on paper—you snitched all summer
streets dont fail me now
they tell me its a new gang in town
from compton to congress
settrippin all around
aint nothin new but a flu of new democrips and rebloodicans
red state versus a blue state—which one you governin
they give us guns and drugs call us thugs make it they promise to fuck with you
no condom they fuck with you obama say what it do
interlude kendrick lamar
obama say what it do
obama say what it do
obama say what it do

verse 3 kendrick lamar
everybody want to talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack or who white or who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hiphop was rappin
motherfucker if you did then killer miked be platinum
yall priorities fucked up put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic my memory been gone since
dont ask about no camera blocking at award shows
no dont ask about my bitch no dont ask about my vogues
less you askin me about power yeah i got a lot of it
im the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby
k dot what up i heard they opened up pandoras box
i box em all in by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said its funny how one verse could fuck up the game
chorus kendrick lamar
i been a1 since day one you niggas booboo
poem kendrick lamar
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
i didnt want to selfdestruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth
trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
back in the city
i was entering a new one235embed"
