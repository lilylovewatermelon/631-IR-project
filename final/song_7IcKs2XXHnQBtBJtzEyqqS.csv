like ridin around on railcars and workin long days
lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways

call it one drink too many
call it pride of a man
but it dont make no difference if you sit or you stand

cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin
yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin

we do it over and over and over again
we do it over and over and over again

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

i know theres california oklahoma
and all of the places i aint ever been to but
down in the valley with
whiskey rivers
these are the places you will find me hidin
these are the places i will always go
these are the places i will always go
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likei am on my way
i am on my way
i am on my way back to where i started

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

one more for the stars and the eyes of the walls
i saw your face i heard you callin out

i saw your face in the crowd and you came out
just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

there was a sign on the door and it reads to me
just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

ohoh ohoh ohohohoh ohoh

i am on my way
i am on my way
i am on my way back to where i started

california oklahoma
and all of the places i aint ever been to but
down in the valley with
whiskey rivers
these are the places you will find me hidin
these are the places i will always go
these are the places i will always go
so i wish i was a slave to an ageold trade
lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways8embed"
