i i always believed in futures
i hope for better in november
i try the same losing lucky numbers
it could be a cold night for a lifetime

prechorus
hey now you cant keeping saying endlessly
my darling how long until this affects me

chorus
say hello to good times
say hello
trade up for the fast ride
we close our eyes
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely

verse 2
i i always could count on futures
that things would look up and they look up
why is it so hard to find a balance between living decent and the cold and real

prechorus
hey now what is it you think you see
my darling nows the time to disagree

we close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely

hey now the past is told by those who win
my darling what matters is what hasnt been
hey now were wide awake and were thinking
my darling believe your voice can mean something

chorus
say hello to good times
say hello
trade up for the fast ride
we close our eyes
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime take the streets completely1embed"
