uh
i forgot to call you on your birthday
you swear youre the last thing on my mind yeah
there is nothing i can do to fix it
all you ever asked me for was time whoa

prechorus
when the lights dont glow the same way that they used to
and i finally get a moment to myself
i will realize you were everything im missing
and youll tell me youre in love with someone else

chorus
so can you do me a favor
if i pull it together make it sooner than later
we wont be here forever and i realize i waited too long
but please dont move on

postchorus
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one you dont need no one
you dont need no one else oh
you dont need no one else

verse 3
the girl or the world you see someone gotta lose
i thought that i could have it all do i really gotta choose
what good is all the cash if it doesnt buy time
and what good is being famous if im never on your mind
nights fallin lights glowing
and im just trying to pay the price owing
and i dont want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
and i aint tryna be without you at the right moments
nigga nice going is it worth it that decision
cause hearts break and i aint tryna be in that collision
so ima dust my shirt and fix my pants
cause i better look good girl if this my chance i swear

chorus
so can you do me a favor
if i pull it together make it sooner than later
we wont be here forever and i realize i waited too long
but please dont move on

postchorus
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one else
you dont need no one you dont need no one
you dont need no one else oh
you dont need no one else22embed"
