id like to be the kind of dream youd never share
to be your boss and to be your maid
your shaving cream your razor blade
the buttons of your shirt
your favorite underwear
id like to be the only thing on earth that makes you cry
the only thing that makes you happy
soon you will see
that no one else but me can take you this high
and soon youll make your last name mine

chorus
hey you
makin an offer that no one could ever refuse
dont play the adamant
dont be so arrogant
cant you see ive fallen for ya
hey you
makin an offer that no one would dare to refuse
dont play the adamant
dont be so arrogant
let me in let me be your muse tonight
tonight tonight

verse 2
id like to be the first white hair upon your head
to be your cherry pie your daily bread
ill cook for free ill make your bed
if i can know the things youve thought and never said
id like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans
and that thing that makes you happy
id like to be the beginning the end
and the inbetween
and be your slave and be your queen
