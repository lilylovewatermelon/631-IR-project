gray light new day leaks through the window
an old soul song comes on the alarmclock radio
we walk the forty blocks to the middle
of the place we heard where everyone would be

prechorus
and there were barricades to keep us off the street
but the crowd kept pushing forward
til they swallowed the police

chorus
yeah they went wild
yeah they went wild
yeah they went wild
yeah they went wild

verse 2
we left before the dust had time to settle
and all the broken glass swept off the avenue
on the way home i held your camera like a bible
just wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth

prechorus
and i stood nervous next to you in the dark room
you dropped your paper in the water
it all begins to bloom

yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild

pre chorus
and just when i get so lonesome i cant speak
i see some flowers on a hillside
like a wall of new tvs

chorus
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild

chorus
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild
yeah they go wild6embed"
