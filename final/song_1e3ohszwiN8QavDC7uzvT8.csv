ask a question receive an answer
the golden rule doesnt apply to you
all confused now content with living
alone inside solitude
remind me again that youre the one
i know you dont like to offend
you think youre special and no ones equal
i think the motion needs to end

prechorus 1
somehow i just dont think youll last

chorus
i know you like the back of my hand
and i know youre the emptiness man
you never have solutions
yeah but you always gave demands
i know youre the emptiness man

verse 2
say your peace now explain yourself
it cannot always change your mind
your operating sophistication
stealing rhythms all on time
wants to be the only one
wants to be the twisted kind
wants to be the only one
had to be the first in line

someday i hope you take off your mask

chorus
i know you like the back of my hand
and i know youre the emptiness man
you never have solutions
yeah but you always gave demands
i know youre the emptiness man

bridge
i know your balance for thrills addictions
your imitations are carrying afflictions
you gotta get into nothing
or whatever makes you feel inside
i imagine the walls you built
leave you a comfortable place to hide

chorus 3
i know you like the back of my hand
and i know youre the emptiness man
you never have solutions
yeah but you always gave demands
i know youre the emptiness man

outro
youre the emptiness man
youre the emptiness man
youre the emptiness manembed"
