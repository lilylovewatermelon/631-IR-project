seasons come and seasons go
one day sun the next day snow
flowers die and flowers grow
but love is neverending

verse 2
you cant kill it with goodbye
it always finds a place to hide
inside your heart for your whole life
love is neverending

chorus
when the lights have all gone down
itll still be hanging round
even when you think its lost it can still be found
when every memory has been made
and the pages start to fade
and every prayer you ever prayed is heaven bound
when you think the ride is over
youre back at the beginning
love is neverending

verse 3
when a man and woman start growing old
the fire of passion may grow cold
but what they got still warms their soul
love is neverending

bridge
it keeps going on and on
long after were all gone away

verse 4
time may change what you believe
but one day the truth will set you free
just have faith and you will see
love is neverending
love is neverendingembed"
