wake up everyone its not too late
to save the remnants of our hearts so stop giving up
our last shot at love our only chance to find the meaning of
the beat beneath the blood

chorus 1
we laugh at honor and are shocked when
we find knives in our backs
we follow those who cheat and steal
look in my eyes you wont find your way back
our only compass smashed under our own heels

bridge
reason abandoned
to appetites and addicts arms
shotguns and silence
have always been the best charms

verse
wake up everyone its not too late
to save the remnants of our hearts so stop giving up
our last shot at love our only chance to find the meaning of
the beat beneath the blood

chorus 2
we laugh at honor and are shocked when
we find knives in our backs
we follow those who cheat and steal
look in my eyes you wont find your way back
our only compass smashed under our own heels and our iron will
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeoutro
the abolition of man is within the
the reach of science
but are we so far gone
that well try it1embed"
