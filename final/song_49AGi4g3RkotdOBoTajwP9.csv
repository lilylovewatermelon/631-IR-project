watchin every single aspiration this fall
why cant it be like it is in my dreams
where i fly through the sky but aint got no wings
im like a sweatin stack of dynamite its true
you can straight feel the blast when we brush against you

now hear me

ive been hearin the voices of the grave
now every single one made me their slave
pushin their music down into my veins
all that powder and all that pain
im like a sweatin stack of dynamite its true
you can straight feel the blast when we brush against you

i know that its comin but i aint worried none
cause we got enough here to go around
and every single persons gonna get them some
x2

i been watchin them angels fly
up inside of that deep blue sky
and they been whispering secrets down into my ears
everything that i need to hear
say im a sweatin stack of dynamite its true
you can straight feel the blast when we brush against you
you might also likenow im parkin it side by side
seems like demons dont give me no place to hide
doesnt matter where i go near or far
he always knows just where you are
im like a sweatin stack of dynamite its true
its like im gonna kill myself but id rather kill you

chorus

i know that its coming and i aint worried none
cause we got enough here to go around
and every single persons gonna get them some

now im just drivin on the same old wings
man it seems theyre the same old things
it dont matter how far that i try to go
whether fast or whether slow
im like a sweatin stack of dynamite its true
im gonna kill myself but id rather kill you

now hear me

i been walkin the same old lines
trying so hard to stay on the outside
but it seems it dont matter how hard i try
i always wind up back up on the inside
now you see and now you dont
and now i will and now i wont
ill wait right here and you will seeembed"
