ooh weekend weekend oh
weekend im beggin you love
stay for the weekend
but if you try weekend
but if you try weekend
weekend no weak links no weak links no weekends
feel like a kid after school on the weekend

chorus
ive been livin it up try breakin me down ill take it back up
theyve been wonderin where wonderin what i stay in the cut
dont wanna wait in vain im turnin the page im learnin to trust
youre my starlight and moonshine and burnin sun
ive been livin it up try breakin me down ill take it back up
theyve been wonderin where wonderin what i stay in the cut
dont wanna wait in vain im turnin the page im learnin to love
youre my starlight and moonshine and burnin sun

verse
you wanna leave i wont stop ya
but youre the one i would die for
the other ones come with sad stories
youre the one i go ride for
waitin to fall for over two seasons
in spring im sprung for the wrong reasons
baby forgive me for rivers that i cant stop
cause my heart freeze in winter
i dont wanna be a savage
done with summertime madness
your sunshine works magic
never thought i would ever know what that is

ive been livin it up try breakin me down ill take it back up
theyve been wonderin where wonderin what i stay in the cut
dont wanna wait in vain im turnin the page im learnin to trust
youre my starlight and moonshine and burnin sun
ive been livin it up try breakin me down ill take it back up
theyve been wonderin where wonderin what i stay in the cut
dont wanna wait in vain im turnin the page im learnin to love
youre my starlight and moonshine and burnin sun
