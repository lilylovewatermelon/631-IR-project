oh i could feel the change acoming
felt it in the breeze
oh i could feel the change acoming
coming right for me
oh i could feel the change acoming
saw it on tv
oh i could feel the change acoming
saw it staring right on back at me

verse 2
oh i could feel the shadow coming
straight on down the line
masquerading like it was a friend of mine
oh i could feel the darkness
wrapping all its arms in mine
oh i could feel the world was turning
all inside my mind
oh i could feel the world was turning
all inside all inside my mind

bridge
i knew it when it started
felt the shift right as it parted
saw my feet right down below me
saw the whole room move around me
saw my old life and my old friends
saw me haunted saw me back again

oh maybe theres a past life coming out inside of me
maybe its the song im singing
maybe everythings just turning out how it should be
maybe theres a past life coming out inside of me
oh maybe thereâ€™s a past life coming out inside inside of me3embed"
