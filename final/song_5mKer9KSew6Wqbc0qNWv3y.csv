verse 1
friday night and im home just chilling on the sofa
relaxing im so glad the week is over
i got my remote good sack of that green ima lean and smoke
going through my cell for the number of a chick that i met last week and her body aint no joke
she picked up on the first ring what took you so long to call me
recognized your name and number from the caller id
she said her roommate is gone and she all alone
let me get your street address let me get dressed and hung up the phone and its on

prechorus
she want it and i want it too but im unprepared
and we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
and she said i aint ready to have no babies jumped up put my clothes back on
i was just about to get some had to make a store run

chorus
store run pack of three up at the counter
store run be back in less than half an hour
store run i need protection and im out
wait for me keep it warm i had to make a store run
see trey songz liveget tickets as low as 87you might also likeverse 2
speeding switching lanes and im flying
and im trying to get back to her before she changes her mind
cause if i take too long
she might put her clothes back on
henny in my system she tipsy on that grey goose
its obvious what shes tryna get into
top hugging them curves got a nigga like me at a loss for words
i know she can tell that im with it wanna get it while its hot she can tell when im close to her
she keep licking her lips she touching and she grabbing
oh ima throw her the bone ima give it to her all night long
i want it bad oh so bad
but i know that its wrong here we go

prechorus
she want it and i want it too but im unprepared
and we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
and she said i aint ready to have no babies jumped up put my clothes back on
i was just about to get some had to make a store run

chorus
store run pack of three up at the counter
store run be back in less than half an hour
store run i need protection and im out
wait for me keep it warm i had to make a store run
store run pack of three up at the counter
store run be back in less than half an hour
store run i need protection and im out
wait for me keep it warm i had to make a store run

all i could do is think of being inside you
im driving like im up out of my mind

and you can take your clothes back off

chorus
store run pack of three up at the counter
store run be back in less than half an hour
store run i need protection and im out
wait for me keep it warm i had to make a store run
store run pack of three up at the counter
store run be back in less than half an hour
store run i need protection and im out
wait for me keep it warm i had to make a store run
store run pack of three up at the counter
