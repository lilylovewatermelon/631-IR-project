i close my eyes all that i see
is a thousand spawn chewing at me
turn to me and say it cant be true
theres no way i came out of you

chorus alice glass
straight from my bones
back in my hands
straight from my blood
back in my hands
too old to be my daughter
too young to be my friend

verse 2 alice glass
its so wrong ive seen it all before
theres two wounded cats waiting at the door
ill give you your lobotomy
theres no way you came out of me

chorus alice glass
straight from my bones
back in my hands
straight from my blood
back in my hands
too old to be my daughter
too young to be my friend

youre covered in the lotion
that was inside of me
ill throw you in the ocean
ill pass you to the sea
youre covered in the lotion
that was inside of me
ill throw you in the ocean
ill pass you to the sea

outro alice glass
straight from my bones
back in my hands
straight from my blood
back in my hands
straight from my bones
back in my hands
straight from my blood
back in my hands4embed"
