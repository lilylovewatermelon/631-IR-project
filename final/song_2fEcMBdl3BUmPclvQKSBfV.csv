kids get high in the basement sometimes
and tell themselves not to watch the screens
it’s the blood that haunts me i can’t fall asleep
cause its ruthless and don’t tell me you’re ruthless too

prechorus
when there is blood on the streets of baltimore
kids are getting ready for a long war
maybe i was born in the wrong skin
but those sheep are rolling in the mud again

chorus
like woah it haunts me now tell me it haunts you too
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue

verse 2
wasted in the tangles of time
and my baby is she the only one left when it’s dire
she said a change is gonna come love but it’s all on us
cause it’s ruthless now and don’t tell me you’re ruthless too

prechorus
when there is blood on the streets of baltimore
kids are getting ready for a long war
maybe i was born in the wrong skin
but those sheep are rolling in the mud again

like woah it haunts me now tell me it haunts you too
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue

bridge
cause there is blood on the streets of baltimore
kids are getting ready for a long war
maybe i was born in the wrong skin
but those sheep are rolling in the mud again

chorus
like oh it haunts me now tell me it haunts you too
oh it haunts me cause their freedom was paid in blood
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue
you cut it up you cut it up but it’s still the red white and the blue4embed"
