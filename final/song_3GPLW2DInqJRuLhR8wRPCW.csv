i was a just a young kid with time to waste
livin out of my car those were the days
we were all the wild ones the wasted youth
other than a dream had nothing to lose

prechorus
ain’t it funny how time flies fades into gold
now i wanna do a driveby but i can’t find the road

chorus
back to wonderland
where it all began
everything was so simple then
livin life like our last weekend
wish i could find my way back to wonderland

verse 2
carrie’s in the valley she’s got a kid
julie’s still a waitress livin on tips
sometimes we get together and shoot the shit
but it’s not the same now no nothing is

prechorus
feels like it was a movie that plays in my mind
shadows of a past life wish i could rewind
you might also likechorus
back to wonderland
where it all began
everything was so simple then
livin life like our last weekend
wish i could find my way back to wonderland

bridge
didn’t have a clue what we were doin or where we would end up
livin off of nickels and dimes and our young reckless love
we didn’t ever think that time would ever come to an end
now if i could you know i’d run

chorus
back to wonderland
where it all began
everything was so simple then
livin life like our last weekend
wish i could find my way back to wonderland3embed"
