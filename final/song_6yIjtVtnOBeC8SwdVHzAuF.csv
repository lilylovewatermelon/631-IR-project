intro
west—mr west—mr west
uh yeah uh yeah

verse 1 kanye west
and i heard em say
nothings ever promised tomorrow today
from the chi like tim its a harder way
so this is in the name of love like robert say
before you ask me to go get a job today
can i at least get a raise on the minimum wage
and i know the government administer aids
so i guess we just pray like the minister say
allāhu akbar and throw in some hot cars
the things we seen on the screen is not ours
but these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
where im from the dope boys is the rock stars
but they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
i guess they want us all behind bars—i know it
chorus kanye west  adam levine
uh and i heard em say ooh
nothings ever promised tomorrow today
and i heard em say
nothings ever promised tomorrow today
nothings ever promised tomorrow today
but well a find a way
and nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeverse 2 kanye west
they say people in your life are seasons
and anything that happen is for a reason
and niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
and gran keep praying and keep believing
in jesus and one day that you see him
til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
the devil is alive i feel him breathin
claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
and put them lottery tickets just to tease us
my aunt pam cant put them cigarettes down
so now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
his job try to claim that he too niggerish now
is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
i cant figure it out im sick of it now
chorus kanye west  adam levine
ugh and i heard em say ooh
nothings ever promised tomorrow today
and i heard em say
nothings ever promised tomorrow today nothings ever promised tomorrow today
but well a find a way
and nothing last forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
postchorus adam levine
with every worthless word we get more far away
and nothings ever promised tomorrow today
and nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
