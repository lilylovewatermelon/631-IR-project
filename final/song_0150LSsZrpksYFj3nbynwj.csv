tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
and this is this— this is the end of this session lets— anything else youve gotta say

verse 1 tyler the creator  dr tc
mom is getting jealous i see my manager more than i see her
before i go on tour and it hurts yeah
i miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
and getting legal so i gotta watch the shit that i blurt out as you should that shits outrageous
my friends are turning into opposites
because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
and all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
harder than the white kids who copy shit
ending it is all i fucking think about thats the shit i think about
all alone bawling til my mofuckin eyes bleed
see hes a leader in person and smile shit gets disgursting
when theres no person around talking discussion shit man fuck im here to talk to you
im putting myself at a distance
for instance my best friend is now my fucking assistant who travis
niggas saying free earl without even knowin him
see theyre missing a new album im missing my only friend

interlude 1 dr tc  tyler the creator

awesome at his concert but he never had a pop see
mommy was a living single queen with a lati
so while my wallets piling with symboliccolored paper
i lace her cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
twenty why didnt she get that abortion
probably cause that motherfucking embryo was morphing
into a grammywinning schizophrenic fucking orphan
oops i mean bastard yeah skinnyass disaster
mom works hard still working on her masters
son lies about taking classes at community college
just to record some bullshit he calls bastard yeah
start a fucking cult clash his talents in a brash way
before he even had a mustache and cash
and all i got was a fucking shitty article in thrasher

interlude 2 dr tc  tyler the creator

verse 3 tyler the creator  dr tc
ima grab the nina no and find a nice arena
cause i cant even choose between ortega or sabrina get security in here
and im not even human im a bodyshaped demon
with some semen in my sack and some problems in the back calm the fuck down
and a life thats fill with crap and a finger filled with hate
and a gat thats filled with love now let opposites attract
i can finally be one no like a marriage in a church
but this marriage has a hearse
and the parents of the one thats getting married has a curse
and its made up inside of him
too late to reimburse but wait it gets worse
all the guests thats in the church all decided to disperse tyler
so there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse you dont want to do this
so they tied the knot now its too late to reverse this arrangement yes it is
and the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and calm the fuck down
but it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
now a bunch of whispering immerse

interlude 3 dr tc tyler the creator security guard  nurse
