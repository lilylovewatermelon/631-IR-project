when problems overwhelm us and sadness smothers us where do we find the will and the courage to continue  well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend a chance encounter with a book or from a personal faith  for janet help came from her faith but it also came from a squirrel  shortly after her divorce janet lost her father then she lost her job she had mounting money problems  but janet not only survived she worked her way out of despondency and now she says life is good again  how could this happen  she told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter one at a time he would take them to the nest  and she thought if that squirrel can take care of himself with a harsh winter coming on so can i  once i broke my problems into small pieces i was able to carry them just like those acorns one at a time

verse 1 jack white
take all your problems and rip em apart
oh oh ohohoh
carry them off in a shopping cart
oh oh ohohoh
another thing you shouldve known from the start
oh ohohohoh
the problems in hand are lighter than at heart
oh ohohohohoh

verse 2 jack white
be like the squirrel girl be like the squirrel
oh oh ohohoh
give it a whirl girl be like the squirrel
oh oh ohohoh
and another thing you have to know in this world
oh oh ahohoh
cut up your hair straighten your curls
well your problems hide in your curls

outro jack white
oh oh ohohoh
oh ohoh
oh ohohoh
