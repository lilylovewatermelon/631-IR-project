i dont seem to care today
i mirror what i love with what i hate
empty ways can cloud your eyes
i only know because i tried
so come with me come with me
lets meet our contestants
that have no better time to play the game

verse 1
i dont wanna give it away underneath the citadels
buried deep with your guilt and regrets
leading in the dark everything is wonderful
i dont care i dont want to forget
why is it a crime its none of your business
i prefer to be in hell by myself
turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody
who refuses to forgive when nothing was taken

chorus
no one else survives ive seen you live now watch me die
but we dont see the writing on the wall
and as i close my eyes alone in here i realize
the one that kills the least still kills us all

verse 2
hidden in the rubble
everybodys got a story to tell
what do i need eliminate the possible
all thats left is a man in a cell
maybe im wrong maybe a decision
is the better way to go the better way to be
ive got my demons go get your own
save another number dont forget to hate me

no one else survives ive seen you live now watch me die
but we dont see the writing on the wall
and as i close my eyes alone in here i realize
the one that kills the least still kills us all

chorus
no one else survives ive seen you live now watch me die
but we dont see the writing on the wall
and as i close my eyes lost in here i realize

the one that kills the least still kills us all all all all10embed"
