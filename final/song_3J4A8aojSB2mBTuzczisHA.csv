lil tjay
niggas gon hate i dont care about em
niggas gon hate i dont care about em
not at all

chorus
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest
bro said be humble i patiently waited
all of this love and i aint even made it
i got a plan for them niggas that hated
run up some bands for my bros ima make it
they want me gone i cant walk around naked
even my brother got caught and he ate it
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest

verse 1
hop in the foreign im driftin off stupid
niggas be broke like the fuck is you doing
started off strong but theres room for improvement
i aint for nothing milwaukee im booming
love aint for me now its static with cupid
bitches in love with the way that i sing
they aint want tjay before this whole movement
now they dick ride cause im doin my thing
still posted up on the block with the gang
spin through your hood i aint tuckin my chain
bro got a chop with a whole lot of range
said be consistent aint nothin gon change
now that im speaking out honestly
i be flexing but im still in poverty
move my mom out the hood do it properly
give a fuck if you look at me awkwardly
no monopoly im about property
i dont owe niggas shit but respect
yeah one day i was going through stress
matter fact im just wasting my breath
and now ima just talk about all of these bands
how im so grateful im not in the can
how im so grateful for all of my fans
how im so grateful i am who i am huh
balmain the sweater huh
truey the pants he did it again
looking forward to a show in japan
i think dexter better lay off the xans
throwin water on my chain cause i can
applyin pressure now they shakin my hands
niggas aint gettin no paper
i know thats the reason they hate thats my gun on my waist
test gwuapo get shot in your face
and there aint no room for debate
i know these niggas gon hate
but my life is still goin great
pop out givenchy and bape
we from the trenches
its easy to hop over fences
the ds tryna build up a case
stay with a weapon
its either a glock or a wesson
that bitch shoot you right in your face
see lil tjay liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likechorus
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest
bro said be humble i patiently waited
all of this love and i aint even made it
i got a plan for them niggas that hated
run up some bands for my bros ima make it
they want me gone i cant walk around naked
even my brother got caught and he ate it
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest

verse 2
feel like the greatest i think im the goat
please dont get naked i just want the throat
out of my birkin i feel like its workin
yeah bitches be burgers aint even a joke
feel like a star when i hop in the wraith
it dont matter the place i aint tuckin my chain
only my brothers aint fuckin with lames
i dont care what you tell me aint nothin gon change
ran up some bands now im up like a plane
i was just hungry aint nothin was funny
yall do what yall do ima stay in my lane
hop in the booth and im spittin that pain
i was a youngin that couldnt be tamed
thinkin shit funny like tjay a stain
and ima get money regardless
kill a nigga be easy im heartless
im so young with a whole lot of charges
in the booth i be workin my hardest
boy tried to diss me i swear that shit garbage
it wont be long til i walk down the carpet
cop me a ladder i took off the market
red and green beam i aint missing my target
run if you stupid run if you stupid
word to smelly i wont hesi to shoot shit
told my niggas we gon ball like im hoopin
in the streets im a fighter hadoken
started winnin i got tired of losin
know about it dont why know they accusin
three lines got me deady im snoozin
back up cause im seein illusions
bro told me grind bro told me grind
all this fake love i dont pay it no mind
got a story and its one of a kind
independent but i couldve got signed
cooking fire baking soda combined
do the math i turned 8 in 09
17 and your boy in his prime
free bro he got off with a dime
free verse is you out of your mind
only gang do whatever for mine
running running tryna get me a bag
running running tryna get to it fast
niggas talkin like they bitches they chat
spin the block and we spinning it back
i was in the field cookin the crack
one in the head i aint cocking it back
g side stackin static they smacked
sb put my hood on the map gang gang
chorus
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest
bro said be humble i patiently waited
all of this love and i aint even made it
i got a plan for them niggas that hated
run up some bands for my bros ima make it
they want me gone i cant walk around naked
even my brother got caught and he ate it
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest

outro
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest
got to be humble i patiently waited
no one can stop me i feel like the greatest
