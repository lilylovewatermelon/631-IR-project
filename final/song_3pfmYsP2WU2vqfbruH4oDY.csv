have you ever wished you could rewind
and pick up all the pieces of a life you left behind
have you ever lived on borrowed time
knowing your mistakes are chasing you down from behind

chorus
but dont hold me cause i am falling back down
and i wouldnt wanna see you hit the ground
little darling you found my heart in the lostandfound
but the scars they still follow me around

verse 2
i know its hard to replace
but the feelings that you had for me will one day be erased
and you will learn to move on
like footprints in the snow will last when the winters gone

chorus
but dont hold me cause i am falling back down
and i wouldnt wanna see you hit the ground
little darling you found my heart in the lostandfound
but the scars they still follow me around

bridge
and the dark surrounds your heart and youre in freefall
oh you must let go of me
cause if you keep me you will lose it all
so darling darling please please
