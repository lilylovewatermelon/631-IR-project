oh understand girl im out of sight
to the other side i dont want no stripes
got my insides loud like motorcycles
girl dont notice it i dont notice it
and the love make me wanna sing sing
and the high make me wanna sing sing
and the pain make me wanna blink blink
but im in a rover i wont feel a thing

verse
guess ive been awake thinking bout our fate
fighting two devils blood in my toothpaste
spit into the night ooh thought it would be nice ooh
you just makе me nervous you werе cold as ice youre cold
i was in your town drivin eighty miles
do not even notice do not even frown
and how could i deserve this im never slowin down never slowin down
dont love me at the surface love me like its now love me love me love me love me

chorus
oh understand girl im out of sight
to the other side i dont want no stripes
got my insides loud like motorcycles
girl dont notice it i dont notice it
and the love make me wanna sing sing
and the high make me wanna sing sing
and the pain make me wanna blink blink
but im in a rover i wont feel a thingyou might also like15embed"
