papa died smiling
wide like the ring of a bell
gone all star white
small as a wish in a well
and sodom south georgia
woke like a tree full of bees
buried in christmas bows
and a blanket of weeds

chorus
papa died sunday and i understood
all dead white boys say god is good
white tongues hang out god is good

verse 2
papa died while my girl
lady edith was born
both heads fell like
eyes on a crack in the door
and sodom south georgia
slept on an acre of bones
slept through christmas
slept like a bucket of snow

chorus
papa died sunday and i understood
all dead white boys say god is good
white tongues hang out god is goodsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
