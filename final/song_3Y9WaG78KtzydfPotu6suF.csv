think i dont need a watch to tell the time
think i dont need the sun to help me shine
think i dont need a girl to be alright
guess i didnt know
thought i didnt need shoes on my feet
thought i didnt need a bed to fall asleep
thought i didnt need love to be complete
guess i didnt know

chorus
that i just got this crazy feeling
ive been making someone wait for me for me

verse 2
youre all i think about when im awake
part of every night and every day
and everythings a mess when youre away
now i know
all of this is getting really old
im having trouble sleeping on my own
feeling like a house but not a home
i want you to know

chorus
that i just got this crazy feeling
ive been making someone wait for me for me

guess i need a watch to tell the time
guess i need the sun to help me shine
and i really need you in my life
now i know

chorus
that you give me this crazy feeling
and you wont have to wait no more for me for me
and i just got this crazy feeling
ive been making someone wait for me14embed"
