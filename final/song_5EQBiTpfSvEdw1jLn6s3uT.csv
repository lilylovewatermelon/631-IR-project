wish i could say it was gonna get better

i tried drinkin til the well ran dry
im movin on to greener pastures

verse 2
i dont know what took so long
to say solong to you
all you do is wear me out
just like the evening news
so you can plant your garden
where you used to chew my ass
yeah i dont want this dirt no more
im tradin it for grass

hit it til it all goes up in smoke up in smoke
puff puff pass it around back to myself right now

im movin on to greener pastures
gettin stoned so it dont matter

i tried drinkin til the well ran dry
im movin on to greener pastures
i tried prayin to the man up high
i tried drinkin til the well ran dry
im movin on to greener pasturesembed"
