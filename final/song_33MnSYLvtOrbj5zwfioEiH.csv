iâ€™m just the boy inside the man
not exactly who you think i am
trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
im just a speck inside your hand
you came and made me who i am
i remember where it all began so clearly

prechorus
i feel a million miles away
still you connect me in your way
and you create in me something i wouldve never seen
when i could only see the floor
you made my window a door
so when they say they dont believe i hope that they see you in me
after all the lights go down im just the words you are the sound
a strange type of chemistry
how youve become a part of me
and when i sit alone at night your thoughts burn through me like a fire
youre the only one who knows who i really am

chorus
we all wanna be somebody
we just need a taste of who we are
we all wanna be somebody
were willing to go but not that far

and were all see through just like glass
and we can shatter just as fast
that lights been burned out for a while ooh
i still see it every time i pass ooh
it was lost in the corners of my mind
behind a box of reasons why
i never doubted it was there ooh
it just took a little time to find and even when ooh

prechorus
i feel a million miles away
still you connect me in your way
and you create in me something i wouldve never seen
when i could only see the floor you made my window a door
so when they say they dont believe i hope that they see you in me
after all the lights go down im just the words you are the sound
a strange type of chemistry
how youve become a part of me
and when i sit alone at night your thoughts burn through me like a fire
youre the only one who knows who i really am

chorus
we all wanna be somebody
we just need a taste of who we are
we all wanna be somebody
were willing to go but not that far
we all wanna be somebody
we just need a taste of who we are
we all wanna be somebody
were willing to go but not that far
outro
im just the boy inside the man
not exactly who you think i am
trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
when i could only see the floor
you made my window a door
so when they say they dont believe i hope that they see you in me16embed"
