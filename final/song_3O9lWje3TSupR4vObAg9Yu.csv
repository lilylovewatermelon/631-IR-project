mama dont pray for my success anymore yeah
but mama still prays for me
seein the world aint really seein the world
through a window from a to b
between alcohol and women and adderall and adrenaline
i dont ever get no rest
signed my life away to be the life of the party
yeah to everybody else

chorus
i look like a rockstar in and out of cop cars
livin out a suitcase trashin hotel bars
if i see the sunrise its cause i stayed up all night
drinkin cause i need to damn it what a good life
judgin by my long hair you might think i dont care
sittin here sippin and bitchin about a spot where
peoplе would kill to be kill to be kill to be
but yall it aint as good as it seems this livin thе dream is
killin me killin me killin me
its killin me killin me killin me

verse 2
another day another venue
theres trouble to get into
and love aint on the menu again
lonely as an eagle
i meet a thousand people
who think i got a thousand friends

ooh
theres a stranger in the mirror
ooh
but accordin to the pictures

chorus
im a rockstar in and out of cop cars

people would kill to be kill to be kill to be
