well its about that time for us
to look around and meet somebody new
lets all welcome in
familiar faces perhaps somebody who
has got a conflict in their life alright
tell them youre sorry but
theres ways to change the wrong to right

and watch rain clouds pour thoughts of greatness
to help our troubles sail real far away oh yeah
