what do you want to do
you and your bullshit youve got a bullshit answer for everybody
but i ask you a very simple question and you cant give me a straight answer
because you dont know

verse
blow these os in the air
os by the pair we aint never gotta share
his and hers blunts while the whole world stares
pullin and pinnin back my hair grab another leaf and fucking tear
in the lair of the rare feel the glare when you approach
you dont see me you dont hear me
you just feel me like a ghost that i am
bring a scam im a bring the whole team
all i ever am is me all i wanna do is break your dreams
look who done came up what
raspberry blunts with the granny smith cups bones wait
look who done came up what
almond milk with the flaxseed on topyou might also like9embed"
