and theres no turning back now
everyone around me smoking crack
this tunnel is blinding hallucinating
im debating life but its still moving forward
if i could just change the hands of time

well id do it better

just walk away
just walk away

just walk away

fearless i have fell into a trap
and theres no way around it
everyone is crying in the back
my kin is around me hesitating
theres no second chance
when you know youre a loser
keep on trying keep an open mind

im caught in a circle

just walk away
just walk away
just walk away
just walk away

feel as if ive fell into the blue
hallucinating theres no turning back
everyone around me smoking crack

just walk away
just walk away
just walk away
just walk away

have you even heard a thing ive saidembed"
