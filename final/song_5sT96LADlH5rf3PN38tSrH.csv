yesterday i spotted you hangin out with someone new
cmon dude i cant believe who
did it hurt
oh yes it hurt
but not as much as i thought it would
guess its time for me to move on

chorus
im getting closer closer
closer to closure closer to closure
every days closer closer
closer to closure closer to closure

verse 2
i finally took your pictures down
and all that other stuff i found
hidden somewhere in my closet
i used to wear your shirt to bed
but now its in the trash instead
i dont wanna be reminded
no no

chorus
im getting closer closer
closer to closure closer to closure
every days closer closer
closer to closure closer to closure

i saw you today taken my breath away
but then you opened your mouth without thinking
and then i recalled why i ended it all
and it makes me feel good about leaving leaving

breakdown
oh everyday everyday everyday everyday
everyday everyday everyday im getting closer

chorus
im getting closer closer
closer to closure closer to closure
every days closer closer
closer to closure closer to closureembed"
