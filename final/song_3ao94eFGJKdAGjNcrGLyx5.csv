sometimes i think this cycle never ends
we slide from top to bottom then we turn and climb again
and it seems by the time that i have figured what its worth
the squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse

prechorus
but if i move my place in line ill lose
and i have waited the anticipations got me glued

chorus 1
i am waiting for something to go wrong
i am waiting for familiar resolve

verse 2
sometimes it seems that i dont have the skills to recollect
the twists and turns of plot that turned us from lovers to friends
im thinking i should take that volume back up off the shelf
and crack its weary spine and read to help remind myself

prechorus
but if i move my place in line ill lose
and i have waited the anticipations got me glued

chorus 2
i am waiting for something to go wrong
i am waiting for familiar resolve
i am waiting for another repeat
another diet fed by crippling defeat
and i am waiting for that sense of relief
i am waiting for you to flee the scene
as if you held in your hand the smoking gun
and on the floor lay the one you said you loved
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likebridge
and its strange theyre all basically the same
so i dont ask names anymore

verse 3
sometimes i think this cycle never ends
we slide from top to bottom then we turn and climb again
and it seems by the time that i have figured what its worth
the squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse

outro
the squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse
the squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse5embed"
