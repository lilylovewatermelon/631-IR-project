while were on the subject
could we change the subject now
i was knocking on your ears door
but you were always out
looking towards the future
we were begging for the past
well we knew we had the good things
but those never seemed to last
oh please just last

verse 2 isaac brock
everyones unhappy
everyones ashamed
well we all just got caught looking
at somebody elses page
well nothing ever went
quite exactly as we planned
our ideas held no water
but we used them like a dam

chorus 1 isaac brock  james mercer
oh and we carried it all so well
as if we got a new position
oh and ill laugh all the way to hell
sayin yes this is a fine promotion
oh and ill laugh all the way to hell

of course everyone goes crazy
over such and such and such
we made ourselves a pillar
we just used it as a crutch
we were certainly uncertain
at least im pretty sure i am
well we didnt need the water
but we just built that good goddamn

chorus 2 isaac brock  james mercer
oh and i know this of myself
i assume as much for other people
oh and i know this of myself
weve listened more to lifes end gong than
the sound of lifes sweet bells

verse 4 isaac brock
was it ever worth it
was there all that much to gain
well we knew wed missed the boat
and wed already missed the plane
we didnt read the invite
we just danced at our own wake
all our favorites were aplaying
so we could shake shake shake shake shake
verse 5 isaac brock
tiny curtains open and we heard the
tiny clap of little hands a tiny
man would tell a little joke and get a
tiny laugh from all the folks sittin
driftin around on bubbles then
thinkin it was us that carried them
when we finally got it figured out
that we had truly missed the boat

chorus 3 isaac brock  james mercer
oh and we carried it all so well
as if we got a new position
oh and we owned all the tools ourselves
but not the skills to make a shelf with
oh what useless tools ourselves8embed"
