this is as far as it goes
this the end of the road
this the end of the rope
the other end of the throat
its suicidal she wrote
this is the end of the show its over
we doin drugs til we in a coma

verse 1
we dont love these hoes our hearts got colder
its hard out here for a lonely stoner
i know im doin drugs but so what
just pray to god i never throw up
i pray to god my plug got pour up
i pray to god my plug still show up
i know the last time we tried to rob him
he lucky bronem aint fuckin off him
im drinkin drivin in the bentley coupe so
its hard for me to drive i move too slow
i told you baby i aint savin no ho
i only save the money antihero
i burned my old clothes and got some new clothes
i left my old hoes and got some new hoes
my brother got a chopper and its kickin like judo
he shootin while im drivin the twodoor

verse 2
im smokin dope til im in a coma
the moon rock on me i love the aroma
i get so high that im in the clouds with the fallen angels
demons with halos
she love the coke but not cocacola
but shell still pop it like a soda for ya
her name rings bells like a motorola
i lay the bitch off like im her employer
and she gon ride like a roller coaster
and im gon hide when the love is over
but its far from over losing composure
in a coffin laying stiff like a boulder
