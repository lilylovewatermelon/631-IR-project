falling asleep
im just writing words
yeah

verse tyga
unreal to a close eye
can’t feel but you heard that i’m close by
it’s more vivid the image embedded in my mind
i look around and rarely i see a fake smile
no time when the tick is down
my rolex dial don’t mean shit now it’s just another pay cut
my mind made up unnecessary layups
you can still win aint got a rich or star player
fuck a hater still remain a self made nigga
live bigger credit cards no limits
i dropped twenty on the luggage took ten minutes
i don’t shop online those are all gimmicks
only make moves when your hearts in it
big said it so i entertain like cedric
standin on the trunk rooftop view the city
batman spotlight gotta save you bitches
jokes on you jack
who the fuck you gon call when your shit towed by the repo
can’t tell your girl so she the centerfold
now you gettin played like casios
uh casino’s cnotes and chips like frito’s
got a free coat when costa rico
most hoes only know two words
like gimme those still buy em though
currently ballin’ so i gotta let ya know
flash through the tint roll the window tilt the brim
what the fuck i did lemme see your registration
ima keep it real kid i’m just hatin
ain’t a opportunity i ain’t take close chase
city national bank evolve into shape
of a dollar then i duplicate
motherfucker don’t believe let me demonstrate
i dreamed a motherfucker try to kill me in my sleep
whats the point of steak when niggas want beef
diss me cause they hungry
made a meal that you couldn’t eat
you fuckin snakes in a rat race twoface bitches
that’s why i don’t fuck with none of yall niggas
cause soon as yall fell well you fell with em
its like puttin 87 in a bentley nigga don’t tempt me
