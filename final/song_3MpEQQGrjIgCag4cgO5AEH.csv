you make me feel like im losing my virginity
the first time every time when youre touching me
i make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
under the sun we are one buzzing energy
lets pollinate to create a family tree
this evolution with you comes naturally
some call it science science we call it chemistry
this is the story of the birds and the bees

prechorus
and even when seasons change
our love still stays the same

chorus
you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
spread my wings and make me fly
the taste of your honey is so sweet
when you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
hummingbird heartbeat
ah ah hummingbird heartbeat
ah ah hummingbird heartbeat

verse 2
ive flown a million miles just to find a magic seed
a white flower with the power to bring life to me
youre so exotic get my whole body fluttering
constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
always on the brink of a heart attack
you keep me alive and keep me coming back
i see the sun rise in your eyes your eyes
weve got a future full of blue skies blue skies
