theres a photograph
of a day gone past
always makes me laugh
theres a little girl
wary of the world
she got much to learn
get her fingers burnt
an affinity
between you and me
was a family
said that id be fine
gave me all your time
and i left your side
like a butterfly

shower me with your love
colour of everyday
you make the milkgold sun
shine on me yeah
lift me up so high
watch me fly away
and you give me life
like a butterfly

in my mothers house
there was happiness
i wrapped my myself in it
was my chrysalis
as my life unfolds
see a pattern through
of you protecting me
and i protecting you
what was that youd say
make your own mistakes
and when youre grown
make sure that you remain the same
now i realise
what was on your mind
when i left your side
like a butterfly
