i walk into obsession makes the world go round
were made up by the people we surround
so we live in times with shit we dont need
well maybe its the price of envy

prechorus
with these eyes i look out for me
but everyone fades in ways we dont see
nothings gonna change why were going down in flames so
im not the one dont wait for me

chorus
cause i wont just sit by while you just bleed
myself and others dry dont wait for me
to be there in the end when you dont see
the truth you just pretend dont wait for me

verse 2
what is the solution we already know
theres no telling how far this could go
no youre near your time but you just dont see
cause youre just part of this game

prechorus
theres nothing you can do to save yourself
you leave your life in the hands of someone else
youll never let it go why its the only way you know know
im not the one dont wait for me
