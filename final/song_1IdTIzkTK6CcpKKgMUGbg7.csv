some of us were hardly ever here
the rest of us were born to disappear
how do i stop myself from being just a number
how will i hold my head to keep from goin under

chorus
down to the wire
i wanted water but ill walk through the fire
if this is what it takes to take me even higher
then ill come through
like i do when the world keeps testing me testing me testing me

verse 2
how did they find me here
what do they want from me
all of these vultures hiding right outside my door
i hear them whispering
theyre tryin to ride it out
theyve never gone this long without a kill before

chorus
down to the wire
i wanted water but ill walk through the fire
if this is what it takes to take me even higher
then ill come through
like i do when the world keeps testing me testing me testing me

verse 3
wheels up
i got to leave this evening
i cant seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
power is made by power being taken
so i keep on running to protect my situation

chorus
down to the wire
i wanted water but ill walk through the fire
if this is what it takes to take me even higher
then ill come through
like i do when the world keeps testing me testing me now
