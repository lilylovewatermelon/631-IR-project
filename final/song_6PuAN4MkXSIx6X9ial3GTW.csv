this is the song that reminds me of my trucker hat
that i used to wear not to block out the sun
with a john deere logo and a stain on the back
from where you laid me out flat one look i was done

prechorus
and all these things mean nothing to me
when i’m with you i’ve got everything
i could want and i could need even god he would agree
you and i were meant to be it’s easy to see

chorus
i’ll never go out of style on you
and nothing really feels the way you do
nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
when you fit me like you do

verse 2
this is the verse about the parachute pants
that i learned to breakdance in and thought i was good
so much for believing the fat guy doesn’t win
get the girl in the end i never thought that i could

prechorus
and all these things mean nothing to me
when i’m with you i’ve got everything
i could want and i could need even god he would agree
you and i were meant to be it’s easy to see
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likechorus
i’ll never go out of style on you
and nothing really feels the way you do
nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
when you fit me like you do

bridge
i’m not the perfect guy a little slow but i’ve
got perfect timing with you
take a look around outside the in crowd
there aint nothing we cant do

chorus
i’ll never go out of style on you
and nothing really feels the way you do
nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
when you fit me like you do

chorus
i’ll never go out of style on you
and nothing really feels the way you do
nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
when you fit me like you do

outro
i’ll never go out of style on you
and nothing really feels the way you do
nothing in the world could ever make me look as good
when you fit me like you doembed"
