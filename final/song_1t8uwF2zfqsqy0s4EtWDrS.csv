i think its pretty strange
watching the passersby
crawling all over one another
trying to get ahead in life

bridge
monday you cough
tuesday you cry
wednesday in bed
what if you die

verse 2
you say that im insane
i say youre probably right
we all got something important to say
but talkings a waste of time

bridge
monday you cough
tuesday you cry
wednesday in bed
what if you die

chorus
cry baby cry
kick scream fight hold on with all your might
youre gonna die die
open up your eyes or life will pass you by
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likeverse 3
dont you think its pretty strange
all got something to hide
house in the desert top of a mountain
lost in a deepsea dive

bridge
monday you cough
tuesday you cry
wednesday in bed
thursday you die

chorus
cry baby cry
kick scream fight hold on with all your might
youre gonna die die
open up your eyes or life will pass you by
without love without love
nothing else will ever be enough

outro
cry baby cry
like it or not like it or not
its a matter of time
cry baby cry
like it or not like it or not
its a matter of time
its a matter of time7embed"
