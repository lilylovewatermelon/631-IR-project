when you found me there
and you rode down the street watch me work
building tables and chairs
you wore white we were married in july
in a church on a hill
and i cried cos you looked just like the winter
dressed in the light

where do i go
what do i know now
with my sweet love gone with my sweet love gone

with my hands oh i worked the night and day
and i built you a home
and we raised our own children in those walls
now theyre happy and gone
and our yard it was colourful with flowers
that scented the air
and i watched as they slowly died away
when you needed me there

who do i be
what do i see now
with my sweet love gone with my sweet love gone
see the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeyou grew old so much faster than i could
and i knew you would go
laid to rest on a sunday afternoon
and you left me alone

how do i live
what do i give now
with my sweet love gone with my sweet love goneembed"
