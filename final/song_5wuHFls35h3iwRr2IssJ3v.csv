the phone rings
another peaceful moment is lost
latifahs chest jingle in set it off
i press pause in the bed as a king
i let it ring 4 or 5 times
answer while im puffin my green
its tamika sayin hi nas
i caught a flashback of her askin me was i asthmatic fore i tapped that
she offered me dinner under the moon
i said sorry i made plans at rays boomboom room
nine pushups strengths gone at the tenth one so why hook up
the pimps gone off the patron tequila
put on my lees and the original filas
sedated from ls 380 cocked naked ladies laid up in tels
like whodini i chose gazelles dont lean on my nose
drivin by the clubs gleamin and go
heads turn its a freak show
i need them to know when will they learn
nas need a queen not a ho to
point out my enemies a girl whos into me
but not a hype chick someone with proper energy
someone whos into me but wont fuck with my enemies
and you can sing along cause im feelin ya energy

chorus claudette ortiz
hey nas how ya doin
take my name and my number
meanwhile well be groovin
but lets take it slow
see nas liveget tickets as low as 106you might also likeverse 2 nas
one for the honies who roll blunts up but dont smoke
two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
three for the g they got they game is hot i give it to you
double life wife play with the man thats livin with you
heres the issue a woman gotta be stunnin
get to a mans heart through his stomach
you gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
hit the museum maybe central park you mentally smart
picture we in tiffany you becomin my counterpart
if i want chinese then you buy me a wok
if you want barbecue i call professor and ak
cause you point out my enemies someone whos into me
but not a hyper chick someone with the proper energy
a girl thats into me who wont fuck all my enemies
and you could be the one cause im lovin ya energy

chorus kelis
hey nas how ya doin
take my name and my number
meanwhile well be cruisin
but lets take it slow

verse 3 nas
slow is the way holdin hands tongue and hickeys
hope and i pray when i run that you run away with me
thats if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
hear sirens jump in the stick drop a sedan and hide for years
like no one else in the world exist except for us two
you gotta trust me i gotta trust you
if coppers bust me its me you rescue this to the death boo
you rep me respectfully thats how i rep for you
retired from pimpin perspire is drenchin
as we suck and fuck each others minds out commission
times out forbidden
until we pass out thats when we stop
we give it all we got give it all we got we hot
give it all we got give it all we got we rock
give it all we got give it all we got
you bout the baddest thing
since michael had billie jean
and prince gave you diamonds and pearls
but to be my queen you must
point out my enemies a girl whos into me
but not a hype chick someone with proper energy
someone whos into me who wont fuck all my enemies
and you can be the one cause im feelin ya energy
chorus claudette ortiz  kelis
hey nas how ya doin
take my name and my number
meanwhile well be cruisin
but lets take it slow

outro claudette ortiz
i can be what you said
that you need i can be all that
i can be i can have your back baby
i can be what you said
that you need i can be all that
i can be i can have your back baby4embed"
