theres this flash i get often a fever dream or a vision of sorts
most times late at night
and i havent found out why but i know exactly why
im on this road and i hear gravel underneath me and i feel it too
and i dont know where i am but i know exactly where i am
its dark its really dark
and the car is warm but somehow i can feel how cold the night is
i dont know where the road leads but i know exactly where it ends
you see i keep driving and all i see for the longest while is my headlights
for an eternity it seems
and everything is desolate and empty and nothing and hopeless
im lost but i know where im going
im safe im warm im driving
and i see this small light
a dim one growing bigger and brighter and closer and stronger
and the closer i get the more i see
i make out a house with light strewn across it a porch and cars
some frosted windshields that hadnt been touched for hours
i hear a song and its faint
and i cant make out the name but i know every word
i feel my feet first
and its cold and theyre crunching and its the sound of driveways
and the wind takes my breath with it
and then i walk up to this door and i knock even though i feel i dont have to
and i dont know where i am but i know exactly where i am
and this crack of light widens on this porch underneath me as this door opens
and this brownhaired girl with the brightest smile
i dont know who she is but i know her so well
and behind her the warmest home id ever seen
its orange and comfortable theres fire and its bulblit
she says
where have you been weve been waiting on you all night
weve missed you
she says to the kindest smirk id seen in so long
then she tapers off the sentence with the
with the peaceful sound that a lady makes
she grabs me on the forearms pulls softly into the dining room
and theres people and theyre happy and theyre content for one
i dont know who they are but i know exactly who they are
and were all standing and im laughing at a joke ill never hear again
i dont know where i am but i know exactly where i am
and then she tucks her head between my collar as a friend
between my collar and my jaw and theres no weight at all
and i dont know where i am but theres no weight at all
its laughter and grins and no tomorrow to win
and i dont know where i am but i know exactly where i am
i dont know where i am but i know exactly where i amsee zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeembed"
