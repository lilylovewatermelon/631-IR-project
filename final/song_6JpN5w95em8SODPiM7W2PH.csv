house nigga dont fuck with me
im a field nigga with shined cutlery
goldplated quarters where the butlers be
ima play the corners where the hustlers be
i told him please dont die over the neighborhood
that your mama rentin
take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
thats how you rinse it
i bought every v12 engine
wish i could take it back to the beginnin
i coulda bought a place in dumbo before it was dumbo
for like 2 million
that same building today is worth 25 million
guess how im feelin dumbo

you wanna know whats more important than throwin away money at a strip club credit
you ever wonder why jewish people own all the property in america this how they did it

verse 2
financial freedom my only hope
fuck livin rich and dyin broke
i bought some artwork for one million
two years later that shit worth two million
few years later that shit worth eight million
i cant wait to give this shit to my children
yall think its bougie im like its fine
but im tryin to give you a million dollars worth of game for 999
i turned that 2 to a 4 4 to an 8
i turned my life into a nice first week release date
yall out here still takin advances huh

yall on the gram holdin money to your ear
theres a disconnect we dont call that money over here yeah
