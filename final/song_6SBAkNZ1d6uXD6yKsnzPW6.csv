wellliked a really nice fella thats why its hard to believe
one day two counties over he got caught with another mans wife
shots fired smoke cleared her husband took jimmys life
in an instant all the good stuff hed ever done was all gone
now everybody just remembers the one thing that he did wrong

you can have it all an in the twinklin of an eye
it can all turn around
if i live to roam this earth another hundred years
without 20 seconds from right now
that aint the way that i wanna go out

rob jenkins sittin on the back pew head bowed an his eyes closed
preacher talkin bout gettin to heaven said brother would you like to go
white knuckles holdin his hymnal while the choir sang amazing grace
he stands up full of conviction turns round an runs out of that place
off in his truck says to himself next sunday im agonna get saved
runs a red light hit broadside an next sunday is way too late

you can have it all an in the twinklin of an eye
it can all turn around
if i live to roam this earth another hundred years
without 20 seconds from right now
that aint the way that i wanna go out
see craig morgan liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeim gonna do right an make sure i ask forgiveness before i go
im gonna take time cause its a fine line
between here an you never know

you can have it all an in the twinklin of an eye
it can all turn around
if i live to roam this earth another hundred years
without 20 seconds from right now
that aint the way that i wanna go out
that aint the way that i wanna go out
no i dont wanna go outembed"
