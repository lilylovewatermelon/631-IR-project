verse 1 juicy j
they call me the juice so you know ima stunt
riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
tone in my lap and you know its a pump
breaking down the good green rolling the blunt

ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
riding through the hood got me gripping the grain
and im sipping the same while im changing the lane
