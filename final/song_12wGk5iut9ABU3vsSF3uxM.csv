i was only ten years old
like the back of my hand knew the roads
i swerved my bike and lost control
over the handles in the air
a lady who came walking by found me lying there
and the nurse at the hospital said

chorus
little boy dont be scared
now your father is waiting in the next room
little boy dont be sad
now your moms on her way youll be out of here soon

verse 2
we drove so slowly through these streets
in the suburbs of our dreams
at night my father closed his eyes
he saw the new car in the drive
my mother standing in the doorway
friday night a smile on her face
and the voice i can hear in my head

chorus
little boy dont be scared
now you know well be sleeping in the next room
little boy dont be sad
now tomorrow is as it is coming round soon
see vance joy liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likebridge
we only need a little space
just somewhere we could call our place
my mother standing in the doorway
friday night a smile on her face
these things always start so small
with no applause and no drum roll
and i came running up the hallway
see the car turn in the driveway

outro
and ill always be that little boy
and ive always been that little boy
yeah ill always be that little boy
and ill always be that little boy2embed"
