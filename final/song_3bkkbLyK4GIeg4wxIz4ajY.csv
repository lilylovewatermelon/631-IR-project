surf to me whatever you want
and whenever youre breezing through
keep tearing my world apart
as we lost the light wet cash on the bar
she fell victim to a violent wave
and died on the jagged rocks

prechorus
but dont believe
its a neverending summer
cause they dont exist
tied around your tongue in all
the rage and spit
so why am i the one falling apart

chorus
cause you dont even know youre an angel
foolish am i for the times i come and go
these stars defy love so i close my eyes
and sleep inside your wornin bed outline

verse 2
splash over your body while you drown on me
you aint seen nothin yet enter the galaxy
of our sober demise
to the young and without type ohohoh
in the morning hear all the birds sing
it never stops then with tears in your eyes
you smiled dressed in coppertone tan lines
ohoh i hope you dont regret me
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeprechorus
but dont believe
its a neverending summer
cause they dont exist
tied around your tongue in all
the rage and spit
so why am i the one falling apart

chorus
cause you dont even know youre an angel
foolish am i for the times i come and go
these stars defy love so i close my eyes
and sleep inside your wornin bed

postchorus
and it wont be long til we drop this match ohohoh
when i burn to your fingertips you can throw whats left

bridge
so long
lets go and play those games you like
lets go and play those games you like
oh

prechorus
but dont believe
cause yesterday i found her with her
clothes still wet
crying in the shower on her
knees she screamed
why the fuck am i falling apart
chorus
cause you dont even know youre an angel
foolish am i for the times i come and go
these stars defy love so close my eyes
and sleep inside your wornin bed

outro
and it woke me up like a heart attack
when you talk in your sleep ill be there to slow your breath3embed"
