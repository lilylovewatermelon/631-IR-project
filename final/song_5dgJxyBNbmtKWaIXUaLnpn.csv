happiness was just outside my window
i thought itd crash blowing eighty miles an hour
but happiness is a little more like knocking
on your door you just let it in

verse 2
happiness feels a lot like sorrow
let it be you cant make it come or go
but you are gone not for good but for now
and gone for now feels a lot like gone for good

verse 3
happiness is a firecracker sitting on my headboard
happiness was never mine to hold
careful child light the fuse and get away
cause happiness throws a shower of sparks
yeah yeah

verse 4
happiness damn near destroys you
breaks your faith to pieces on the floor
so you tell yourself thats enough for now
but happiness has a violent roar

bridge
happiness is like the old man told me
look for it and youll never find it all
but let it go live your life and leave it
then one day youll wake up and shell be
