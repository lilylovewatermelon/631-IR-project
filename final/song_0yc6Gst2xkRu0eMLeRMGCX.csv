you leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

chorus
got the music in you baby tell me why
got the music in you baby tell me why
youve been locked in here forever and you just cant say goodbye

verse 2
kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
youve been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

chorus
got the music in you baby tell me why
got the music in you baby tell me why
youve been locked in here forever and you just cant say goodbye

bridge
your lips my lips
apocalypse
your lips my lips
apocalypse
go and sneak us through the rivers
flood is rising up on your knees
oh please
come out and haunt me i know you want me
come out and haunt me
you might also likeverse 3
sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

chorus
got the music in you baby tell me why
got the music in you baby tell me why
youve been locked in here forever and you just cant say goodbye
youve been locked in here forever and you just cant say goodbye
outro
oh when youre all alone
i will reach for you
when youre feeling low
i will be there too65embed"
