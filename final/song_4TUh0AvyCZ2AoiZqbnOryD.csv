well ill be on my way
this is what she told me told me
that ive got too much on my plate
but baby you dont know me know me
so why am i afraid
to be the one who asks the questions im looking for direction
was sorta hoping youd explain
how to be the man that you were looking

chorus
the man you were looking for
how to be the man that you were looking for

verse 2
i think you thought this was a game
but the rules are there for breaking breaking
so i guess i am to blame
thats why my heart is aching aching
while my bodys numb
ill continue looking for the answer your love is like a cancer
and i hope its not too late
to be the man that you were looking

chorus
the man you were looking for
how to be the man that you were looking for
how to be the man that you were looking for
see ocean alley liveget tickets as low as 38you might also likebridge
running always running
away
and all i need is for you to stay
running always running
away
and all i need is for you to say

chorus
that im the man that you been looking for
gonna be the man that youve been looking for
how to be the man that youve been looking for
how to be the man that youve been looking for
how to be the man that youve been looking forembed"
