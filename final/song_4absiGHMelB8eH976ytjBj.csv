rosemary
heaven restores you in life
youre coming with me
through the aging the fearing the strife
its the smiling on the package
its the faces in the sand
its the thought that moves you upwards
embracing me with two hands
right will take you places
yeah maybe to the beach
when your friends they do come crying
tell them now your pleasures set upon slow release

prechorus
hey wait
great smile
sensitive to fate not
denial
but hey whos on trial

chorus
it took a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy why cant we look the other way

he speaks about travel
yeah we think about the land
we smart like all peoples
feeling real tan
i could take you places
do you need a new man
wipe the pollen from the faces
make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

prechorus
hey wait
great smile
sensitive to fate not
denial
but hey whos on trial

chorus
it took a life span with no cell mate
by the long way back
sandy why cant we look the other way
youre weightless you are exotic
you need something for which to care
sandy why cant we look the other way

verse 3
leave some shards under the belly
lay some grease inside my hand
its a sentimental jury
and the makings of a good plan
youve come to love me lightly
yeah you come to hold me tight
is this motion everlasting
or do shudders pass in the night
rosemary
oh heaven restores you in life
chorus
i spent a life span with no cell mate
the long way back
sandy why cant we look the other way
youre weightless semierotic
you need someone to take you there
sandy why cant we look the other way
why cant we just play the other game
why cant we just look the other way24embed"
