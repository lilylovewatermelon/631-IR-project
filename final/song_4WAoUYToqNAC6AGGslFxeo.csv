just when you were getting used to this place
you were getting used to these bones
you were getting used to the changes well
the change wont leave you alone
you finally caught up with the pace
the tough just might have got going
you thought you could trust all the faces
well theyre only on one side of the coin

chorus
all these changes different stages
turning page after page after page
it gets stranger day by day

verse 2
you set your eyes straight up ahead
dont look down when you cross
and pay no mind to time its a punchline
the joke is on all of us

chorus
all these changes different stages
turning page after page after page
it gets stranger day by daysee jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeembed"
