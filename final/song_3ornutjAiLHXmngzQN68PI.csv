this bipolar love affair
it just aint where its at for me anymore
so dont let the door hit you when you leave
you throw me in the fire just to save my life
a pretty little liar
when i call you out youd rather put up a fight
than just come clean

chorus
get on your way to making someone else feel low
then higher than they ever thought they could go
you already know
im giving you up youre letting me down
stop pretending that youre gonna turn yourself around

hook
you already know know know
you already know know know know
dont ask me why
you already know

verse 2
i was a shoulder you leaned on
you made me feel like the next james bond
double o seven oh hell you were heaven to me to me to me to me
but while you were saying what i wanted to hear
you started breaking ground on a new frontier
always making love
but never with me never with me never with me

so get on your way to making someone else feel low
then higher than they ever thought they could go
you already know
im giving you up youre letting me down
stop pretending that youre gonna turn yourself around

hook
you already know know know
you already know know know know
dont ask me why
you already know

bridge
you already know that im done waiting
going crazy hating myself for loving you
at least the one side of you i thought i knew

hook
you already know
you already know know know know
you already know know know know
dont ask me whyembed"
