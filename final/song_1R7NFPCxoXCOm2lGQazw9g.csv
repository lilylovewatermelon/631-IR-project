late night train back to of austin
couple cars cocaine and the interstate
most every night this is what its like
you dont answer i keep callin just to stay awake

chorus
hope what you said wasnt meant for me
you told me i was no good
its alright babe im pretty used to being misunderstood

verse 2
i never pegged you for what you are
had it in my head i would break your heart
hate to think about what i did
some things in me are broke i cant find a fix

chorus
hope what you said wasnt meant for me
you told me i was no good
its alright babe im pretty used to bein misunderstood
its alright babe im pretty used to bein misunderstood

verse 3
go home and sleep til i leave again
thats why i gave you up couldnt watch you cry
you said youd wait on me patiently
but ill live out of a bag til the day i die

i guess i get how you think of me
you told me i was no good
its alright babe im pretty used to bein misunderstood
its alright babe im pretty used to bein misunderstood
its alright babe im pretty used to bein misunderstoodembed"
