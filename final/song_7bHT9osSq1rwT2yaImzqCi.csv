its an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd yeah
you can see the sparks from hot metal yeah
coldhearted from the day i bogarted
the game my soul started to rot fellow yeah
when im not even in my harshest
you can still get roasted cause marsh is not mellow
til im topplin from the top im not gonna stop
im standin on my monopoly board uh
that means im on top of my game
and it dont stop til my hip dont hop anymore shit
when youre so good that you cant say it
cause it aint even cool for you to sound cocky anymore shit
people just get sick cause you spit
these fools cant drool or dribble a drop anymore ow
and you can never break my stride nope
youll never slow the momentum at any moment im bout to blow
youll never take my pride
killin the flow slow venom and the opponent is gettin no
