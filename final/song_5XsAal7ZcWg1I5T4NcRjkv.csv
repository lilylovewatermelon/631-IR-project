i dont want it
and i dont want to want you
but in my dreams i seem to be more honest
and i must admit youve been in quite a few

verse 2
halleys comet
comes around more than i do
but youre all it takes for me to break a promise
silly me to fall in love with you

verse 3
i havent slept since sunday
midnight for me is 3 am for you
but my sleepless nights are better
with you than nights could ever be alone oohooh
i was good at feeling nothin now im hopeless
what a drag to love you like i do
oohoohoohoohooh

verse 4
ive been loved before but right now in this moment
i feel more and more like i was madе for you
for you
you might also likeinstrumental break

outro
im sitting in my brothers room
havent slept in a week or two or two
i think i might havе fallen in love
