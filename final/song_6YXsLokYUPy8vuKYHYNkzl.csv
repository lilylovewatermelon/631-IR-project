and blew up through the roof
i watched the fed saw them panic
as the fire grew
i saw virginia get rid of langley
and its secrets too
i held your hand and sat there knowing
that wed make it through

i saw this man dispose of hunger
and soap operas too
i saw this field that grew perfection
full of things you do
i saw this box get rid of heartache
and cure cancer too
when i awoke i sat there hoping
this is what well do

if we can we will leave a letter
and this song for you
and well write once a day
and float it through the sea to you
well regret all those things we thought of
but didnt ever do

if we can we will leave a letter
and this song for you
and well write once a day
and float it through the sea to you
well regret all those things we thought of
but didnt ever do
when the sky seems to clear
who will then be left
but a few me and youyou might also likeembed"
