youre my favorite explosion
you know the only real way to cure pain is to add a little more
because everything new distracts the old

verse 1 vic fuentes
a violin with no hands plays symphonies
with no words with no words
a drowning boy with no voice prays

true love comes from more than just the heart

verse 3 vic fuentes
so say it say it say say im in love
cause you called me crying crying crying crying from your job

a diamond bullet and a gun made of gold
she was covered in blood last seen in san francisco

sometimes the bedroom walls become my only friends
but they were there from beginning to end
there from beginning to end
chorus vic fuentes
im tired of holding up your backup plans
go down your list and be satisfied
its all you have
