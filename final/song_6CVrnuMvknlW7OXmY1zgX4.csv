i got death in my pocket and nothing but time
all these bones in the closet in the back of my mind
i just leave em there i don’t even care no
holding up a flare i could use a prayer oh
i got death in my pocket but i feel so alive

interlude machine gun kelly
dont know why but it feels like my world is crashing down
i just bought a brand—
fuck how much darkness does it take to get this flashy

verse 1 machine gun kelly
dont know why but it feels like my world is crashing down
i just bought a brand new car i wanna crash it now
how much darkness did it take to get this flashy now
i lose a piece of my soul when the cameras flash
so i’m just asking every fan whos questioning my passion
thinking im caught up in fashion or that i forgot my past
to understand that im just a dropout i dont have the answers
i became a dad so young i aint know how to use them pampers
baby mamas food stamps kept my stomach full
i had to make a plan cause now my family needed me to make it rapping
me and slim back at that address 128th we trapping
writing lyrics down on napkins
room so small we shared a mattress
look what happened

i got death in my pocket and nothing but time
all these bones in the closet in the back of my mind
i just leave ’em there i don’t even care no
holding up a flare i could use a prayer oh
i got death in my pocket but i feel so alive

verse 2 machine gun kelly
dont know how i get so high but i’m not passing out
i guess the drugs are  in my blood hope i dont pass it down
hope im alive to see my baby get her cap and gown
cause doctors told my dad he won’t be here a year from now
yeah my first reaction is punching the wall until its cracking
both my knuckles shattered dont ask what the fucks the matter
ive been battling the fact i lost my closest to cancer
the only thing she asked was for me and him to get closer
but i hung up too fast went to sleep and then she passed
youve been silent seven years it took that to get us back
we all needed second chances ive been bottling the sadness
i guess im just happy that we finally got to bury shit before the casket

chorus naomi wild  machine gun kelly
i got death in my pocket and nothing but time
all these bones in the closet in the back of my mind
i just leave em there i dont even care no
holding up a flare i could use a prayer oh
i got death in my pocket but i feel so alive
outro machine gun kelly
i think im ready to die tonight
its fucked up cause i aint lived half my life
i saw the devil and passed him like
you tryna fuck up my afterlife
but i dont even care you can keep me there yeah
holding up a flare i needed a prayer yeah
i got death in my pocket
but i feel so alive15embed"
