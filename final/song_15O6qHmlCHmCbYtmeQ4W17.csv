its your last chance to find yourself in consequence
its so hard to find a simple reason
maybe ill find myself with evidence
hate breeds with nothing to believe in
another day another day in paradise
if you only knew wouldnt it be nice

prechorus
get away get away get away
im about to detonate

chorus
everything to prove
nothing to lose
just when everything has fallen to the ground
going to knock it down
just believe me when i tell you its alright

verse 2
this time were on our way to tragedy
forever bored and outside from the in crowd
ive come to grip confronting my reality
numb struck its me against the world now
for all you know for all you know its not for real
spare me the obsession that you deal

chorus
everything to prove
nothing to lose
just when everything has fallen to the ground
going to knock it down
just believe me when i tell you its alright
everything to prove
nothing to lose
just when everything has fallen to the ground
going to knock it down
just believe me when i tell you its alright

bridge
i shouldve know right from the start
that youd take this trust and rip me apart
could be a change of heart

outro
ill fall into you but dont believe that this is real
ill fall into you but dont believe that this is real
ill fall into you but dont believe that this is real
ill fall into you but dont believe that this is realembed"
