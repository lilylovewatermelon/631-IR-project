verse 1 justin timberlake
didnt have to run i knew it was love from a mile away
but i had to catch you running through my mind all day baby
they all say im crazy cause anybody even when your father say
that i cant be with you i dont hear a word they say

chorus justin timberlake
cause im in love with that girl so dont be mad at me
cause im in love with that girl so dont be mad at me
so what youre from the other side of the tracks
so what the world dont think we match
ill put it down like my loves on wax
guess what im in love with that girl
and she told me that shes in love with me

chorus justin timberlake
