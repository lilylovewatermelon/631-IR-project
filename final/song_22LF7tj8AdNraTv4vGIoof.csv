and all the things that stay
i can count on memories
cause they dont go away
good times were hard to hold
until she came along
she moves me like a memphis soul song

im not always there i know
but she dont mind at all
as pretty as a picture that hangs on my own wall
shes like mississippi
when the sun comes up at dawn
she moves me like a memphis soul song

with an angel on my left side and a devil on my right
shes the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
of all the ones whove left me its a wonder shes not gone
she moves me like a memphis soul song
she moves me like a memphis soul song

she dont care what the game is
shes always down to play
my world without her seems a million miles away
she dont have to worry
i know where i belong
she moves me like a memphis soul song
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeive been dealt some aces
and ive played them all the same
but shes the only one that keeps me in the game
no fame or fortune could ever keep me gone
she moves me like a memphis soul song

with an angel on my left side and a devil on my right
shes the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
of all the ones whove left me its a wonder shes not gone
she moves me like a memphis soul song

theres a magic down in memphis
the never seems to fade
even now them voices carry
like a lonely serenade
its the memories that still and always will be on my mind
they move me every time

she sees the good in everything there is to see
sometimes i wonder what she ever sees in me
im not always right you know
but shes never led me wrong
she moves me like a memphis soul song

in all my travels ive never found a way
to find the words that say the things id like to say
ive sang some melodies but shes my favorite one
she moves me like a memphis soul song
with an angel on my left side and a devil on my right
shes the one who saves me from them dark unholy nights
of all the ones whove left me its a wonder shes not gone
she moves me like a memphis soul song
she moves me like a memphis soul songembed"
