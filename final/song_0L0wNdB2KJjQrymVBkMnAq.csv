deceitful eyes shes got those come get me thighs
she only knows how low that she can go
she speaks the lines that can control my mind
wherever she goes i know my eyes follow
she blew a kiss i swear that it was meant
only for me then spoke with her body
her only goal is just to take control
and i cant believe  that i cant tell her no

chorus
that girl i cant take her
should have known she was a heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen it coming heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen right through her
shes a heartbreaker

verse 2
she plays a game with such an innocent face
i didnt know heartbreaking was her case
her actions confess and put me through the test
i was surprised that i was caught inside
now shes thinking that i will never know
and shell keep playing until i let her go
but i hope in time that she will finally realize
im onto her game and shell get played the same

bridge
i never thought that i would stop dreaming about you
stop being without you
but everyone told me so to stop caring about you
start being without you
but iâ€™ll find a way to go and start doing without you
stop talking about you
and what will she say
she will say i was the man that got away

rap fats

i thought it was love with this game huh
when you dealing with the emotions of pain huh
take a closer look when youre dealing with a stranger
i cant change her now
heart murder in place then youll see
it wont heal from pepsi they see
ballhard player shes a star player
i need this crap huh
i didnt see the heartbreaker come on
