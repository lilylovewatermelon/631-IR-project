nothing suffocates you more than
the passing of everyday human events
and isolation is the oxygen mask
you make your children breathe in to survive

chorus
but im not a slave
to a god that doesnt exist
and im not a slave
to a world that doesnt give a shit

postchorus
and when we were good
you just closed your eyes
so when we are bad
well scar your minds

hook
fight fight
fight fight
fight fight
fight fight

verse 2
youll never grow up to be a big rock star
celebrated victim of your fame
theyll just cut our wrists like cheap coupons
and say that death was on sale today
you might also likeprechorus
and when we were good
you just closed your eyes
so when we are bad
well scar your minds

chorus
but im not a slave
to a god that doesnt exist
and im not a slave
to a world that doesnt give a shit

bridge
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of one is a tragedy
the death of millions just a statistic

chorus
but im not a slave
to a god that doesnt exist
and im not a slave
to a world that doesnt give a shit
but im not a slave
to a god that doesnt exist
and im not a slave
to a world that doesnt give a shit
