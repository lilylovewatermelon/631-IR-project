if youre standing with your suitcase
but you cant step on the train
everythings the way that you left it i still havent slept yet
and if youre covering your face now
but you just cant hide the pain
still setting two plates on the counter
but eating without cha

if the truth is youre a liar
when you say that youre okay
im sleepin on your side of the bed goin out of my head now
and if youre out there tryna move on
but somethin pulls you back again
im sitting here tryin to persuade you
like youre in the same room

prechorus
and i wish you could give me the cold shoulder
and i wish you could still give me a hard time
and i wish i could still wish it was over
but even if wishing is a waste of time
even if i never cross your mind

chorus
ill leave the door on the latch
if you ever come back if you ever come back
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back
therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on
and it will be just like you were never gone
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back if you ever come back now
oh if you ever come back if you ever come back now
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likeverse 2
now they say im wasting my time
cause youre never coming home
but they used to say the world was flat
but how wrong was that now
and by leaving my door open
im risking everythin i own
theres nothin i can lose in a breakin
that you havent taken

prechorus
and i wish you could give me the cold shoulder
and i wish you could still give me a hard time
and i wish i could still wish it was over
but even if wishing is a waste of time
even if i never cross your mind

chorus
ill leave the door on the latch
if you ever come back if you ever come back
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back
therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on
and it will be just like you were never gone
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back if you ever come back now
if you ever come back if you ever come back now
bridge
if its the fighting you remember
or the little things you miss
i know youre out there somewhere
so just remember this
if its the fighting you remember
or the little things you miss
oh just remember this oh just remember this

chorus
ill leave the door on the latch
if you ever come back if you ever come back
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back
therell be a smile on my face and the kettle on
and it will be just like you were never gone
therell be a light in the hall and a key under the mat
if you ever come back if you ever come back now
oh if you ever come back if you ever come back

and it will be just like you were never gone
and it will be just like you were never gone
and it will be just like you were never gone
if you ever come back if you ever come back now9embed"
