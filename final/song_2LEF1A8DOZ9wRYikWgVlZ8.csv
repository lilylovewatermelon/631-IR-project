verse 1 flo rida
yes i can doubt better leave im runnin with this plan
pull me grab me crabs in the bucket cant have me

speaking it and its done
woke up on the side of the bed like i won
talk like a winner my chest to that sun

verse 2 flo rida
the mountain top walk on water
i got power feel so royal
one second ima strike all you
diamond platinum no more for you
got adrenaline never giving in
giving ups not an option gotta get it in
witness i got the heart of twenty men
no fear go to sleep in the lions den
that flow that spark that crown
you looking at the king of the jungle now
stronger than ever cant hold me down
a hundred miles gunning from the pitchers mound
straight game face its game day
see me running through the crowd full of melee
no trick plays im bill gates take a genius to understand me
