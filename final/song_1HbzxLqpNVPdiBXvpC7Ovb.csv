she comes from silver spoon golden rule private school never miss sunday church
and i come from bluecollar lowdollar out here where concrete meets old red dirt
and i dont know what happened but it sure dont add up on paper
but when i close my eyes late at night you can bet i thank my maker

chorus
she keeps on loving me loves me the way i am
shes not just along for the ride shes my biggest fan
lord its a little piece of heavеn when we lay down at night
she keeps on loving mе and i keep on wondering why

verse 2
shes got a wicked smile angel eyes every guy wanting to hold her close
shes as pretty as sin like the sun sinking down on the california coast

chorus
she keeps on loving me loves me the way i am
shes not just along for the ride shes my biggest fan
lord its a little piece of heaven when we lay down at night
she keeps on loving me and i keep on wondering why

bridge
and i dont know what happened but it sure dont add up on paper
and as long as she lets me ill take her wherever she wants me to take her
