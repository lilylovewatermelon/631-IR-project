now that you cant have me
you suddenly want me
now that im with somebody else
you tell me you love me
i slept on your doorstep
begging for one chance
now that i finally moved on
you say that you missed me all along

chorus harry
who do you think you are
who do you think i am
you only love to see me breakin
you only want me cause im taken
you dont really want my heart
no you just like to know you can
still be the one who gets it breakin
you only want me when im taken

verse 2 harry
youre messin with my head
girl thats what you do best
saying theres nothing you wont do
to get me to say yes
youre impossible to resist
but i wouldnt bet your heart on it
its like im finally awake
and youre just a beautiful mistake
