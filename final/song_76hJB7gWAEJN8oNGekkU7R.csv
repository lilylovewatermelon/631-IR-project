my hopes just fell and i cant see
the reason why why there is blood on my sleeve
and all this time i thought it mine
but its not its yours and

chorus
its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you
this life you lead like us living in a shiny ballroom
next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow
next time you steal better ask before you borrow

verse 2
and i dont see too well dont sing too well
and so i settle to scream
just grab your shit and leave with it
they wont make no statues of you

chorus
its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you
this life you lead like us living in a shiny ballroom
next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow
next time you steal better ask before you borrow
this label thief find a better title suited for you
this tidal wave is coming down upon you

this time ive forgotten
i swear this shit was rotten
this time i believe it

chorus
its not worth it for me gets harder every time call you
this life you lead like us living in a shiny ballroom
next time you bleed right about this time tomorrow
next time you steal better ask before you borrow
this label thief find a better title suited for you
this tidal wave is coming down upon you1embed"
