ive been away searching for a reason
another purpose to find
ive sailed the seas fought my many demons
ive looked to gods in the skies
ive stood in hell where many had to suffer
i stared the devil in the eyes
walked many roads to witness ancient idols
and found the great gates of fire

verse 2
had many storms question my conviction
gave armies reason to rise
the hangmans searching for bones he can borrow
while i escaped in the night fight or flight

chorus
live again all roads end
ill be coming home
tend your light cause on this night
ill be coming home

verse 3
escaped the hail of calculated mortars
then drank the blood of a king
the desert rain has washed away direction
had angels looking after me
so it seems
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
live again all roads end
ill be coming home
tend your light cause on this night
ill be coming home

verse 4
my story ends not far from where it started
my weary limbs have grown old
ive seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
home is where the heart is ive been told
so i go

chorus
live again all roads end
ill be coming home
tend your light cause on this night
ill be coming home

outro
im coming home
im coming home
im coming home
im coming home4embed"
