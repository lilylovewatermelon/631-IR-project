i fell in love with a windup souvenir
i bought it downtown as i was on my way to meet you
she sounds like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep but
now that youre gone shes all that ive left to hold

hook
and i feel so all alone
no ones gonna fix me when im broke
how do you cry with inanimate eyes
youre never gonna smile with the way that youre wired
and i feel so all alone

verse 1
i gave her to you i dont need a toy
i thought you might appreciate i dont like the way that it moves
the way that she dances
the painted look upon her face someone mustve thrown this away
she must have come from the sun i got too much stuff
i want to take her through the park
where shed tell me im all that she wants
speaking of which
if she could even talk i think we need to talk

hook
i feel so all alone
no ones gonna fix me when im broke
how do you cry with inanimate eyes
youre never gonna smile with the way that youre wired
and i feel so all alone
i feel so all alone
you might also likebridge
as she sits on my shelf
it makes me think of you
the way she carries the things that remind me of who
we used to be before we became antiques
shes a lot like you
but when i hold her too tight i know shell break
she just takes some glue to stay

hook
and i feel so all alone
no ones gonna fix me when im broke
how do you cry with inanimate eyes
youre never gonna smile with the way that youre wired
and i feel so all alone
i feel so all alone
i feel so all alone2embed"
