baby lion goes
where the islands go
verse 1 kanye west
you say you never saw this comin well youre not alone
million dollar renovations to a happy home
my ex says she gave me the best years of her life
i saw a recent picture of her i guess she was right
i wake up assessin the damages
checkin mediatakeout
pictures of me drunk walkin out with a bitch
but its blurry enough to get the fake out
i wake up all veggies no eggs
i hit the gym all chest no legs
yep then i made myself a smoothie
yeah then me and wifey make a movie
chicago st louis st louis to chicago

cause you was in college complainin bout its no jobs
