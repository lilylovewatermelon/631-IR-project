come on

verse 1
somebody give me some light
not pointed into dark
somebody show me the end
and i try to push to start
im trying to figure out a better way a better answer
but i keep finding all the problems ive been looking after
you cant wander through the world with nothing but a smile
ill take your tongue for words and use it to instill denial

chorus
dont get close
you dont know me and youll never know
chivalry will get you somewhere
rivalry will take you there
dont get close
you dont know me and youll never know
chivalry will get you somewhere
rivalry will take you there

verse 2
maybe i should look away before i really miss
maybe i should pick the time before i pick the place
i bet you all the things that you emulate you penalize
but i dont wanna go until you learn to finalize

dont get close
you dont know me and youll never know
chivalry will get you somewhere
rivalry will take you there
dont get close
you dont know me and youll never know
chivalry will get you somewhere
rivalry

verse 3
you ascertain the plot my visions overshot
i have the best confessions i was gone for all the lessons
who coined these words i use stay out and be abused
i didnt want to be the undeniable source of everything

refrain

dont get close
dont get close youd better stay away
dont get close youd better stay away
dont get close youd better stay away
dont get close youd better stay away
guitar solo

bridge
waiting watching all the conflicts
constrict just to fit in squeeze in
i can insist claws and fist
remember remember

verse 4
you take the reverent and never make much sense
i have the worst possession what i want but so obsessive
come out and be abused cause this is so confused
i only want to be left alone and rot away

refrain
dont get close
dont get close
dont get close
dont get close
dont get close youd better stay away
dont get close youd better stay away
dont get close youd better stay away
