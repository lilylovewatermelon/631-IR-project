say goodbye to oz and everything you own
california dreamin is a pettibon
las screaming youre my home
vanity is blasted but its rarely fair
i could smell the prozac in your pretty hair
got a lot of friends but is anyone there
i dont know but its been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home
stick n move youre living in a quick world
got a heavy life for such a tiny girl
born into it thats for sure

chorus
rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away yeah
prisons of perspective how your vision gets corrected and
sick love is my modern cliche

verse 2
people talk and tell you what you want to hear
do you really need another souvenir
superheroes tend to disappear
fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
chase your tail my baby itll be your last
i dont know but its been said
your heart is stronger than your head
and this location is my home

rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
sick love comes to wash us away yeah
prisons of perspective how your vision gets corrected and
sick love is my modern cliche
