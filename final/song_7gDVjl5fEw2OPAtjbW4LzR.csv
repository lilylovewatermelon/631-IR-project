tilling my own grave to keep me level
jam another dragon down the hole
digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
one that pushes me along and leaves me so

chorus
desperate and ravenous
so weak and powerless
over you

verse 2
someone feed the monkey while i dig in search of china
white as dracula as i approach the bottom

chorus
desperate and ravenous
so weak and powerless
over you

bridge
little angel go away come again some other day
the devil has my ear today ill never hear a word you say
he promised i would find a little solace and some peace of mind
whatever just as long as i dont feel so

desperate and ravenous
so weak and powerless
desperate and ravenous
so weak and powerless
over you
