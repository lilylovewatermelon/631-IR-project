verse 1 sharpay ryan  both
i believe in dreamin shootin for the stars
baby to be number one youve got to raise the bar
kickin and ascratchin grindin out my best
anything it takes to climb the ladder of success
work our tails off every day
gotta bump the competition blow them all away

interlude ryan  sharpay

chorus sharpay ryan  both
yeah were gonna
bop bop bop bop to the top
slip and slide and ride that rhythm
jump and hop hop til we drop
and start again
zip zap zop pop like a mop
scoot around the corner
move it to the groove til the music stops
do the bop bop bop to the top
dont ever stop
bop to the top
