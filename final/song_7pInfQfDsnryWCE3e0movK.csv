verse 1
it was in the way you grabbed my waist
looked into my face
and told me i was your only yours
already knew that i had fell for you
giving myself to you
i kinda want a little more
see i dont know what you did
but i like it and how it is
i dont know if its right i dont care if its wrong
i dont know if its love but i cant get enough so

chorus
ohh ahh ohh
youre just what i need tonight
ohh ahh ohh
youre just what i need tonight

verse 2
i always wanna be alone with you
no matter what we do
its something that im gonna love
even when i am on the phone with you
i pretend im holding you
im fiending for you more and more
see now i know what you did
just one kiss with your lips
see i know how i feel what im feeling is real
and i need to you to know that youre making me go
