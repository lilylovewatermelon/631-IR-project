i worked all week
cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
i got the cover off the 68
i fire it up and let them horses sing
a little pretty thing
a little tanlegged georgia dream
she’s a rocking them holey jeans
baby what you got going on saturday
you know words got it there’s gonna be a party
out of town about half a mile
four wheel drives and big mud tires
muscadine wine

chorus
oh baby you can find me
in the back of a jacked up tailgate
sitting round watching all these pretty things
get down in that georgia clay
and i’ll find peace
at the bottom of a real tall cold drink
im chilling to some skynyrd and some old hank
lets get this thing started
it’s my kinda party

verse 2
if you wanna drink
go baby just do your thing
give up your keys
hell why drive when you can stay with me
and then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
gotcha sipping on some moonshine
baby if youre in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
you can be my tanlegged juliet
i’ll be your redneck romeo

oh baby you can find me
in the back of a jacked up tailgate
sitting round watching all these pretty things
get down in that georgia clay
and i’ll find peace
at the bottom of a real tall cold drink
im chilling to some skynyrd and some old hank
lets get this thing started
it’s my kinda party

instrumental break

chorus
oh baby you can find me
in the back of a jacked up tailgate
sitting round watching all these pretty things
get down in that georgia clay
and i’ll find peace
at the bottom of a real tall cold drink
im chilling to some skynyrd and some old hank
lets get this thing started
it’s my kinda party

outro
