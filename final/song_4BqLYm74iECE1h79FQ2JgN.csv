her bumpersticker says i hate hiphop
with a southern drawl she says howdy yall
and her hands aint afraid of dirt
hes proud of his old truck
he spray painted over dents and rust
the motor smokes its got four bald tires
but the radio works
raised on the good book and our country songs
ridin down back roads an singin along

so blame me for the way they are
their love of the fiddle and the steel guitar
blame me for their cowboy hats
roper boots wrangler jeans and rifle racks
if you wanna point a finger at somebody
for the way theyve been led
blame me

they were kids when hag and me came to town
all eyes and ears look at em now
center stage on the grand ole opry
on a saturday night
sing of fishin and the lord above
fallin in and out of love
from aunt bea to uncle sam
and that american pie
from big cities to the little towns
were hardcore country inside and out
see craig morgan liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeso blame me for the way they are
their love of the fiddle and the steel guitar
blame me for their cowboy hats
roper boots wrangler jeans and rifle racks
if you wanna point a finger at somebody
for the way theyve been led
blame me

blame me for the way they are
their love of the fiddle and the steel guitar
