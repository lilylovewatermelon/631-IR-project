this is another missy elliott exclusive

verse 1 missy
my twinkies look stinky on the benz
and dont i gotta look sweet for my mens
and make em think i got a whole bunch of paper
and even date a ball player from the lakers
now fake a take and make em holler at ya later
shake em wake em tell em what to get my ass from jacobs
thats the way a real diva like to floss it
buy a car no matter what is costses
of courses my rolls royces make em nauseous
tell you who the motherfucking boss is
im driving you walking thats why you talking
see the chrome spinning on the wheels stop jocking
ima let you know real nice and slow
id be broke as a joke if i had to be a ho
so poor missy on the rise like the sun
if you think that im done i aint even begun

verse 3
my rims keep turnin and turnin
tires burnin through queens and mount vernon
and yes its my concern that
your chain platinum or is it really sterling
im old school i rock a sherman
from new jerz heard all the way to berlin
and thats for certain behind every curtain
is a snake bitch lurking and she about to catch a hurtin
mr mos on the beats on the beats
and missy be the beats behind the beats behind the beats
my record sales dont jump or do leaps
and while you sleep im on the ground as i creep
she creep i got pumas on my feet
fresh gear every day all week
you know i keep it hot for my peeps
never cheap underground like the streets
