i found my life in between shots and getting high
the cage i was in fell away when she asked me to dance again yeah
i found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
the dust settled down now i can see through the crowd

prechorus
im loving the colour white
surrounding your colored eyes
though she is the kryptonite
she stays in my crib tonight
i light her like dynamite
load her like gigabyte
turn out the fucking lights
i wanna see you bright

chorus
i wanna see you bright
i wanna see you bright
i wanna see you bright
i wanna see you

verse 2
for the love in my mind love for the bass
she likes getting high yeah just for the day
shes different in night she knows what i say
free of the flash dirt on your shoes i dont know you
