what would i do without your smart mouth
drawing me in and you kicking me out
youve got my head spinning no kidding
i cant pin you down
whats goin on in that beautiful mind
im on your magical mystery ride
and im so dizzy dont know what hit me
but ill be alright

prechorus
my heads under water but im breathing fine
youre crazy and im out of my mind

chorus
cause all of me loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me ill give my all to you
youre my end and my beginning
even when i lose im winning

postchorus
cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you ohoh
