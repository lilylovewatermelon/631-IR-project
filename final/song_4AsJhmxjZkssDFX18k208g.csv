look at me and tell me you dont love me
take my hand and say it cant be
kiss me once and just before you walk away
listen first to what your senses say
cause

chorus
i can see me loving you forever
i can feel my arms around your life
i can taste your lips against my memory
listen to your senses what they have to say

verse 2
love can hurt love can scar you
the time just best to turn away
but love can heal and love can save you
today is not like yesterday

chorus
i can see me loving you forever
i can feel my arms around your life
i can taste your lips against my memory
listen to your senses what they have to say
cause i can see me loving you forever
i can feel my arms around your life
i can taste your lips against my memory
listen to your senses what they have to say
