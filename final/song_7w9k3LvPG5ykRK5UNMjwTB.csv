is that a word you said my love
or just a gesture in tongues
well i live to guess your sorrow
and you live to empty my lungs
and youve got me up in a frenzy again
and i know youre planning to leave in the end

chorus
wont you say that you will
let the impulse to love
and the instinct to kill
entangle to one
in this light you are mine
til the sweat turns to blood
wont you say that you will
even if you wont

verse 2
oh is that a glint in your eye
is that a blade in your palm
well i am yours tonight
so will you lay in my arms
youve got me up in a frenzy again
i know youre planning to leave in the end

wont you say that you will
let the impulse to love
and the instinct to kill
entangle to one
in this light you are mine
til the sweat turns to blood
wont you say that you will
even if you wont
wont you say that you will
let the impulse to love
and the instinct to kill
entangle to one
in this light you are mine
til the sweat turns to blood
wont you say that you will
even if you wont

outro
youve got me up in a frenzy again
youve got me up in a frenzy again
youve got me up in a frenzy again
youve got me up in a frenzy again
youve got me up in a frenzy again
youve got me up in a frenzy againembed"
