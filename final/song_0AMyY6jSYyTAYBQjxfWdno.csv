oh i didn’t smoke no grass today
but that’s ‘cause i’m the one on stage

but that’s because i love to play
so who am i to take away
what makes you feel this great

verse 1 jack met
does the grass look greener greener
on my side of the speakers speakers
i tried a couple weekends
but that green’s not for me
i thought i’d get clever
make my lyrics come out better
but at 711’s where you would find me

prechorus jack met
don’t wanna get paranoid
just wanna be making noise
you want a hit it’s your choice
but please enjoy the show

last night at the concert concert
the audience it flickers flickers
they’re lighting up like christmas
still that green’s not for me
on corners people cursing
to legalize their burning
but that ain’t no concern of mine
i keep doing me

i’m not narcissistic
i’m just high off the music
and i don’t wanna miss it
but i wouldn’t stop you
i’m not narcissistic
you light up if you like it
and though i may not like it
you just keep doing you
you just keep doing you like
