first see the city skylights shining from my room
youre such a sight to see in the month of june
beautiful like the moons reflection when
its passing off your skin
and before you let me in
i hear you say its been a long time

do you say play some slow ones
got that sade al green and marvin gaye too
to love you gently

chorus
oooh let me love you gently
lay back relax girl ima be
light as a feather but hard as a rock
cause daddy know just what you like
gonna love you gently
gonna love you baby gentle with you baby ooh ooh
light as a feather but hard as a rock

verse 2
see i know just when to finish and i know just when to start
and ill be loving your reaction every time i hit that spot gently
butter soft like leather gently but the top is hard gently
whisper your pleasures gently then ill do my job
invigorating intense girl let me do what i do
i dont know whats echoing louder the music or you gently
i aint close to be done yet gently but youre getting real warm gently
like the calm of the thunder gently right after the storm
do you say you say do you say it girl
im gonna push it to the limit oooh
its yours its yours
see second place or win the race im gonna be your number one
til the sun shines
woooaaah here comes the sun get ready babe forever more
lets try and taste the moon again forever more
