well i’ll wait ‘til you listen
i won’t say a word
to ‘follow your instincts’
well just never worked for me
well i’m silent but strong
yeah i’m playing that card and you’re
noticing nothing again

prechorus 1 adam lazzara fred mascherino both
so i’m lying on the table with everything you said
keeping in mind the way it felt
when the most i could do was to just blame myself
when the most i could do was to just blame myself feel it out for once and feel nothing like everyone else

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
well i know you know everything
i know you didn’t mean it
i know you didn’t mean it
i know you know everything drop everything
i know you didn’t mean it start it all over
i know you didn’t mean it and remember more than you’d like to forget

verse 2 adam lazzara
so we’re talking forever and you
almost feel better but
better’s no excuse for tonight
you see it’s never bad enough to just
leave or give up but it’s
never good enough to feel right

now i’m lying on the table with everything you said
“it will all catch up eventually” well it caught up and honestly
the weight of my decisions were impossible to hold
but they were never yours they were never yours
they were never yours

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
well i know you know everything
