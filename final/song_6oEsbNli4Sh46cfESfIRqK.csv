do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside
cause its nice out and we could get high
yeah the sun shinin and im feelin right
we outside outside hey hey hey

verse 1
i wake up throw on some clothes and out the door i wont be back ma
shinin sun horizon settin up a lovely backdrop
my life the topic of a lullaby
ah breath of fresh air is somethin right
i dont wanna be inside today
just keep it rollin like we ridin skates
i got a halfy of haze im thinkin we gon get high today
and let the sun shine all in my face
oh yeah this life is good dont let it all go to waste
just walk outside the door to get your mom off your case haha
yeah free livin swear i be on some hippie shit
but gettin way fresher than the hippies is
i got the the gift of gab somethin that you wish you had
dont need to get a strap nah id rather kick a rap
enjoy the place that you livin at stay round
we just some kids and this world is our playground

chorus
do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside

we could post outside for the night
do you mind if we smoke this blunt outside
cause its nice out and we could get high
oh yeah the sun shinin and im feelin right
we outside outside hey

when i be on some kid shit go and take my shorty on a picnic
and every day feelin like its christmas
the kinda weather have the people livin so privileged
i know the lord take today he was tryna giveth
hey hey ayy rich or poor a sunny day a sunny day
we start the madness as soon as we hit the month of may
rain rain go away
waitin for my homie mr sun to come our way
little kids runnin through the streets playin
poppy on the porch he aint got time to waste it
he just an old man in the sea ernest hemingway
elevate look up in the sky stare at heavens face
second grade holdin down the corner slangin lemonade
every day hustlin you ridin down penny lane
you aint gonna get a day like this
so put to rest your troubles with that goodnight kiss

chorus
