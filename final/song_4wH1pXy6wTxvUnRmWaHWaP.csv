for the time being
i will still avoid my own questions
and we both bury that history deep
but you know i can hold my breath forever
for the time being
you are still a perfect reminder of what
all of these scars on my arms are for
if i can hold myself together

chorus
and i choke myself on sacred vapour
waiting on some holy favour
basking in the solace of regret
and it seems my hell is your high water
wash me clean again before i pull myself beneath the waves

verse 2
when thе mouth of infinity
buries its teeth in me
ill smile through thе agony for you
and i know you still bear the weight of your own existence
and youll never bear the weight of two

chorus
and i choke myself on sacred vapour
waiting on some holy favour
basking in the solace of regret
and it seems my hell is your high water
wash me clean again before i pull myself beneath the waves
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likebridge
for the time being
i will admit my defeat again
i will accept that i cant pretend
we will ever be together

breakdown
i cant hold myself together1embed"
