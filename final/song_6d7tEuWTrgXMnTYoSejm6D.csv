a coffee stain on a window sill
a bad translation to a foreign film
just wandering round with you you know
just wandering town with you
ohohohoh would be enough

verse 2
the tiny cracks on the city stone
a welcome back to your troubled home

prechorus
just wandering round with you
just wandering town with you you know
ohohohoh would be enough

chorus
but oh oh
ohohohohoh
i didnt see the sea until i crossed
ohohohohoh
i didnt feel your love until i lost

verse 3
the moving shadows on your swaying light
or your picture notes of your porcupines
see tom odell liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likeprechorus
just wandering round with you you know
just walking these towns with you
ohohohoh would be enough

chorus
but oh oh
ohohohohoh
i didnt see the sea until i crossed
ohohohohoh
i didnt feel your love until i lost
ohohohohoh
i didnt see the sea until i crossed
ohohohohoh
and i didnt feel your love until i lost
