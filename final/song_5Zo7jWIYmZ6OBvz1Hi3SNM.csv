white demon love song down the hall
white demon shadow on the road
back up your mind there is a car
he hears it coming after all all this time
she likes the way he sings
white demon love songs in her dreams

verse 2
white demon wheres your selfish kiss
white demon sorrow will arrange
lets not forget about the fear
black invitation to a place that cannot change
while strangely holy
come pouring rain darling

chorus
white demon widen your hearts scope
white demon who let your friends go
white demon widen your hearts scope
white demon who let your friends go

verse 3
let us be in love let us be in love
lets do old and gray lets do old and gray
i wont make you cry i wont make you cry
i will never stray i will never stray
i will do my part i will do my part
let us be in love tonight

white demon widen your hearts scope
white demon who let your friends go
white demon widen your hearts scope
white demon who let your friends go
