little boy six years old
a little too used to bein alone
another new mom and dad
another school another house thatll never be home

prechorus 1
when people ask him how he likes this place
he looks up and says with a smile upon his face

chorus
this is my temporary home its not where i belong
windows and rooms that im passin through
this is just a stop on the way to where im goin
im not afraid because i know
this is my temporary home
mmm

verse 2
young mom on her own
she needs a little help got nowhere to go
shes lookin for a job lookin for a way out
cause a halfway house will never be a home

prechorus
at night she whispers to her baby girl
someday well find our place here in this world
