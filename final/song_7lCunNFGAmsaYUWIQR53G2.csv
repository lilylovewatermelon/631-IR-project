everybody got their eye on the prize
wants to know what its like
to be on top of the world
think its all money and fame
its just a game
but its more than denim and pearls
its a real mans world
and i aint lyin

verse 2
gripped tighter and you get a deep seat
turned out ya feet
get your hooks in and let it go
feel the power straight out the gate
but it aint too late
roll your hips son
get back in the flow
eight seconds is a long damn time

chorus
its more than the shine in the buckle
broken hearts busted knuckles
you know you gotta hustle
youre sifting through the rubble
to find your souls on the line
and youre running behind
its more than the shine

sometimes you land on your feet
or accept defeat
pick up yourself
get back on again
most nights you lie awake
as your body aches
knowing youve lost more than youll win
please god just give me a sign
this lifes been a hard go
out on the road
chasing this damn rodeo
the woman i love stays on my mind

chorus
its more than the shine in the buckle
broken hearts busted knuckles
you know you gotta hustle
youre sifting through the rubble
to find your souls on the line
and youre running behind
its more than the shine

instrumental break

its more than the shine in the buckle
broken hearts busted knuckles
you know you gotta hustle
youre sifting through the rubble
to find your souls on the line
and youre running behind
its more than the shine in the buckle
broken hearts busted knuckles
you know you gotta hustle
youre sifting through the rubble
to find your souls on the line
and youre running behind
its more than the shine
its more than that shine
outro
everybody got their eye on the prize
wants to know what its like
to be on top of the worldembed"
