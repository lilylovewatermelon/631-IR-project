yeah

verse 1
in the circles ive been running
ive covered many miles
and i could search forever for whats right before my eyes
just when i thought id found it
it was nothing like id planned
when i got my heart around it
it slipped right through my hands

prechorus 1
here with you i feel it
i close my eyes and see it

chorus
in a midnight talk in a morning kiss
when im in your arms thats where it is
when were tangled up and cant resist
when we feel that rush thats where it is
thats where it is

verse 2
when im crashing through the madness
im not sure who im supposed to be
when im caught up in the darkness
its your hand thats leading me
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likeprechorus 2
you bring me back to solid ground
you lift me up right here right now

chorus
in a midnight talk in a morning kiss
when im in your arms thats where it is
when were tangled up and cant resist
when we feel that rush thats where it is

bridge
its a lifetime filled with tight embraces
the biggest things in the smallest places

chorus
in a midnight talk in a morning kiss
when im in your arms thats where it is
when were tangled up and cant resist
when we feel that rush thats where it is

outro
in the sweetest smile on a night like this
and a tender touch thats where it is
when were tangled up tangled up and cant resist cant resist
when we feel that rush thats where it is
thats where it isembed"
