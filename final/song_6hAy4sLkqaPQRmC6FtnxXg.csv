that i was glad to see you go
i could hate you for the way im feelin
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know

its a sin to make me cry
when you know i love you so
i could tell my heart that i dont miss you
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know

i could give you all the blame
but im sure the truth would show
i could tell this world ive found a new love
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would know

i cant fool my cryin heart
cause it knows i need you so
i could tell my heart im glad we parted
my lips could tell a lie but my heart would knowyou might also likeembed"
