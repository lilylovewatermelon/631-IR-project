welcome to the internet have a look around
anything that brain of yours can think of can be found
weve got mountains of content some better some worse
if none of its of interest to you youd be the first

verse 2
welcome to the internet come and take a seat
would you like to see the news or any famous womens feet
theres no need to panic this isnt a test haha
just nod or shake your head and well do the rest

verse 3
welcome to thе internet what would you prefеr
would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur
be happy be horny be bursting with rage
weve got a million different ways to engage

verse 4
welcome to the internet put your cares aside
heres a tip for straining pasta heres a nineyearold who died
weve got movies and doctors and fantasy sports
and a bunch of coloredpencil drawings of all the different characters in harry potter fucking each other

verse 5
welcome to the internet hold on to your socks
cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock
they are grainy and offputting he just sent you more
dont act surprised you know you like it you whore
you might also likeverse 6
see a man beheaded get offended see a shrink
show us pictures of your children tell us every thought you think
start a rumor buy a broom or send a death threat to a boomer
or dm a girl and groom her do a zoom or find a tumor in your—
heres a healthy breakfast option you should kill your mom
heres why women never fuck you heres how you can build a bomb
which power ranger are you take this quirky quiz
obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids

chorus
could i interest you in everything all of the time
a little bit of everything all of the time
apathys a tragedy and boredom is a crime
anything and everything all of the time
could i interest you in everything all of the time
a little bit of everything all of the time
apathys a tragedy and boredom is a crime
anything and everything all of the time

interlude
you know it wasnt always like this

bridge
not very long ago just before your time
right before the towers fell circa 99
this was catalogs travel blogs a chatroom or two
we set our sights and spent our nights waiting
for you
you insatiable you
mommy let you use her ipad you were barely two
and it did all the things we designed it to do
now look at you oh ha look at you
you you unstoppable watchable
your time is now your insides out honey how you grew
and if we stick together who knows what well do
it was always the plan to put the world in your hand
break
laughs

chorus
could i interest you in everything all of the time
a bit of everything all of the time
apathys a tragedy and boredom is a crime
anything and everything all of the time
could i interest you in everything all of the time
a little bit of everything all of the time
apathys a tragedy and boredom is a crime
anything and everything and anything and everything
and anything and everything and
all of the time87embed"
