intro
i awoke from a dream
filled of a world full of greed and hate
the world was my thoughts and surroundings
i realized i needed to rise and become king
my own destiny

hook
take a look around tears from they eyes
knees on the ground money in the sky
take a look around aint shit nice
praying for my life hope i make it through the night
take a look around

verse 1
the city on fire
its all taking place in the middle of my mind
i stand in the middle cause death right beside
murdering is simple get your life simplified
where the bones lie rebuild another life
americas pie put my hand in the pot
i cant get caught in the streets i was taught
raised off anger but it wasnt my fault
nigga take a look around its needles on the ground
never gave three fucks and i still dont now
im fucking in the house babysitter on the couch
13 like when this shit coming out
pass me a jimmy i aint ready for a child
i hope nobody hears bitch why you so loud
turn on the tube put my head on the cloud
breathe inhale the angels cant help
tyga take a look around
careless world
take a look around
careless world
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likehook
take a look around tears from they eyes
knees on the ground money in the sky
take a look around aint shit nice
praying for my life hope i make it through the night
take a look around

ill replace you with somebody better that you only make up

and rule the world a little later
later on in that day tears all in her face
i said i’m going away she begging me to stay
took a look in her eyes then she put my hands on her waist
said “don’t leave we’ve got a baby on the way”
take a look around
