theres traffic in the sky
and it doesnt seem to be getting much better
theres kids playing games on the pavement
drawin waves on the pavement mmmm
shadows of the planes on the pavement mmmm

prechorus 1
its enough to make me cry
but that dont seem like it would make it feel better
maybe its a dream and if i scream it will burst at the seams
whole place would fall into pieces
and then theyd say

chorus
well how could we have known
ill tell them its not so hard to tell nah nah nah
if you keep addin stones
soon the water will be lost in the well mm

verse 2
and puzzle pieces in the ground
no one ever seems to be diggin
instead theyre lookin up towards the heavens
with their eyes on the heavens mmmm
the shadows on the way to the heavens mmmm

its enough to make me cry
but that dont seem like it would make it feel better
the answers could be found we could learn from diggin down
but no one ever seems to be diggin
instead theyll say

chorus
well how could we have known
ill tell them its not so hard to tell nah nah nah
if you keep addin stones
soon the water will be lost in the well mm

verse 3
and words of wisdom all around
but no one ever seems to listen
theyre talkin bout their plans on the paper
buildin up from the pavement mmmm
the shadows from the scrapers on the pavement mmmm

prechorus 3
its enough to make me sigh
but that dont seem like it would make it feel better
the words are all around but the words are only sounds
and no one ever seems to listen
instead theyll say
chorus
well how could we have known
ill tell them its really not so hard to tell nah nah nah
if you keep addin stones
soon the water will be lost in the well lost in the well mm mmmmmm6embed"
