baby dont dont you take too long i want you in my arms
and if you feel what i feel bring it here to me cmon
see we young but girl we grown
and baby i want to grow old with you cause you know that you so

verse 3 jim jones
maybe its ya attitude that makes me a lil mad at you
the same time the gratitude makes me wanna spend cash on you
take you on trips you caught the longitude and latitude
let you hold the whip last time we almost crashed the coupe
so i laughed at you cause we was drunk pissy
it was two summers ago and you still rollin with me
but maybe its the loyalty the way that you callin me
when we makin love when you scream put it all on me
or maybe my physique and my upcomin from the streets
i keeps you runnin back i got you cumin in the sheets
from the first time i met you you become a little freak
i might go downtown and get somethin to eat
and baby you took care of me baby i took care of you
you cry i cry baby i shed tears for two
baby if the 7 karats didnt cost 300 grand
i would had the table and put some ice on ya hand

chorus trey songz
you so fly im so fly
whats more fly than you and i together
get high lets fly together
im so fly you so fly
whats more fly than you and i together
get high lets fly together
outro trey songz
im so you so we so fly
im so you so we so fly
get high lets fly together2embed"
