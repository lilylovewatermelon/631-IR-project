in the morning i wake up and in the night i sleep
since the day that i was born repeat repeat repeat
brought to this life born to this life where was i before
nonexistent not at all will i ever know

chorus
today is my birthday and i get one every year
and some day
hard to believe but ill be buried six feet underground

verse 2
subconsciously motivated natural instinct
alter nature for the pleasure orthocyclen
flirt with conception slow the cycle will the baby grow
social tradition interference control control control

chorus
today is my birthday and i get one every year
and some day
hard to believe but ill be buried six feet underground
ill be dead and gone no longer around

bridge
spinning spinning before i can recall
all the unknown chemicals control the cycle
the successive generations from dust to dust
burying my grandma then give birth to my own daughter
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
today is my birthday and i get one every year
and some day
hard to believe but ill be buried six feet underground
today is my birthday and i get one every year
and some day
hard to believe but ill be buried six feet underground
ill be dead and gone no longer around
ill be buried six feet underground1embed"
