simple math
our love divided by the square root of pride
multiply your lies plus time
im goin out of my mind
it was heavy when i finally figured it out alone

but dont think ive been so blind  ooh
and i may not be einstein but i know
dumb plus dumb equals you
dumb plus dumb equals you yeah yeah yeah
dumb plus dumb equals you you

verse 2
even had the nerve to flirt with her in front of my face
heres your keys your bags your clothes and now get out of my place

chorus
i didnt get it the first time ooh
dont think ive been so blind ooh
yeah i may not be einstein but i know
dumb plus dumb equals you
dumb plus dumb equals you yeah yeah yeah
dumb plus dumb equals you you

all of your promises plus
a thousand apologies just
take out the pain and then it leaves us
with nothing at all no nothing at all
you can stop wasting my time ooh
without you im just fine ooh
why did it take me so long to figure out
dumb plus dumb equals you ooh
equals you yeah

chorus
i didnt get it the first time ooh
dont think ive been so blind ooh

dumb plus dumb equals you
dumb plus dumb equals you

outro

multiply your lies plus time

and i may not be einstein but i know
dumb plus dumb equals you
