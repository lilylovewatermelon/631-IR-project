we were wild we were restless
after a while i grew coarse
i grew cold i grew reckless

i hold this memory
ive pulled you so close to me
whispered will we always have this

lately it feels like im sleeping
and i just cant wake up
pacing the floor want to call but i cant
so i hang up

sharing a seat on the train
with a lady whos crying
has ruined her make up

now i see just how young how scared i was
my eyes closed tight throwing punch after punch
at the world

sarah is it ever gonna be the same
sarah is it ever gonna be the same

said goodbye to all the places i used to go
i said goodbye to all the faces i used to know
you might also likenothing lasts forever

i guess by now i should know
i should know

there aint a thing i can say
that will ever repair it
and you who had so much advice
and yet couldnt share

maybe someday we will look back
on this and well smile
but right now i cant bear it

now i see just how young how scared i was
eyes closed tight throwing punch after punch
at the world

sarah is it ever gonna be the same
sarah is it ever gonna be the same1embed"
