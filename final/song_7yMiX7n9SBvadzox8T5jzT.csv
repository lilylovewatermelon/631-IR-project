chorus 2d
i aint happy im feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
im useless but not for long

i aint happy im feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
im useless but not for long
the future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
its coming on its coming on

verse 1 del the funky homosapien
hoo yeah haha
finally someone let me out of my cage
now time for me is nothing cause im countin no age
nah i couldnt be there now you shouldnt be scared
im good at repairs and im under each snare
intangible bet you didnt think so i command you to
panoramic view look ill make it all manageable
pick and choose sit and lose all you different crews
chicks and dudes who you think is really kickin tunes
picture you getting down in a picture tube
like you lit the fuse you think its fictional
mystical maybe spiritual hero
who appears in you to clear your view when youre too crazy
lifeless to those the definition for what life is
priceless to you because i put you on the hype shit
you like it gun smokin righteous with one toke
get psychic among those possess you with one dose

verse 2 del the funky homosapien
the essence the basics without it you make it
allow me to make this childlike in nature
rhythm you have it or you dont thats a fallacy
im in them every sproutin tree every child of peace
every cloud and sea you see with your eyes
i see destruction and demise corruption in disguise thats right
from this fuckin enterprise now im sucked into your lies
through russel not his muscles
but percussion he provides for me as a guide yall can see me now
cause you dont see with your eye you perceive with your mind
thats the inner fuck em so ima stick around with russ and be a mentor
bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
where the thought is i brought all this
so you can survive when law is lawless right here
feelings sensations that you thought was dead
no squealing and remember that its all in your head
chorus 2d
i aint happy im feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
im useless but not for long
the future is coming on
i aint happy im feeling glad
i got sunshine in a bag
im useless but not for long
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
its coming on its coming on

outro 2d
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
its coming on its coming on
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
its coming on its coming on
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
my future is coming on
its coming on its coming on
