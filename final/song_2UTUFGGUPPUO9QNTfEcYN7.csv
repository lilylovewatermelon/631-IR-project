you got the gas
i got the matches
we gonna turn this town to ashes
cause they aint never seen nothing like us
aint heard loud till we turn it up
i got the wild
you got the crazy
you know thats why i love you baby
cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
pedal to the metal keep your throttle down all night
and we only get one life

chorus
aint scared to ride this train
make a few marks leave a few stains
might slam just a little too hard
might take it just a little too far
might burn out like a firework
like a shooting star across the sky
and we may not be around in 20 years
but theyre sure gonna know we were here
yeah theyre sure gonna know we were here

verse 2
people talk girl
you know damn well
when they got a good tale to tell
lets give them something they aint never seen
a little rated r redneck dream
lets blaze a trail through the dirty south
or give them something they can talk about
a little story that they wont forget
long after we ride off into the sunset
baby cause we aint dead yet baby

aint scared to ride this train
make a few marks leave a few stains
might slam just a little too hard
might take it just a little too far
might burn out like a firework
like a shooting star across the sky
and we may not be around in 20 years
but theyre sure gonna know we were here

bridge
we only get one chance around
this runaway roller coaster train
and it aint slowing down
so baby theyre gonna remember our name

chorus
aint scared to ride this train
make a few marks leave a few stains
might slam just a little too hard
might take it just a little too far
might burn out like a firework
like a shooting star across the sky
and we may not be around in 20 years
no we may not be around in 20 years
but theyre sure gonna know we were here
yeah theyre sure gonna know we were hereembed"
