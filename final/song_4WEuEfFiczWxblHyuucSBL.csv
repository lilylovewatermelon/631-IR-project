everybody put three fingers in the air
the sky is falling the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
section80 hiiipower

verse 1 kendrick lamar
visions of martin luther staring at me
malcolm x put a hex on my future someone catch me
im falling victim to a revolutionary song the serengetis clone
back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
you slipped your disc when i slid you my disc
you wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eatin pussy that smell like its a stale plum
i got my finger on the motherfuckin pistol
aimin it at a pig charlottes web is gonna miss you
my issue isnt televised and you aint gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat because our lifes an instrumental
this is physical and mental i wont sugarcoat it
youd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
and everything on tv just a figment of imagination
i dont want a plastic nation dread that like a haitian
while you motherfuckers waiting i be off the slave ship
building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs

verse 2 kendrick lamar
visions of martin luther staring at me
if i see it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
sorry mama i cant turn the other cheek
they wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin widows peak uh
and she always told me pray for the weak uh
them demons got me i aint prayed in some weeks uh
dear lord come save me the devils working hard
he probably clockin double shifts on all of his jobs
frightenin so fuckin frightenin
enough to drive a man insane i need a license to kill
im standing on a field full of land mines
doin the moonwalk hopin i blow up in time
cause 2012 might not be a fuckin legend
tryna be a fuckin legend the man of mankind
who said a black man in the illuminati
last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
so get up off that slave ship
build your own pyramids write your own hieroglyphs

bridge alori joh  kendrick lamar
every day we fight the system just to make our way

we was built to be strong cause its our life nanana
every day we fight the system we fight the system
we fight the system never like the system
we been down for too long but thats alright nanana

verse 3 kendrick lamar
who said a black man in the illuminati
last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
last time i checked we was racin with marcus garvey
on the freeway to africa til i wreck my audi
and i want everybody to view my autopsy
so you can see exactly where the government had shot me
no conspiracy my fate is inevitable
they play musical chairs once im on that pedestal
frightenin so fuckin frightenin
enough to drive a man insane a woman insane
the reason lauryn hill dont sing or kurt cobain
loaded that clip and then said bang
the drama it bring is crazy product of the late 80s
tryna stay above water thats why we shun the navy
pull your guns and play me lets set it off
cause a riot throw a molotov
somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
got our own pyramids write our own hieroglyphs
chorus kendrick lamar
just call the shit hiiipower
yeah nothing less than hiiipower
fivestar dishes food for thought bitches

fred hampton on your campus you cant resist his
