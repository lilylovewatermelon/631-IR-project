you dont have to move
you dont have to speak
lips for biting
youre staring me down
a glance makes me weak
eyes for striking

verse 2
now im twisted up
when im twisted with you
brush so lightly
and time trickles down
and im breathing for two
squeeze so tightly

chorus
ill be fine youll be fine
this moment seems so long
dont waste now precious time
well dance inside the song
what makes the one to shake you down
each touch belongs to each new sound
say now you want to shake me too
move down to me slip into you
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeverse 3
she sinks in my mind
as she sheds through her skin
touch sight taste like fire
hands do now
what eyes no longer defend
hands to fuel desire

chorus
ill be fine youll be fine
this moment seems so long
dont waste now precious time
well dance inside the song
what makes the one to shake you down
each touch belongs to each new sound
say now you want to shake me too
move down to me slip into you

bridge
and ill be fine youll be fine
is this fine im not fine
give me pieces
give me things to stay awake to stay awake

chorus 2
what makes the one to shake you down
each touch belongs to each new sound
say now you want to shake me too
move down to me slip into you
what makes the one to shake you down
each touch belongs to each new sound
say now you want to shake me too
move down to me slip into you
move down to me slip into you1embed"
