you understand me
at least you say you do
lately thats enough for me
looking for perfect surrounded by artificial
youre the closest thing to real i see
sure everyone has their problems thats a given
yours are the easiest to tolerate
this wasnt what we we were wanting how were living
but lets take this good enough and turn it to great
baby understand

prehook
this can only be as good as we both make it
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
we can be as happy as we want to be girl
but we gotta make it work

hook
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh

verse 2
sometimes i love you more than youll ever know
other times you get on my nerves
hey thats just reality no it cant always be
kisses hugs and beautiful words
you was looking for your prince what you found
is a pauper with potential
and no im nowhere near perfect but im around
girl time and patience is essential baby realize
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeprehook
this can only be as good as we both make it
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
we can be as happy as we want to be girl
but we gotta make it work

hook
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh

verse 3
thick and thin
the bad outweighs the good sometimes
that doesnt mean were supposed to give it up
my problems are yours and yours are mine

prehook
this can only be as good as we both make it
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
yes sometimes its gonna hurt
we can be as happy as we want to be girl
but we gotta make it work

we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
we gotta make it work ay oh ay oh oh
