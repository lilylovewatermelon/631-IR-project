i see a mansard roof through the trees
i see a salty message written in the eaves
the ground beneath my feet the hot garbage and concrete
and now the tops of buildings i can see them too

verse 1
i see a mansard roof through the trees
i see a salty message written in the eaves
the ground beneath my feet the hot garbage and concrete
and now the tops of buildings i can see them too

the admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
the ground beneath their feet is a nautically mapped sheet
as thin as paper while it slips away from viewsee vampire weekend liveget tickets as low as 73you might also like13embed"
