verse 1 nanna ragnar  both
i dont like walking around this old and empty house
so hold my hand ill walk with you my dear
the stairs creak as you sleep its keeping me awake
its the house telling you to close your eyes
and some days i cant even dress myself
its killing me to see you this way
cause though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore

refrain nanna  ragnar

verse 2 nanna ragnar  both
theres an old voice in my head thats holding me back
well tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young and full of life and full of love
some days i dont know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
cause though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore
