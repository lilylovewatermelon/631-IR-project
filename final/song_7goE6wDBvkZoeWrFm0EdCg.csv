you cant stop an avalanche as it races down the hill
you can try to stop the seasons girl but you know you never will
and you can try to stop my dancing feet but i just cannot stand still
cause the world keeps spinning round and round
and my hearts keeping time to the speed of sound
i was lost til i heard the drums then i found my way

chorus tracy  link
cause you cant stop the beat
ever since this whole world began
a woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man
and so im gonna shake and shimmy it the best that i can today
cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky
you can wonder if you wanna but i never ask why
and if you try to hold me down im gonna spit in your eye and say
that you cant stop the beat

verse 2 penny seaweed both
you cant stop a river as it rushes to the sea

cause the world keeps spinning round and round round and round
and my hearts keeping time to the speed of sound speed of sound yeah

but you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
cause you cant stop the beat
