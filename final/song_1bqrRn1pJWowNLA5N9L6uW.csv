i took a little journey to the unknown
and i come back changed and i can feel it in my bones
i fucked with forces that our eyes cant see
now the darkness got a hold on me
holy darkness got a hold on me

verse 2
how long baby have i been away
oh it feels like ages though you say its only days
there aint language for the things ive seen yeah
and the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
the truth is stranger than all my dreams
holy darkness got a hold on me

chorus
i have seen what the darkness does
say goodbye to who i was
i aint never been away so long
dont look back them days are gone
follow me into the endless night
i can bring your fears to life
show me yours and ill show you mine
meet me in the woods tonight
