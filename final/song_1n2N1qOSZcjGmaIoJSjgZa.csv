father forgive me
for i know i have sinned

verse 1
close my eyes and i pray
cause i feel the skys falling on me the skys falling on me
and the walls caving in and i feel like i just cannot breathe like i just cannot breathe
and i feel like feel like
i may lose my mind mind
this is real life real life
can anyone hear my cries cries

prechorus
will you forgive me will you forgive me
i cant shake this depression and im always stressing
and nobody feels me

chorus
baby i need you baby i need you
baby i need you baby i need you
no more bargaining back and forth
arguings what we agreed to

postchorus
if i fall out into space
will my problems finally fade
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
i need you i keep rolling and smoking
and blowing to deal with these problems deal with these problems
i keep drinking and popping these pills
but it never resolves em it never resolves em
and i feel like feel like
its my time to bloom
this is real life real life
im bout to explode explode

prechorus
will you forgive me will you forgive me
i cant shake this depression and im always stressing
and nobody feels me

chorus
baby i need you baby i need you
baby i need you baby i need you
no more bargaining back and forth
arguings what we agreed to

postchorus
if i fall out into space
will my problems finally fade
if i fall out into space
will my problems finally fade
