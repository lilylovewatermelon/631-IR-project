girl i know it’s late for me to be calling
but what else was i gonna do
i woke up with a heart full of love
and no one around to give it to
it’s just me here staring up at the ceiling
feeling like a watch that’s been wound too tight
nothing but the sound of the box cars rumbling
and the sirens screaming
in the middle of the night

chorus
and i’m wide awake thinking bout you baby
i’m wide awake and i’m going crazy
i’m wide awake
now honey how about you

verse 2
don’t ya ever feel like this ‘ole rock we’re riding
is only turning to wear you down
and don’t yeah wish that you had someone there
to wrap your loving arms around

chorus
and i’m wide awake thinking bout you baby
i’m wide awake oh and i’m going crazy
i’m wide awake
now honey how about you
