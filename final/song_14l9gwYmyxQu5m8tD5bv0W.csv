uh tryna find a way to like not overstep
but its really just me um
its somethin i gotta whatever
uh look

verse 1 jid and rayvn lenae
pardon me but a part of me looking for more
givin my heart my art my artery what do you want more
minority boy black lookin for joy
they snatch it lookin back part i paint it for
but im tapped i lap tap water and tap dance
and tabernacles before the lord the pattern is null and void
not gon avoid the words that come with the voice
inside of my head im sick of the noise oh
so be a bigger nigga put your finger on the trigger
as youre lookin at the mirror mirror mirror on the wall
and let that bitch rip til your backbonе slip
and know the cracks dont give no black fuck bout yall four four
just your ass your hips your lips my dick tip my black balls
dribblin and dippin em in your jaw
scribblin word rhymеs the crowd givin applause
but in my spirit i feel it that they dont hear me at all ball
nigga my nigga look at the bigger picture we flawed okay cool
you pickin up figures nigga we proud you paid dues
but now you gotta do what you can and cant abuse your power
lets come up with a plan and we pursue and devour
but dont get shit fucked up
i be in the forefront with the 45 dont front
back then right now last week next month
backseat shotgun dont knowgot one

mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm

no matter what you say no matter what you do get high
this shit is tribal tribal ill stand beside ya oh
hand me my hand on the bible
mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm hey

verse 2 jid with rayvn lenae and both
yeah pardon me but a part of me lookin for more
givin my heart my art my artery what do you want more
majority push packs they unemployed
part of your past straps oohooh woah the crack come in the stores consume
boarded windows chosen boardrooms and bored negros oohooh
nothin to do but war wounds and more vigils
candlelight moon ayy ayy the more women the more widows
lookin for food hey without a dude and four kiddos
but fuck it im sick as fuck and i told you motherfuckers no recoverin
kickin up and im coughin and spittin legitimate love
like a drug loaded in the snubs
sniffin for information on who the plug
on the black plight black gloves black night black baby
go and keep it wrapped tight give a brother a hug and not a slug thats right
if ever trouble should come we never crumble
thats why we been down for life
bridge 1 jid and rayvn lenae
got a weird feeling that enemies on the way
give a little energy anything motivates
come around namaste now you down dont be afraid
just keep that fear locked out
come feel the love feel the love right now feel it oh
feel the love come feel the love feel the love right now
rain down come feel the love feel the love right now
feel the love come feel the love come feel the love right now feel the love
come feel– come feel the love come feel the love gotta show em the love
come feel the love come feel the love gotta feel– gotta gotta show oh shit right
gotta feel gotta feel the love gotta feel the love right now

bridge ravyn lenae and jid
under the ocean dries to dust
just rest assured the sun will come
so close your eyes and ease your fears
just let me whisper in your ear
forever more forever more
ever more forever more oh
