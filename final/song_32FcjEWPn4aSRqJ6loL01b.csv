you slip your finger through the tear in my tshirt
you stirrin up dirty in the back of my mind
you keep on flirtin cause you know that its workin
you stuck in my head girl writing the lines
couldnt sing this song without you if i tried
lets light it up like its our last night

chorus
were just hanging around
burnin it down
sippin on some cold jack daniels
jammin to some old alabama with you baby
laying right here naked in my bed
im just doing my thing
you love it when i sing
say it makes you feel like an angel
we about to get a little tangled up right about now
so girl lets keep burnin it down
burnin it down burnin it down

verse 2
girl when you want it
you know that im on it
you know that i love lovin up on you
lets hit the switch and let our shadows dance
and light it up like its our last chance

i wanna crawl through the dark
just to feel your heartbeat against me  against me
