getting a little erratic here
and i dont know who to trust
i guess they got a way of readin my mind
i guess i got to adjust
ive got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
i got my head on a spring
well i thought i got you on my side
i havent got fucking anything

chorus
im just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even tryin to stand out
im getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and i got nothing to say
its all been taken away
i just behave and obey
im afraid i am starting to fade away

verse 2
uhhuh
i kinda see through the cracks
when i press up on the wall
im not lookin to stand up real high
id be happy to crawl
i think im losing my grip
but i can still make a fist
you know i still got my one good arm
that i can beat mmm i can beat myself up with
see nine inch nails liveget tickets as low as 118you might also likechorus
im just a face in the crowd
nothing to worry about
not even tryin to stand out
im getting smaller and smaller and smaller
and i got nothing to say
its all been taken away
i just behave and obey
im afraid i am starting to fade away

bridge 1
hey and for what it was worth
i really used to believe
that maybe theres some great thing
that we could achieve
and now i cant tell the difference
or know what to feel
between what ive been tryin so hard to see
and what appears to be real

instrumental break

bridge 2
fading away
fading away
fading away
fading away
outro

my world is getting smaller everyday
hey hey hey hey and thats okay
my world is getting smaller everyday
