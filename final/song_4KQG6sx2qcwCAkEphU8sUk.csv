or at least it ought to for as much as i buy
but its money well spent just to help me feel free
from the pain she creates when shes cheatin on me

well shes at it again livin high on the streets
so i reach for the bottle just to help me to sleep
and i lay here in bed and dream of a time
when she was content with being all mine

if whiskey could talk itd say im a great guy
or at least it ought to for as much as i buy
but its money well spent just to help me feel free
from the pain she creates when shes cheatin on me

shell come back to me when the lights have gone down
and shes ran out of men to buy her a round
but she dreads comin home to that drunk in her bed
whos living alone hangin on by a thread

if whiskey could talk itd say im a great guy
or at least it ought to for as much as i buy
but its money well spent just to help me feel free
from the pain she creates when shes cheatin on mesee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeembed"
