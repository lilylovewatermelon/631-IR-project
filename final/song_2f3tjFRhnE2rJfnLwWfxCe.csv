put your trust in me
i wont let you down
dont delay the things
that you want right now

prechorus
why wait for later
hey dont you want some action
im not a waiter
i like to make things happen
somethings coming on coming on strong
dont take too long
dont you wanna know
baby come home oh

chorus
one more night with you
i wont think it through
times money but you knew
theres nothing in the world
you can think of that i wont do to you

im gonna dance through the veil of your eyes
while you follow my steps in the sand
i see your fate in the palm of your hand
no one looks no one hears us this time
its only me and your conscience tonight
if there are no witnesses there is no crime
