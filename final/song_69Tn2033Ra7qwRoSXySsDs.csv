opened my eyes this morning with a smile on my face
my arms wrapped around you took me away
and it got me to thinking what we need to do
is take a sunday drive and drive on through
monday tuesday friday and saturday too
lets disappear gotta jet out of here
feel the wind across our face
well have some fun gonna dance on the run
its a perfect day to break away
well hit tulsa by tuesday follow the stars above
spend the weekend in vegas and gamble on sweet sweet love
it dont matter what we do as long as im with you

bridge
lets disappear gotta jet out of here
feel the wind across our face
well have some fun gonna dance on the run
its a perfect day to break away

yeah yeah
break away
yeah yeah

outro
lets disappear gotta jet out of here
feel the wind across of faceyou might also likeembed"
