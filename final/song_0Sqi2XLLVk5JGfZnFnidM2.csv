it was all just a dream oh no
yet i wish it was real

verse 1
all my pets they were there and they smiled
take a shit it was fine
everybodys so inviting
theyve got it in for me i know
its not that i dont really love you
its just that i dont really know
the hateful things you think you want to say yeah
time will turn them into jokes yeah

chorus 2
yes it was all just a dream oh i know
was it real i dont know i hope so

instrumental break

bridge
here we go can i play can i watch
i would like one night in your life
i saw worlds they dont stop theyre like us
they go fast like a sun thats been shot
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 2
everybody at the party
shouldnt worry if im there
everybody at the party
shouldnt worry what i wear
cause today theyll talk about us
and tomorrow they wont care

chorus 3
this whole life is it a dream i cant tell
i got up then i waved then i fell
i recall you were all there with me
overjoyed and at peace

outro
first time around second took too long
third times a charm circle of fourths
five days to rehearse six to make it work
seven notes in a scale eight in some countries
nine in fancy keys ten years weve been friends
eleven seconds to hell and of course twelve major chords5embed"
