getting late
why you gotta be

verse 1
lilah
i know its getting late
and im struggling to let go
although theres distance between us
theres no place id rather be
owe you some hospitality
and it comes so naturally
promise i just need some more time
if you can bear with me

when last did we feel this closе together
chasing sunsets in california
dont makе me wait babe its been forever
dont take forever
its been forever
dont take forever
its been forever

verse 2
trust me im starting to realize
and look beyond my fears
sun keeps on turning to twilight
baby we dont have long
i cant keep my hands off you
all night all my love
you say its getting too late
baby dont be afraid

chorus
when last did we feel this close together
chasing sunsets in california
dont make me wait babe its been forever
dont take forever
its been forever
dont take forever
its been forever
outro
giddy up girl best i can do
go follow where the wind blows mmm
sometimes we all feel hollow
my heart girl you can borrow mmm
please dont make this song about you
please dont make this song about you
please dont make this song about you
please dont make this song about you3embed"
