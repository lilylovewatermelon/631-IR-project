 sindarin 

ngîl cennin eriel vi
menel aduial
glingant sui mîr
síliel mae

 i saw a star rise high in
the evening sky
it hung like a jewel
softly shining 

ngîl cennin firiel vi
menel aduial
dûr dûr i fuin
naenol mae

 i saw a star fade in
the evening sky
the dark was too deep and so light died
softly pining 

an i ú nathant
an i naun ului
a chuil anann cuiannen
a meleth perónen
you might also like for what might have been
for what never was
for a life long lived
for a love half given embed"
