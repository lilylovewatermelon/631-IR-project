im writing a song all about you
a true song as real as my tears
but youve no need to fear it
cause no one will hear it
cause sad songs and waltzes arent selling this year

verse 2  willie nelson
ill tell all about how you cheated
id like for the whole world to hear
id like to get even with you cause youre leavin
but sad songs and waltzes arent selling this year

chorus cody johnson   willie nelson
its a good thing that im not a star
you dont know how lucky you are
and though my record may say it no one will play it
cause sad songs and waltzes arent selling this year
