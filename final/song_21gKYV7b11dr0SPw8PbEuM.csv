under moonlit skies
we found love there
dancing in the sand
walking hand in hand
both without a care

haunted by her past
completely in her grasp
simply unaware
wasnt meant to last
it fell apart so fast
life is just not fair

its time to face
what this love has done to me
i can’t escape
only your love can save me

you’re the only one who matters
and the only one for me
now i’m lonelier than ever
only your love can save me

i’ve wanted this forever
but i want you all for me
you can put me back together
only your love can save me
you might also likeeach day i’m in hell
everyone can tell
by the look on my face

not one day goes by
that i don’t wonder why
don’t believe its fate

its time to face
what this love has done to me
i can’t escape
only your love can save me

you’re the only one who matters
and the only one for me
now i’m lonelier than ever
only your love can save me

i’ve wanted this forever
but i want you all for me
you can put me back together
only your love can save me

only your love can save me
whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
only your love can save me
you’re the only one who matters
and the only one for me
now i’m lonelier than ever
only your love can save me

i’ve wanted this forever
but i want you all for me
you can put me back together
only your love can save me

whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
only your love can save me
whoa whoa oh whoa whoa oh
only your love can save meembed"
