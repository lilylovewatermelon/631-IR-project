round 1 tay roc
they said i cant gun bar him to death what is that shit bout
smack joe jackson makin me put this hit out
wait… this gonna take a minute to get out
it went from concentration to constipation
i been sittin on this round waitin to get this shit out
ay but yall keep callin him the goat
you about to get your feelings hurt spittin
i carry curry these to whatever crib he in caribbean and take this jerk chicken
like where that coco bread
i box well you dont know roc well
i put the whole blade in him then start twistin the oxtail
the real is back
this the perfect place to get you at
i have a nigga that love new york hit you with a midget mac
when you face the fifth it aint a bottle of liquor
you will get clapped the pistol whip
think you some type of guerrilla gorilla til you hit with the silverback
faggot yall keep talkin about he hot so what
this your funeral i hope everybody on your block show up
if roc show up no cops show up glocks show up
ariana grande shit i hit a man chest or manchester the spot blow up
you not so tough nigga i grip heat aimin and ima clap
like a taco stuff you see meat hangin out the back
fuck them angles that you use
if i dont understand hollows point
i whip out on hollow point and give him a hollowpoint
light bars
you look like you came to cop blow
i will aim the glock low let it bang and drop bro
yall can praise him but the tay will stop lo
after i kill him yall watch this king tower thats jamie foxx show
once they paid me my dough this problem was all yours
black mask im flashin sticks thats star wars
sawed off try to run im all for it
ill chase you with it runnin with the thunder im paul george
ill be damned if they caught me if you plannin to rob me
i hit you with one k thats a band what it cost me
you tryin to wrestle tell this man to get off me
i had my bitch point with the long nose thats diana taurasi
am i wild yes this gon turn into a foul mess
buck fifty from cheek to cheek youll get your smile stretched
hollow try me this guy die next
cowboy revolver i will smith him with a wild wild wess
ay i can take that same bar redo it better
im evil and clever yall try to put these pieces together
strapped with an eagle and heckler
now im will smith in wild wild west
actin out with a big machine and in a desert
who is this man tryin to play with
potato on the barrel banana for the k clip
i can treyeight shit the snub better
but in the closet i got a de and ar at the top like a love letter
thats light
im the type to answer you before i know your question
and send your soul to heaven
this shit gon get so upsettin
all that jokin is yo profession
ill put an apple in your mouth then hang you over a fire thats a roasting session
my nigga we not the same
i wouldnt be me if every other bar these niggas didnt hear a chopper bang
like play with me and get murked fucker
i got somethin ugly for him and it kick off the shot like dirk jumper
boy i will show up to your funeral with a straight face
buck fifty you while you in the casket then say grace
i will pop the tre eight youll get caught with the pound
think bill cosbys rape case this shit will lift a star off the ground
but real shit if shit go further than fuckin rap
snuff this cat open up the trunk you get stuffed in that
a couple clap wont hear right when i buck the gat
i keep squeezin till somethin fly in his ear like what the fuck is that
you might also likeround 1 hollow da don
i said i came to this spot to cook you watch dawg get it
did i spill something that means ima wipe the floor wit em
nigga we gon set some rules
even though these rounds turn into cream like dippin dots
im a hustler i woulda did this for free i love whippin roc
so let us know if its beef and stuff
come for the don tay daunte
then cold peppers culpepper will heat him up
ill be in his projects wavin at the bench like i need a sub
ill have him spillin his guts out everywhere like i need a hug
you act tough in blogs but when i see you you change instantly
take the fatigues off in 2k i want to see the same energy
im with aggression
cause a real battler do everything when its called for
thats why im mayweather and you mcgregor
cause you could only beat me with an arm bar
so how dare yall pair me with my peers and the cheers with legends thats a mere deception
ive transcended i no longer stare steer in their direction
i had mirror recessions that means i spent the year reflectin
battlin the only competition i see
like whoo pats himself on the back – that theres impressive
a scary site when it aint apparent i appear at night
so you know they had to pay for this bag its like a spirit flight
im in his bush with the 40 bout to throw him shots
im like lets rock and roll now every once in a blue moon they forced to rolling rock roll in roc
bare bear with me cause if theres problems
i know where this bitch stay
i treat rap beef like dj akademiks im posted the next day
i been to his hood tay dont clap the k
only time he throw a cap away he was on the battle stage
but i told yall ima let him—
only time he throw a cap away he was on the battle stage
and im glad yall threw this back up
i meant to throw this shit in the crowd
im a little different i think ahead
i always keep a backup just to finish my rounds
me losing is like smack starting a battle on time
i said before they dropped this battle online
theyve already brought his box to my door like amazon prime
they went to his door his wife said tay roc at work
i said ththe gun bar king got a job
oh shit its the perfect time to play swear to god
you nervous right look at his face
he wish he could fuck me up
but when his boss tell him to do something he said yes sir and he hustle up
i mean dont come in here and act tough with us
when the only thing he ever rang up was a customer
i can see roc with the red laser flashin
like boop 236 is that too much for ya
he used to taking orders
surf said he dust rock off and kept him hes an archaeologist
he kept you he kept you my nigga
thats how i know you write with him
cause all of a sudden you got schemes
then it was cave gang and you got mean
at this point i dont know if im battlin tsu roc or roc rawsteen
i mean you linked up with brizz surf mook
some of the coldest writers
i guess you dont know whats hot or not
so you gotta get somebody that know the fire notifier
i said but i aint he dont come up with his own shit
and niggas pen all his raps
im just sayin to give him the blueprint
then leave the writing on rock these are the facts artifacts
so you need niggas to proof read
well what you gon need is a bulletproof v
give two gs to my shooter
it makes a lot salat its a cool fee kufi
i dont care if they amp you in the venue
i seen you on udubb gettin smoked
the detector says you aint goin off without a battery in you
but you come here and say this is my house this is my house
it is well thats right
cause you need two things to run a house gas and… thats light
but hell say a coma is what he sat her in saturn
yall remember that
hell say a coma is what he sat her in saturn
my nigga that wasnt that hot
cause if i woulda said it i woulda— i wouldnt have said it
nigga did you really think thats somethin id jot
for me to say a line like that i gotta be dumb as a rock
let me chill cause yall know this nigga
he always like he about to fight right
but but somehow his niggas pull him out the fight
let me go let me go let me go
i mean you never see da don wildin im usually calmsilent
i just stand by then let these hands fly they palm pilots
wait wait these the same jawns that had john john lyin
and you frailer than him
so what make you think i wont park your shit
a right bring kimbo slice back to life
like whoo he hit him hard as shit
i said a body shot make your whole organ shift
he like groans – he dont know if he gotta fart or shit
ima watch watch watch em swatch swap
if what roc rocks is rocks ill rock roc
this hopscotch you hopped in your own box roc
we can box roc or i pop roc in his mouth like pop rocks
i said i could go for like 20 minutes right now my nigga
tay roc
do your thing

hollow
and youll automatically lose
i set some battling rules
and yeah i killed you with the culpepper
so if you got any daunte lines you automatically lose
lomclothingcom bitch

round 2 tay roc
ima rebuttal since im feelin myself
i knew you would mention surf
but since tsu aside suicide ima kill him myself
you a fake nigga thats what it seems
you came all the way to my city to do charity
nigga what have you done for queens
thats how i know you a character
when you doing genuine shit from the heart you dont put it on camera
why would i knock you helping the homeless
give the homeless some help
i hope you keep donating to the homeless until you homeless yourself
you fuckin idiot you fuckin dummy
you act like we out here winnin grammys
i aint in a financial position to take care of nobody but my family
i got two daughters that im raisin ones 9 and ones 1
if i gotta raise this one 9 he gon call 911
you look like a rat i know youd get to snitchin bout a crime
cause in your battle with dizaster you was bitchin bout the time nigga
but ay that aint where the topic ends
you aint tell math dizaster was gon be in boston
he coulda got revenge
if i dont fuck with a nigga then i would not pretend
bitch ass niggas like you why i aint got no friends
be loyal to your niggas you only had one task
you was just nyb right then a couple of months pass
your punk ass was on cam chillin with the niggas that jump math
if i was him id punch you right in that luigi mustache
you wouldnt be allowed in new york with a bus pass
didnt yall have history together
and then you cut class and said fuck math
if it was me in that surprise battle with dizaster
ida had math waitin in the parking lot to catch him after
im not these other battle niggas but you dont know no different
you givin somebody a shot that they know wont miss it
i thought about changin my style for this
they said no dont switch it
theres an old saying it goes if it aint broke dont fix it
now me losing to you that aint how this battle go
what makes yall think i wouldnt take on a hollow
i survived a calic—
shit bangin matics blow clips hangin ladders low
stick wavin over his hat now thats a magic show
who can rock with me
you look like a fiend do a shot with me
you gon make me turn this to a scene that is not pretty
you do not get me til you get hit with a glock semi
when you see hollow inside a box it is not empty
enoughs enough im on some other stuff
im known for these gun rounds
but ill put these guns down and fuck you up
if i dont knock you out when we knuckle up
then the razor come out when i swing it you get your upper cut
i grab you by your neck you get another cut and another cut
it look like the seat belt wont work and im tryin to buckle up
ladder stickin out the window of the tahoe
six feet is how low im tryin to put hollow
all face shots – blaow – for the dinininon
when im finished with him i doubt the nigga fitted fit on
im sick of the don
if we aint gettin along this shit in my palm will give you déjà vu
of your last fight hollow get hit with the jawn
and the bullpen trash
not john john league – the bull pen trash
surprise him with two handles on me its a gift bag
i pull this hell break out on me this a skin rash
before you can run you get stretched thats gym class
driveby ima get him while we walkin
shots out the ac sent accent it be different when im talkin
hollow get hit with a hollow if the beef pop off
its either the donll duck donald duck or get his beak shot off
you told surf youll cap the leader liter
yall believe in this cat
til im leavin his cap twisted so the leader liter is flat
when im squeezin the gat youll see four bald heads breakin shit up thats norbes cheeko beasley and smack
believe its a wrap i told him that this aint what he want from me
battle rap is not a job this shit is fun to me
fuck a scheme angle punch its a gun to me
a gun the only thing that get this job done for me
gang shit nigga
round 2 hollow da don
yall really cheered for him dissin me for helpin people
thats what this nigga say
you aint know my rebuttals like tim mcveigh on olympic day
im blowin shit away
nigga diss me for havin a good heart
ill show your good heart when i click and spray
cause these hollows like givin back in a different way
you tried to turn the crowd against me cause im legendary
he wants yall to have it in for me
i only took this battle for the second round
nigga im here to match your intensity
two 9s deuce deuce fo fo i pocket peers
i have all these bitches kickin until roc get tears rocketeers
after diz that was something i was gonna take out
then i figured this all day delivery
plus thats how i got to cookin
soon as i saw tay saute was grillin me
so let me get this out the way so i can get backed focused
i been the most consistent for 10 years
but dare yall question my flow with the back stroakin
you know how i prepare it quick
its still two guns when im airin it
but this time im gettin hit it look like im tryin to steer a ship
i said large gat knock off a fitted ball cap
face gone mom gotta identify him by his arm tats
thats cause a quick tussle can turn to a chin scuffle
that turn into trunks and lighter fluid watch his skin bubble
i say he was in the trunk
i was like i know its hot in here but i dont know nelly
but wheres the plug for some reason he wont tell me
i forgot to take the tape off his mouth
he like mmm mmm mmm – sounded like omelly
im mean
i said i was loaded so he gettin booked this clips can boom roc
and lift him high as possible im tryin to moon rock
we down to earth niggas understand i  his family
and if you lom we gon make sure you eat like spanish women
if not bust like aneurysms reverse the mannerisms
then precisely cut you open thats a planned incision
silencer with a hair trigger got the hammer trippin
its ironic i got a stand to sit it
old school tobacco chewer nigga i only hold this can for spittin
take his bitch beat up the box thats damaged shipments
then get her cut up for cheap nigga thats planet fitness
im in the pad loft with the mask off like stanley ipkiss
and let it whistle before it show like andy griffin
you want a gun show well heres a gun show
lets pick the best contender
the glock 9 that bitch ring all day like a debt collector
the glock 18 that bitch open off top like a pez dispenser
ahhh i just registered a 40 its a sex offender
i said all these guns got me paranoid
so im drawin first like fuck that
and you back the fuck up i dont even trust smack
im isolated ive been buggin ive been the man alone
fuck what your crew say i run through cave indiana jones

i got the metal sparkin like i left a fork in it
wait wait calicoe said he aired rock out he done dribblin mane
well i got the gauge to pump rock back up im here to finish the game
shout to juelz cause i fuck with your bars
you see me you see j you see a car next to a car
i see you i see vada you in the next nigga car
its obvious tay got no respect—
nigga you drive like an intrepid
thats why you rammin heads like the dodge emblem
i drive different like a tesla car engine
im the reason the line outside longer than an escobar sentence
im the reason theres always people in front of the building like a methadone clinic
you probably paid to get into summer madness 1
and didnt know summer madness 2 was also mine
you know that whole funeral casket blog thing
me and beas had that all designed
if beasley man enough to tell you
youll find im lowkey the man up in harlem like carlton hines
so yeah this is your home
but remember you dont live alone
i was actually here before you i helped build the bricks and stones
he got me in defensive mode
im boxin one i gotta pick a zone
they said this wont help my stock
i said watch me use rock as a stepping stone
i mean you said you got knocked for mailing pounds in 2015
nigga duh it was hot by then
i started that in 06 and stopped in 010
but battlers say smack rockin his pockets
nigga duh he aint gon pay you off of every new event
fuck half and half he milkin you you aint even gettin 2
but then i see him tweet these bills kickin my ass
nigga duh thats why you had to get a 9to5
so how it feel to look into yo mama eyes
and tell her you cant make your talent monetize
thats cause he got no hustle outside of this
i mean all i see is this nigga complain
im like life dont come with a remote
you gotta get up and change
at first i used to come to these battles strapped
if you ask a cat think ai the answers that
my whole career i carried that
tommy gun from the punisher and the handle black
ima… ima… bro why do we lie as rappers
like for real like i can come up here and spit actual facts
i remember i had beef in my hood and i was scared son
bird sensed it so he threw me a weapon cause he had a spare one
i checked the clip put one in the head in case i had to air one
pulled up on that nigga block hopped out and shot the fair one
i been scarred since my dad left my mom had my mind slippin
ironically in houston that had my mom trippin
thats why i stay with my son more than my gun
cause i know if i raise him right hell pop different
im more mature
you can leave you can leave if you want to we dont need you
i said i went from hennessy to ginger tea
i went from fitted hats to thinking caps
i went from probation to donation
but this aint about me
im just giving game so you aint gotta battle all day
think drake on ygs record
yall dont even peep that im rappin for tay rappin 4tay
the only thing you prepared for this year my nigga is this battle tonight
see me a few years from now ill be winnin the battle at life
thats cause i got the drive of tony robbins
the grind of eric thomas the mind of iggy johnson
i aint got any options
im the king junior thats why im killin you with no violence
this is suicide smack help with the notes since you cosigned him
when i go to the bed the gun on the stand next to a nigga like joe biden
and damn see how hard it is i forgot no lyin
alright i was on the e train and that shit was takin mad long
union turnpike when some guy woke up and randomly ran off
the doors closed hes bangin on em cause he left his bag on
the train takes off he jumps in between the carts and grabs on
im thinking whoo this gon be a rough ride if he drags on
i waited 15 seconds nobody did nothin it was a sad song
so my point is we all could come to this stage
and rap about killin and how well take a life
but i know the feeling of actually having to save a life
i mean niggas might think thats wack
cause most wanna be a thug all the time
yall dont care about other people til theres blood on the line
and im showin love to everybody i aint with the beef
i mean theres more than one way i can be with the piecepeace
my nigga what you doing
im tryin to make sure this nigga gets deceased

guy from the crowd
yeah yeah but we dont wanna hear that bullshit sharrief

hollow da don
this is what im talking about
time then fuck it
