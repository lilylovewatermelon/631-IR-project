oh i had a lot to say
was thinking on my time away
i missed you and things werent the same

prechorus
cause everything inside it never comes out right
and when i see you cry it makes me want to die

chorus
im sorry im bad im sorry youre blue
im sorry about all things i said to you
and i know i cant take it back
i love how you kiss i love all your sounds
and baby the way you make my world go round
and i just wanted to say im sorry

verse 2
this time i think im to blame
its harder to get through the days
you get older and blame turns to shame

prechorus
cause everything inside it never comes out right
and when i see you cry it makes me want to die
