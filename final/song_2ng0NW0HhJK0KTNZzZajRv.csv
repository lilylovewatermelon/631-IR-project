are you okay
cause youre the one who needed space
and finally now im doing fine
you would rather see me cry
are you okay
youre acting like we never changed
and finally i can sleep at night
makes you wanna lose your mind
are you okay

verse 1
i know that youve been scared of love
and everything it did to us
but how am i supposed to open up
when you were just so good at closing off
youre up and down im inside out
you ripped my heart right from my mouth
and then i had to go and pick it up
and play it like i didnt give a fuck

prechorus
you called up my phone fifty times from that party
3 am you thought id be there in a heartbeat
your life but you might wanna put down the bacardi
mean this sincerely dude

verse 2
you called my friends you called my dad
you begged for help to win me back
and they would never say it to your face
but no they never liked you anyways
you missed my birthday and my shows
you made me feel so damn alone
and somehow now you got so much to say
dont got time to listen anyway

prechorus
you called up my phone fifty times from that party
3 am you thought id be there in a heartbeat
your life but you might wanna put down the bacardi
mean this sincerely dude
