gemini
im a myth and im a legend
whom never wins
and might not ever play again
keep falling in keep falling in yeah
love so fast and back out again
speeding

lesson learned but truth gets old

i lookеd up at the ceiling as i draft my im so sorry text
dont rеgret the choice i chose but do regret the mess i made
i see you hurt i wish i could just hold you tight and close
dont need long just wanna say i love you and miss you most

oh i know myself my skin
rolling stones dont crawl back in
daddys faults fell down on me
break that curse for sweet relief
