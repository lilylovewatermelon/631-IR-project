verse 1
something about the way that you walked into my living room
casually and confident lookin at the mess i am
but still you still you want me
stress lines and cigarettes politics and deficits
late bills and overages screamin and hollerin
but still you still you want me

chorus
oh i always let you down
youre shattered on the ground
but still i find you there
next to me
and oh stupid things i do
im far from good its true
but still i find you
next to me next to me

verse 2
theres something about the way that you always see the pretty view
overlook the blooded mess always lookin effortless
and still you still you want me
i got no innocence faith aint no privilege
i am a deck of cards vice or a game of hearts
and still you still you want me
