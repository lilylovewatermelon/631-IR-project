verse 2 damian marley
and i remember when we met and we began dating and everything was copacet and we began mating
and the way then the way mi love her good she gimme don ratings
because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
and she get her belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings and the closer we become the more she gravitating
until we buckle down and there is no escaping
now it typically become an everyday thing regulary physically communitcating
sexually scientifically penetrating until she start spiritually resonating
ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
she is the only queen the king is desognating i know its kinda deep but keep on concentrating
cause jazzy lay di beat and i am clearly stating
