say it once tell me twice
are you certain im alright
just a sign to remind me
tomorrows worth the fight

partial prechorus
ever changing the story line that keeps me alive
so make a wish and say

verse 2
give me life give me love
scarlet angel from above
not so low not so high
keep it perfectly disguised

prechorus
ever changing the story line that keeps me alive
my mona lisas making me smile right before my eyes
