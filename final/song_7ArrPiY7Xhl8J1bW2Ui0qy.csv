gold hair shinin in the sun in the back of a cadillac
ripped jeans pullin you tight
how does it feel by dangelo playin on the radio
glass cold gripped in your hand
and a bottle of cogniac
up late howlin at the moon in the heart of los angeles

chorus
ohoh yeah
i wonder who is gonna love you oh
i wonder who is gonna love you
if it aint me

postchorus
if it aint me
if it aint me
i wonder who is gonna love you

verse 2
i fall in love the more you ignore me
conversation gets stale conversation gets boring
missed calls and unread texts
but none of them are important none of them are from you

chorus
ohoh yeah
i wonder who is gonna love you
i wonder who is gonna love you

tattoos fadin in the sun in the back of a cadillac
up late high on cocaine in the heart of los angeles
and i wonder and i wonder

chorus
ohoh yeah
i wonder who is gonna love you
i wonder who is gonna love you
if it aint me
