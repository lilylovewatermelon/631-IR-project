i been lookin to find a bigger picture
still envision when i was chillin’ with ya
i know i said ill go my own way
but its been months and i still don’t feel a difference
tried to focus on everyday distractions
tried to fuck with some of the most attractive
all these alternatives just got me trippin
at the end of the night im reminiscing
ill give you any and everything that you please
aint that what love is unassociated with greed
i put my heart in this shit i hope that you see
cause it was simpler to stay than it was to leave
but that was for the better that was for me
and i been doin better thats guaranteed
and even though i been focused on what i need
honestly i gotta tell you

chorus
i aint really trying to do nothin’ but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i ain’t really trying to do nothin but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i ain’t really trying to do nothin but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i aint got the time to be frontin i’m still in love
still in love still in love
still in love still in love

thoughts of trying to fix the situation
thoughts of stayin in place and being patient
i know time is supposed to heal everything
but staying optimistic gets complicated
cause i dont think i want nobody if it aint you
to go console another body i just cant do
i been through pain and came up out it with the same shoes
hard to fall back when i feel you someone i cant lose
i cant move crazy i cant choose
act like im good when you see me really that aint true
tellin myself that im done but knowin i aint through
saying its bound to get better something i cant prove
and i done see your true colors multiple times
yeah i can see through your bullshit read through the lines
and even though i can see id rather be blind
cause deep inside

chorus
i aint really trying to do nothin but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i aint really trying to do nothin but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i aint really trying to do nothin but
feel your love feel your love
feel your love feel your love
i aint got the time to be frontin im still in love
still in love still in love still in love
i aint really trying to do nothin but feel your love
i aint got the time to be frontin im still in love
thinkin bout what it coulda been and bout what it was
i been thinkin bout what it coulda been and bout what it was
what it was what it was5embed"
