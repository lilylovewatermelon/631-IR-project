you said youd never lie
but you did it anyway
so how am i supposed to feel when
you said its so real to my face
and you said youd make a promise
but a promise never stays
so how am i supposed to act when
its just how it is nowadays

prechorus
and i swear we kinda fell in love with the pain
and im scared we dont even know the right way

chorus
wish i loved you in the 90s
cause i know that we would work
say wrong place wrong time
shouldve been alive
bet it wouldnt hurt
if i had loved you in the 90s
back when life wasnt a blur
say right guy right vibe
wouldnt have to try
bet it wouldnt hurt
if i had loved you in the 90s oh
if i had lovеd you in the 90s
see tate mcrae liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeverse 2
what happened to thе guy picking up the girl
and now you speed down the highway
and dont care to say a word
in my head its kinda dreamy
i imagine it with you
on the lawn record on
lookin at this guy like 92 ohohooh

prechorus
and i swear we kinda fell in love with the pain
and im scared we dont even know the right way

chorus
wish i loved you in the 90s
cause i know that we would work
say wrong place wrong time
shouldve been alive
bet it wouldnt hurt
if i had loved you in the 90s
back when life wasnt a blur
say right guy right vibe
wouldnt have to try
bet it wouldnt hurt
if i had loved you in the 90s oh
if i had loved you in the 90s
outro
wish i loved you in the 90s
cause i know that we would work
say wrong place wrong time
