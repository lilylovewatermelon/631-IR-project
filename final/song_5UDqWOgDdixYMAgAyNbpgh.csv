if you aint got two kids by twentyone
youre probably gonna die alone
at least thats what tradition told you
and it dont matter if you dont believe
come sunday morning you best be
there in the front row like youre sposed to

prechorus 1
same hurt in every heart
same trailer different park
chorus
mamas hooked on mary kay
brothers hooked on mary jane
and daddys hooked on mary two doors down
mary mary quite contrary
we get bored so we get married
and just like dust we settle in this town
on this broken merry go round
and round and round we go
where it stops nobody knows
and it aint slowin down
this merry go round

verse 2
we think the first times good enough
so we hold on to high school love
say we wont end up like our parents
tiny little boxes in a row
aint what you want its what you know
just happy in the shoes youre wearin
you might also likeprechorus 2
same checks were always cashin
to buy a little more distraction

chorus
cause mamas hooked on mary kay
brothers hooked on mary jane
and daddys hooked on mary two doors down
mary mary quite contrary
we get bored so we get married
and just like dust we settle in this town
on this broken merry go round
and round and round we go
where it stops nobody knows
and it aint slowin down
this merry go round

instrumental break

chorus
mary mary quite contrary
were so bored until were buried
and just like dust we settle in this town
on this broken merry go round
merry go round
outro
jack and jill went up the hill
jack burned out on booze and pills
and mary had a little lamb
mary just dont give a damn no more16embed"
