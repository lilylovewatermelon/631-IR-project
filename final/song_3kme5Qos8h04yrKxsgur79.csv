watch out

verse 1
i see you on the street and you walk on by
you make me wanna hang my head down and cry
if you gave me half a chance
youd see my desire burning inside of me
but you choose to look the other way

prechorus
ive had to work much harder than this
for something i want
dont try to resist me

chorus
open your heart to me baby
i hold the lock and you hold the key
open your heart to me darling
ill give you love if you you turn the key

verse 2
i think that youre afraid to look in my eyes
you look a little sad boy i wonder why
i follow you around but you cant see
youre too wrapped up in yourself to notice
so you choose to look the other way
well ive got something to say
