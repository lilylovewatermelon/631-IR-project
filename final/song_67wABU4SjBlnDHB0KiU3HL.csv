when all of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid out one by one
a wonderful part of the mess that we made we pick ourselves undone
all of your flaws and all of my flaws they lie there hand in hand
ones weve inherited ones that we learn they pass from man to man

prechorus
theres a hole in my soul i cant fill it i cant fill it
theres a hole in my soul can you fill it can you fill it

chorus
you have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
and i have always buried them deep beneath the ground
dig them up lets finish what weve started
dig them up so nothings left unturned

verse 2
all of your flaws and all of my flaws when they have been exhumed
well see that we need them to be who we are without them wed be doomed

prechorus
theres a hole in my soul i cant fill it i cant fill it
theres a hole in my soul can you fill it can you fill it

chorus
you have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
and i have always buried them deep beneath the ground
dig them up lets finish what weve started
dig them up so nothings left unturned
