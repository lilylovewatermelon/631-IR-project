badaba badaba
badaba dada
offseason
lets work hey

chorus
plottin my escape this game rot a niggas faith
got a couple ms hidin in the safe
imagination turned a honda into wraith
i was doin eighty on the interstate
tryna make it back before my class started
country nigga never seen a passport
til i popped off and got a bag for it
now im at the garden sittin half court
watchin jr catch it off the backboard
ville nigga never seen nothing
cept a fucking triple beam jumping
good dope leave a fiend krumping
made it out it gotta mean something

verse
either you gon hustle or that nigga uncle sam got yo ass reenlisting
26 murder scene pumping
better leave it tucked if you aint dumping
pow pow nigga he slumping
twelve comin we aint seen nothing
time change niggas aint rumbling no more
nah what for hungry for more
if you solo these vocals listen close and you can hear grumbling
multi and im still munching
big bag never fear fumbling
want smoke nigga dont choke
im a whole fuckin nicotine company
dreamville the army not a navy
how could you ever try to play me
kill em on a song walk up out the booth do the westbrook rockababy
i never fall out with the bro
hate when your family turn into foe
we had a penthouse on the road
interior decorated with the hoes
just like a multiplechoice getting chose
my niggas like eenie meenie miney moe
scoop up a dimepiece like we homeless
then we gon send em back pigeontoed
out of the concrete was a rose and winters was cold
had to go over and stand by the stove
we from the southeast niggas know
this where the opps creep real slow
wont vote but they mob deep with the poles
i punch the time sheet not no more
and now my assigned seat is the throne

plottin my escape this game rot a niggas faith
got a couple ms hidin in the safe
imagination turned a honda into wraith
i was doin eighty on the interstate
tryna make it back before my class started
country nigga never seen a passport
til i popped off and got a bag for it
now im at the garden sittin half court
watchin jr catch it off the backboard
ville nigga never seen nothing
cept a fucking triple beam jumping
good dope leave a fiend krumping
made it out it gotta mean something
made it out it gotta mean something
made it out it gotta mean something
