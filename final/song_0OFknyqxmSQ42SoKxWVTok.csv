what color is the sky ay mi amor ay mi amor
you tell me that its red ay mi amor ay mi amor
where should i put my shoes ay mi amor ay mi amor

the way you keep me guessing im nodding and im yesing
ill count it as a blessing that im only un poco loco

verse 2 hector miguel both
the loco that you make me it is just un poco crazy

the liberties youre taking

youre just un poco loco
