mother motherlets eat
hold your horses got a million courses
and im fixin a treat
jeremiah go and help your mother
jane and jonah you too
hezekiah go and get your brother
then fetch amy and sue
mother mother everybodys happy
got a reason to smile
cause you know that im about to serve a
christmas dinner country style
christmas dinner country style
ho everbody sit and bow your heads
well all say grace and then break bread
la la la lala la la
put your napkin on your lap
while jud pours cider from the tap
oh dont that turkey look divine
well promenade it down the line
plenty of dark were long on white
so allemande the platter to your right
now sashay along that country ham
and double sashay the marshmallow yams
swing to the left the chestnut stuffin
and aswing to the right a huckleberry muffin
time for your partner to reach across
and dosido the cranberry sauce
have another helpin one and all
and you and the rhubarb swing to the wall
pass a little drumstick if you please
and promenade the pretty blackeyed peas
well youve all sashayed and dosidoed
so much turkey youre bout to explode
but youve still got to swing to the pickled quince
choose your pieeither punkin or mince
ho the dinner was grand to say the least
so honor the lady who cooked the feast
mother mother thank you for the dinner
all the fixins were great
nothin to it mightly glad to do it
seein how much you ate
jeremiah go and get your fiddle
come on father lets dance
im too full of turkey and the stuffing
i aint takin a chance
its a very very merry christmas
got a reason to smile
mother mother everybody loved your
christmas dinner country style
