verse 1 lil wayne
ugh too many women and not enough time
im a cool cat but im on life nine
pimping aint dead cause i be the lifeline
and i dont buy the bar cause it dont sell white wine
go on let that light shine balling for a lifetime
smoking on that nice pine weezy baby flightflying
you can call him your husband call me at nighttime
and even though women change i will always like dimes
and yeah im quite fine but shawty much finer
and i just get behind her and smack it like e honda
and please dont hate on me when you see me with keyana
cause she wilder than nirvana and colder than your honor
holler at your boy mañana maybach come with a recliner
run up on it and shit will get uglier than an iguana
this is only a reminder its young money—dont forget it
and im weezy f baby you might find it on her titty
would you—
