he said im gonna buy this place and burn it down
im gonna put it six feet underground
he said im gonna buy this place and watch it fall
stand here beside me baby in the crumblin walls
oh im gonna buy this place and start a fire
stand here until i fill all your hearts desires
because im gonna buy this place and see it burn
and do back the things it did to you in return

interlude
haah haah
haah haah

prechorus
he said im gonna buy a gun and start a war
if you can tell me somethin worth fightin for
oh and im gonna buy this place is what i said
blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

chorus
honey
all the movements youve started to make
see me crumble and fall on my face
and i know the mistakes that i made
see it all disappear without trace
and they call as they beckon you on
they say start as you mean to go on
start as you mean to go on
see coldplay liveget tickets as low as 113you might also likeverse 2
he said im gonna buy this place and see it go
stand here beside me baby watch the orange glow
some will laugh and some just sit and cry
but you just sit down there and you wonder why

prechorus
so im gonna buy a gun and start a war
if you can tell me somethin worth fightin for
and im gonna buy this place is what i said
blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
oh to the head oh

chorus
honey
all the movements youve started to make
see me crumble and fall on my face
and i know the mistakes that i made
see it all disappear without trace
and they call as they beckon you on
they say start as you mean to go on
as you mean to go on
as you mean to go on

outro
so meet me by the bridge
oh meet me by the lane
when am i gonna see that pretty face again
meet me on the road
meet me where i said
blame it all upon
a rush of blood to the head23embed"
