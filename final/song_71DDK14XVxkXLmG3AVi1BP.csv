she rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
hotter than the heat in july
with her windblown hair it just wasnt fair
the way she was blowin my mind
have you ever noticed every hurricane
gets its name from a girl like this
shes a cat five kind keeps you up at night
hangin on to the edge of a kiss

prechorus 1
shes a beautiful mess
yeah the kind you love to love
but what happens next
i got a feelin when the sun comes up

chorus
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a sign
im gonna wish i had a little heads up
a little leeway a little more time
some kind of radar system locked in on love
i got a feelin by the time the night finds the mornin
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a storm warning

aint it funny how it feels when youre burning your wheels
somewhere between going and gone
you get so lost that you cant turn it off
you give in and you just turn it on
shes a heart full of rain red lips like a flame
shes a girl from your favorite song

prechorus 2
what a beautiful mess
one part angel one part perfect one part a wreck
the kind of flood youll never forget

chorus
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a sign
im gonna wish i had a little heads up
a little leeway a little more time
some kind of radar system locked in on love
i got a feelin by the time the night finds the mornin
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a storm warning

bridge
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a sign
im gonna wish i had a little heads up
a little leeway a little more time
some kind of radar system locked in on love
chorus
im gonna wish i had a storm warning
im gonna wish i had a sign
