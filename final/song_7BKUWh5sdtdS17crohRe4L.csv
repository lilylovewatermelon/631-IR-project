verse
i ain’t here to pick and choose
i aint here to sing the blues
i’m just here to spread the clues
i’m just here to spread the news
everybody know i do
listen
i ain’t ashamed to be white
i ain’t ashamed to be black
i ain’t ashamed of my beautiful mexican wife as a matter of fact
i know you fucking with that
and i’m not scared of the people who tell me i should be
do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
everybody from my hood everybody know i’m good
sometimes i’m misunderstood
but thats just the uneducated that never related and feel like im fading off
they feel like im fading
im right out my mind
tell em
momma dont love me
daddy dont love me
wonder why i drown in the bubbly
you could be anything you wanna be
cept the person you don’t wanna be
let him hate let em love
wondering if everybody still like this up above
when that push come to shove
make me wanna pull up with the with the gat in the glove like
i just wanna be free
not a slave to the stereotype
all alone in my room in the middle of the night
i don’t have the words but my stereo might
i dont wanna be black i don’t wanna be white i just wanna be a man today
i dont wanna be a christian muslim gay straight or bi see you later bye
not perceived by the things i believe or the color of my skin
or the fact i’m attracted to her maybe him
or the fact i’m a single mother living all alone
looking for a man and a home to call my own
but i already have one
the only man i’ma ever need is my son my son my son my son
son say
black is beautiful
be black and proud
fuck everybody hatin on me right now i’m black and proud
i’m just as white as that mona lisa
i’m just as black as my cousin keisha
i’m biracial so bye felicia
praise black jesus now call the preacher
maybe jesus was black
maybe jesus had dreads

i vote for more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
i vote for so much more
