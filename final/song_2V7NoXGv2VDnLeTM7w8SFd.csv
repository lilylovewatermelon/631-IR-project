like a verbal seduction when
seduction when i tell em girls on the floor
i dont know man gehgehgeh
just feels like were a lot different right now
girls on the floor it kinda feels like like a verbal seduction when
im on a whole different page right now than you girls on the floor
it feels strange but umm girls on the floor
i guess its kinda like its kinda like

verse 1 eminem
i feel like im morphin into somethin thats so incredible
that im dwarfin all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check
its psychological warfare endorphins i effect
your selfesteem shatters as dialect comes blastin out your deck
she loves me such passion youd expect
this sort of reaction from her yet you strongarm
youre fuckin corny you try to turn your charm on
cause you just think youre bishop the don juan
but if you think that youre fuckin with me homie youre on one
im cockin my head back like ed lover cmon son
shes on my johnson she brings my name up constant
your boys are like shes fuckin with dude she wants some
homeboy you better get a clue
shes on my dick cause i spit better than you
what you expect her to do
how you expect her to act in the sack when shes closin her eyes
fantasizin of diggin her nails in my back to this track

seduction seduce
aint nobody whos as good at what i do

shes been stolen from you
its like a verbal seduction when

aint nobody whos as good at what i do
cause one minute she loves you the next she dont
shes been stolen from you

verse 2 eminem
shes sittin there gettin liquored up at the bar
she says its quicker to count the things that aint wrong with you
than to count the things that are
theres a sevendisc cd changer in her car
and im in every single slot and youre not — aww
im the logo on that dallas cowboy helmet a star
and im not about to sit back
and just keep rhymin one syllable — naw
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
cause theyre just not good enough but im not givin up
til i get my respect and i wont stop til i get enough
cause im not livin up to my own expectations aww
that hater alarm is soundin off
and obama took the bomb from my name aww
so quit cryin that i took your dame homie shes my dame aww
you sadly mistaken if you thinkin that im not on my game boy
and things just aint been the same since the day that i came forth
you wear your heart on your sleeve i sport that white tank boy
but you got a hardon for me what you hollerin my name for
its your bitch on my dick aint my dang fault man i cant call it
chorus eminem  sly jordan
seduction seduce

verse 3 eminem
its like were playin lyrical tug of war with your ear
you hear it girl come here
put your ear up to the speaker dear
while i freak this world premiere
seducin her loosen up
with a little freestyle thatll— wait am i losin ya
am i makin you look bad well i got news for ya
homie you losin her
oh wait she dont like when i spit it fast
am i tryin to show how let me slow it down some
its still gonna be a blowout
youre gonna wanna throw out your whole album
rummage through the shit and try to salvage somethin to see
if you can save any of it punk but none of its fuckin with me
prick you really feelin that bullshit
you think you killin them syllables quit
playin these beats aint nothin to fool with
they call me fire marshall i shut the shit down
your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
i am also the opposite of what you are like
youre a microcosm of what the fuck i am on the mic
i am awesome and you are just awestruck
shes lovestricken shes got her jaw stuck
from suckin my dick aw fuck
chorus eminem  sly jordan
