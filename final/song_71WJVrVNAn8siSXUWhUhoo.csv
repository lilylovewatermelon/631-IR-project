you cannot see him from the earth
he sees as he flies and knows as he sees
the masses below theres trouble below

this high flying bird has no sense of time
for a thousand years hes climbed these skies
his brothers have burned
flown too close to the sun
but higher and higher
this white bird flies
this white bird flies

i feel you in my sleep
when the suns down
and the world sleeps below
you call across endless oceans
i hear you and want to fly too

theres no turning back as blue becomes black
the air becomes thin this flight begins
but the bird can still breathe
brighter than before
on celestial wing
this bird can now sing
this bird can now sing
you might also likei feel you in my sleep
when the suns down
and the world sleeps below
you call across endless oceans
i hear you and want to fly too
