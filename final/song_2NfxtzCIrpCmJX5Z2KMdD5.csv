drifting in and out you see the road youre on
it came rollin down your cheek you say just what you mean
and inbetween its never as it seems

chorus
help me to name it
help me to name it

verse 2
if you built yourself a myth youd know just what to give
what comes after this momentary bliss
the consequence of what you do to me

chorus
help me to name it
help me to name it

bridge
found yourself in a new direction
arrows fallin from the sun
canyon callin would they come to greet you
let you know youre not the only one

verse 3
cant keep hangin on to what is dead and gone
if you built yourself a myth youd know just what to give
materialize or let the ashes fly
