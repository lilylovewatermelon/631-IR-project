im condemned im condemned oh my heart is on the mend
nobody gives a damn about me
you can tell me that you love me til your little lungs turn blue
but im always alone when i fall asleep
and the girls that walk downtown are like some stars that fell to earth
like the veins in my arms the story in my hurt
and the boys they always tell me my words get em by
they can tell how much i mean it by the bloodshot in my eye

prechorus
so dont try to make it my fault
if you plan on leaving dont come at all
lord knows no glory in thе fall
if no ones around at the end of it all

chorus
im condеmned im condemned oh my heart is on a mend
looking for somebody who can save me
im condemned im condemned just like all my worthless friends
waiting on the wind to set us free

verse 2
well the debt that ive been after all the booze and all the laughter
i guess thats just what makes us who we are
and the people that we lose and the battles that we choose
have you pining for something too damn far
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likebridge
so dont try to make it my fault
if you plan on leaving dont come at all
lord knows no glory in the fall
if no ones around at the end of it all
no ones around at the end of it all

chorus
im condemned im condemned oh my heart is on the mend
nobody gives a damn about me
you can tell me that you love me til your little lungs turn blue
but im always alone when i fall asleepembed"
