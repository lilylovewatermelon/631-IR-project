go unnoticed
let the freedom wash away
losing focus
the pretense is second nature
its a broken life that i cling to
trying to make right
i feel dismay just like you do
i feel decayed

chorus
so find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me this wasted life
find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me after all

verse 2
yes i see you
surrounded by the hopeless
when they need you
youre much too good and bloated
by the hopeless life that you cling to
try to make right
i feel disdain just like you do
i feel decayed

so find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me this wasted life
find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me after all

bridge
go away go away
and just leave me here
and just leave me here
just leave me here

chorus
so find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me this wasted life
find me a way to leave this wasted life
behind me after all

outro
this wasted life
this wasted life
this wasted life
this wasted lifeembed"
