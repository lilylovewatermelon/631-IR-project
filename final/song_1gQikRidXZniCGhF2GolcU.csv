down is where im goin
pain is what im showin
love is what im takin
hearts are what im breakin

verse 1
theres a strong man lives up in jackson hole
he took my heart and he broke my soul
left a dark place in my chest
i sleep but i dont rest
i sleep but i dont rest

chorus
so down is where im goin
pain is what im showin
love is what im takin
hearts are what im breakin

verse 2
met a little boy in baton rouge
his eyes were clear and his heart was true
i made that boys heart scream my name
but he didnt know the game
no he didnt know the game

so down is where im goin
pain is what im showin
love is what im takin

verse 3
you dont wanna be standing there
when the storm hits you wont have a prayer
my wind will blow you to your knees
stay away from me
stay away from me
stay away from me

chorus
so down is where im goin
pain is what im showin
love is what im takin
hearts are what im breakin
hearts are what im breakinembed"
