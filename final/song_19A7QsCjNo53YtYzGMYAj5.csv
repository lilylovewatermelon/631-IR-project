thought id be with you until the end
how did i know that i would be there
blow me away see if i care

death of a future goodbye to my friends
wish i would see you all again
family hollow family real
wish you were here see how i feel

oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl

jekyll in you brings out the wired in me
i have no defense im all that you see
the night is a bomb blast the night is on fire
sing with me in the gasoline choir

oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
oh kill a man
oh kill a girl
i killed a man
i killed a man
i killed a man
i killed a man
