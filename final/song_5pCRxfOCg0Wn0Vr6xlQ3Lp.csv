never spoken with my mouth full
yeah thats a mouthful and im doubtful
that i could get these lyrics out oh
cause i think fast but i sing slow
if i ever started rapping
theyd be laughing they wont believe me
but i got so much i wanna say
so im thinking rappers they got it easy

verse 2 jack met
someone told me to be selfless
but we are helpless without attention
so if no ones paying attention
then does my voice get to your headphones
you start thinking bout the clock ticks
you get nervous you start stressin
so how am i supposed to fit this
in three minutes and thirty seconds

chorus jack met
listen to my aching heart
quick before you skip the song
we are human after all
and we dont stay for long
see ajr liveget tickets as low as 10you might also likeverse 3 jack met
someone told me to be selfless
but we are helpless without attention
wealthy people learn the lesson
and never donate without the press there
you wanna skip it if its wordy
but fit the whole song in threethirty
i thought i had the adhd
but thats a real thing and im just lazy

chorus jack met
listen to my aching heart
quick before you skip the song
we are human after all
and we dont stay for long
we are human after all
and we dont stay for long

interlude

outro jack met
listen to my aching heart
will you keep this record on
if ed sheeran writes my song
ill finally top the charts
if ed sheeran writes my song
ill finally top the charts8embed"
