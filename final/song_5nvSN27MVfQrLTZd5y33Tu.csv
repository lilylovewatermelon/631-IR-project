first time i saw her in them cut off jeans
i knew that id be in for a treat
next thing i knew she had me tonguetied
she had me shaking from my head to my feet
never shoulda underestimated her eyes
her smile or them long long legs
now shes got me down on my hands and knees
and all i can is beg

chorus
haywire
shes got me going haywire
ill never get tired
never seen a woman do what she can do
inspired
shes got my soul feeling inspired
and full of desire
shes hotter than fire
shes got me going haywire
haywire

verse 2
every time we take a little ride in my truck
she likes the country turned way up
do a little dancing on a long dirt road
she likes to show me the definition of love
take a little dip in the river at night
way out under the stars
fresh air is good for a country girl
and that country girl is good for my heart
