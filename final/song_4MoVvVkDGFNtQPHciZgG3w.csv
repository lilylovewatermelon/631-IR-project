do you know what its like when
youre scared to see yourself
do you know what its like when
you wish you were someone else
who didnt need your help to get by
do you know what its like
to wanna surrender

chorus
i dont want to feel like this tomorrow
i dont want to live like this today
make me feel better
i want to feel better
stay with me here now
and never surrender

postchorus
never surrender

verse 2
do you know what its like when
youre not who you wanna be
do you know what its like to
be your own worst enemy
who sees the things in me i cant hide
do you know what its like
to wanna surrender
