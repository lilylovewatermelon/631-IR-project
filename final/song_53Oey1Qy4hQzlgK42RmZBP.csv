why dont we do something different
something that breaks with the times
take an old idea make it new again
baby what say we stay together

verse 2
it tears me up to watch
our old friends fall apart
lets swear right now
that well never go there
baby what say we stay together

chorus
what say we work on one day at a time
ill always be yours and youll always be mine
and well be an exception to the rule
baby what say we stay together

verse 3
lets start with loving kindness
and leave no room for hurt
and when times get hard
and we want to give up
baby what say we stay together
