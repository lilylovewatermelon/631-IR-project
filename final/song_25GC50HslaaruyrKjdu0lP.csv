am i going insane insane
my blood is boiling inside of my veins
an evil feeling attacks attacks
my bodys shaking theres no turning back
dont take your eyes off the trigger
im not to blame if your world turns to black
as your eyes start to blister
theres just no hope for our final embrace

prechorus
so here we are
im in your head
im in your heart

chorus
you were told to run away
soak the place and light the flame
pay the price for your betrayal
your betrayal your betrayal
i was told to stay away
those two words i cant obey
pay the price for your betrayal
your betrayal your betrayal

verse 2
is it my turn to die
my heart is pounding as i say goodbye
so now i dance in the flames
i love you crying and screaming my name
you said that wed be forever
how could you kill me and lie to my face
now that we cant be together
theres just no hope for our final embrace
