dear god i pray for all my haters

dear god i pray for all my haters
all my haters all my haters all my haters all my haters
they hatin on me but i dont know why they tryna stop me
tryna slow down my grind ah

verse 1
my life is a movie and everybodys watching
are you entertained looking at me partner
i made it out the hood let us get this understood
people think my life is good but theres way more too
rumors spreading fast they trying to take my glory
but its two sides to everybodys story
so let me tell this story truthfully no lying
i hate when my momma called me crying
telling me dre i feel like dying
telling me dre i feel like dying
i remember growing up west side of atlanta
couldnt pay the light bill so we kept the candles
im asking mama questions she giving false answers
i didnt want to leave my hood i just couldnt stand it
moved to mississippi and i finally had a family
moved to mississippi and i finally had a family
my dad my sister and my newly born brother
the first time i had to call another woman mother
flair i love ya i know i didnt show it
my mom asking for money and you asking for nothing
every day i told ya one day ima make it
and if i never told ya really appreciate ya
and if i never told ya i really appreciate ya
and if i never told ya i really appreciate ya
