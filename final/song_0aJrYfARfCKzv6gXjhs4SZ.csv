whos to say
whats impossible well they forgot
this world keeps spinning and with each new day
i can feel a change in everything
and as the surface breaks reflections fade
but in some ways they remain the same
and as my mind begins to spread its wings
theres no stopping curiosity

chorus
i wanna turn the whole thing upside down
ill find the things they say just cant be found
ill share this love i find with everyone
well sing and dance to mother natures songs
i dont want this feeling to go away

verse 2
whos to say
i cant do everything well i can try
and as i roll along i begin to find
things arent always just what they seem

chorus
i wanna turn the whole thing upside down
ill find the things they say just cant be found
ill share this love i find with everyone
well sing and dance to mother natures songs
this world keeps spinning

and theres no time to waste
well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round
and upside down
whos to say whats impossible and cant be found
i dont want this feeling to go away

outro
please dont go away
please dont go away
please dont go away
