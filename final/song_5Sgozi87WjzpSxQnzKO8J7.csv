i learned how to write it when i first started school
some bully didnt like it he said it didnt sound to cool
so i had to hit him and all i said when the blood came
its my last name

verse 2
grandpa took of to europe to fight the germans in the war
it came back on some dog tags nobody wears no more
its written on a headstone in the field where he was slain
its my last name

chorus
passed down from generations too far back to trace
i can see all my relations when i look into my face
may never make it famous but ill never bring it shame
its my last name

verse 3
daddy always told me far back as i recall
son your part of something you represent us all
so keep it how you got it  as solid as it came
its my last name

chorus
