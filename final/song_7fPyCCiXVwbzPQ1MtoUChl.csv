boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
the ones who get undressed before the second date
girls seem to like the boys who dont appreciate
all the money and the time that it takes

prechorus 1
to be fly as a mother
got my both eyes out for mr right
guessing i just dont know where to find em
but i hope they all come out tonight

chorus
where do the good boys go to hide away hide away
im a good good girl who needs a little company
looking high and low someone let me know
where do the good boys go to hide away hide away

verse 2
boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
talking them up about the things they do so well
but id rather find a boy who is down for the chase
putting in the time that it takes

prechorus 2
to be fly as a mother
to supply all of my hearts demands
suit and tie cause undercover
hes gonna save my life like superman
