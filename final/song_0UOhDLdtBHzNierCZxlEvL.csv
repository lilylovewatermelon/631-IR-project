i breathe air and sigh
toucan sleeps and cries
im all armored up
ive got my old helmet on
keeping out an eye
puffing all my feathers up
one more little blow
one more tap and i collapse
teetering on a toe
i feel that final poke

chorus
please its not okay
oh cant you feel your dirty face
oh dont it leave that filthy taste
oh when you squeeze that life untamed

verse 2
i freefall real slow
im all drying out
where my funny friends gone
youre in paradise
who gon plant the flowers huh
weak and worried
i shut my wild eyes
and crumble to a pile
of dust and fertilise

please its not okay
oh cant you feel your dirty face
oh dont it leave that filthy taste
oh when you squeeze that life untamed

bridge
take my hand and let us fall
play with me and pass the ball
take my hand and let us fall
play with me and pass the ball
take my hand and let us fall

outro
i breathe air and sigh
you cant breathe without me14embed"
