she left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle
on a table beside my bed
with a short little note that said i had a good time
it was written in lipstick red
she didnt sign her name i wonder
if thats a little secret that she keeps
ooh shes walking around in my sleep

chorus
dream walkin pillow talkin
shes calling my name again
days breaking i aint waking up im sleeping in
im on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends

verse 2
she took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket
and she never even bothered to ask
you could say i havent seen her since late last summer
but every night she comes back
just like smoke through the keyhole
she slips in so silently
ooh shes walking around in my sleep

chorus
dream walkin pillow talkin
shes calling my name again
days breaking i aint waking up im sleeping in
im on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
you might also likebridge
oh theres a thin line between dreams and memories
ill be losing my mind till she comes back to me

chorus
dream walkin pillow talkin
shes calling my name again
days breaking i aint waking up im sleeping in
im on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
im on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends
im on a roll now i gotta know how this dream ends

outro
shes walking around in my sleep
shes walking around in my sleepembed"
