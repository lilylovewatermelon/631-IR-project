the livin in the living room and the savin me on sunday
you put the tangle in the sheets and the perfume on my pillow
without you its just a pile of sticks and stones
i built a house you made a home

you picked every color and bought all the antiques
hung the pictures up of all our favorite memories
you watered those roses out in the front yard
left the i love you on the mirror in a lipstick heart
girl i love everything you are

cause youre still the singin in the kitchen the dancin down the hallway
the livin in the living room and the savin me on sunday
you put the tangle in the sheets and the perfume on my pillow
without you its just a pile of sticks and stones
