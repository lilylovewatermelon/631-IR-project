i will always love you
how i do
let go of a prayer for you
just a sweet word
the table is prepared for you
wishing you godspeed glory
there will be mountains you wont move
still ill always be there for you
how i do
i let go of my claim on you
its a free world
youll look down on where you came from sometimes
but youll have this place to call home always

bridge frank ocean  kim burrell
this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
silence in the ears darkness of the mind until its time
this love will keep through blinding of the eyes oh
silence in the ears darkness of the mind oh
this love will keep us through blinding of the eyes oh its til its time we die
silence in the ears darkness of the mind

outro kim burrell
oh oh
ill always love you
until the time we die
