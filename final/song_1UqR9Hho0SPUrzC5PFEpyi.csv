new face new feel i know the drill
you got a girl so dont get too close to me
i mean aint that how its supposed to be
mysterious and distant true
commanding i listen
cause everything i was thinking about i rather pursue
you got me you got me
you got me wanna risk it all
you got me wanna miss his calls
you got me wanna take it off ooh yeah oh woah
you got me thinking crazy things
regretting this but its too late
i wish you didnt know my name oh yeah

chorus

like ooh ah pull up hop out ooh ah

like ooh ah pull up hop out ooh ah

like ooh ah pull up hop out ooh ahsee summer walker liveget tickets as low as 238you might also like1embed"
