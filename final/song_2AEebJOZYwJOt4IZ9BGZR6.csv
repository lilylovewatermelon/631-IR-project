litter the floor
an all night revival
passed out around 4

now the preachers been drinkin
but its hard not to do
since she ran out the screen door
and swore they were through

oh lord if you care send a spirit down here
cause the preachers been drinkin again

but its a hard way to go on the straight and narrow
when everybody in town points a finger at you
but they aint had to walk with the weight that youve hauled
they dont know you at all but they think that they do

he didnt believe her
he just knew shed come home
but the nights kept a crawlin
as he laid there alone

and hed call up to heaven
and hed hope and hed pray
but the lines always busy
since he went astray
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeoh lord if you care wont you answer his prayers
cause the preachers been drinkin again

but its a hard way to go on the straight and narrow
when everybody in town points a finger at you
but they aint had to walk with the weight that youve hauled
they dont know you at all but they think that they do

now the bottles and bibles
broke out in a fight
the whiskey fought hard son
and took the victory that night

they found him a layin
face down by the stairs
dressed up for a sermon
nobody would hear

oh lord if you care send an angel down here
cause the preachers been drinkin again

but its a hard way to go on the straight and narrow
when everybody in town points a finger at you
but they aint had to walk with the weight that youve hauled
they dont know you at all but they think that they do
oh lord if you care send an angel down here
cause the preachers been drinkin againembed"
