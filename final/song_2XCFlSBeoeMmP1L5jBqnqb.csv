into the air
slowly disappear
no no longer here

disappear
disappear
thinner thinner
into the air
never really here
wasnt ever ever

like a thought brushing up against a sigh
floating away floating away
floating away floating away
floating away floating away
floating away floating away
floating away floating away
floating away floating away

floating away floating away
floating away floating away
floating away floating away

into the air
slowly disappear
never really here
