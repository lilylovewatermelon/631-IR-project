verse 1 kanye west
feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon
better than a chick that say yes too soon
until you have a daughter thats what i call karma
and you pray to god she dont grow breasts too soon
projects tore up gang signs is thrown up
niggas hats broke off thats how we grow up
why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
get they first car and then irs show up
he aint never had shit but he had that nine
nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
put two and two together and a little bad weather
gon be your whole family on that funeral line
asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
if my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
thats all i want like winos want they good whiskey
i aint in the klan but i brought my hood with me

verse 2 nas
i heard the beat and i aint know what to write
first line—should it be about the hoes or the ice
fourfours or black christ both flowsd be nice
rap about big paper or the black man plight
at the studio console asked my man to the right
what this verse sound like should i freestyle or write
he said nas what the fans want is illmatic still
looked at the pad and pencil and jotted what i feel
been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
now im a free agent and im thinking its time
to build my very own motown
cause rappers be deprived of executive ninetofives
and it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
and i love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
so yall copped the lps and yall fiends got dealt
im jesse jackson on the balcony when king got killed
i survived the livest niggas around
lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
look i used to cook before i had the game took
either way my change came like sam cooke
