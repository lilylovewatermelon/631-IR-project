always running from what feels right
too fast and i didnt know
then im in a toast to daylight
youre here no way to let go
dont look back when youre holding me
cause i know what this love was meant to be

chorus
one day were gonna wake up together
you wont wanna go home
well find love here together
and it feels so good in my arms
were gonna wake up together
you wont wanna go home
well find love here forever
cause well wake up together

verse 2
i got something and it feels right
what i needed to be cant control what you feel for me
i was watching you the whole night
i can never explain how the magic was made
dont look back when youre holding me
cause i know what this love was meant to be

one day you wont wanna go home
and it feels so good in my arms
you wont wanna go home
cause we wake up togetherembed"
