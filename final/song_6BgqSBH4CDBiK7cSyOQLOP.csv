verse 1
i know my hands arent warm enough to hold your
cold cold heart
and i know my bones arent strong enough to keep me from
falling apart

verse 2
did you know sometimes i dig into the carpet with my feet
and did you know that every night i play your favourite songs on repeat repeat
it helps me sleep it helps me sleep
because my hair is growing backwards and my knees are bending inwards ininwards
and monsters in the closet wont stop giving me the shivers
even though its probably just in my mind
