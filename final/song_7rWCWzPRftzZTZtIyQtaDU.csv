verse 2 future
cookin out the bowl tryna scrape out the paint
one day i was high had to pour the whole pint
woke up in the sky same money from the bank
ill take it wrapped in plastic accept anything
cut up the dark with the fetti nine times
doped up today like i got ninetynine lives
blood on my money see the blood in my eyes
laferrari buy them two at a time
every time i fuck you gotta tell me its mine
sinnin again ive been winnin again
tray done got shot he back spinnin again
ridin with the fire bitch aint never gon see
walkin in the day one in the head is a must
dark in my flesh say it run in my cup
rose gold like a bandaid over my cut
tailored in plush and covered up all this kush
bridge kanye west
cross me so much i got nails in my hand
city on fire like bethlehem

verse 3 kanye west
testin my faith and i fell in a trance
blessings on blessings they fell in my hand
comin from the raq we the home of the drillers
comin from the hundreds you got change for a billion
comin for the house real change in a minute
when i run for 24 i know my spouse better be with me
hundred feet tall when i stand on the business
look at how we did everything we intended
you dont want no tension boy you just want attention
ima pop up at your house if you pop up in my mentions

verse 4 future
got a bando count money with a mac
seen too much violence done seen too much death
bodies on bodies got a gang full of them
raised by gangsters prostitutes and pimps
visit my grandmother in prison on sunday
talk in third person they wont admit it if i done it
money like sage in my house keep it burnin
money like sage in my house keep it burnin
outro kanye west  future
city on fire
