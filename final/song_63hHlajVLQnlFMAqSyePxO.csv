i paint my nails black
i dye my hair a darker shade of brown
cause you like your women spanish
dark strong and proud
i paint the sky black
you said if you could have your way
youd make a nighttime all today
so itd suit the mood of your soul

prechorus
oh what can i do
nothing my sparrow blue

chorus
oh what can i do
life is beautiful but you dont have a clue
sun and ocean blue
their magnificence it dont make sense to you

postchorus
black beauty ahah
black beauty ahah

verse 2
i paint the house black
my wedding dress black leather too
you have no room for light
love is lost on you
i keep my lips red
to seem like cherries in the spring
darling you cant let everything
seem so dark blue
