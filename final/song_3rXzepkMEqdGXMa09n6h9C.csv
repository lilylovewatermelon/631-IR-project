whoa welcome to a day of my life day of my life
the memoirs of an imperfect angel
whoa welcome welcome welcome to a day of my life
the memoirs of an imperfect angel

verse 1
though the lights were low
i could see you both in a lovers silhouette
and my heart stood still i was froze right there
staring down at her red dress
so i bolted out the door jumped right into the car
its too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
rolled down all the windows just so i could breathe
cant believe you just actually did this shit to me
im going bout a hundred mascara runnin
laughing out of anger but it dont strike me as funny
been too good to you ive been virtuous and true
to have something like this happen in my own bedroom

chorus
betcha gon know though how it feels
when i get you back
betcha gon know though how it feels
when your hearts been cracked
betcha gon know though how it feels
when we fade to black
how it feels for real
see mariah carey liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likepostchorus
and you see your whole world collapse
and im gon lalalalalalaugh
and im gon lalalalalalaugh
and im gon lalalalalalaugh right in your face boy
betcha gon know though how it feels

verse 2
so i pulled to the side of the road to fix my face
but i cant cover with make up what my tears want to erase
i wake up in a haze morning dew and sun rays
as i drive i hide my eyes behind my black cavalli shades
a block from the house slowly creep in the driveway
tip toe through the door but youre there wide awake
youre like where you been
im like sorry but i fell asleep on jasmines sofa
i couldve swore that rae rae called you and told ya
youre like you okay
im like im alright little sleep and ill be fine
but if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
already stung but you really gon find out in time

chorus
betcha gon know though how it feels
when i get you back
betcha gon know though how it feels
when your hearts been cracked
betcha gon know though how it feels
when we fade to black
how it feels for real
bridge
this is for real for real for real
oprah winfrey whole segment for real for real
2020 barbara walters for real for real
60 minutes for real

outro
baby i had all my trust in you
and look at what you put me through
you got me all crazy
somewhere down the line youre gon get what you deserve
you fucking jerk
you were supposed to save me my sweet baby
now were fading away
but your gonna know how this feels
even if its the last thing i ever do
