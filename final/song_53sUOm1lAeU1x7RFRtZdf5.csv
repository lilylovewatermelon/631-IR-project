oh yeah
uhhuh

verse 1
there aint a woman in the world that wants to hear the word yes
when she asks you if you think that she looks chubby in that dress
and if she cooks all day you better eat it with a smile
it doesnt matter if it tastes just like bad gravy on a goodyear tire

prechorus
yeah yeah yeah
alright so you bend the truth
yeah yeah yeah
thats something that youll have to get used to

chorus
cause thats love youll see
we all commit a little bit of perjury
aw but thats no crime if you ask me thats love
youre staring at a burnt steak
you bite the bullet and you clean your plate
then you go on and on about how great it was
thats not a lie thats love

verse 2
well its the very same thing that she does for you
when she doesnt bring up the fifteen pounds that you need to lose
and every time she runs her fingers through your hair
and she says she kind of likes the way theres not as much of it there
