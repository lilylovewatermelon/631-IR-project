youre revvin and drivin through the night when those stars line up like they should
youve turned into what youve been through but you used to be the good
think of that old photograph your mom in 89
your dad laughed said she was like that when she had herself too much wine
youd give anything at all to be anywhere but here
your breathin only steadies when you start to disappear
you wanna be in mountains or smellin water by the coast
but you cant get out of your own mind so you settle in and coast

chorus
and you just drive to stay alive
one more day passes by
you just drive through the night
til that darkness turns to sky

verse 2
you think about your sister and the mighty heart she has
shes been sober for a year now how the time seems to pass
they told you it would go quick but you never tend to listen
dont you miss your mamaboy hummin hymnals in the kitchen

chorus
and you just drive to stay alive
one more day that passes by
you just drive through the night
til that darkness turns to sky
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 3
the concrete is the same here as it is in rogers county
i bet those boys are doin fine runnin roads without me
dont you miss the days when wed sneak jack in football games
no one in this town remembers my name anyways

chorus
so i just drive to stay alive
one more day that passes by
i just drive through the night
til that darkness turns to sky

outro
youre revvin and drivin through the night when those stars line up like they should
youve turned into what youve been through but you used to be the good1embed"
