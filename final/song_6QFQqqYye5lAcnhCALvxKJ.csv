verse 1 yung mutt
slumped back in the drivers seat
blunt between my lips
im ridin with a bitch thats high as me
she duckin out she tryna sleep
im duckin out im tryna see the road
but all i can see are four horsemen comin closer to me
i think im about to die well see
swervin on them motherfuckers bitch it aint my time
let the world blow up first
then i might just close my eyes
its all i really wanted my whole life
the universe wont notice
bitch you just another life
the sunll rise the stars have already died

verse 2 yung carecrow
i see the reaper creepin as my blood is seeping
sleeping deeper through the night so i can face my demons
my weakness seems to be that i cannot stop breathing
death keeps cheating on my life
but on my soul its feeding
it goes on and on and on and on and on
leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
screaming and needing yelling and pleading
that things aint as they seem
in the cut sneaking and tweakin
because i cant stop seeking this pain
this torture of horror that im always conceiving18embed"
