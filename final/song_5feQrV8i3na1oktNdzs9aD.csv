such an unusual story
of a man who did breathe in but never did breathe out
this tale reminds me of you
though a different shade of blue
you cannot always take and never give this is not how to live

chorus
you gotta breathe in and out
you gotta spread a little love all around

though i dont know this for sure
just another knock at my door
a sprinkling of an inkling underneath an apple tree
ill tell you when i find out
and show you what it is to breathe out
a natural progression lesson messin up your mind

chorus x2
i feel in you another way to be
i watch as you breathe over me
im breathing

like a tale on jackanory
the end to this unusual story is
a breath upon a window payne so comon step out of the rain
though id like to think this were true
youve become a deeper shade of blue
in my eyes this comes as no surprise youve nothing left to give no
