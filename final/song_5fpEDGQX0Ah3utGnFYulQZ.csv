i spent my time watchin
the spaces that have grown between us
and i cut my mind on second best
the scars that come with the greenness
and i gave my eyes to the bottom
still the seabed wouldnt let me in
and i tried my best to embrace the darkness
in which i swim

verse 2
now walking back down this mountain
with the strength of a turnin tide
the winds so soft and my skin
the sun so hot upon my side
looking out at this happiness
i searched for between the sheets
feeling blind to realise
all i was searching for was me
ohohh all i was searching for was me

chorus
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set keep your hair long
oh my my darling
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set in your ways
and keep your heart strong

i saw a friend of mine the other day
and he told me that my eyes were gleaming
i said i had been away
and he knew oh he knew the depths i was meaning
it felt so good to see his face
the comfort invested in my soul
to feel the warmth of his smile
when he said im happy to have you home
ohohh im happy to have you home

chorus
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set keep your hair long
oh my my darling
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set in your ways
but keep your heart strong

bridge 1
cause ill always remember you the same
eyes like wild flowers with your demons of change

bridge 2
keep your head up keep your heart strong
may you find happiness there
keep your head up keep your heart strong
keep your head up keep your heart strong
may all your hopes all turn out right
keep your head up keep your heart strong
chorus
keep your head up keep your heart strong
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set keep your hair long
keep your head up keep your heart strong
oh my my darling
keep your head up keep your heart strong
no no no no
keep your mind set in your ways
and keep your heart strong
