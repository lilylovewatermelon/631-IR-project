in my rear view i watch you
watching the twilight behind the telephone lines
nothing to prove or to assume
just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine
in my rear view i watch you
and i give you your life but you give me mine
i see you slowly swim away as the light is leaving town
to a place that i cant be but theres no apologies

chorus
just go on
just go on
theres still so many things i wanna say to you
but go on
just go on
were bound by blood thats moving
from the moment that we start
from the moment that we start

verse 2
i see your perfect little eyes watch the shadows of the clouds
on the surface of the ocean out the window of a plane
i get nervous when i fly im used to walking with my feet
turbulence is like a sigh that i cant help but overthink
what is the purpose of my life if it doesnt have to do
with learning to let it go live vicariously through
you could do the same its the least you could do
cause its a lonely little chain if you dont add to it

so go on
just go on
theres still so many things i wanna say to you
but go on
just go on
were bound by blood and love
from the moment that we start
just go on
just go on
theres still so many things i wanna say to you
just go on
just go on
were bound by blood thats moving
from the moment that we start
from the moment that we start1embed"
