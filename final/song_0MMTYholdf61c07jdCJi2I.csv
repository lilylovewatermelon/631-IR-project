shes been playing in a room on the strip
for ten years in vegas
every night she looks in the mirror
and she only ages

bridge
shes been readin about nashville and all the records
that everybodys buyin
says im a simple girl myself
grew up on long island

prechorus
so she packs her bags to try her hand
says this might be my last chance

chorus
shes gone country
look at them boots
shes gone country
back to her roots
shes gone country
a new kind of suit
shes gone country
here she comes
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
well the folk scenes dead
but hes holding out in the village
hes been writin songs speakin out against
wealth and privilege

bridge
he says i dont believe in money
but a man could make him a killin
cause some of that stuff dont sound
much different than dylan

prechorus
i hear down there
its changed you see
well theyre not as backward
as they used to be

chorus
hes gone country
look at them boots
hes gone country
lack to his roots
hes gone country
a new kind of suit
hes gone country
here he comes
verse 3
well he commutes to la
but hes got a house in the valley
but the bills are pilin up
and the pop scene just aint on the rally

bridge
and he says honey im a serious composer
schooled in voice and composition
but with the crime and the smog these days
this aint no place for children

prechorus
lord it sounds so easy
this shouldnt take long
be back in the money
in no time at all

chorus
hes gone country
look at them boots
hes gone country
back to his roots
hes gone country
a new kind of suit
hes gone country
here he comes
chorus 2
yeah hes gone country
a new kind of walk
hes gone country
a new kind of talk
hes gone country
look at them boots
hes gone country
oh back to his roots

outro
hes gone country
hes gone country
everybodys gone country
yeah weve gone county
the whole worlds gone country
were gone
