yeah man oh man oh man

verse 1
bartender looked at me like
pony up man were closin down
i paid the tab and i turned around
got on that phone on the way home
and ended up down the rabbit hole again
its funny how you havent changed a bit
but youre twice as pretty
glad you finally got to see new york city
and i know its not a race
but it looks like youre gettin over me
faster than im gettin over you
but hey what you gon do

chorus
im sick of sittin at the house dyin on my phone
wishin i was somewhere i can be alone
try to let you go somethin always reminds me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s
im tired of gettin drunk tired of bein free
tired of seein pictures i dont wanna see
girl youre everywhere everywhere but behind me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeverse 2
back then i couldve convinced myself
that maybe you called when i was out
but you didnt know what to say so you didnt leave a message
and that youre probably at home right now sound asleep
cause goin out isnt really your thing
and i wouldnt have a clue what you been up to lately
or who you been up to it with
but when i dont miss your calls i miss you callin
and i go round and round again

chorus
im sick of sittin at the house dyin on my phone
wishin i was somewhere i can be alone
try to let you go somethin always reminds me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s
im tired of gettin drunk tired of bein free
tired of seein pictures i dont wanna see
girl youre everywhere everywhere but behind me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s

bridge
modern love its the modern hearts breakin
im just a product of my generation and i
bout had enough watchin you gettin on with your life
chorus
baby im sick of sittin at the house dyin on my phone
wishin i was somewhere i can be alone
i try to let you go somethin always reminds me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s
im tired of gettin drunk tired of bein free
tired of seein pictures i dont wanna see
girl youre everywhere everywhere but behind me
i bet breakin up was easy in the 90s

outro
hearts breakin
im a product of my
oh a product of my generation oh and i
my baby my baby2embed"
