i had this question for a real long time
ive been a bad boy and its plain to see
so why do good girls fall in love with me

verse 1
youve got pep in your step you live your life with no regret
how you look when you are wet is something i cannot forget
i just wanna kiss your lips the ones between your hips
if i cashed in all my chips on you then baby id be rich
