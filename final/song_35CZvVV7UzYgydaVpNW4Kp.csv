all this time ive spent with you
all that weve been through
still were holding on
all this time ive spent with you
i am tied to you

verse 1
you call me up just to say
you think were better off this way
leaves may fall seasons change
yet we remain
a year away a year alone
the tears have fall but we have grown
the sun will rise the seasons change change
and here we are

i call you up just to say
how much ive thought of you today

the sun grows bright the rain has gone

time will heal our hearts
but were we doomed from the start
or were we planned in the stars
or is there any god at all
