blinding shining star
you wont see so far
know what cant be shown
feel what cant be known

verse 1
you were an isle unto thyself
you had a heart you hadnt felt
why would it hurt me
or was it real
it was the night we had to part
we were afraid to miss the start
what did it matter
why would it matter
and could we heal

chorus
blinding shining star
you wont see so far
know what cant be shown
feel what cant be known

bridge 1
i was a victim of magic apollo
catching my breath as i bled on the ground
somebody called me to follow i followed
thinking aloud without hearing the sound

then all the planets fell to dust
lonely departing after us
gone not forgotten
long but forgotten old lore
in every element of life
love camouflaging under strife
or other matters
mind over matters let there be more

bridge 2
maybe youll exit tomorrow the sorrow
sweeping you off as your island replies
sudden invincible flowing a river
clearer than all thou might view with thine eyes
outro
why did fireerupted lands arrive
why did murderous animals survive
why did we deserve to be revived
why was any and everything alive17embed"
