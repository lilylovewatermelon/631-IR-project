got a girl from the southside got braids in her hair
first time i seen her walk by man i bout fell up out my chair
had to get her number it took me like six weeks
now me and her go way back like cadillac seats

chorus
body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin fifteen in a thirty i aint in no hurry
ima take it slow just as fast as i can

verse 2
the way she fit in them blue jeans she dont need no belt
but i can turn them inside out i dont need no help
got hips like honey so thick and so sweet man
and aint no curves like hers on them downtown streets

chorus
body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin fifteen in a thirty i aint in no hurry
ima take it slow just as fast as i can

bridge
were out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
on a highway to heaven headed south of her smile mmm
get there when we get there every inch is a mile
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
i know every curve like the back of my hand
doin fifteen in a thirty i aint in no hurry
ima take it slow just as fast as i can

outro
ima take it slow
just as fast as i can body like a back road drivin with my eyes closed
got braids in her hair i know every curve like the back of my hand17embed"
