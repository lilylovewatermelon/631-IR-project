yeah

verse 1 lil wayne
i loved her fancy underwear
i sit behind her every year
waiting for the chance to get to tell her
im the one she should be with oh
shes popular with all the guys
so innocent in my eyes
i can see her in my life
she woulda had the world if she were mine
but see she had other plans i couldnt understand
her and her stupid friends varsitys biggest fans
never forget the day she laughed and walked away
and i couldnt stop her i guess she had it all

chorus lil wayne
she had it all figured out
when she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cause she didnt think i could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is cryin sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything can turn around
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likeverse 2 lil wayne
uh they loved her fancy underwear
every boyfriend every year
she tried to keep them entertained
when they can hardly remember her name ah
she did everything she could
just to make them laugh and treat her good
she finds herself alone
askin herself where did she go wrong
she didnt realize she chased the type of guys
that dont believe in ties tryin to apologize
never forget the day she left and walked away
and i couldnt stop her i guess she had it all

chorus lil wayne
she had it all figured out
when she left me with a broken heart
fucked around and turned me down
cause she didnt think i could play the part
but now the prom queen the prom queen
is cryin sittin outside of my door
see you never know how
how everything can turn around
