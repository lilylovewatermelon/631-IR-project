havent we met
youre some kind of beautiful stranger
you could be good for me
ive had the taste for danger
if im smart then ill run away
but im not so i guess ill stay
heaven forbid
ill take my chance on a beautiful stranger

prechorus
i looked into your eyes
and my world came tumbling down
youre the devil in disguise
thats why im singing this song
to know you is to love you

chorus
youre everywhere i go
and everybody knows
to love you is to be part of you
ive paid for you with tears
and swallowed all my pride

refrain
dadadadadada dadadada dum
beautiful stranger
dadadadadada dadadada dum
beautiful stranger
