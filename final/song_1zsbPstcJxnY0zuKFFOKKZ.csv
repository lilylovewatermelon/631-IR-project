hey kids
today were gonna learn about the world

verse 1 bo burnham
the world thats around us is pretty amazing
but how does it work it must be complicated
the secret is the world can only work
when everything works together
a bee drinks from a flower and leaves with its pollen
a squirrel in a tree spreads the seeds that have fallen
everything works together

prechorus bo burnham
the biggest elephant the littlest fly
the gophers underground the birds in the sky
and every single cricket every fish in the sea
gives what they can and gets what they need

chorus bo burnham
that is how the world works
that is how the world works
from a to zebra to the worms in the dirt
thats how it works

interlude 1 bo burnham  socko
hey everyone look who stopped by to say hello its socko
hey
where you been socko
ive been where i always am when youre not wearing me on your hand in a frightening liminal space between states of being not quite dead not quite alive its similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis
socko we were just talking about the world and how it works
boy that sounds complicated
do you have anything youd want to teach us about the world
i wouldnt say anything that you probably havent already said yourself
i dont know about that socko how about you give it a try
all right
you might also likeverse 2 socko
the simple narrative taught in every history class
is demonstrably false and pedagogically classist
dont you know the world is built with blood
and genocide and exploitation
the global network of capital essentially functions
to separate the worker from the means of production
and the fbi killed martin luther king

prechorus socko
private propertys inherently theft
and neoliberal fascists are destroying the left
and every politician every cop on the street
protects the interests of the pedophilic corporate elite

chorus socko bo burnham  both
that is how the world works really
that is how the world works
genocide the natives say you got to it first
thats how it works

interlude 2 bo burnham  socko
thats pretty intense
no shit
what can i do to help
read a book or something i dont know just dont burden me with the responsibility of educating you its incredibly exhausting
im sorry socko i was just trying to become a better person
why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every sociopolitical conflict through the myopic lens of your own selfactualization this isnt about you so either get with it or get out of the fucking way
watch your mouth buddy remember whos on whose hand here
but thats what ive— have you not been fucking listening we are entrenched in—
alright alright i wait wait wait no please i dont wanna go back please i cant go— i cant go back please please im sorry
are you gonna behave yourself
yes
yes what
yes sir
look at me
yes sir
thats better
chorus bo burnham socko  both
that is how the world works
that is how the world works
i hope you learned your lesson i did and it hurt
thats how it works
