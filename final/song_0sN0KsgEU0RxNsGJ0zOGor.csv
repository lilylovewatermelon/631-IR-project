i would like to leave this city
this old town dont smell too pretty and
i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
and when i leave this island
ill book myself into a soul asylum
i can feel the warning signs running around my mind

chorus
so here i go
im still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say
you cant give me the dreams that are mine anyway
youre half the world away
youre half the world away

verse 2
and when i leave this planet
you know id stay but i just cant stand it and
i can feel the warning signs running around my mind
and if i can leave this spirit
ill find me a hole and ill live in it and
i can feel the warning signs running around my mind

chorus
so here i go
im still scratching around in the same old hole
my body feels young but my mind is very old
so what do you say
you cant give me the dreams that are mine anyway
youre half the world away
youre half the world away

youre half the world away
ive been lost ive been found
but i dont feel down
youre half the world away
ive been lost ive been found
but i dont feel down
i dont feel down
i dont feel down13embed"
