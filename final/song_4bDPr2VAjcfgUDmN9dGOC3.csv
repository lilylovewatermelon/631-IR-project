verse 1 jayz
picture if you will that the thrones burning
romes burning and im sitting in the corner all alone burning
why does it always end up like this
something that we dont determine
same people that i fought for that i fight for that i ride for
that i live for that i die for
be the reason that these niggas is alive for
and they want me dead but im sorry but i just cant die for you
but i can make em put their hands in the sky for you
we waiting for the fireworks like july 4th
get fly more get high more cry boy why for
when the grief is over beef is over
ill be fly when easters over
i tried to teach niggas how to be kings
and all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
so when love is gone til blood is drawn
cause we no longer wear the same uniform
fuck you squares the circle got smaller
the castle got bigger the walls got taller
and truth be told after all that said
niggas still got love for you

verse 2 jayz  kanye west
showed love to you niggas
you ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
i picked up the pieces fore you swept on it
goddamn this shit leaves a mess dont it
shit feelin like death dont it
charge it to the game whatevers left on it
i spent about a minute maybe less on it
fly pelican fly turn the jets on it
but first i shall digress on it
wasnt i a good king
maybe too much of a good thing huh
didnt i spoil you me or the money what you loyal to
huh i gave you my loyalty
made you royalty and royalties
took care of these niggas lawyer fees
and this is how niggas rewarded me damn

verse 3 jayz  kanye west
bussin at me bbbbussin at me
but im bulletproof bitch you cant get nothin past me
got body armor
a nigga gotta watch the throne
and im bussin back
so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
what do you do when the love turn to hate
gotta separate from these fuckin fakes
caesar didnt see it so he ceased to exist
so the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
am i my brothers keeper
only if that nigga dont creep up
got a pistol under my pillow
ive never been a deep sleeper
pppparanoia cause the nigga that said hell
blast for ya is now blastin for ya
thats an assassin for ya
these niggas got a shot theyll shoot
please lord forgive him
for these niggas not know what they do ooh36embed"
