intro jimmy smith
good god almighty—like back in the old days
you know years ago they had the ar men to tell you what to play how to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
but uh we just went in the studio and we did it
we had the champagne in the studio of course
you know compliments of the company
and we just laid back and did it
so we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
because we had a ball
only real music is gonna last
all that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

overly focused its far from the time to rest now
debates growin bout who they think is the best now
took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
i hear you talking say it twice so i know you meant it
fuck it i dont even tint it they should know whos in it
im authentic real name no gimmicks
no game no scrimmage i aint playin with you niggas at all
my classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
or work with their parents
but thinkin back on how they treated me
my high school reunion might be worth an appearance

part ii paris morton music 2

verse drake
yeah uh
look fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall want me on
im the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog
like i should fall in line
like i should alert niggas when im bout to drop somethin crazy
and not say im the greatest of my generation
like i should be dressing different
like i should be less aggressive and pessimistic
like i should be way more nervous and less dismissive
like i should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
like i didnt study the game to the letter
and understand that im not doin it the same
man im doing it better
like i didnt make that clearer this year
like i should feel i dont know guilty for saying that
they should put a couple more mirrors in here so i can stare at myself
these are usually just some thoughts that i would share with myself
but i thought fuck it its worth it to share em
with someone else other than paris for once
i text her from time to time she a mom now
i guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
i told her she could live with me if she need to i got a compound
but i think shes straight
cause she supported since hot beats
right before wayne came and got me out of the back room
where i was rapping with jas over beats that i shouldnt have
in the hopes for the glory
he walked right past in the hallway
three months later im his artist
he probably wouldnt remember that story
but that shit stick with me always
couldnt believe when he called me
you never know what could happen to you
and i just spent four ferraris all on a brand new bugatti
and did that shit cause its somethin to do
yeah i guess thats just who i became dawg
nothing was the same dawg370embed"
