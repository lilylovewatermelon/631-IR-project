all of the astronauts champagne in plastic cups
waiting for the big hero to show
outside the door he stands his head in his hands
and his heart in his throat

prechorus
what can he tell em now sorry i let you down
sorry it wasnt quite true
but dont get hung up on it just soldier on with it
and good luck with shootin the moon

chorus
shootin the moon
shootin the moon
the moon
shootin the moon

verse 2
all of the principals generals admirals
and the podium lit with the spotlight
the crowd buzzing quietly waiting expectantly
like its opening night

prechorus
what can he tell em now sorry i let you down
sorry it wasnt quite true
but dont get hung up on it just soldier on with it
and good luck with shootin the moon
