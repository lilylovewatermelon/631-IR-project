well i walked up to the bar
i laid down my platinum card
then i ordered fifty longnecks
for my new friends thanks kenny

verse 2
well the barmaid passed them out
and before we chugged them down
i held mine up said heres to us and then

verse 3
well this blonde slid up to me
said that was awful sweet
then i saw her boyfriend
as wide as he was tall

verse 4
well he broke up our hug
with a six foot five inch shove
and i found myself slammed up
against the wall

why does everybody want
to kick my ass
im just trying to have a little fun
for all the ones who cant

and just because i kiss the prettiest girls
and i drive my truck too fast

well ive never been the type
to walk up and pick a fight
ive always been the kind
to get along

verse 6
i throw parties all the time
and there always on my dime
we drink and dance and smoke
until the dawn

verse 7
well my style of stress relief
sometimes disturbs the peace
the police show up
and cut donuts in my yard

verse 8
and while the zeppelins playing loud
they run off my party crowd
they cuff my wrists
and throw me down so hard
prechorus
why does everybody want
to kick my ass
im just trying to have a little fun
for all the ones who cant
