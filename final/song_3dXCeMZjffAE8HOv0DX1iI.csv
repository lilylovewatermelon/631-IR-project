yeah you can try to love your woman try to love your friends
try to love your neighbor you can try it again
try to go to church try to live your life
probably still be trying on the day that you die

roll up your sleeves dont tell me that you cant
make something something if youre trying you aint

try it when no one else is even watching but you
try just a little try it too much
try an over do it and it still aint enough

make something something if youre trying you aint
