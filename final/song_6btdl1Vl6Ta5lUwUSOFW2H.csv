i wanna run away
dont wanna lie i dont want a life

id rather run away
dont wanna lie i dont want a life
send me a gun and ill see the sun

postchorus
you need an instant ease
from your life where you got plenty
of every hurt and heartbreak oh
you just take it all to the face
i know that you want to cry
but theres much more to life than dyin
over your past mistakes oh
and people who threw dirt on your name

verse
since ten i been feelin lonely
had friends but they was pickin on me
always thinkin why my lips so big
was i too dark can they sense my fears
these gay thoughts would always haunt me
i prayed god would take it from me
its hard for you when youre fightin
and nobody knows it when youre silent
id be by the phone
stanning nicki mornin into dawn
only place i felt like i belonged
strangers make you feel so loved you know
and im happy by the way
that i made that jump that leap of faith
im happy that it all worked out for me
ima make my fans so proud of me oh
