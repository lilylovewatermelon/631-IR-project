this is a dark parade
another rough patch to rain on
to rain on
i know your friends may say
this is a cause for celebration
hip hip hooray love

prechorus
photographs in sepia tones
so still the fires barely fighting the cold
alone
there are times when i can feel your ghost
just when im almost letting you go
the cards were stacked against us both

chorus
i will always love you for what its worth
well never fade like graffiti on the overpass
and i know time may change the way you think of us
but ill remember the way we were
you were the first fullstop love that will never leave
baby you will never be lost on me

verse 2
this is a goddamn shame
i never wanted to break it
leave us tainted
know i should walk away
but i just cant replace us
or even erase us

the car was stuck the engine stalled
and both of us got caught out in the snow
alone
there were times when i forget the lows
and think the highs were all that wed ever known
the cards were stacked against us both

chorus
i will always love you for what its worth
well never fade like graffiti on the overpass
and i know time may change the way you think of us
but ill remember the way we were
you were the first fullstop love that will never leave
baby you will never be lost on me

postchorus
lost on me
baby you will never be lost on me
lost on me
