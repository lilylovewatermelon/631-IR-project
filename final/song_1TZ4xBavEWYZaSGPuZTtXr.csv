clear creeks and cool mountain mornins
honest work out in the field
cornbread in my mamas kitchen
daddy sayin grace before the meal

prechorus 1
family ties run deep in this land
and im never very far from what i am

chorus
i was born country and thats what ill always be
like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free
i got a hundred years of down home runnin through my blood
i was born country and this countrys what i love

verse 2
moonlight and you here beside me
crickets serenadin in the yard
what more could two people ask for
layin here in love beneath the stars

prechorus 2

just the way my mom and daddy did
