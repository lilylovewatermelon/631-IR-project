verse 1
in the morning light let my roots take flight
watch me fall above like a vicious dove
they dont see me come who can blame them
they never seem to catch my eye
but ive never wondered why

prechorus
i wont fall asleep
i wont fall asleep

chorus
hey yeah dont let em know were coming
hey yeah tiptoe higher
take some time to simmer down keep your head down low
hey yeah tiptoe higher

verse 2
from your slanted view see the morning dew
sink into the soil watch the water boil
they wont see me run who can blame them
they never look to see me fly
so ive never had to lie
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likeprechorus
i wont fall asleep
i wont fall asleep

chorus
hey yeah dont let em know were coming
hey yeah tiptoe higher
take some time to simmer down keep your head down low
hey yeah tiptoe higher

bridge
nobody else
nobody else
nobody else can take me higher
nobody else can take me higher
nobody else can take me higher
nobody else

chorus
hey yeah dont let em know were coming
hey yeah tiptoe higher
take some time to simmer down keep your head down low
hey yeah tiptoe higher
hey yeah dont let em know were coming
