verse 1 travie mccoy
we both knew this type of life didnt come with instructions no
so im trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
and sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
when you call and i dont even know what city im at
or what day of the week in the middle of the month
in a year i dont recall
its like my lifes on repeat and the last time we spoke i told you i wouldnt be long
that was last november now decembers almost gone
id apologize but i dont realize what im doing wrong
i never know

chorus neon hitch  travie mccoy
i dont know where youre going
or when youre coming home
i left the keys under the mat to our front door thats love yeah
for one more chance to hold you close
i dont know where youre going uhhuh okay whats that
