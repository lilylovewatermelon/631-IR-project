take my hand and rock it real slow
i wanna feel your love tonight
lets put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
im all about us tonight
ooh im scared to fall in love again
ooh im scared to fall in love again

verse 1
yeah tried to give you everything i was thinking wedding ring
you were cheating every chance you got while i was faithful
then you went with who you told me not to worry bout
now you got a baby with him damn that couldve been me
cant say that i hate you if i had the money
that i have now i wouldve taken you away from
everything that killed us would have seen the real us
now im scared of falling in love again

chorus
take my hand and rock it real slow
i wanna feel your love tonight
lets put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
im all about us tonight
ooh im scared to fall in love again
ooh im scared to fall in love again

yeah tryna help you see the truth
but you prolly wont look
i just wanna hear your story
like a audio book
you knew me before my ex yeah
we stayed at the w yeah
better not fuck my name up
like a substitute yeah
i can tell you wanna do it but you dont know how to do it
cause youre scared to death
you can tell i wanna do it but i dont know how to do it
cause im scared to death
we should grab each others hands and take a jump off the cliff
and hope we fly
then you pause and i pause and we look at each other
but we both know why

chorus
take my hand and rock it real slow
i wanna feel your love tonight
lets put the world on pause and get drunk off these city lights
im all about us tonight
ooh im scared to fall in love again
ooh im scared to fall in love again10embed"
