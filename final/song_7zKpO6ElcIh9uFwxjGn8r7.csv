dust begins to fall to the ground
and you sit there and do nothing
the air is cold and thin
youre content with doing nothing
thoughts are haunting me as i look around
but in my life i wanted more
this will never end this will never end
when ill bleed forever

chorus
dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far  its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

verse 2
outside shell is strong  confident
there is nowhere to run and hide
but slowly eats away
stuck alone inside your head
like a man plagued with disease i try to fight
guess youre better off dead
through my pores it seems to seep
your mind bleeding
when ill bleed forever

dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far  its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

bridge
and you sit there and do nothing
youre content with doing nothing

verse 3
theres nowhere to run and hide
when youre living to die
stuck alone inside your head
better off dead
the phone would ring in the empty house
no ones around

chorus
dont acknowledge right just dwell on wrong
this spot in hells where i belong
ive come so far  its been so long
dont know why it started or where it came from

outro
but in my life i wanted more
i needed more i taste moreembed"
