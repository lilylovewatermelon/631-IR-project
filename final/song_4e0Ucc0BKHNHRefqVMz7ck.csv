verse 1
country boys and city girls
travelling to a foreign world world
oh da vinci riot police
cold war preacher on your street alone alone

prechorus
it started when your mother was young
in every song your father sung
you take it and you make it your own

so bind your heart in back with love
carry on carry on
many other roads yet to run
so bind your heart in back with love
carry on carry on
