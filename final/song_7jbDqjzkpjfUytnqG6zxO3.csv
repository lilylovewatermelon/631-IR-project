ooh

verse
i break it by god your face
awakened two eyes ballooning
open sesame

prechorus
super silence in the quiet eye inside the storm
water from your broken iris fell toward the floor
everything waiting shakin as it drops
i tried for you and i for too hard for too long
gave it all and everything for more time but i lost

chorus
ooh were breakin down
whispers would deafen me now
you dont make a sound
heartbreak was never so loud

break
ooh

chorus
ooh im breakin down
whispers would deafen me now
you dont make a sound
heartbreak was never so loud
you might also likebridge
two hearts foldin
pulling everything

chorus
ooh im breakin down
whispers would deafen me now
you dont make a sound
heartbreak was never so loud

outro
ooh im breakin down
whispers would deafen me now
you dont make a sound
its all so incredibly loud
its all so incredibly loud9embed"
