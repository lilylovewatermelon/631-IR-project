is there nothing left to keep myself awake
to keep the walls from caving in
when all they ever do is try to bend and break
is there forgiveness in the end

prechorus
i need relief a failures coming on
just breathe in deep its taking far too long

chorus
i had you in my grip but youre starting to slip
bring out the worst in me
and now its come to end i think im giving in
you set my demons free

verse 2
it seems no matter where i look its always gone
with you i know ill never win
and its hard to say where it went so wrong
and failed me in the end

prechorus
i need relief a failures coming on
just breathe in deep its taking far too long
i need relief this weakness carries on
please be a dream or was it all along

i had you in my grip but youre starting to slip
bring out the worst in me
and now its come to end i think im giving in

bridge
its better when youre with me but thats better left unsaid
its better when im empty but i still let you in
its better when youre with me but thats better left unsaid
its better when im empty but i still let you in

chorus
i had you in my grip but youre starting to slip
bring out the worst in me
and now its come to end i think im giving in
you set my demons free
i had you in my grip but youre starting to slip
bring out the worst in me
