reberu rajio
“loss”
¡la última noche
“me”
and we will see how godless a nation we have become
em sseug dnoces em tset tnod

verse 1
raise your hands now to testify
your confession will be crucified
youre a sacrificial suicide
like a dog thats been sodomized well
stand up all the white boys
sit down and the black girls
stand up youre the soldiers
sit down of the new world

prechorus
put your faith in a miracle
and its nondenominational
join the choir well be singin
in the church of wishful thinkin

chorus
a fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
the sirens of decay
will infiltrate the faith fanatics
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeverse 2
oh bless me lord for i have sinned
its been a lifetime since i last confessed
i threw my crutches in the river of a shadow of doubt
and ill be dressed up in my sunday best

prechorus
say a prayer for the family
drop a coin for humanity
aint this uniform so flatterin
i never asked you a goddamn thing

chorus
a fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
the sirens of decay
will infiltrate the faith fanatics

bridge
dont test me
secondguess me
protest me you will disappear

prechorus
i wanna know whos allowed to breed
all the dogs who never learned to read
the missionary politicians
and the cops of the new religion
interlude

chorus
a fire burns today
of blasphemy and genocide
the sirens of decay
will infiltrate the inside
