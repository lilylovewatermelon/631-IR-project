came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin
but dont think i ever stopped
to think that i was speakin to children
everything was happenin so fast
it was like i blinked—sold three million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous
‘cause i was gettin sick of this feelin
like im always under attack man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin
women dishin but really thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess im a little bit of a hypocrite when im rippin shit
but since when did this many people ever give a shit
what i had to say its just my opinion
if it contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rear end
thats why every time you mentioned a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it
‘cause it gave me an enormous platform
im flattered you thought i was that important
but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed
attaboy they told me to slow down id just zone out
good luck tryin to convince a blonde
its like tellin gwen stefani she sold out
‘cause i was tryna leave no doubt
in anyones mind one day id go down in history
think they know now because everybody knows
you might also likechorus skylar grey
everybody knows
that youre just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows
so dont pretend to be nice
theres no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows

interlude eminem
thanks for the support asshole scratch
thanks for the support asshole

verse 2 eminem
quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he roundabout
dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history well goddamn honky
that compliments like backhandin a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah im off him
but what the fucks all this trashtalkin about
the fight was fixed im back and you cant stop me
you knocked me down i went down for the count
i fell but the fans caught me and now
youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
to take my belt—word to pacquiao
momma said there aint nothin else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock em out
or you better not come out
its poetry in motion
like freddie roach when hes quotin shakespeare
so what if insults are revoltin
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think its a joke til youre bulletriddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles not that man
half of you dont got the guts intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts
and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo
my souls escapin through this asshole that is gapin
a black hole and im swallowin this track whole
better pack toilet paper but im takin no crap ho
here i go down the bat pole
and im changin back into that old maniac
in fact there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin
‘cause everybody knows
chorus skylar grey
everybody knows
that youre just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows
so dont pretend to be nice
theres no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows

verse 3 eminem
holy mackerel im the biggest jerk on the planet earth
i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin magnets work
‘cause youre attractive but we aint attractable
hate to be dramatical but im not romantical
im makin up words so you can understandable its tragical
thinkin some magical shits gonna happen that aint practical
you crackin a joke its laughable
‘cause me and loves like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault
so its safe to say im uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded full body armor
bitch you just need a helmet
‘cause if you think youre special youre retarded
thinkin youre one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
youre a train wreck i got a onetrack mind
shorty youre fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent
‘cause all of my spare time is spent
on my nose in this binder so dont bother tryin
only women that i love are my daughters
but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget im a father
and i push it farther
so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
its apparent i shouldnt have been a parent
ill never grow up so to hell with your parents
and motherfuck father time
it aint never gonna stop a pessimist
who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if im halfdead im halfalive
poured my halfempty glass in a cup
now my cup has runneth over
and im bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin coaster
i’m goin back to what got me here
yeah cocky and can’t knock bein rude off so fear not my dear
and dry up your teardrops im here
white americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself because youre one too
shouldnt be a shock because everybody knows
chorus skylar grey
everybody knows
that youre just an asshole
everywhere that you go
people wanna go home everyone knows
everybody knows
so dont pretend to be nice
theres no place you can hide
you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows131embed"
