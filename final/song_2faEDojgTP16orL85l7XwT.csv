seconds move as fast as the hours do
in between the world i dont have with you
here in all the miles that we used to share
my heart is still there

prechorus
if you found some other love than me
it would tear this one completely
will you still need me
how will we carry on and on and on

chorus
now that winter’s falling
all of the color’s gone
when the summer stops
with the beat of my heart my heart
days pass by
fade all the clouds apart
last raindrop
with the beat of my heart my heart

verse 2
strike away the fears hidden ‘round in me
they’re eating up the truth of our memory
keep in mind the words so they don’t give way
that’s what we both say
