if you hate the taste of wine
why do you drink it til youre blind
and if you swear that theres no truth and who cares
how come you say it like youre right
why are you scared to dream of god
when its salvation that you want
see stars that clear have been dead for years
but the idea just lives on
in our wheels that roll around
as we move over the ground
and all day it seems weve been in between
a past and future town

prechorus
we are nowhere and its now
we are nowhere and its now

chorus
and like a ten minute dream in the passenger seat
while the world was flying by
i havent been gone very long
but it feels like a lifetime

bridge
ive been sleeping so strange at night
sideeffects they dont advertise
ive been sleeping so strange
with a head full of pesticide

i got no plans and too much time
i feel too restless to unwind
im always lost in thought as i walk the block
to my favorite neon sign
where the waitress looks concerned
but she never says a word
just turns the jukebox on and we hum along
and i smile back at her
and my friend comes after work
when the features start to blur
she says these bars are filled of things that kill
by now you probably should have learned

prechorus
did you forget that yellow bird
how could you forget your yellow bird

chorus
and she took a small silver wreath and pinned it onto me
she said this one will bring you love
and i dont know if its true
but i keep it for good luck8embed"
