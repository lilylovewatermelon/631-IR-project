paint the target we dont need no evidence
flood the market we do it all in self defense
youre a smart kid never work without your gloves
if youre a smart kid youll stay the hell away from love

prechorus
and if it comes to murder
dont tell and we wont

ask you how you sleep at night
when the lights go out and youre all alone
with all the ghosts of lesser humans
whose lives youve spilt to suit your own

verse 2
sit and think of all the dollars and the cents
and your blue blood youll see it all makes perfect sense
drink from this cup a better life awaits us all
youre one of us remember conscience comes before the fall

chorus
ask you how you sleep at night
