shes gone away but still they stay together
people call him crazy crazy
his thoughts progress he thinks about forever
his mind tells him maybe maybe

chorus
i wish i could drive away to the sunset
back to the day that we first met
only believe the things i wrote
ill put it in a note yeah
ill cross my ts and dot my is
better say hello dont you dare say goodbye
ill write sincerely yours and sign my name
ps i love you forever and today

verse 2
and now shes gone they couldnt stay together
the rain falls down now hes crying crying
two weeks go by seems like its been forever
their hearts are bound now shes lying lying

chorus
