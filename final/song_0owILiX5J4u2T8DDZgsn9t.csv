she said i dont recall
seeing you around here
you must be new to this town
said im just passing through
but girl from the looks of you
i could see me settling down

chorus
then she smiled and said the invitations open
cause you look just like what ive been waiting on
so i said why dont we take this matter somewhere else
and get to know this feeling thats so strong
lead on

verse 2
she said i had a love once
but he just up and left me
i said i bet it broke your heart
i had a love once too
but i acted like a fool
oh what id give to be back in her arms

chorus
then she smiled and said the invitations open
cause you look just like what ive been waiting on
so i said why dont we take this matter somewhere else
and pick up right where everything went wrong
