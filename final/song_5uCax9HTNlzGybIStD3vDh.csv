i met you in the dark you lit me up
you made me feel as though i was enough
we danced the night away we drank too much
i held your hair back when you were throwin up

prechorus
then you smiled over your shoulder
for a minute i was stonecold sober
i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest

chorus
i knew i loved you then but youd never know
cause i played it cool when i was scared of letting go
i knew i needed you but i never showed
but i wanna stay with you until were grey and old

postchorus
just say you wont let go
just say you wont let go

verse 2
ill wake you up with some breakfast in bed
ill bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
and ill take the kids to school wave them goodbye
and ill thank my lucky stars for that night

and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that every day youll get better
you make me feel this way somehow

im so in love with you and i hope you know
darlin your love is more than worth its weight in gold

i wanna live with you even when were ghosts
cause you were always there for me when i needed you most

that its just you and me till were grey and old
