ah ah fuck me good baby
you better than any man before
ah ah fuck me good baby

verse 1
my bitch can tell that im addicted to pussy she lookin past it
the smile that she fakin is tragic hate lookin at it
that magic i try to grasp it shes had it with the dramatics
fantasize of love so classic
attracted to what she got up in her attic can we mind fuck
do i lie when i look inside her eyes hush dont say a word
i know i make you hurt sorry is my favorite word
i dont deserve your trust but can we make it work
i hate to end the story can we wait until the morning to decide on it
spend this time pretendin it was that first summer
we was pure lovers
she was used to bein hurt i took that curse from her
sometimes i wonder what its all for you wish that i would call more
youre sick of seein condoms in my sock drawer
love turns to war so quickly i envisioned us married and fifty
couple of kids that we drop off at little league
im addicted to you you only want the best i need to listen to you
im fuckin other girls wishin its you yeah
fuck the bullshit we in love
im a mess but can you clean me up

verse 2
yeah um
and i see you fallin victim to the thirst
all the sins you committed you could prolly use a couple minutes in church
but for what its worth i think youre perfect
theres an angel hidin underneath your surface
yeah the woman of my dreams im lookin at her sleep
the pussy right in front of me i shouldnt be so weak
what did i do to deserve a love like this
you see her shinin thats my sunlight bitch
im sick of fightin that smile is so invitin
i see you every time im writin
im losin to all my vices they kickin my ass
i hold on to this feelin i wish it would last
dont wanna lose you for some evil i did in the past
you knew i fucked that bitch and you didnt react
girl its me and you how simple is that
you gave me all your love now im givin it back
but i know that
chorus 2

every time you say you sorry everything you do just feel
like its rehearsed
