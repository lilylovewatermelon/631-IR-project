verse 1 fabolous
i said we the best at making this green
i swear mountain dew aint got nothing on my team
f is for the family that’s holding me down
i think niggas know who run this town
a is for the action i’m all about
blow a nigga head off kill all the doubt
b is for the big boys with the grown money
and bad bitches who aint gotta spend their own money
shots of tron at like 4 in the morn
it aint over til it’s over loso im gone

verse 2 mary j blige
the lights stay on they dont fade
ohhohhwhoaohh
take my last call don’t hold your breath
ohhohhwhoaohh
everyday make something outta nothing
move a mountain and still keep running
never come down make no mistakes

chorus mary j blige
they can say ayy ooh that my end is on the horizon
when i wake ooh all i see is the sun rising
just when you thought i said all there was to say
i get the last word it aint over til its over
just when you thought i did all there was to do
i give my best to you it aint over til it’s over

whoaohohohoh it aint over til it’s over
whoaohohohoh ohohoh ohoh ohh ohh

i smoke weed you sip on lean
people always sayin’ what the hell does that mean
j is for the justice i did to the game
lot of these niggas thats on is lame
a is for the way i airs em out
coupes by the two’s i pairs em out
ds for the dope that a nigga still pumping
twelve hour shifts got the spot still jumping
rocking on til the block is gone
38 is snubnosed but the choppers long

verse 4 mary j blige
and everything takes time so they say
ohhohhwhoaohh
what has been on my side everyday
ohhohhwhoaohh
every second gone is another way to come up
bend the corner crash into the jackpot
twists and turns i can take

chorus mary j blige
they can say ayy ooh that my end is on the horizon
when i wake ooh all i see is the sun rising
just when you thought i said all there was to say
i get the last word it aint over til its over
just when you thought i did all there was to do
i give my best to you it aint over til it’s over
