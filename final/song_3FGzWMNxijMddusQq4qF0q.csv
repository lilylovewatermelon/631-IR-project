verse 1
ive been rappin since the apparition
ggggod was gonna kill me and im glad he didnt
might have made a bad decision
he just left me with an ocean and a bad religion
while mary magdalene laughin smokin a pack of winstons
up on a church hill acid trippin with older men
as they tell her stories shes seducin em
but she only usin em
my studio is filled with spirits
and every single lyric dedicated to my dearest friends
yeah and lord knows that we hate the questions
so back and forth exchange faces over wine playin table tennis at dinner
i end up so bitter when i lose
defeat hurts i got scissors in my shoes
you might also likechorus
and im dancin
never got the steps right
loose i never slept tight
but ima keep dancin
yeah
yeah

verse 2
i did a cannonball off the deep end my boat was comin to america
pouch of fairy dust and a little poodle terrier
a silver derringer smile for the camera take a picture
split your line up like james farrior
ive always been a cowboy they need me like the cancer cure
weed loud as crowd noise we just let the amber burn
wiffle balls a childs toy aint fuckin with amateurs
im ken griffey on the mariners
okay im way beyond the boundaries outside of parameters
the rap chancellor jacket made of camel fur
and clockwork got every single answer cept time
ive experienced every feelin except fine
im line dancin again20embed"
