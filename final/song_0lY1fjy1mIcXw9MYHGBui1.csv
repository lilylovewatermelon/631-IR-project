you would give it all up in an instant
i bet youd torch your house with your own hands
youd let me break your back so you could lie in it and never get up
never get up from it
youre back into that smack
do you know you act just like a whore
beggin for crack or a sack
you think you revolutionize with every breath
you bring me down

chorus
does anybody know who the fuck you are
does anybody care how the fuck you are

breakdown
youre wasted now and youre gettin on down with the disco
youre wasted now and you think you want to leave but you dont go
youre wasted now and your pants have been soiled but you disco
youre wasted now and you think there was a point but you dont know

verse 2
you would take us all down with you if you would stab me in the back with your own hands
never turn around to see if im okay
ill always get up  get up in your face
youre one of the people everybody just loves to hate
just a person everybody else loves to blame
you think we care
well every breath you take just brings us down
you might also likechorus
does anybody know who the fuck you are
does anybody care how the fuck you are

outro
what was your point
you bring it back for me
those things i thought left me
that hate that greed
that bleeds me become the speed that feeds meembed"
