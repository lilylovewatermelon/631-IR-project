what do you do with a loving feeling
if the loving feeling makes you all alone
what do you do with a loving feeling
if they only love you when youre all alone

verse
holding hands under a table
meeting up in your bedroom
making love to other people
telling each other its all good

bridge
kisses like pink cotton candy
talking to everyone but me
im staying up late just in case
you come up and ask to leave with me

chorus
what do you do with a loving feeling
if the loving feeling makes you all alone
what do you do with a loving feeling
if they only love you when youre all alone
what do you do with a loving feeling
if the loving feeling makes you all alone
what do you do with a loving feeling
if they only love you when youre all alone
