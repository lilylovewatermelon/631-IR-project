im a cloud drifting by
dripping tears from the sky
im a snail without a shell
leper with a golden bell
ive got nowhere to go
im a stray cat on the roam
choking on a chicken bone
for a homesweet no sweet home

prechorus
for a root for a leaf for a branch for a tree
for something somebody that reminded them of me

chorus
running with my roots pulled up
caught me cold so they could cut
what there was left of love
im rootless im rootless

verse 2
working fingers to the bone
building castles out of snow
im a nomad walking on
humming to the same old song
lowercase society
tied to no community
a kingdom without a king
with no sense of belonging

for a root for a leaf for a branch for a tree
for something somebody that reminded them of me

chorus
running with my roots pulled up
caught me cold so they could cut
what there was left of love
im rootless im rootless

bridge
running with my roots pulled up
so they could cut me free of love

chorus
running with my roots pulled up
caught me cold so they could cut
what there was left of love
im rootless im rootless

outro
dragging my roots through the snow
no homesweet and no sweet home
ive got nowhere to go
