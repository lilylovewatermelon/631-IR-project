i can see clearly now that this is not a place for playing solitaire
tell me where you want me

seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare
let it rise before you
this is my crime

all in all and im loving every rise and fall
the sun will make and i will take breath to be sure of this
in the end and then all will be forgiven when
surrender rises high and i gave what i came to give

say it now because you never know
