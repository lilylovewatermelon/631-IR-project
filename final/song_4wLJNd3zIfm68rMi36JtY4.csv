leggin with the clip we dump it off like v radmanoviÄ‡
sorry homie you know we not friends its all for politics
politics never get to see who really runnin shit
now you know who runnin shit you rappers on punishment
poppa doc niggas they be lyin on they brother dick
everybody scared of lil linky man its evident
feelin like 50 way back in 03 aw geez
talkin bout goddamn they on some other shit
30whop screamin 44 on my louis shit
poppin tags by the mo niggas on their dummy shit
uhuh trade my slave noose for a gold noose
black and yellow goose with the boots and the jumpsuit
we shot a nigga at the gogo last week
we dont really care who got shot last week
ridin up the meter plug ya village bumpin migos
im past shit you dont want no problems with a g dc
pg im the king of the streets
i never had to struggle with the gangs in a beef
always ten toes so its hard to defeat
and trust me nigga i been lookin hard for a beat huh

verse 2
he aint rap this hard in a long time
ustreet poppin off vita dos and nines
muslim homies always sayin wallahi to the guys
all my life been addicted to the power aint gon lie yo
aint no fear im never wellin
put a shell up in yo
aint no tellin when we do it we just shoot and get ya
got a bad thing her name lala
ass wide with them tatas keep my mouth wide uh
northside bumpin norf norf what a day
when i was a baby i was wildin for respect
you gon get your head bust fuckin with the set
fuck around here and talk crazy you get wet
we ran so many niggas outta here
