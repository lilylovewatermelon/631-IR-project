can i wish on a star for another life
cause it feels like im all on my own tonight
and i find myself in pieces
there are pills on the table and a thought in my head
and i walk through the halls where i used to be led
my heart is filled with reasons

prechorus
im trying to be somebody else
im finding it hard to love myself
ive wanted to be somebody new
but that is impossible to do

chorus
im running out of my mind
is this really my life
im running out of time
is this really my life my life

verse 2
i could run from it all but id only get lost
oh ive walked on the bridge that i shouldnt have crossed
and i find myself a user
oh i wake every day with addictions to feed
they all call me a friend but ill never be freed
from the face of a faithless future

chorus
im running out of my mind

refrain
these years pass by and were growing older
and i think of you all weve made it through
some have passed away some have moved on
but im still here today im here today

refrain
these years pass by and i am growing older
and i think of you and all weve made it through
some have passed away theres no words to say
no second tries is this my life
and i think of you

chorus
im running out of my mind
is this really my life
im running out of time
is this really my life my life10embed"
