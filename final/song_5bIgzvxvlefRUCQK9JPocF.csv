someday im gonna live
in your house up on the hill
and when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
ill plant a garden in the yard then
theyre gluing roses on a flatbed
you should see it i mean thousands
i grew up here til it all went up in flames
except the notches in the door frame

chorus
i dont know when you got taller
see our reflection in the water
off a bridge at the huntington
i hopped the fence when i was seventeen
then i knew what i wanted

verse 2
and when i grow up im gonna look up
from my phone and see my life
and its gonna be just like my recurring dream
im at the movies i dont remember what im seeing
the screen turns into a tidal wave
then its a dorm room like a hedge maze
and when i find you
you touch my leg and i insist
but i wake up before we do it
you might also likechorus
i dont know how but im taller
it must be something in the water
everythings growing in our garden
you dont have to know that its haunted
the doctor put her hands over my liver
she told me my resentments getting smaller
no im not afraid of hard work
i get everything i want
i have everything i wanted25embed"
