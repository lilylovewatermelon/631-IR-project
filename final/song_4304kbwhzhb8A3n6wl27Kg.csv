oh oh oh oh oh

verse 1
you only hold me up like this
cause you dont know who i really am
sometimes i just want to know what its like to be you
were making out inside crashed cars
were sleeping through all our memories
i used to waste my time dreaming of being alive
now i only waste it dreaming of you

chorus
turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
cause all of our moves make up for the silence
and oh the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
like ill never be the same

verse 2
you only hold me up like this
cause you dont know who i really am
i used to waste my time on
waste my time on
waste my time dreaming of being alive
now i only waste it dreaming of you
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
cause all of our moves make up for the silence
and oh the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
like ill never be the same

ive got headaches and bad luck but they couldnt touch you no
ive got headaches and bad luck but they couldnt touch you no

turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
cause all of our moves make up for the silence
and oh the way your makeup stains
