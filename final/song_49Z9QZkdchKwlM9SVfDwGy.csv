style of your hair shape of your eyes and your nose
the way you stare as if you see right through to my soul
its your left hand and the way that its not quite big as your right
the way you stand in the mirror before we go out at night

prechorus
our quiet time
your beautiful mind

chorus
theyre all part of the list
things that i miss
things like your
funny little laugh or the way you smile
or the way we kiss
what i notice is this
i come up with
something new
every single time
that i sit and reminisce

verse 2
the way your sweet smell lingers when you leave a room you leave a room
stories you tell as we lay in bed all afternoon all afternoon
i dream you now every night in my mind is where we meet in my mind is where we meet
and when im awake staring at pictures of you asleep
