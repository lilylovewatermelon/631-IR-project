i crashed my car right into a tree
id risk my life for a chance youd come back to me yah
you called 999 then left me to bleed left me to bleed
i know youd never cause an accident for me

chorus
ill count the stars tonight

verse 2
so last valentines last valentines you spent it away spent it away
to be with a girl you said you never saw that way
it hurts now to smile it hurts more to breathe
it makes me so angry all i do is grit my teeth
i still let this man take over me
but i know that im not the one it should be
i should really take some tim–µ instead
to figure why this plays out again and again

chorus
