monday morning got my work boots on
my checkbook tells me that my money is gone
gotta little honey depending on me
to take her to town at the end of the week
well find a parking spot so we can reconnect
as soon as i get my friday paycheck
well get a chili cheese dog at the bowling lane
im still a working on that perfect game
maybe catch a movie when my arm goes numb
wrap it around her when the good part comes
i may look like an old redneck
but im a highroller with a friday paycheck

chorus
everybody knows i like to have a good time
i just got to stay above that poverty line
food on the table roof over head
leave something to my young guns when i wind up dead
you never know what life will throw at you next
im counting down the day til my friday paycheck

verse 2
wish i could tell the foreman when im under the gun
take this job and shove it son
i keep it to myself cause ive gotta get paid
and dance with my baby at the end of the day
im a yelling at the band when theyre doing sound check
why dont you give me some cash with my pppaycheck
everybody knows i like to have a good time
i just got to stay above that poverty line
food on the table roof over head
leave something to my young guns when i wind up dead
you never know what life will throw at you next
im counting down the day til my friday paycheck
