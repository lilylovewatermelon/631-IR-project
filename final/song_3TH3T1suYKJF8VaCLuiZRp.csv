well he was old school in overalls
tough as nails as i recall
he fought a war and came back home
honest as the day was long
and right before my grandpa died
he looked me right straight in the eyes
said heres some words to get you by
to help you on the journey of your life

youll need a hero
and a good dog
especially a good dog
a hammer and a handsaw
bandaid now and then
youll need a home to come home to
son we all need a refuge
on the straight and narrow path
you need to learn to bend
get a good square and keep it level
have grace to face the devil

chorus
you need an angel flying by your side
on the journey of your life
see jake owen liveget tickets as low as 138you might also likeverse 2
ride the wind til we meet again
on the other side of life
youll need some good luck and a bible
especially a bible
a lot of faith in god above
and a woman you can love
youll need a good song that you can sing on
and a shoulder you can lean on
and you gotta draw the line sometimes
when push comes to shove
youll need to lose some to be a winner
have courage to surrender youll need to
laugh a lot and keep it light
on the journey of your life

and no matter what dreams youre chasing
never get above your raising
may the simple things be amazing
on the journey of your life

chorus
you said ill be the angel flying by your side
on the journey of your lifeembed"
