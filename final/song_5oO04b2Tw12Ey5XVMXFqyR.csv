we can fight the fight all damn night
but in the morning light the lies reveal the truth
yeah the sober truth
we wake up to reality
and play the blame game ruthlessly
like it woulda turned out different
if we woulda stopped at one or two

chorus jon pardi  lauren alaina
but dont blame it on whiskey
no this aint about a drink
dont let alcohol take the fall
for all these thoughts i think
lets get down to the bottom
and not just the bottom of the glass
this heartbreak trains pickin up steam
and were standin on the track
yeah i can blame it on you
or you can blame it on me
but dont blame it on whiskey

verse 2 lauren alaina jon pardi  lauren alaina
