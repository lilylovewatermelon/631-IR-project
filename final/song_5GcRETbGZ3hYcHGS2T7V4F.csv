feel the beat feel the beat
feel the beat feel the beat
feel the beat feel the beat

spoken word
his world is suddenly filled with action and simplicity
there is no light but there is sound
it fills in great sluggish ways
not heard but felt through his hundred cells
the cells pulse separate contract
according to the rush of fluid
this is now the basis of this being
the flow  he is in his own blood

refrain
i can feel the beat
feel the beat feel the beatsee darude liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeembed"
