ive been drinking
with wolves dressed up as sheep
theyve been killing
injured creatures in their sleep
get some feelings
that truly bothers me
i can save them
i know i can

chorus
thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
honey thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck

verse 2
ive been lonely
ive been trying not to show
the pain you caused me
you really shut me down
like a butterfly
being stung to death by bees
thats an image no one wants to see

thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
honey thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck

bridge
its just another sunny day where im at
my head is in the clouds cause im stretching out my neck
i wake up in the morning to a protein shake
do twenty minutes calisthenics then im off into the day

chorus
thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
honey thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
oh thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
outro
and thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
and thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
and thats what you get
for sticking out your neck
and thats what you get
for sticking out your neckembed"
