down by the lake of mississippi
a boy was born poor and abandoned
and as he walked you could hear him yearning
for a home and he prays

verse 2
and by the fields he sang for rising
all for his faith and memorizing
all of the songs his mother learned
from the lord himself

chorus 1
heaven light a way for a fallen
let me ease the pain from my mother
but he feels the deception in his head

verse 3
another day was born and rising
and on the stool the boy was trying
to earn a coin for his mother and hoping
that freedom will lead her away

verse 4

for your mother and her wings
