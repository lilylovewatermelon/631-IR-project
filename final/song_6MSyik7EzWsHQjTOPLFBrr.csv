young nigga i was tryna get my money right
mama support the crib with my granny daddy servin life
breakin in my auntie room fore school i used a butter knife
teacher bitchin at me like her husband cant be fuckin right
wild niggas slidin round in tracks and srts
we stealin packs from the older cats to buy us new jordan 3s
i know a million niggas who millionaires off ppps
thats how we got the address to the opps
we were stained to make it out the hood well thats what we thought
rob kill or scam but never gon get caught thats just what we taught
no fist fight but first degree murders thats just what we fought
gotti told us never forget your dog and thats law
i got blamed for niggas dying i wonder why
they say i sacrificed to be in this position thats a lie
see the blogs cant break me down see im the voice i dont reply
but the rumors yall done heard ima humbly deny yeah yeah

i take everything i go through and i put it in these songs
i aint gon never go against you please correct me if im wrong

and you can say whatever you want to but you gon miss me when im gone
i be everywhere with it on free them runnin it up off of strong
aint not one of us get the loan aint never fell off i went broke before
damn that shit be crazy real niggas die for something a ho done told you
take whatever come with it dont show no emotion
im back in that mode bruh
i get impatient about that money whats the hold up
i gotta do this shit for my kids now they growin up
win lose or draw but no matter what it aint no hoing us
lookin at the phone i saw you callin
i am way too far to turn back now i swear im all in
i know it get rough but you stay tough and keep shit solid
the brabus truck got g800 on the back and it got stars in it
im just tryna show my young niggas they can ball too

i done ran up millions off this pain shit
i dont like to deal with her too much cause its the same shit
