guitar solo

verse 1
and if your heart stops beating
ill be here wondering
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life

prechorus
and if you get to heaven
ill be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life wont wait
then your heart cant take this

chorus
have you heard the news that youre dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldnt it be grand it aint exactly what you planned
and wouldnt it be great if we were dead

verse 2
tonguetied and oh so squeamish
you never fell in love
did you get what you deserve
the ending of your life

prechorus
and if you get to heaven
ill be here waiting babe
did you get what you deserve
the end and if your life wont wait
then your heart cant take this

chorus
have you heard the news that youre dead
no one ever had much nice to say
i think they never liked you anyway
oh take me from the hospital bed
wouldnt it be grand to take a pistol by the hand
and wouldnt it be great if we were dead

and in my honest observation during this operation
found a complication in your heart so long
cause now youve got
maybe just two weeks to live
is that the most the both of you can give
