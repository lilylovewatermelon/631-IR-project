verse 1 swifty mcvay  kon artis
you dont know mcvay and i doubt if you understand me
why would i give a fuck about you if we aint family
i roll with a chosen few and those of you thats behind me
witness the most coldest ferocious niggas that rhyme me
these bitches turn they back on you acting like they aint did shit
when you rapping never mix business up with your friendship
if you lacking up in this jungle then what you breathe for
niggass dont love you you got habits of breaking street codes
far as static i automatically get medieval
when im after people then ill explode you bitches with c4
these hoes have no insurance bodies get repo
making you vanish even when we aint got our heat close
keeping 44s where your hoes are swallowing deep throat
if you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep close
niggas pupils thats what i do im foolish will shoot you
cuz im coocoo but i dont think yo niggas be taking heed though

verse 3 obie trice  kon artis
ayo loyaltys first all the bullshit second
i showed you on the record «cheers» to who respect it
most of these niggas neglect it
even though its a known method
from the hectic hood that you slept in
you wanna be an exception
thats when the weapon is leaving you half steppin
with that caine in your left hand
obie from a section thatll stain up your flesh and
have you on bed rest
questioning your affection for streets
dtwizzie no question
one of the best groups that done it
and obie is their reflection
lil homie that know soley that loyalty is reppin
dtwizzie for yo life obie trice is second

verse 4 proof  kon artis
which one of you niggas wanna be bulsh and bump heads
when i got a passion for clapping with one hand

never leave the crib without packing my black burner
on some chi ali rapper to murk and have murder
incorporated hitman harry is at your service
reach for me one more gain and thats curtains
for life as d12 no ice and spreewells
every night that i chill in i fight by freewill
knowing i can be killed
leaving my group pieces of proof
with a reason to shoot and a license to ill
we lost bugz and ill be damned if we loose another man from our clan
without forcing our hand
extorting your family ill torture your granny
for my niggas im on your motherfucking yo porch with a cammy
