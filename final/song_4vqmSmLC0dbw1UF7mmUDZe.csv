i was lost now im found im sustained by the sound
of the angels singing me to sleep while my feet are leaving the ground
am i dead or am i dreaming instead
a cornucopia of opiates have flooded my head
im insane i am smart all it takes is a spark
to ignite my bad intentions and do what i do best to your heart
dont be fooled i was raised by the wolves
now the moon hangs in full so you know i wont play by the rules

prechorus
i will never spill
spill my blood for you
you have let me down
one too many times

chorus
someway somehow weve fallen out
caught in between my enemies
no way not now i wont back down
i draw the line at you and me
youre what i started now disregarded
one day theyll see it was always me

verse 2
due to mistakes i have made to the state
i am trapped inside a dillinger diligently thinking of ways
to get out of this god awful place i have learned that my fate
is something i cant escape so
sound the alarm what ive said from the start
is ill never let your system break me down or tear me apart
dont be fooled i was raised by the wolves
now the moon hangs in full so you know i wont play by the rules

i will never spill
spill my blood for you
you have let me down
one too many times

chorus
someway somehow weve fallen out
caught in between my enemies
no way not now i wont back down
i draw the line at you and me
youre what i started now disregarded
one day theyll see it was always me

bridge
this is the end of you
this is where i draw the line
and i wont lose
this war is mine
oh

prechorus
spill my blood for you
one too many times

chorus
someway somehow weve fallen out
caught in between my enemies
no way not now i wont back down
i draw the line at you and me
youre what i started now disregarded
one day theyll see it was always me
one day theyll see it was always me
it was always me5embed"
