sky on a break break down
ghost town shake down beach
good vibes blowin in that gulf shore breeze
saltwater skinny dip waitin on me
its hotter in the water good lord
aint no doubt bout to lay you down on a beach towel
california king style
gonna do it all night baby

chorus
big stars shinin over summerland
sunburnt love with a a southern man
baby right now im high as a kite
seabirds fly yeah i just might tonight
gypsy driftwood shiner bock kissin on the dock
big dipper slow dance
with my hands where the sun dont tan
dont you worry bout the sand
in no time baby well be slippin off to summerland

verse 2
lay it on back back to the back of that ragtop jeep
blame it on the waves we aint geting no sleep
fireside crackle kiss plant it on my cheek
lips on a bottle
i know you aint a model but you should be a model
im gonna kiss you to till tomorrow
and im gonna do it all night baby

big stars shinin over summerland
