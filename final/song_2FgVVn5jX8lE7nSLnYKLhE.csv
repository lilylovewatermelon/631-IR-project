we have one chance
one chance to get everything right
we have one chance one chance
and if were lucky we might
my friends my habits my family they mean so much to me
i just dont think that its right
ive seen so many ships sail in
just to head back out again and go off sinking

chorus
im just a box in a cage
im just a box in a cage
im just a box just a box in a cage
im just a box just a box in a cage
im just a box just a box in a cage
im just a box in a cage

verse 2

didnt get the joke
didnt mean to poke another
just to save myself from some something something or another one

im just a box just a box in a cage
