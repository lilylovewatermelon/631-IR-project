kidnap mr sandy claws
i wanna do it lets draw straws
jack said we should work together
three of a kind birds of a feather
now and forever la la la

chorus 1
kidnap the sandy claws lock him up real tight
throw away the key and then well
turn off all the lights

verse 2
first were going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait
when he comes asniffing we will
snap the trap and close the gate

wait ive got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man
lets pop him in a boiling pot
and when hes done well butter him up

chorus 2
kidnap the sandy claws
throw him in a box
bury him for ninety years
then see if he talks

then mr oogie boogie man
can take the whole thing over then
hell be so pleased i do declare
that he will cook him rare

i say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then
knock three times and when he anwers
sandy claws will be no more

youre so stupid think now
if we blow him up into smithereens
we may lose some pieces
and the jack will beat us black and green

chorus 3
kidnap the sandy claws
tie him in a bag
throw him in the ocean
then see if he is sad

verse 4
because mr oogie boogie is the meanest guy around
if i were on his boogie list id get out of town
hell be so pleased with our success
that hell reward us too i bet
perhaps hell make his special brew
of snake and spider stew

were his little henchmen
and we take our job with pride
we do our best to please him
and to stay on his good side

ive got something listen now
this one is real good youll see
well send a present to his door
upon therell be a note to read
now in the box well wait and hide
until his curiosity
entices him to look inside
and then well have him
one two three

chorus 4
kidnap the sandy claws beat him with a stick
lock him up for ninety years see what makes him tick

kidnap the sandy claws chop him into bits
mr oogie boogie is sure to get his kicks
kidnap the sandy claws see what we will see
lock him in a cage and then well throw away the key1embed"
