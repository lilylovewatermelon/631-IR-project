standing on the edge with you
all the things we said wed do
all the freckles on your face
tell me of your storied grace

prechorus
all the things i said to you
felt them in my heart so true
thousand miles from boy to fawn
but it didn’t feel that way at all

chorus
on and on and on
im yours
yours on and on and on
im yours

verse 2
standing on the edge with you
eyes of green and sky of blue
all the while you try and guess
as your heart beats through your chest

prechorus
is it real could it be true
sparks fly as i think of you
all the freckles on your face
tell me constellations don’t stay in space

of rosemary and daffodils
holding fast to notions grand
grateful to be here holding your hand
