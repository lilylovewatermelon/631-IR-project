i wont lie to you
i know hes just not right for you
and you can tell me if im off but i see it on your face
when you say that hes the one that you want
and youre spending all your time in this wrong situation
and anytime you want it to stop

chorus
i know i can treat you better than he can
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
tell me why are we wasting time
on all your wasted cryin
when you should be with me instead
i know i can treat you better
better than he can

verse 2
ill stop time for you
the second you say youd like me to
i just wanna give you the loving that youre missing
baby just to wake up with you
would be everything i need and this could be so different
tell me what you want to do

chorus
cause i know i can treat you better than he can
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
tell me why are we wasting time
on all your wasted cryin
when you should be with me instead
i know i can treat you better
better than he can
better than he can
you might also likebridge
give me a sign
take my hand well be fine
promise i wont let you down
just know that you dont
have to do this alone
promise ill never let you down

chorus
cause i know i can treat you better than he can
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
tell me why are we wasting time
on all your wasted cryin
when you should be with me instead
i know i can treat you better
better than he can
better than he can
better than he can120embed"
