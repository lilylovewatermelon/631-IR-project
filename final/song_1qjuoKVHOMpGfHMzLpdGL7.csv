dead from all the loneliness and this is how i feel
understanding everything has never been my deal
maybe you have crossed my path to live inside of me
or maybe youre the reason why im losing all my decency
chorus
but i believe that you and me
we could be so happy and free
inside a world of misery
and i believe that you and me
we could be so inside of you inside of me
cause this could be the one

refrain
this could be the one
this could be the one
this could be the one

verse 2
ive been lookin lookin lookin ive been lookin
ive been lookin for my mrs right but she dont exist
chemistry is everything and were anything but this
maybe i have crossed your path and swept you off your feet
or maybe im the reason why you cry at night before you sleep

but i believe that you and me
we could be so happy and free
inside a world of misery
and i believe that you and me
we could be so inside of you inside of me
cause this could be the one

refrain
this could be the one
this could be the one
this could be the one

bridge
but what do you think we could give it a try
cause you never know maybe we could be soul mates
but maybe not but maybe so
if you never try then youll never know
the grass could be greener
and it will always be greener on the other side
but you just never know
this could be the one

chorus
but i believe that you and me
we could be so happy and free
inside a world of misery
and i believe that you and me
we could be so inside of you inside of me
cause this could be the one
refrain
this could be the one
this could be the one
this could be the one

outro
but maybe so maybe so
but maybe not maybe not
who knows who knows

coda
if youre alone i know why
if you can hide then go hide away
but i want you to stay hey
and blow me away away
i want you to stay and blow me away away
if youre alone dont you cry
if you can hide then go hide away
i want you to stay and blow me away your way your way2embed"
