well i dont go to church enough
i curse out loud i drink too much
im more of a sinner than a saint
got a dusty bible on my shelf
i just pick it up when i need help
lord knows theres a lot i need to change

prechorus 1
and i want to
baby you make me want to

chorus
you tie the knot
when im at the end of my rope
you never stop
believin in me when i dont know
who i am
or what im supposed to be
i dont give you no good reason
but baby dont give up on me

verse 2
ive smoked my last cigarette
at least a hundred times i bet
i guess ill just keep quittin til it sticks
but for all the things ive failed to do
ive never failed at lovin you
we both know i cant grant your every wish

but i want to
baby you make me want to

chorus
you tie the knot
when im at the end of my rope
you never stop

but baby dont give up on me
