if you look around
the whole world is coming together now
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it
feel it in the air the wind is taking it everywhere
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it

all the colors of the world should be
lovin each other wholeheartedly
yes its all right
take my message to your brother and tell him twice
spread the word and try to teach the man
whos hating his brother when hate wont do
cause were all the same yes the blood inside me is inside you now tell me

can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it now tell me
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it

every breath you take
is someones death in another place
every healthy smile
is hunger and strife to another child
but the stars do shine
in promising salvation is near this time
can you feel it now
so brothers and sisters
show we know how
now tell me
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it
you might also likeall the children of the world should be
loving each other wholeheartedly
yes its all right
take my message to your brother and tell him twice
take the news to the marching men
who are killing their brothers when death wont do
cause were all the same
yes the blood inside my veins is inside of you now tell me
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel it
can you feel it can you feel it can you feel itembed"
