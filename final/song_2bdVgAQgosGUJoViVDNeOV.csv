verse 1
i just been goin through motions back and forth like a ocean
i am a fraud i am the shit hoping that nobody notice
bang chest in the morning head down in the night
drink less if i wanted strike up with the light
and square up i’m the mightest
myself in the fight hurt twice but i tried it
no advice for this shit might die for this shit
do i feel alive feel alive feel alive

chorus
feel more like limbo hands out my window
chasin that sunset thats more my tempo
yeah that’s more my tempo
ooh but this is all that i am
i only show you the best of me
the best of me
you might also likeverse 2
looked in my demons and saw myself
put all my meanin in someone else
outta sight outta mind dont know where to find it
dont know where to hide but i still
eat good drink good feel good sall good
cant hear my head when im sat beside ya
fucked lungs and a liver good looks in the mirror
do i feel alive feel alive feel alive

chorus
feel more like limbo hands out my window
chasin that sunset that’s more my tempo
that’s more my tempo
keshi ooh but this is all that i am
i only show you the best of me
the best of me
ooh tryin but i’m just a man
hopin it wont get the best of me
the best of me8embed"
