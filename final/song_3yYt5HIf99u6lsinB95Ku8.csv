you know when i was a little kid i idolized michael jackson

hook
black giuseppes on my feet i feel like michael jackson
see my life is like a movie but im not no actor
i smoke a wood into a doobie the weed make me happy
i hit the mall and blow a bag and get it back and stack it
black giuseppes on my feet i feel like michael jackson
moonwalkin in giuseppes like im michael jackson

verse 1
i smell like money so she put her hands on me
how you rich nigga you aint got no bands on you
bitch im from california and im smokin california
that mean my weed is very loud it got a strong aroma
moonwalkin in giuseppes she say neffy sexy
i just hit her with the digits told the bitch to text me
when she showed up to the crib i told the bitch to neck me
ordered her a luxury uber she pulled off in a lexus
how you finna stunt with no money you out here lookin naked
me and all my niggas one hunnid we out here gettin chicken
i just spent two bands on my feet im really giuseppe steppin
i dont leave the house with no tool i always stay with the weapon
