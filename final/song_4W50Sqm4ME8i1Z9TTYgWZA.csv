niggas really out here snitchin
still runnin round like they aint told nothin
real talk im scared of yall niggas
yallll get a nigga super bowl numbers
dont do it just for the money
you aint gon always get rewarded
when you one hundred dont nothin come with it
and when youre real you dont get nothin for it
long as them circles stay silent and loyal
what else is really important
watch me do this shit for all of my niggas
watch me get this money tellin my story
