slowly sinkin in the buds and the suds and the tone deaf singin
getting hillbilly high weve gotta little swerve in our stride
yeah were chain drinkin bar leanin chugluglugin
long as old joes slinging those beers on ice
til that well runs dry well be chain drinkin

some folks need a lot of nicotine to get their rocks off
some folks need a bag of wacky weed to get high
if youve got a short trigger
that old corn liquor shouldnt be your vice
ah but our addiction aint causin much friction tonight

were just chain drinkin
slowly sinkin in the buds and the suds and the tone deaf singin
getting hillbilly high weve gotta little swerve in our stride
yeah were chain drinkin bar leanin chugluglugin
long as old joes slinging those beers on ice
til that well runs dry well be chain drinkin

two for one times seven adds up to a big ole buzz
livin it up 12 ounces at a time
as long as theyre cold no we dont care what they got on tap
keepin em cool aint hard to do
when youre knockin em back to back

slowly sinkin in the buds and the suds and the tone deaf singin
getting hillbilly high weve gotta little swerve in our stride
yeah were chain drinkin bar leanin chugluglugin
long as old joes slinging those beers on ice
til that well runs dry well be chain drinkin

yeah were just chain drinkin
slowly sinkin in the buds and the suds and the tone deaf singin
getting hillbilly high weve gotta little swerve in our stride
yeah were chain drinkin bar leanin chugluglugin
long as old joes slinging those beers on ice
til that well runs dry well be chain drinkin
