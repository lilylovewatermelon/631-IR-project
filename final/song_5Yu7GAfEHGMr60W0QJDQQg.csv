waves crashing on her feet
standing in some rolled up jeans
making tracks in the sand
its like shes living in a photograph
but disappearing silouhette
flip flops in her hands

prechorus 1
and every kiss is burnt and hot
i cant let them go to waste
lets say the night is all that weve got
and im ready for the chase

chorus
we can be sundowners edge of towners
waiting on a spark
silent sounders come unwounders
tangled in the dark
like the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake
lets go out into the am
but tonight lets be some sundowners sundowners

verse 2
blue gives into the black
red lips just like a match
that sets me on fire
while the whole world falls asleep
every look that youre giving me
is taking me higher

and every kiss is burnt and hot
i cant let them go to waste
and once we start we cant stop
like 80 with no brakes

chrous
we can be sundowners edge of towners
waiting on a spark
silent sounders come unwounders
tangled in the dark
like the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake
lets go out into the am
but tonight lets be some sundowners sundowners

bridge
we can be the only two up
when they close down this town
lets just live it up til it comes back around
we can be sundowners
we can be come unwounders

chorus
sundowners edge of towners
waiting on a spark
silent sounders come unwounders
tangled in the dark
like the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake
lets go out until the am
but tonight lets be some sundowners
outro
lets just be some come unwounders
we can be some play it louders
gotta start sundowners
