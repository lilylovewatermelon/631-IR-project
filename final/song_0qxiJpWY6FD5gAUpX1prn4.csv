well every time i turn around
i see some dude dressed like a clown
baggy pants and a cap on sideways
they dont say maam or sir no more
they wont even hold a door for a woman
well its a crying shame

chorus
tell me where did all the good ole boys go
must be working on a farm
or out there chasing rainbows
are they back in oklahoma
or at a texas rodeo
tell me where did all the good ole boys go

verse 2
are they sitting on an old bar stool
telling lies and cutting the fool
talking about the way it was and wishing
or down in orange beach alabama
hanging out at the florabama
headed out the pass and going fishing

chorus
tell me where did all the good ole boys go
must be working on a farm
or out there chasing rainbows
are they hiding down in georgia
or at a texas rodeo
tell me where did all the good ole boys go
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeverse 3
are they driven cattle and riding high
living life the cowboy way
or down there on the front line
fighting off the bad guys
given them hell for the good ole usa

chorus
tell me where did all the good ole boys go
must be working on a farm
or out there chasing rainbows
are they back in oklahoma
or at a texas rodeo
tell me where did all the good ole boys go
yeah just where the hell did the good ole boys go

verse 4
i know where a few of them are
down there in southern oklahoma
theres even some down in texas
i even saw one in new york one time
you know what im talking about ladies
hell ill hold the door for you
ill hold your purse for you
and ill even go pick up some feminine products for you
thats what a good ole boy will doembed"
