id sell my soul just to see your face
and id break my bones just to heal your pain
in these times i need a saving grace
but time is running out and im starting to lose my faith

chorus
but if i told you i loved you would it make you wanna stay
im sorry for the way i hurt you and making you walk away
i shoulda took the time to tell you
and if i wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day
would it ever be enough
to make you wanna come back home and stay
i cant go another day without you
would it make you make you wanna stay
girl you gotta know i love you

verse 2
my hearts on my sleeve but its turning black
i guess i know what it feels like it to be alone
without your touch im not gonna last
i know you know that i need you just to carry on
it feels like my walls are caving in
you always wanted it more i left you hangin on
and ill do anything to have you here again

to make you wanna come back home and stay
i cant go another day without you

verse 3
yeah the days are cold the nights are long
and i cant stand to be alone
please know this is not your fault
and all i want is to tell you i love you and make you wanna stay
theres gotta be a way
cause goin on without you is killing me everyday

chorus
and if i wrote you a love song and sang it to you every day

to make you wanna come back home and stay
i cant go another day without you

would it make you make you wanna stay
i cant go another day without you
would it make you make you wanna stay11embed"
