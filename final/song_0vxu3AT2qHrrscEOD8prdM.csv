oh oh oh
where did she go
where did my love run
i want back the way it was

verse 1
i saw you in level
oh a bit of a rebel
and the dance of my lips were locked glued to yours
yeah they were
and do you believe it
and you cant deceive it
but love runs from my veins down to this day
and now im singing

chorus
oh oh oh
where did she go
where did my love run
i want  back the way it was
oh oh oh
give me the time
give me the clock cause
i want  back the way it was

cause love can be so blind
and i was just too kind
and she thinks im fake and everybody knows
and i was all for it
and then she stung like a hornet
when she sees me im sure it will be the last
now were singing

chorus
oh oh oh
where did she go
where did my love run
i want back the way it was
yeah yeah yeah
oh oh oh
give me the time
give me the clock cause
i want back the way it was
