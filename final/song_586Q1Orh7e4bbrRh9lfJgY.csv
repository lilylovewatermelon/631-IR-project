you said that youd never hurt me
be the bandaid when i bleed
but i guess that that bandaid was all made of paper
cause you never stuck to me
and you say that you conquered the lion without even tryin
but she only gets stronger
she only bites harder and i only die fighting

prechorus demi lovato
you can run
you can run but you know that i know just what youve done
you can run
you can run but save those words for one on one

chorus demi lovato
so when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
you should know that i wont back down
ill be waitin for you
knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
when youre hungry for the next round
ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh
mmm

yeah dont take things too personal but you made shit personal
talkin bout my bad habits
man fuck my bad habits
dont act like you got none

prechorus demi lovato
you can run
you can run but you know that i know just what youve done
you can run
you can run but save those words for one on one

chorus demi lovato
so when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
you should know that i wont back down
ill be waitin for you
knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
when youre hungry for the next round
ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh
mmm

verse 3 sirah
you got my name in your mouth
forgive me when i knock it out
i love it when you talk about me just cause you dont know yourself
my jabs gogo for broke
your teeth is on the floor
thirty million people watchin do you still want more
fake bitches gon get it
i am winnin but you isnt
call your dentist cause i meant this i dont see no competition
goin wild mikey tyson born a fighter i will triumph
bitch i thought you knew i was comin for your title
chorus demi lovato
so when the lights go down and the sun hits ground
you should know that i wont back down
ill be waitin for you
knuckles out and the guard in my mouth
when youre hungry for the next round
ill be waitin for you
ohoh ohohooh ill be waitin for you
