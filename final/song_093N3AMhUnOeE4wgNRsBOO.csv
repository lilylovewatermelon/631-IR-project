i will retire to the salton sea at the age of 23
for im starting to learn i may never be free
but though i may never be free
fuck you and your money im tired of your money

verse 2
and i sit on the curb cause its the prettiest night
with no one else in sight
you know i wore this dress for you
these killer heels for you
see the dark it moves
with every breath of the breeze
