triple 6 til death

chorus lil lonely
hold up wait—
hold up wait
all of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
one day i will forget their name
one day ill forget their name name name
hold up wait—
hold up wait
all of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
one day i will forget their name
one day ill forget their name name name

verse 1 lil remains
when i was 27 every night i had dreams to die
now im 28 feelin more dead than alive
29 in a month all my idols fuckin dead
got a check more or less just another problem what what what
bringin 400 degreez no limit cash money
half a milli bands in cash i feel like cash money
popped a xan couldnt tell you when i forget
fuck a friend all i need is crim and my kin ruby
days lookin grim goosebumps on my skin
hope the reaper comin hope my demise begin
fill my vein with heroin pokin through my skin
this is the end

hold up wait—
hold up wait
all of my heroes are rotting in their fucking graves
one day i will forget their name
one day ill forget their name name name

verse 2 lil lonely
one day ill become the same a pile of ashes forgotten in a vase
wrap my chain around the base and then put it on display
flashing lights they shine so brightly
til theres blackouts every night
see shattered glass rain from the sky
beware my drip ayy that shit so blinding
white gold blade on a bright gold chain
ruby da cherry been hated so why the fuck would i not stay the same
every step that ruby take is like he walking on a plank
let the waves crash down let them take me to my grave
aint no way my gang aint grey
thousands of people are shouting for uicide to save the day
roll up in the tank fuck the fame
remember my name until your memory fades
documenting the plague until my dying day
