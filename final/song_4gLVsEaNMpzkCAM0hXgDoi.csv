trippin out spinnin around
im underground i fell down
yeah i fell down
im freakin out where am i now
upside down and i cant stop it now

i ill get by
i ill survive
when the worlds crashin down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around
dont you try to stop me
i i wont cry

verse 2
ill play the game but i cant stay
ive got my head on straight and im not gonna change
im not gonna change
ill win the race keep up with the pace
todays the day that i start to pray
you cant get in my way no

chorus
i ill get by
i ill survive
when the worlds crashin down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around
dont you try to stop me
