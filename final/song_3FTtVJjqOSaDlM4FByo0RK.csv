one two three four

verse 1
johnnys in the drive and he’s drinkin again
rough crowd downtown but theyre all my friends
by the end of the night i won’t recall my name
well my levi jean queen ive been here all night see
someday ill take you somewhere it never rains
but for right now im tearin down this town
how being young is so painful and strange

verse 2
deborahs on the bar and shes dancin again
to an old folk song that reminds her of him
she ain’t gettin’ down til they carry her away
she was his levi jean queen but he’s long gone now see
end of the night shell get choked up by his name
and shell try her best just to let him go
but shes sick and tired of his rough and younger ways

chorus
lettin’ go movin on
keepin strong and finding god
i find it awfully odd we made it here
a few good friends on the longest night
gettin high until we cry
enjoyin all the pain of younger years
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 3
now im drunk and walkin home all alone my honey
lookin for a better place to spend my money
like takin my levi jean queen to see the stars
tougher than a lover and leaner than a fighter
looks to me we got another allnighter
i think god put us exactly where we are

chorus
lettin go movin on
keepin strong and finding god
i find it awfully odd we made it here
a few good friends on the longest night
gettin high until we cry
enjoyin all the pain of younger years
enjoyin all the pain of younger years

outro
johnnys in the drive and hes drinkin again
rough crowd downtown but theyre all my friends
by the end of the night i wont recall my nameembed"
