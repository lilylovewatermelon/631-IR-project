verse 1
why do i depend on you
six then im about to pull up
think about your body too much
im feeling you for real
missing the party for what
there aint nobody but us

prechorus
love me like im gonna die
fuck me like you fantasize
touch me like you know you provide to
aint one to lie to
just one to slide through oh

what i do makes me wonder if im alright
holding back feelings like its the end of my life
thats right youre killing me
thats right youre killing me

verse 2
te lo juro solo pienso en ti
cuando me tocas y me llamas vuelo

try to stop do you feel relaxed
love it when you make me feel like that oh
