verse 1 lupe fiasco
all in together the weather is better than ever
i hope it never ends i hope it lasts forever
but when it does we can all pretend that its
better than its ever been
lie to ourselves
like the skies well rebel
and its well and its fine
and its fine if they fell
and you can refine the storyline if you survive to retell
we all targets

interlude lupe fiasco
they said everythings gonna be fififine
said everythings gonna be oookay just dont breathe the air

verse 2 lupe fiasco
he just sits and waits for them to kick in the door
he once was a hero they dont love him no more
theres a blast every time a ten hits the floor
his gift for not fighting another mans war
and if they can get their hands on the mask
that he had wore on his face
they can put somebody else in his place to restore
the state the illusion that its safe
the faith that being a slave is so great
as gas fills the room
and rockets destroy everything around him
he stands to find himself surrounded
by thousands of soldiers that he once trained
to never miss their targets heartless
