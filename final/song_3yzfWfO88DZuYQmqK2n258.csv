never thought that id say
i wish i didnt love you ever since the first date
when you got close my heart would just stop
thought me and you together would end up on top
you changed me for better for worse
i know i was caught up always put you first
i never once thought you would be trifling
but oh i was blinded

prechorus
i was like oh oh oh
never wanna let you go go go
i was open before had me open before
but now i know

chorus
love made me blind so i couldnt see
all the lies you told were right in front of me
since love made me blind you made a fool of me
you made it look so perfect when it wasnt meant to be
your love made me blind

verse 2
i gave all of my trust
didnt think being faithful was asking too much
but im good glad that i know now
i was fooled but fate let me see how
they say every tear has its reasons
every smile has its own season
never once thought you would be trifling
but oh i was blinded

never wanna let you go go go
i was open before had me open before

chorus
love made me blind so i couldnt see
all the lies you told were right in front of me
since love made me blind you made a fool of me

love made me blind blind
your love made me blind blind

cause when i i felt your lips pressed against mine
thought the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
didnt know you were a beautiful liar
cause love made me blind

chorus
love made me blind so i couldnt see so i couldnt see

your love made me blind blind
your love made me blind blind
