verse 2
she loves me she loves me more
amour me she assures
she adores me
even when its up and down like seesaw
surely we can start from scratch like default
when they say youre not my baby like maury
you can tell em that theyre telling a story
testify like youre telling a jury
and ill repeat like you said it before me
we undefeated like a veteran army
and we as heavy as an elephant arent we
lets take em to the zoo or better yet a safari
they want me to leave my dame like the fella from marcy no
but we go way back like a set of ataris
from baby fat til we skeletons darling
me starring you is what it says on the marquee
so lets go give them a show on my heart get set go

go baby hoo hoo go baby hoo hoo

and youre my surefire superstar sureshot firecracker
extravaganza fantastic supersize with extra cheese

that youre my surefire superstar sureshot firecracker
extravaganza fantastic supersize with extra cheese
