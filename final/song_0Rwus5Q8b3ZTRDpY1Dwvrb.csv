one boy one girl two hearts their world
time goes by secrets rise
one more sad song tears shed shes gone
shed take it back if she only could

prechorus
and all the perfect words they seem so wrong
shes gone
you wish that you could learn to see
the door is closed and you wish you could be

chorus
alone with you alone with me
what can i do i cannot breathe
my heart is torn for all to see
alone with you alone with me

verse 2
best friend worst thing shes been cheating
friend deceives she leaves
last date she cries whispers goodbye
she walks once more out that door

prechorus
and all the perfect words they seem so wrong
shes gone
you wish that you could learn to see
the door is closed and you wish you could be
