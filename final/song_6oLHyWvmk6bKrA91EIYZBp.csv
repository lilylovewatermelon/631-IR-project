verse 1 partynextdoor
been a minute since weve slept together
finna get myself together
ive been thinkin about everything
i dont know if its because im lonely
lonely on a wednesday night girl im lonely
ill admit it if you just keep quiet girl im lonely
that shit ain’t my fault girl cause im lonely

chorus partynextdoor
name another woman
aint no other woman that should comfort me when i’m lonely
mixing remy little bit of henny
im running on empty im lonely
when i’m lonely when i’m lonely

verse 2 partynextdoor
heard you spent your summers in miami
at somebody’s yacht that you didn’t buy
you’re young yeah have fun girl but i hope it was worth it
cause fuck it i’m not here to judge
fuck it i’m not here to love everything you did to ball
fuck it im just glad you called
ring ring ring what a thing
ring ring ring school bell i ring
you and i got options bae

aint no other woman that should comfort me when i’m lonely
mixing remy little bit of henny
im running on empty im lonely
when i’m lonely when i’m lonely
