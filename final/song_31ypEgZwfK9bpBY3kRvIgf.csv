i coated my house all in white
i got my paints i havent spend a night
on every inch your name i wrote oh

since youre gone ive been watching paint dry
since youre gone ive been watching paint dry
since youre gone ive been watching paint dry

verse 1
the modern office buildings are chasing the sun
and the wind is racing after the day
and everybodys chasing a beauty they dont have
and im woah im im chasing you

verse 2
the raindrops keep falling searching for a home
my televisions gasping for air
and everybodys searching searching for a reason
but im woah im searching for you

chorus
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you

verse 3
the militant commuters come waiting for the train
in the longest bavarian night
and everybodys waiting waiting for the sunrise
and im woah im waiting for you
you might also likeoutro
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you
we are only dreaming and im dreaming only of you3embed"
