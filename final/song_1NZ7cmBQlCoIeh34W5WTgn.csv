you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright

im on the run the devils tryin to get me
says i met him at a pawn shop down in mississippi
i was an angel lookin for another face
i must a bumped my fuckin head when i fell from grace
i found a place in the sun like stevie
and now i gotta wonder cause the rain dont believe me
i need to breathe take the money and run
i put my faith in one place and now im fuckin done

chorus
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright
see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeverse 1
i could a been a saint but i chose the wrong path
i aint no dummy take the money and laugh
i got the cash did the dash for the door
now im sittin on my stash and im feelin like a whore
im torn but cant think i blink so i miss
i move in strange ways i move to dismiss
ill leave this place and when i do thats it
i dont need to conclude so you can keep that shit

chorus
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright

verse 2
im headin south on old whiskey road
livin life like a story that doesnt need to be told
its getting old always runnin from the past
im lookin at myself in the bottom of a glass
i wont last my lights too dim
i seen the future and its lookin pretty grim
im gonna win but not like that
so im takin what i got and i aint never comin back
chorus
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alright
you put some whiskey in the water
gonna run off with your daughter
and if i make it to the border
im gonna be alrightembed"
