you are to me
a part of me just like anatomy
youre pulling me
youre pulling me in like youre gravity

refrain justin bieber
im notorious for thinking youre full of beautiful
instead of hollow
sugar on your lips it starts to kill
jagged like a pill so hard to swallow

chorus justin bieber  halsey
am i in love with you am i in love with you
or am i in love with the feeling
im trying to find the truth trying to find the truth
but sometimes the heart is deceiving
cant get out of my head and i need you to save me
if i am delusional then maybe im crazy
in love with you am i in love with you
or am i in love with the feeling

verse 2 justin bieber
you give to me
everything anything that i could dream
and at least thats what it seems
could it be i dont know whats good for me
