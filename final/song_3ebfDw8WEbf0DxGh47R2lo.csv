verse 1
i miss the days when i had a smile on my face and
wasnt so caught up in all of the small things
wasnt so adamant that i could handle everything alone
and wasnt so cautious and always exhausted
and actually listened to things that my heart said heart said
ridin my bike just ridin my bike
not overthinkin my life
not always wonderin if im a likable person
or someone that nobody likes
not always stressed about money or losin my job
or scared i aint makin a flight
not always goin to bed every night
with this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
what happened to me yeah what happened to me
when did i start to believe i wasnt worth it
then question my purpose to breathe
wonderin who i should be
happiness out of my reach
scared to get back on my feet
need to get rid of whats detrimental but its hard to let go
when the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
see i miss the days when i wasnt so faded
love wasnt always invasive i could embrace it
just innocent waitin not always livin in anguish
when did i break and become overtaken
what was the moment i caved and
gave away all of my faith and made a replacement
i miss the days when i miss the days whenâ€”

i miss the smiles we had when we were young oh
i miss the memories of feeling love oh
i miss us runnin underneath the sun oh
staring out the window when the rain would come oh
i miss the smiles we had when we were kids yeah oh
i feel like life was so much simpler then yeah oh
when we had joy and we were innocent oh
id give it all to feel that way again way again

verse 2
give me my mind back yeah
give me my mind back
the one that told me i was worth somethin when i fall flat
yeah fall flat
the one that told me i was worth somethin when im off track
back when my imagination wasnt in a cage and it was free to run fast
yeah give me my mind back
yeah give me my give me my mind back
before it was hijacked and wasnt described as
a place of limitation always indicating i cant
handle everything from my past
handed anything it dissects til im depressed
i know im blessed but im cursed too
take me back when i was happy but i wasnt actin
vulnerable but didnt see it like some kind of weakness
or a thing thats unattractive
had emotion but i learned to mask it
didnt know what i was runnin after
didnt know the older i would grow
the more id lose control and take in all the baggage
its really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes
everything you thought would take the sadness
really only made it deeper got me off the deep end askin
will we ever feel like we imagine
will we ever feel like we adapted
will we ever feel like we did back then
just take me back when just take me back when
