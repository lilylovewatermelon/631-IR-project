little bit tired little bit worn through the years
you sound nervous you seem alone
i hardly recognize your voice on the telephone

in between i remember
just before we wound up broken down
drive out to the edge of the highway
follow that lonesome deadend road sign south

chorus
were all in this thing together
walkin the line between faith and fear
this life dont last forever
when you cry taste the salt in your tears

come my friend lets put this thing together
and walk the path that worn out feet have trod
cause if you wanted we can go home forever
give up your jaded ways spell your name to god

chorus
all we are is a picture in a mirror
fancy shoes to grace our feet
all there is is a slow road to freedom
heaven above and the devil beneath
