tell em all im on vacation
say i went to visit friends
that you aint heard or seen from me in quite a while
when they ask you where ive been
tell em im out on the west coast
where it dont ever rain
and that im probably doing fine

chorus
just dont tell em ive gone crazy
that im still strung out over you
tell em anything you want to
just dont tell em all the truth
yeah dont tell em all the truth

verse 2
tell em all im out in vegas
blowing every dollar i ever made
tell em that i must be into something bad for me
cause i sure lost a lot of weight
tell em im out on the road
with some old rock and roll band
living like a gypsy king

chorus
just dont tell em ive gone crazy
that im still strung out over you
tell em anything you want to
just dont tell em all the truth
yeah dont tell em all the truth

and we both know that it aint right
