my soul is haunted
my heart is stolen
you cannot break what’s already broken
i cannot get back time that i borrowed
life is too short to fill all of the sorrow

chorus
i’m in this empty house
i’m not the only one that’s here
me and the spirits now
and the walls are closing in
i prayed for peace before all i know is war
i have battled the voices within
angels i used to know had to let them go
now they visit when fear is in the air

verse 2
my innocence taken tried to rеplaced it
chasing the same things that lеft me jaded
must have mistaken my courage for bravery
wasn’t prepared for the turmoil and hatred
where will you turn when your conscience is calling your name
memories burn
i just watch as they go up in flames

i’m in this empty house
i’m not the only one that’s here
me and the spirits now
and the walls are closing in
i prayed for peace before all i know is war
i have battled the voices within
angels i used to know had to let them go
now they visit when fear is in the air

verse 3
when i’m lonely i don’t feel alone
i can’t let go darkness is holding on
almost died before what i’m fighting for is the chance that i finally change i need peace
it’s so hard when my sins keep chasing me

chorus
i’m in this empty house
i’m not the only one that’s here
me and the spirits now
and the walls are closing in
i prayed for peace before all i know is war
i have battled the voices within
angels i used to know had to let them go
now they visit when fear is in the airembed"
