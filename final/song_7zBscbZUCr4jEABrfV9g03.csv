i dont know what you wanna hear
things changing course smiles fade to grin
now the moments gone just as i feared
and i was hoping and i was hoping this time

verse 2
no longer here we were feeling bliss
dont hold your tongue theres no time for tricks
youve been closing up i expected this
but i was hoping that youd stay open this time

chorus
i know it wont be long
i know youre almost gone
hold on let me in before the day is over
just let me in before the day is over

verse 3
say something soon we might lose it all
something we can use to break our fall
theres nothing left to do when we start to stall
and i was hoping that we could hold it this time

chorus
i know it wont be long
i know youre almost gone
hold on let me in before the day is over
just let me in before the day is over
let me in let me in
just let me in before the day is over

i cant take another day
i could go insane
theres only so much i can take
i cant live this way
i cant take another day
i could go insane
theres only so much i can take
i cant live this way

chorus
let me in let me in i know it wont be long
just let me in before the day is over i know youre almost gone
let me in let me in
just let me in before the day is over9embed"
