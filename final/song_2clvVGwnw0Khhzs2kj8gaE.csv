there was something in your eyes that i saw tonight
i never thought that i would see it
now theres holes in my walls and theres glass on the floor
and you said you didnt mean it
you went from zero to none in these past three months
on your level of affection
i aint gonna be that girl who cries herself to sleep
putting up with your rejection cause

chorus
i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this
i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this

verse 2
when i try to make sense out of what we have
i always fall into depression
because i know in my heart that weve both grown apart
aint no use in us pretending
we never talk on the phone and youre never at home
and if you are theres always tension
i aint gonna be that girl that ends up staying
sitting around and just regretting cause

i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this
i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this

bridge
im tired of fighting im tired of spiting
my life is a storm full of raining and lightning
my insides are bleeding from all of this screaming
sometimes i just feel like im no longer breathing
i look in your eyes all i see is a demon
im tired of wearing my heart on my sleeve and
i just dont know why i stay
cause day after day i continue to say

chorus
i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this
i cant carry on living life like this
this cant be what it is
i dont wanna live my life like this1embed"
