keep on haunting
keep on haunting me
keep on haunting
keep on haunting me

verse 1
i was as pure as a river
but now i think im possessed
you put a fever inside me
and ive been cold since you left
ive got a boyfriend now and hes made of gold
and youve got your own mistakes in a bed at home
im hoping you could save me now but you break and fold
youve got a fire inside but your hearts so cold

prechorus
cause ive done some things that i cant speak
and ive tried to wash you away but you just wont leave
so wont you take a breath and dive in deep
cause i came here so youd come for me

chorus
im begging you to keep on haunting
im begging you to keep on haunting me
im begging you to keep on haunting
i know youre gonna keep on haunting me

we walk as tall as the skyline
and we have roots like the trees
but then your eyes had to wander
cause they werent looking at me
you werent looking for me

prechorus
cause ive done some things that i cant speak
and ive tried to wash you away but you just wont leave
so wont you take a breath and dive in deep
cause i came here so youd come for me

chorus
im begging you to keep on haunting
im begging you to keep on haunting me
im begging you to keep on haunting
i know youre gonna keep on haunting me

bridge
cause ive done some things that i cant speak
and ive tried to wash you away but you just wont leave
so wont you take a breath and dive in deep
cause i came here so youd come for me

chorus
im begging you to keep on haunting
im begging you to keep on haunting me
im begging you to keep on haunting
i know youre gonna keep on haunting me28embed"
