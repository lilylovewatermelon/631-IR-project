running desperately low on food they were forced to turn back
well ill be
whats that villain doing
wait princess your voice sounds familiar
well it should—you see doom wants me to marry him
what
but after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world i despise him he intends to destroy all of us if i persist in refusing him even now

verse 1 angelika
sheitan never came so ill he got skill
met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
all thirty three nerves controlling my curves
common sense just swerved every time i got served
stress frustration empty rhetoric
cold as winter in connecticut compassion lacking deficit
thought it was love like sent from above you not a soulmate
more ways and actions of a primate
who by low and census coming faker than extensions
pissed away all good intentions outta here sister was missin
intuition maybe it was me i couldnt see
holding onto fantasy getting bitten by reality

hook 4ize
war wound purple heart love veteran
morphine pain killers drugs and medicine
anything just to forget the hurt
incoming take cover hit the dirt
on the frontline theres casualties in the mind
and the pows get left behind
mentally scarred for life love is war
and some chicks are just too hard to wife

i shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin the guinnesses
now im free falling cursing at the street bawling
he ceased calling no appetite for feast darling
so deep all in i bet he never stop balling women
forsake god for the sin of a man
sacrifice a whole life for a slice overstand
maybe its a lack of pigment loneliness imagine figment
only got the car tinted to pull extra gs in it
damn jody comin with the okie doke pokie poke
steady rockin boats got me aimin for ya throats
sniper scope werent we supposed to elope
propose then ya froze i dont think that i can cope

hook 4ize
war wound purple heart love veteran
morphine pain killers drugs and medicine
anything just to forget the hurt
incoming take cover hit the dirt
on the frontline theres casualties in the mind
and the pows get left behind
mentally scarred for life love is war
and some chicks are just too hard to wife

verse 3 angelika
constant frustration stemming from a nowin situation
rushing lust and fornication adding to the complication
patience is a virtue pain run deep when love desert you
listenin to whisperin choosing chaos over discipline
simpleton life should really be a piece of entenmann’s
relationships strengthening flower essence penstemon
gentlemen my favorite shit so ive never forsaken it
i persevere make it fit sculpting and reshaping it
taking sips off a fifth of it passionate
intense incense candles lit scandalous
emotional bandages why would he abandon this
guess he couldnt handle it the boss is magnanimous
hook 4ize
war wound purple heart love veteran
morphine pain killers drugs and medicine
anything just to forget the hurt
incoming take cover hit the dirt
on the frontline theres casualties in the mind
and the pows get left behind
mentally scarred for life love is war
and some chicks are just too hard to wife

outro samples
look there ya see
oh boy—here we go
how come all you college boys wear them faggottylooking white shoes—

—they look funny as hell
“that and them black knee stockings”

ah yes looks like she got burnt laces
you didnt wash your neck—sometimes we dont wash our necks but thats ok
oh i—i washed my neck take—take a look at my neck
hold it right there you
where youre going—there are no jokes
aw boy im beginning to think that armorplated gargoyle doesnt like me9embed"
