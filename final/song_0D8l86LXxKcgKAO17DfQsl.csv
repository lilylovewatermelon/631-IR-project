alrighty then
picture this if you will

verse 1
10 to 2 am x yogi dmt and a box of krispy kremes
in my need to know pose just outside of area 51
contemplating the whole chosen people thingy
when just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
cutting right angle donuts on a dime
and stopping right at my birkenstocks
and me yelping holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit
holy fucking shit

verse 2
then the xfile being
looking like some kind of bluegreen jackie chan
with isabella rossellini lips and breath that reeked of
vanilla chig champa
did a slowmo matrix descent
outta the butt end of the banana vessel
and hovered above my bugeyes my gaping jaw
and my sweaty l ron hubbard upper lip
and all i could think was
i hope uncle martin here doesnt notice
that i pissed my fuckin pants
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeverse 3
so light in his way like an apparition that
he had me crying out
fuck me its gotta be
the deadhead chemistry
the blotter got right on top of me
got me seein emotherfuckint

verse 4
and after calming me down
with some orange slices
and some fetal spooning
et revealed to me his singular purpose
he said you are the chosen one
the one who will deliver the message
a message of hope for those who choose to hear it
and a warning for those who do not
me the chosen one
they chose me
and i didnt even graduate from fuckin high school
refrain
youd better
youd better
youd better
youd better listen
verse 5
then he looked right through me
with somniferous almond eyes
dont even know what that means
must remember to write it down
this is so real
like the time dave floated away
see my heart is pounding
cause this shit never happens to me

verse 6
i cant breathe right now
it was so real
like i woke up in wonderland
all sorta terrifying
i dont wanna be all alone
while i tell this story
and can anyone tell me why
you all sound like peanuts parents
will i ever be coming down
this is so real
finally its my lucky day
see my heart is racing
cause this shit never happens to me

verse 7
i cant breathe right now
you believe me dont you
please believe what ive just said
see the dead aint touring
and this wasnt all in my head
see they took me by the hand
and invited me right in
then they showed me something
i dont even know where to begin
chorus
strapped down to my bed
feet cold and eyes red
im out of my head
am i alive am i dead
cant remember what they said
god damn shit the bed

bridge
overwhelmed as one would be placed in my position
such a heavy burden now to be the one
born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
to write it down for all the world to see
but i forgot my pen
shit the bed again
typical

chorus
strapped down to my bed
feet cold and eyes red
im out of my head
am i alive am i dead
sunkist and sudafed
gyroscopes and infrared
wont help im brain dead
cant remember what they said
god damn shit the bed

verse 8
i cant remember what they said to me
cant remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
cant remember what they said
bob help me
cant remember what they said

outro
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
dont know wont know
god damn shit the bed18embed"
