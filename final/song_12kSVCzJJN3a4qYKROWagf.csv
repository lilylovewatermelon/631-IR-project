verse 2dj paul
i ran up in his spot with the glock his jaw dropped
he knew i came for money  the weight i heard he got
i cracked him in the middle of his face with the tone
tied his ass up and ransacked his home
i had to rape his bitch cause the ho was stacked
i fucked her from the back with my gun to her back
i left up out his crib with dollar  purple hat
but eventually got caught because of a dick hair
verse 3juicy j
dont let me find out that you got that dope
dont let me find out that you snitching on folks
dont let me find out that you tryna get rich
