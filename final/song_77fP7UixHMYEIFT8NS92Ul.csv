intro
oh oh oh papers
oh oh oh papers

verse 1
i cant get to work on time
cant believe the words to her i just said
but who the hell argue and fight like dogs at 6 in the morning
i know its gonna be some more shh tonight oohh
our pastors calling telling me i done went too far
and im seen around town and my friends cant recognize me
cause i took a chance on love
its like im dying oooh dying

chorus
for you i gave my heart and turned my back against the world
cause you were my girl girl girl
i done damn near lost my mama i done been through so much drama
i done turned into the man that i never thought id be
im ready to sign them papers papers papers
i done took all i can take but you leave me no options girl
i cant deny how much i love you i done gave up everything i had to
as hard as it is im afraid i gotta say
im ready to sign them papers papers papers
i done took all i can take but you leave me no options girl
oh oh oh papers
oh oh oh papers

im losing my mind cant figure out whos wrong or right
i know its you i love but then i also know its you i dont like
you claim you hate who i was but thats the reason you here now
you think i dont know whats up but sweetheart thats what ruined us
i aint afraid to say i got needs but the only time you here for me
is when the bottles popping and everything is sweet
but i im tired of sleeping in the other room spending them long nights
trying to figure out what in the hell in my heart i aint do right

chorus
for you i gave my heart and turned my back against the world
