and i always knew id come far ever since i was a lil one droc

interlude

verse 1
went from stolo surfing to a own rolls
come from handmedowns to his own clothes
no facade he on it and he dont fold
couple niggas dead all behind songs

going through court behind a dirty game
cant let them see me and i dont got nothin
mama im a gangster please forgive me im so gone
life in danger they gon kill me dont do no runnin at all
i done got serious things done changed got that money standing tall
i dont need that range i just woke up and bought that car

ducking from bullets inside of my truck what the fuck
this a dirty game brought a lot of pain
they dont know the story so why should i feel shame
i dont want the glory i just want the finer things
new check for that money it been acclaimed
hold on she callin me
