verse 1
i go hop in the rental with two choppers and the glizzy
if they say that they want smoke
when i catch em i hop out and zip em

when i up it im shooting civilians
i can bet my whole bank thats on my name ima kill em
38 north side where we at north side

where you trap same place we creep at where we creep
til we shoot everyone we aint leavin
