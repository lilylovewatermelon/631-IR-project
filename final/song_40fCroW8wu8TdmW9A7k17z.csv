i wont let you bring me back bring me back
no i wont let you bring me back bring me back
you can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
but i wont let you bring me back bring me back down

verse 1
way back in 95 scraped knees tough love ah yea
grass stains were just a sign of the times
big kids look at us now too adult to say big whoop
letting any old bummer get under my hide

but ooh im gonna take control

chorus
i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
no i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps

verse 2
so ill walk that tightrope wire
but what am i really made of
scared of heights like im scared of falling in love

but ooh im gonna take control

chorus
because i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
no i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
you can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
but i wonâ€™t let you bring me back bring me back down

bridge
so think back to 95
and reach armslength deep ah yea
cause theyll try to pierce your childhood hide

but ooh im gonna take control

chorus
i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
no i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
i said i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
no i wont let you bring me back bring me back down in the dumps
you can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
but i wont let you bring me back bring me back down
you can throw all the fits and the tantrums you want
but i wont let you bring bring me back6embed"
