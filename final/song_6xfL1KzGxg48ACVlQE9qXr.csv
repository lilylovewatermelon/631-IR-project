yeah yeah

verse 1
what you got if you aint got love
the kind that you just wanna give away
its okay to open up
go ahead and let the light shine through
i know its hard on a rainy day
you wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
but dont run out on your faith

chorus
cause sometimes that mountain youve been climbin is just a grain of sand
and what youve been out there searchin for forever is in your hands
and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
seem so small

verse 2
its so easy to get lost inside
a problem that seems so big at the time
its like a river thats so wide
it swallows you whole
while youre sittin round thinkin bout what you cant change
and worrying about all the wrong things
times flyin by movin so fast
you better make it count cause you cant get it back

sometimes that mountain youve been climbin is just a grain of sand
and what youve been out there searchin for forever is in your hands
oh and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
it sure makes everything else
seem so small

sometimes that mountain youve been climbin is just a grain of sand
and what youve been out there searchin for forever is in your hands
oh and when you figure out love is all that matters after all

seem so small
