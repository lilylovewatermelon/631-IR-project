waves do move like round
it dont go up and down
it spreads circle bound
running like a hound ha
look at what i found
where they threw me down
where they threw me down

on ten were on

theyre an opening ceremony and we all start the same
cells grow to cell phones
some form cells
some get put in cells
sex fucking sells
now you know the drill so
hear me sound the bells
you use new keys to type old deeds
set up by old needs
what world peace
what was in ya read yeah what was in ya feed
where do you get to with the internet lead
things do change and change can have a range
systems shouldnt operate by sticking me in a cage
aint dalai lama
aint sai baba
my words are my armor and youre bout to meet your karmasee mia liveget tickets as low as 146you might also like10embed"
