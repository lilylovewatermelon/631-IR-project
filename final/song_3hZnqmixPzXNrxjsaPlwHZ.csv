what does love look like
love looks like you
what does love feel like
love feels like this
what does love smell like
love smells like us

verse 1 andr√© 3000
you make me understand
what it means to be in love once again
why must we fly so low
are we fraid of heights do kites get lost in the tow

chorus
stank love
stank love
stank love
stank love

verse 2 sleepy brown
let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
open up you flower please let me taste your love
honeysuckle sweet cant stop till i get every drip drop on my tongue
hitting every spot of you what you gonna do
your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
up and down it seems to go
oh my god i think im bout to explode

verse 3 big rube
my fingertips scan flesh so supple
no longer a couple like two in one skin
where do you end and where do i begin
both brains become one mind sensually
every nerve becoming its own individual entity
with its own lusts its own needs to serve
longing for the love of all the other nerves
as they writhe and twist in satisfaction
in the burning chill of pleasure we both bathe
engulfing encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
of an impact so deep but not one of destruction
but of creation elation in the remaking
no faking in the relation no taking in the relation
just giving of the persona making love after making love
til aint nothing but stankonia

chorus
