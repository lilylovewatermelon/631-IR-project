she said everything is fine shes leaving you behind
you had your chance to apologise
theres no one on your side
and nowhere left to hide save me

prechorus
and shes always right
youre gonna feel her bite
youre gonna learn the hard way
youll never win the fight

chorus
cause i dont wanna be the one to explain
that maybe for your safety
that shes always right

verse 2
shes up early in the morning with a coffee and a dart
shes got a long list of reasons while shell tear out your heart
and theres no one on your side
theres nowhere left to hide save me

refrain
and shes always right
youre gonna feel her bite
youre gonna learn the hard way
youll never win the fight

verse 3
shes up early in the morning with a coffee and a dart
shes got a long list of reasons while shell tear out your heart
