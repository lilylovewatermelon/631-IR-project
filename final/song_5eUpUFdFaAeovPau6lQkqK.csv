well look who it is
last call i thought id get
hows your mama how you been
girl its been too long
saw your sister at the circle k
heard baby number two is on the way
hadnt seen her since her weddin day
with you on my arm
its good to hear from you again
girl what a coincidence

chorus dustin lynch
i was just thinkin bout that weekend out on cumberland lake
and that one time in baton rouge when we made out in the rain
where we went chasin fallin stars
on a hill at your daddys farm
dont be sorry for callin me up right outta the blue
i was just thinkin bout you
oh i was just thinkin bout you

verse 2 mackenzie porter
hmm yeah

and it put a smile on my face when i started reminiscin
