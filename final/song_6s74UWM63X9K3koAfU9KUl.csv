verse 1 calum
wait dont tell me heaven is a place on earth
i wish i could rewind all the times that i didnt
show you what youre really worth what youre really worth
the way you held me i wish that id put you first
i was wrong i admit numb from your kiss
while you were slippin through my fingertips

chorus luke ashton calum
takin every breath away
with all of the mistakes ive made
from all the letters that ive saved
this is everything i didnt say
i wish i couldve made you stay
and im the only one to blame to blame
i know that its a little too late
this is everything i didnt say

holdin onto a broken and empty heart
flowers i shouldve bought all the hours i lost
wish i could bring it back to the start

chorus luke ashton calum
