i found myself in this bar
makin mistakes and makin’ new friends
i was growin up and nothin made sense
buzzin’ all night like neon in the dark
i found myself in this

verse 1
couldnt wait to turn twentyone
the day i did i got too drunk
spinnin round dizzy on the patio
found out real quick how to take it slow
got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
ran my mouth to an outoftowner
learned a big lesson when i met the bouncer

chorus
i found myself in this bar
makin mistakes and makin new friends
i was growin up and nothin made sense
buzzin all night like neon in the dark
i found myself in this bar

post chorus
oh woah
oh woah
oh woah
i found myself in this
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
saw her in the corner sippin’ somethin’ tall
cracked a few jokes we hit it off
year down the road im watchin’ her
walk through the door with some new jerk
and we had it good and it hurt so bad
but i had to stand my ground
chase my pride with another round

chorus
i found myself in this bar
makin mistakes and makin new friends
i was growin up and nothin’ made sense
learnin how to live with a broken heart
i found myself in this bar

post chorus
oh woah
oh woah
oh woah

bridge
those nights what i would give for one more
bud lights and kissin on the front porch
didnt even know what i was lookin for
outro
but i found myself in this bar
i found myself in this bar
i found myself in this bar
aint it strange the things you keep tucked in your heart
i found myself in this bar5embed"
