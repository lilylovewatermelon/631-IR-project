verse 1 lil wayne
tell them hoes get they mind right tell them niggas back up
man i heard the truth is hard to swallow do you have cups
used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
tell ’em get they iron right before ironman come
tell em bring my car around tell em bitches lap up
i’ma cut this music down tell em put they aps up
tell em throw they pride out roll the windows back up
money in the air who said white men cant jump
catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
let me get the phone and the car once its gassed up
ak47 make a sittin duck stand up
i could let it blast but i much rather have one
tell em bring my car around tell em bitches lap up
