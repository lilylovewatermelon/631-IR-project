how would you know
when everything around yous changing
like the weather of a big black storm
and who would you turn to
had i a ghost a shadow at the most
would you let me know

verse 2
cause i dont want to
trouble your mind with a childish design
of how it all should go
but i love you so
when it all comes clear when the wind it settles
ill be here you know

prechorus
cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
the sun upon that place
darling ill grow weary happy still
with just the memory of your face

chorus
gracious goes the ghost of you
and i will never forget
the plans and the silhouettes you drew here
gracious goes the ghost of you
my dear

how would you know
when everything around yous bruised and battered
like the cold night storm
and who would you turn to
had i a ghost a shadow at the most
would you tell me so

verse 4
cause i i adore you so
when it all comes clear when the wind it settles
ill be here you know

prechorus
cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
the sun upon that place
darling ill grow weary happy still
with just the memory of your face

chorus
gracious goes the ghost of you
and i will never forget
the plans and the silhouettes you drew here
gracious goes the ghost of you
my dear
gracious goes the ghost of you
and i will never forget
the plans and the silhouettes you drew here
gracious goes the ghost of you
my dear1embed"
