it had been many years since id been in love
with a real man i had given up on love
i didnt think a good man existed in this world
i was tired of searching
because relationships i dealt with in the past
couldnt fathom being monogamous
and when i least expected it i found you
and because of you i know how it feels to be in love

prechorus beyoncé
and when i look into your eyes i see love
we pillowtalk at night and i can hear your love
ooh the next morning we make love
im so in love

chorus kelly  beyoncé

through you i learned to smile again
i love you i love you
