self medicate while they sleep
we let the night chase evil things away
and were like animals homesick from shows
weve gotta kill everything before the night gets wasted
maybe it seems so strange
but we dont even stress at all
cause weve got poisons in our well
poison in our well

prechorus
come at me with everything youve got

chorus
burst into flames scream in the dark
im gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars tonight

verse 2
does it even make a difference
when im sober i feel pain
as we run under the stars through cemetery backyards
celebrate the way the night hides scars
so dance if it moves you
jump in the fire if it burns you
ill throw my arms around you darling
and well turn to ashes drown me in the flames
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
scream in the dark
im gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars
but if these demons keep falling from the sky its alright
cause sometimes i love the way you swing the blade at everything in sight

bridge
separate me from my own two hands ive killed so many times
but i cant save the world from the creatures that dont die
kinda like the way you tell me baby please come home
i need you here right now
im crying in the water so you dont hear the sound

guitar solo

chorus
burst into flames what do you do when youre out of time
scream in the dark where do you go when theyre right outside
gonna light up this place and how do you scream when theres no one around

outro
no one around
and i will be the only light
ill be the only light23embed"
