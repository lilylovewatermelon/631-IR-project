and if the snow buries my
my neighborhood
and if my parents are crying
then ill dig a tunnel from my window to yours
yeah a tunnel from my window to yours

verse 2
you climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle
the middle of the town
and since theres no one else around we let our hair grow long
and forget all we used to know
then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow

chorus
you change all the lead sleeping in my head
as the day grows dim i hear you sing a golden hymn

verse 3
then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that
the names we used to know
but sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parents bedrooms
and the bedrooms of our friends
then we think of our parents well what ever happened to them

chorus
you change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold
as the day grows dim i hear you sing a golden hymn
its the song ive been trying to sing
see arcade fire liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likeoutro
purify the colors purify my mind
purify the colors purify my mind
and spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine22embed"
