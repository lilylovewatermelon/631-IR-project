when life leaves you high and dry
ill be at your door tonight
if you need help if you need help
ill shut down the city lights
ill lie cheat ill beg and bribe
to make you well to make you well

verse 2
when enemies are at your door
ill carry you away from war
if you need help if you need help
your hope dangling by a string
ill share in your suffering
to make you well to make you well

prechorus
give me reasons to believe
that you would do the same for me
