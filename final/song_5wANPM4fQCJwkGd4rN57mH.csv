i got my drivers license last week
just like we always talked about
cause you were so excited for me
to finally drive up to your house
but today i drove through the suburbs
crying cause you werent around

verse 2
and youre probably with that blonde girl
who always made me doubt
shes so much older than me
shes everything im insecure about
yeah today i drove through the suburbs
cause how could i ever love someone else

chorus
and i know we werent perfect but ive never felt this way for no one
and i just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that im gone
guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
cause you said forever now i drive alone past your street

verse 3
and all my friends are tired
of hearing how much i miss you but
i kinda feel sorry for them
cause theyll never know you the way that i do
yeah today i drove through the suburbs
and pictured i was driving home to you

and i know we werent perfect but ive never felt this way for no one oh
and i just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that im gone
i guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
cause you said forever now i drive alone past your street

bridge
red lights stop signs
i still see your face in the white cars front yards
cant drive past the places we used to go to
cause i still fuckin love you babe ooh oohooh ooh oohooh
sidewalks we crossed
i still hear your voice in the traffic were laughing
over all the noise
god im so blue know were through
but i still fuckin love you babe ooh oohooh ooh oohooh

chorus
i know we werent perfect but ive never felt this way for no one
and i just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that im gone
guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
cause you said forever now i drive alone past your street
