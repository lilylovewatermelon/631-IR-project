perfect by nature
icons of selfindulgence
just what we all need
more lies about a world

chorus
that never was and never will be
have you no shame dont you see me
you know youve got everybody fooled

verse 2
look here she comes now
bow down and stare in wonder
oh how we love you
no flaws when youre pretending
but now i know

chorus
she never was and never will be
you dont know how you betrayed me
and somehow youve got everybody fooled

bridge
without the mask
where will you hide
cant find yourself
lost in your lie
i know the truth now
i know who you are
and i dont love you anymore

it never was and never will be
you dont know how you betrayed me
and somehow youve got everybody fooled
