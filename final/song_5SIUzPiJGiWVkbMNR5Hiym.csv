i didnt come here looking for nothin
then a pretty little thing sat down
said shes tryna get over something
lookin like shes tryna get over it now
so i ordered one she ordered two
she opened and started talking bout you
she started falling but youre blowin up her phone
mmm now its looking like ya wish ya didnt leave her alone

chorus
here in this bar
gave er the runaround then broke her hеart
told her all the things that you didnt mean
evеry time you came back home youd leave
yeah you left her alone just to be found
by a guy like me buying rounds
spin her round the dance floor
for a couple more then take her home
its my turn to love her
so leave her alone mmm
leave her alone

verse 2
no i didnt try hard i didnt have to
hell you did half the work for me
and i know youre all hung up on the fact you
couldnt ever give her what she needs
now shes on my lips shes on your mind
im in her house and youre driving by
wonderin bout the shadows on the wall with the lights on
this is my song
its looking like ya wish ya didnt leave her alone
see dylan scott liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likechorus
here in this bar
gave er the runaround then broke her heart
told her all the things that you didnt mean
every time you came back home youd leave
yeah you left her alone just to be found
by a guy like me buying rounds
spin her round the dance floor
for a couple more then take her home
its my turn to love her
so leave her alone mmm
leave her alone

bridge
i could never go and leave her alone like ya did to her
take it as a loss for what its worth
put a diamond on it in due time
you should let it burn
thats a lesson learned that if ya
leave it alone ya gotta leave it for good
i swear ill love her like ya never could
and you let her go so dont look back
hell i aint even mad that ya left her alone

chorus
here in this bar
gave er the runaround then broke her heart
told her all the things that you didnt mean
every time you came back home youd leave
yeah you left her alone just to be found
by a guy like me buying rounds
spin her round the dance floor
for a couple more then take her home
its my turn to love her
so leave her alone
go on and leave her alone
outro
mmm
now its looking like you wish you didnt leave her aloneembed"
