oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohoohooh oohooh ooh
oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohoohoohooh oohooh

verse 1
i feel the salty waves come in i feel them crash against my skin
and i smile as i respire because i know theyll never win
theres a haze above my tv that changes everything i see
and maybe if i continue watchin ill lose the traits that worry me

prechorus
can we fastforward to go down on me

chorus
stop there and let me correct it
i wanna live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and ill admire your expensive taste and
who cares divine intervention
i wanna be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on gettin out of here

postchorus
oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohoohooh oohooh ooh
can we fastforward to go down on me
oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohoohoohooh oohooh

taking everything for granted but we still respect the time
we move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine everything is fine
and i would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines
but i regain repose and wonder how i ended up inside up inside

prechorus
can we fastforward til you go down on me

chorus
stop there and let me correct it
i wanna live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and ill admire your expensive taste and
who cares divine intervention
i wanna be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on gettin out of here
catch me up on gettin out of here

bridge
more to the point i need to show
how much i can come and go
other plans fell through
and put a heavy load on you i know
theres no more that need be said
when im inching through your bed
take a look around instead and watch me go
ah ah ah ahahah ah ah
chorus
stop there and let me correct it
i wanna live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and ill admire your expensive taste and
who cares divine intervention
i wanna be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on gettin out of here
its not fair just let me perfect it
dont wanna live a life that is comprehensive all on me
cause seein clear would be a bad idea
now catch me up on gettin out of here
so catch me up on gettin out of here
