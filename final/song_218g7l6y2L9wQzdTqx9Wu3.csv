verse two trick daddy
leave me your number and ill holla back
you prefer your pet name nickname no big thang girl ill call you that
wont be no problem with no other woman
cause you the one i chose in other words fuck dem other hoes
and if a man gon be a man are you really a woman
is this really what you want and is you sho
are you ready to be committed
do you plan on spendin the rest of your life with a nigga
have you even thought about it weighed out all your options
made your mind up with no doubt about it
if not we oughta talk about it
but stick with it dont let dem sick bitches talk you out it
cause baby im in love witcha
and i couldnt stand to see you with another man so
dearly beloved we gathered here today
homey to marry and see a couple in thug matrimony

verse three trick daddy
i need a woman thats down for me one wholl love
respect and honor her nigga do it all no matter what
just one lifetime  wouldnt be long enough
for us to be together at least not for us
and if im ever in a jam be there for me
and keep it real with a player cause you care for me
with no strings attached when you rub on my back
greasin my strap kissin my neck baby im lovin that
i got this thang that i do with my tongue
i wanna do it to you but it might make you cum
but itll cure you of your back spasms
have you floatin while your motion in your ocean gotcha backpedallin
and we can take it to another level
and get elevated gettin way mo creative
and you can slap me if it makes you happy
but if you scratch and bite me that only shows me you like me
see we can do big thangs
i make you scream my name and blame it all on the whip cream
and if youre down with me ill have you down and dirty
i do my thang for certain just tell me if its hurtin
