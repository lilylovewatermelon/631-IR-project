i wanna live in the city with no friends and family
im gonna look out the window of my color tv
i wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
im gonna look out the window of my color tv

verse
through the cracks in the wall slow motion for all
dripped out of the bars someone smart said nothin at all
im watching tv i guess thats a solution
they gave me a receipt that said i didnt buy nothin
so rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
my eyes rolled around all around on the carpet
oh hit the deck its the decal man
standin upside down and talkin out of his pants

chorus
i wanna live in the city with no friends and family
im gonna look out the window of my color tv
i wanna remember to remember to forget you forgot me
im gonna look out the window of my color tv

verse
through the cracks in the wall slow motion for all
dripped out of the bars someone smart said nothin at all
im watching tv i guess thats a solution
they gave me a receipt that said i didnt buy nothin
so rust is a fire and our blood oxidizes
my eyes rolled around all around on the carpet
oh hit the deck its the decal man
standin upside down and talkin out of his pants

through the cracks in the wall slow motion for all
