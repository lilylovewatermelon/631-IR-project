i got a chick and she a bit dimwitted
but she real pretty and she slim thick with it uh
she let the whole imprint hit it
now im cool i aint got no real interest in it
i know my innocence gone
cause its 80 proof liquor all up in my system uh ayy ayy
i dont jerk it when im finna get some
and it paid off for me cause im finishin strong ayy ayy
but i don’t let the kids live long
cause the utilities and the renters insurance is enough already
tryna do the right thing but i bluffed already
tryna take it slow but i cuffed already
