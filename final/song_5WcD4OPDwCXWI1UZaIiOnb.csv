i cant remember the time or place
or what you were wearing
its unclear about how we met
all i know it was the best conversation that ive ever had
to this day i never found someone
with eyes as wide as yours
ive been searching up and down this coast
overlooking what i need the most

chorus
did you notice i was afraid
i thought id run out of things to say
two more hours until today burns this away
and it starts all over again
the sky will never look the same again
till you show me how it could be
the sky will never look the same again
till you show me how it could be

verse 2
and everything else is irrelevant
to the story so far
a coincidence that you look like her from a far
is it true that you like to sleep alone
or is it what you just tell everyone

and when the world turns over
ill keep my ears to the wall
and when the world turns over
ill keep my feet straight on the ground
