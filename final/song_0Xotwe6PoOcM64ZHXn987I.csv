i pack up my saddle
throw it in that twohorse trailer
back up my truck hook em up
and drive away
wont be the first time
but this times the last time
she meant it when she said
thats all ive got to say
never had been thrown like this before
i aint her cowboy anymore

verse 2
never say it coming
but i knew where it was going
when she asked how long this time
before i hit the road
she didnt come right out and say it
but i sure got the message
when i reached out to hold her
that shoulder sure was cold
figured id just let goodbye run its course
i aint her cowboy anymore

chorus
these white lines are a blur
like the last few nights i spent with her
i dont know where i went wrong or if i did
like the good ol boy i am
i told her that i understand
but lord knows that i wont long as i live
seems lately every time it rains it pours
i aint her cowboy anymore
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 3
we met in denver
settled down in dallas
the best days of my life
were the ones i spent with her
youd think that all that loving
ought to count for something
guess i wore out my welcome
like the rowels of these old spurs
that casper sunsets what im shooting for
cause i aint her cowboy anymore

chorus
these white lines are a blur
like the last few nights i spent with her
i dont know where i went wrong or if i did
like the good ol boy i am
i told her that i understand
but lord knows that i wont long as i live
seems lately every time it rains it pours
i aint her cowboy anymore

outro
her cowboy anymore
i aint her cowboy anymoreembed"
