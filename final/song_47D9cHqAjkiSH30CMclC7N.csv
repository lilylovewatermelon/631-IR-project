verse 1
when i think of what ive done all the pain that ive brung
baby you shouldve walked out on me
and when i turned away from you
whenever there were hard times
how could you still be with me
and it was no mistake when i hurt you that day
and went out with somebody new
but still you forgave me like it was so easy
i shouldve been better to you

chorus
baby it breaks my heart
to think that lovin me is not easy to do
and i dont mean to make it hard
sorry for all the changes i put you through
and its hard to believe after everything
that youre still here right beside me
wouldnt trade you for this whole world
im thankful just bein your girl

and right when i come back youre waiting for me
and you welcome me home

chorus
