im for the law and order the way that it should be
this songs about the night they spent protecting you from me
someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
new york sent a posse down like i aint never seen

chorus
dont you think this outlaw bits done got out of hand
what started out to be a joke the law dont understand
was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man
maybe this here outlaw bits done got out of hand
out of hand woo

verse 2
we were wrapped up in our music – thats why we never saw
the car pulls up the boys get out and the room fill up with law
they came boundin through the backdoor in the middle of the song
they got me for possession of something that was gone
long gone

chorus
dont you think this outlaw bits done got out of hand
what started out to be a joke the law dont understand
was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man oh lord
maybe this here outlaw bits done got out of hand woo
