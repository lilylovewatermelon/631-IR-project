the bodys a temple thats what were told
ive treated this one like an old honkytonk
greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
one day theyll get me if they aint got me yet

chorus
cause im living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
im living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow

verse 2
my friends all grew up they settled down
built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
they work in their office drive suvs
they pray for their babies and they worry bout me

chorus
cause im living in fast forward
a hillbilly rock star out of control
im living in fast forward
now i need to rewind real slow

but the way ive been going
its time that i toned it
down just a notch or two
