am i sorry your sky went black
put your knives in babies backs
am i sorry you killed the kennedys and huxley too
but im sorry shakespeare was your scapegoat
and your apples sticking into my throat
sorry your sunday smiles are rusty nails
and your crucifixion commercials failed

i see all the young believers
your target audience
i see all the old deceivers
we all just sing their song

verse 2
am i sorry just to be alive
put my face in the beehive
am i sorry for booth and oswald pinks and cocaine too
sorry you never check the bag in my head for a bomb
and my halo was a needle hole
sorry i saw a priest being beaten
and i made a wish

but im just a pitiful anonymous

we all just sing their song
