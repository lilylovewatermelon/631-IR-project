verse 1
well she said i know but i just cant tell
everything that youve just been saying
lucy was there as well in the dark
when the kids in the band were playing
no one could hear a word or tell
what the girl was singing
she just mustve been 16 or 18
im just past caring

chorus 1
she was into the stones when
i was into the roses
she was breaking my bones when
i was busting their noses
she would tell me a secret
i would lose it the next day
young love pleases you easy
makes you sick in a bad way
you might also likepostchorus
and all the while the girl sang
la la la la she sang
kickings for my sweetheart
bruises that i just dont miss
and she said i cant love you anymore than this

verse 2
oh she said she said no no no no
then again yes why dont you kill me
i said wait a minute stop right there
sweetheart you know that dont thrill me
said i wouldve been there
if only you had been a little bit nicer
i was dead by sunday
half dead skint just trying to please her
chorus 2
she was getting me pills when
i was into her best friend
she was chasing the thrills and
living out in the west end
she was pretty in places
i lived under her window
she said take me to london
tell me something i dont know

postchorus
and all the while the girl sang
la la la la she sang
kickings for my sweetheart
bruises that i just dont miss
and she said i cant love you anymore than this
