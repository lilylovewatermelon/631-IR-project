the pain in my heart just wont end
the words that i find just dont seem to compare
awaiting my death in the end
alone i must seek out the end to begin
so nobody wants death
cause nobody wants life to end
im the only one stressed
and the only one tired of having fake friends
put the noose on my neck
and the hole in my back again
ive been waiting on death with a smile on my face
so this is the end
waste of tears
waste of years and months
faced my fears
loving her for once
hurt me
break my heart
worthless
cant keep love at all
turning
twist myself
worthless
cant keep love at all at allyou might also like142embed"
