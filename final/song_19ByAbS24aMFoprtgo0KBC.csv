and drive all over the world
if you would like you could ride with me
and we could live on the road
we cruise by the banks the rivers deep and wide never have to think about space or time
i want to be a moonshine distiller and make the best stuff around
and if youd like you could drink with me until we fall through the ground
we could have our home out up in the hills
never have to pay no dues or bills
well i want to be a stardust chaser and land on the face of the moon
if you would like well you could run with me but ill be running soon
we could go forever or at least until were done runs circles around the moon run circles around the sun
i want to be a school bus driver
and drive all over the world
if you would like well you could ride with me
and we could live on the road
well we could live on the road yeah we could live on the roadsee trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
