i hate living by the hospital
the sirens go all night
i used to joke that if they woke you up
somebody better be dying
sick of the questions i keep asking you
that make you live in the past
but i can count on you to tell me the truth
when youve been drinking and youre wearing a mask

chorus
baby its halloween
and we can be anything
oh come on man
we can be anything

verse 2
always surprised by what i do for love
some things i never expect
they killed a fan down by the stadium
was only visiting they beat him to death

chorus
baby its halloween
and we can be anything
oh come on man
we can be anything
baby its halloween
theres a last time for everything
oh come on man
we can be anything
