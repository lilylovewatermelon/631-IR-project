it cant be love
for there is no true love
it cant be love
for there is no true love

verse 1
sure im cfk
but you gotta love me
the cost no man can say
but you gotta love me

verse 2
well im sorry but im not
interested in gold mines
oil wells shipping or real estate
what would i liked to have been
everything you hate

chorus
it cant be love
for there is no true love
it cant be love
for there is no true love

verse 3
there is a man
a certain man
and for the poor you may be sure
that hell do all he can
who is this one
whose favorite son
just by his action has the traction
magnates on the run
who likes to smoke
enjoys a joke
and wouldnt get a bit
upset if he were really broke
with wealth and fame
hes still the same
ill bet you five youre not alive
if you dont know his name
you might also likebridge
you said the union forever
you said the union forever
you cried the union forever
but that was untrue girl

chorus
cause it cant be love
for there is no true love
it cant be love
for there is no true love3embed"
