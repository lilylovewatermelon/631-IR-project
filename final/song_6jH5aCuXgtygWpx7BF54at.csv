throw it all away
lets lose ourselves
cause theres no one left for us to blame
its a shame were all dying
and do you think you deserve your freedom

verse 2
how could you send us
so far away from home
when you know damn well that this is wrong
i would still lay down my life for you
and do you think you deserve your freedom

outro
no i dont think you do
theres no justice in the world
theres no justice in the world
and there never wasyou might also like4embed"
