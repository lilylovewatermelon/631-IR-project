it was good to be there in the bright lights oh
but i lost good friends under the spotlight oh
imagine if everybody knew your name
but they had nothing nice to say nothing nice to say
it was good to be living up the high life oh
but the comedowns harder in the headlines oh
and everybody tells you you should play the game
but theres only you to play theres only you to play

chorus 1
i set fire to the glory
i set fire to the dream
i set fire to the only thing that lead me from the streets

cause now ive opened my eyes and i have found a way to breathe
the truth sets me free

i broke my back to make a breakthrough oh
i lost my mind look what it came to oh
i had to lose it all so i could understand oh
i was just a boy in the shadow of a man

cause now ive opened my eyes and i have found a way to breathe
the truth sets me free
