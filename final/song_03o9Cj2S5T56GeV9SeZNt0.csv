chorus
i wanna see you do better
fly ima need a propeller fly
when its cold im the one like a sweater sweater
when im high aint no changin the weather
if you only had one time you could hear my voice
id sing my song at coachella sing my song at coachella
only got one life you can get rich twice
let it rain on the rolls umbrella
seats in the rollsroyce leather
vvs in the roll skydweller uh
i done made up my mind and done got on my grind
and now they got a vendetta now they got a vendetta
jumpin inside i aint goin in silent
now her pussy gettin wetter now her pussy gettin wetter
i wanna see you doin better
