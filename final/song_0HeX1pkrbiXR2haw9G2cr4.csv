here come the man from the star
we dont know why he go so far
and keep on marching along
beating his drum
thugs and sticks and bats and balls
for nuclear dicks with dialect drawls
they come from a parking lot town
where nothing lives in the sun

chorus
dont make me a target
dont make me a target

verse 2
when you reach back in his mind
feels like hes breaking the law
theres something back there he got
that nobody knows
he never claimed to say what he says
he smells like the inside of closets upstairs
the kind where nobody goes

chorus
dont make me a target
dont make me a target
dont make me a target
dont make me a target
dont make me a targetyou might also likeembed"
