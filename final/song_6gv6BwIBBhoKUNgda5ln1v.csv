i don’t need an answer
i don’t need clarity
in all of my questioning
i just need you here with me
even if you told me
still i may not understand
so i choose to trust you
i believe you have a plan

chorus
you’ve got the whole world in your hands
sing it out loud sing it out now
you’ve got the whole world in your hands
nothing to fear finding peace here
you wrote the ending from the beginning
you’ve got the whole world

verse 2
you are never caught off guard
you have never been surprised
all that is in the dark
you will bring to the light
evil may have its day
this world may break my heart
but you will have the final say
your goodness works through it all

you’ve got the whole world in your hands
nothing to fear finding peace here
you wrote the ending from the beginning
you’ve got the whole world

the same god who carved out
the depths of the ocean
knows every longing deep in my heart ohohoh

nothing is missing
nothing forgotten
you hold it all yeah
