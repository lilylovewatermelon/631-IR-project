i stick with real things
usually facts and figures
when informations in its place
i minimize the guessing game
guess what

jenna  becky spoken
what

dawn
i dont like guessing games
or when i feel things
before i know the feelings
how am i supposed to operate
if im just tossed around by fate
like on an unexpected date

with a stranger who might talk too fast
or ask me questions about myself
before ive decided that
he can ask me questions about myself
he might sit too close
or call the waiter by his first name
or eat oreos
but eat the cookie before the cream
but what scares me the most
what scares me the most
you might also likeis what if when he sees me what if he doesnt like it
what if he runs the other way and i cant hide from it
what happens then
if when he knows me hes only disappointed
what if i give myself away to only get it given back
i couldnt live with that
so im just fine inside my shellshaped mind
this way i get the best view
so that when he sees me i want him to

jenna spoken
dawn dont you think youre being a little i mean maybe just a tad

dawn
im not defensive
im simply being cautious
i cant risk reckless dating
due to my miscalculating
why a certain suitor stands in line
ive seen in movies
most made for television
you cannot be too careful
when it comes to sharing your life
i could end up a miserable wife
sorry girls
but he could be criminal some sort of psychopath
who escaped from an institution
somewhere where they dont have girls
he could have masterminded some way to find me
he could be colorblind
how untrustworthy is that
he could be less than kind
or even worse he could be very nice have lovely eyes
and make me laugh come out of hiding
what do i do with that

oh god
what if when he sees me
i like him and he knows it
what if he opens up a door
and i cant close it
what happens then
if when he holds me
my heart is set in motion
im not prepared for that
im scared of breaking open
but still i cant help from hoping
to find someone to talk to
who likes the way i am
someone who when he sees me
wants to again17embed"
