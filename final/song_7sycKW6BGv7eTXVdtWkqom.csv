verse 1 schoolboy q
groovy nigga jumped up off of the peg
4th by my 3rd leg plead the 5th
no ls no whips backyard full of crips
barbecues and county blues this hoover gangster be the shit
it aint much up on our list shoot the killer and hit the licks
get ebt up out the bitch gangbanging fuck a clique
yup im looking for a scrap
see my cripping done spread around the world
put his top below his bottom its the reaper

prechorus schoolboy q
looking like the reaper in your driveway
strays through your living room
liable to driveby on a summer day
july 4th will be in june
blatay blatay blatay bla bum
the sound of the drum that crips and bloods know
blatay blatay blatay bla bum
the sound that the drums sing

verse 2 schoolboy q
dont make me put a lean to a nigga spleen
shells through a nigga pariiing peedi crack riiing
stop a dream in its tracks beam down
little boy now dream little boy dream
coke go in the pot arm and hammer body
aap rocky want it i could get it
onion in my pocket like the booty on a midget
diamond on my rollie teach a nigga how to fridge it
looking at the times they been winning for a minute
see my neck codefendant whats the problem
seen the souls long gone before i got them
he was dead before i shot him its the reaper

bridge schoolboy q
tell me more about it in the gutter
where it started with the cripping
blue on campus know it happened
tell me more about it in the gutter
where it started with the cripping
then the bloods done got it brackin

verse 3 jay rock
suwoo im just a eastside nigga
william nickerson show you what it be like nigga
lit em up light em up like a street light nigga
follow me i can show you what these streets like nigga
handle bars of a schwinn guns blow like dusty winds
spend a band push his wig back when that revolver spins
toe tag em false flagging like its all good
tell niggas tee off like tiger woods where you from
we never heard of ya walking with the murderers
niggas thatll murder ya steal you like a burglar
seemed the soul was long gone before i got them
he was dead before i shot him its the reaper
