verse 1
she said i won the battle but i lost the war
and now my head is sore
and if i try to sail back in
shes gonna push me from the shore
now i wont even get the time of day
no way no way no
not for what i said
but for what i didnt say what i didnt say so

if you see kay will you tell her that i love her
and if you see kay let her know i want her back
if shell listen say im missing everything about her
and make sure you say im sweet fa without her
if you see kay

verse 3
now im sitting here in disbelief
how it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave
but she was torn between what she wants and what she needs
they say you love someone enough you gotta set them free
she said that she was born to leave this town behind
knew the truth but still she looked me in the eyes and lied
saying its time to cut the ties time to say goodbye
so she left but she nevernever left my nevernever left my mind
chorus
if you see kay will you tell her that i love her oh yeah
and if you see kay let her know i want her back
if shell listen say im missing everything about her
and make sure you say im sweet fa without her
and make sure you say i lost my way without her
if you see kay

refrain
if you see my friend doesnt matter where or when
tell me if you see kay if you see kay
if you see my friend doesnt matter where or when
tell me if you see kay if you see kay
if you see my friend doesnt matter where or when
tell me if you see kay
if you see my friend doesnt matter where or when
tell me if you see kay5embed"
