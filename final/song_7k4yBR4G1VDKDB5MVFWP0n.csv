fancy cars and diamond rings
i seen all kinds of shiny things
i should be feeling like a king
but lord i dont
great big towns so full of users
make a million still a loser
some may bet on you to win
most hope you wont
living wild aint no mercy being free
when it brings you to your knees
cant keep lying

chorus
ive seen the road now
i know just what i need
to find my way back to tennessee
im going home now
to southern is so sweet
and find my way back to tennessee

verse 2
i was only seventeen
i lived behind my beauty queen
i turned my back on everything
and everyone
rooms with lots of pretty faces
still dont fill the empty spaces
wandering where amazing grace is
there is none no
now i know theres no comfort in this world
god i miss that hometown girl
want to hold her

all this time i was chasing after dreams
it was right in front of me
i was lost without her
