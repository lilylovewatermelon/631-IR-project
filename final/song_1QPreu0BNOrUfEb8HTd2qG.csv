verse 3 kendrick lamar
frat brother real nigga that brother
we just upped the score give me dap brother

ayy peacemaker but im not naive brother
ayy gotta watch your homies and police brother
ayy clout chasing hell of a disease brother
im fasting four days out the week brother
i pray to god that you realize the entourage is dead
i pray to god that you not lackin when you off the meds
i pray to god she know them cabo trips dont last forever
bet she argue with her momma go and get them kids
i pray to god you actually pray when somebody dies
thoughts and prayers way better off timelines
