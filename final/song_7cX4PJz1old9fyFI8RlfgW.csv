on the corner of main street
just tryna keep it in line
you say you wanna move on and
you say im falling behind
can you read my mind
can you read my mind

verse 2
i never really gave up on
breaking out of this twostar town
i got the green light i got a little fight
im gonna turn this thing around
can you read my mind oooh
can you read my mind oooh

chorus
the good old days the honest man
the restless heart the promised land
a subtle kiss that no one sees
a broken wrist and a big trapeze
oh well i dont mind if you dont mind
cause i dont shine if you dont shine
before you go can you read my mind

verse 3
itâ€™s funny how you just break down
waiting on some sign
i pull up to the front of your driveway
with magic soaking my spine
can you read my mind oooh
can you read my mind oooh
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus
the teenage queen the loaded gun
the drop dead dream the chosen one
a southern drawl a world unseen
a city wall and a trampoline
oh well i dont mind if you dont mind
cause i dont shine if you dont shine
before you jump tell me what you find
when you read my mind

bridge
slipping in my faith until i fall
he never returned that call
woman open the door dont let it sting
i wanna breathe that fire again
she said i dont mind if you dont mind i dont mind if you dont mind
cause i dont shine if you dont shine i dont shine if you dont shine
put your back on me put your back on me i dont mind if you dont mind
oh put your back on me
oooh

outro
the stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
can you read my mind oooh oooh30embed"
