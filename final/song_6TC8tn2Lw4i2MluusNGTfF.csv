it irks me when i get burned
and i realize i dont get hurt
and always it seems ive lost my way

when i feel you its not enough
and i need you you shun my touch
i notice the season s ripe for change

interlude
im weak
im weak

verse 2
so with every new lesson learned
i could keep you before it turns
in the knowledge that things wont be the same

now i realize that you have won
and theres nothing to be said or done
and i notice the wind wont blow my way

chorus
so run with the eyes of a devil
and keep them in your dreams
if you succumb to the lies of the rebel
youll cleanse yourself of me
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 3
it kills me to watch this fade
and i realize its all charade
and every mistake i make s the same

i beseech you to let me drown
will it please you to let me down
now no one can save me from the pain

chorus
so run with the eyes of a devil
and keep them in your dreams
if you succumb to the lies of the rebel
youll cleanse yourself of me

outro
jesus save me
jesus save me
im weak jesus save me
im weak jesus save me
im weak jesus save me
im weak jesus save me from me1embed"
