i was hopin for an indication
i was seekin higher elevation
aye aye aye aye aye aye
ive been shaken wakin in the night light
ive been breakin hidin from the spotlight
aye aye aye aye aye aye

prechorus
the more i stray the less i fear
and the more i reach the more i fade away
the darkness right in front of me
oh its calling out and i wont walk away

chorus
i would always open up the door
always lookin up for higher floors
wanna see it all give me more rise rise up
i was always up for makin changes
walkin down the street meetin strangers
flippin through my life turnin pages rise rise up

verse 2
like a prayer that only needs a reason
like a hunter waiting for the season
aye aye aye aye aye aye
i was there but i was always leaving
ive been livin but i was never breathing
aye aye aye aye aye aye

im burstin like the fourth of july
so color me and blow me away
im broken in the prime of my life
so embrace it and leave me to stray

flippin through my life turnin pages rise rise up
i would always open up the door
always lookin up for higher floors
want to see it all give me more rise rise up
i was always up for makin changes
walkin down the street meetin strangers
flippin through my life turnin pages rise rise up
