they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow

verse 1
they think this thing is a highway
if it was our way wed have a tempo change every other time change
cause our minds changed on what we think is good
i wasnt raised in the hood
but i know a thing or two about pain and darkness
if it wasnt for this music i dont know how i would have fought this
regardless all these songs im hearin are so heartless
dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless
honest theres a few songs on this record that feel common
im in constant confrontation with what i want and what is poppin
in the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
my creativitys only free when im playin shows

chorus
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
will they be alive tomorrow

im sorry if that question i asked last
scared you a bit like a hazmat in a gas mask if you ask zack
hes my brother he likes when i rap fast
but lets backtrack back to this
who would you live and die for on that list
but the problem is theres another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
forget sanity forget salary forget vanity my morality
if you get in between someone i love and me
youre gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
all these songs im hearin are so heartless
dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless

chorus
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
bridge
will they be alive tomorrow
will they be alive tomorrow
will they be alive tomorrow
they be alive tomorrow
drum solo

chorus
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
they say stay in your lane boy lane boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway highway
but will they be alive tomorrow
