verse 1 phineas
you keep saying that you dont have rhythm
but listen what youre doing right there
with that stamp and a book
you got a real nice hook
sounds to me like youve got rhythm to spare

verse 2 sherman
i have no idea what youre talking about
ive got as much rhythm as that chair
what happened to me was a tragedy
but i dont have to be a millionaire
look i got a sweet deal going on here
i got all the books that i can read
all these sweet old ladies
and this carpet from the 80s
what more could a librarian need

interlude woman
ssh

chorus sherman
besides i aint got rhythm
no i aint got rhythm
said i aint got rhythm
i aint got rhythm

youre kidding me right yyoure kidding me
dont you see what you were doing right then
thats a wicked groove you were starting to move
mister you got rhythm times ten

verse 4 sherman
i think perhaps that youre not listening
i find it tedious to repeat
its no big crime
i just cant keep time
im telling you i lost the beat
i dont need my face on tshirt
or hit a powerchord guitar
they were screaming my name
i guess its a shame
but i dont need to be a rock star

chorus sherman phineas  library patrons
besides i aint got rhythm
no i aint got rhythm
said i aint got rhythm
i aint got rhythm
i aint got rhythm sounds like rhythm to me
no i aint got rhythm seems like they all agree
said i aint got rhythm but youre laying down
i aint got rhythm some funky syncopation
i aint got rhythm but you got that beat
no i aint got rhythm look at them theyre stomping their feet
said i aint got rhythm its time for you to rock
a brand new generation
brand new generation
gonna rock a brand new generation
because i aint got rhythm
interlude woman
sigh
