does it have to end
ill gladly acquiesce and do it again
youre staring into space
theres something to see
but all i see is space and its staring at me

to cry on return from sleep
and in the daytime
assured its a different thing

so when it snows
and youre inside
a weeks gone by
with different skies
in transit i pretend
its a lucid dream
gennadius at night
its no difference to me
content about the world
when im halfasleep
and listening to the sounds of the bqe

im hoping that you ask
does it have to end
ill gladly acquiesce and do it again
youre staring into space
theres something to see
a different time and place
