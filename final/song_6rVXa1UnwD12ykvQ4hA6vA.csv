was the heart that i gave
the dreams that i made
with someone who dont care
the time that i wasted
the feelings ive chased
that just led me nowhere
the sleepless nights the dragout fights
the silence always won
the tears that i cry
the breaking inside
the loneliness to come

chorus
it’s alright this goodbye
won’t hurt me for too long
i’ll be fine on my own
it’ll take some time
but i know that i
i can find where i belong
and i’ll find it in a song

verse 2
this songs about freedom searching for new love
how ignorance is bliss
i know that i’m not the only fool who’s been hurt just like this
yeah songs about making honest mistakes
and heartaches ive gone through
yeah then i’ll forgive
i won’t have to forget
all the good things about you

verse 3
well im sure if i had the chance to go back
id change more than i should
but knowing i cant is helping my chances
of moving on for good
now im not saying there wont be too many lonely nights
but the songs that i choose getting over you
help me make it out alive

chorus
its alright this goodbye
won’t hurt me for too long
i’ll be fine on my own
its gonna take some time
but i know that i
i can find where i belong
and i’ll find it in a song
