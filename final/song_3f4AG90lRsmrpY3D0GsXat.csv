fences in a row
fences in a row
wired and protected
in a row

verse 1
if only your necessary silhouette
unknown join the dissi– dissi– dissidents
got carried away now hiding from their lies and discords
once remembered now forgotten
come roll the dice for me
roll the dice for me

prechorus
hold on better undone
if really on your own
thinking this is fun
feathers fallen from drapes
fold her into pieces
tied up and lace

chorus
fences in a row
fences in a row
wired and protected
in a row

got carried away thought i wouldve let you know
oh no did you miss a miss a message
i know you still
would rather mess with me than get going
shes been building up a castle in la
roll the dice for me

prechorus
hold on better undone
if really on your own
thinking this is fun
feathers fallen from drapes
fold her into pieces
tied up and lace
