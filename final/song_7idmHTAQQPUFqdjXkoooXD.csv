youre all alone at a party you wanna dance with somebody
but you aint got a clue how to ask
you and your girl had a fight and now shes sayin goodbye
she ran upstairs and packed her bags

prechorus thomas rhett
it could be rainin on your perfect vacation
you could be stressed about your work situation
aint gotta listen to me but all im sayin

chorus thomas rhett
aint nothing that a beer cant fix
aint no pain it cant wash away
from the moment that it hits your lips
makes those clouds look a little less gray
oh you could be lonely or heartbroken
or hungover from the night before
turn that frown into a smile real quick
there aint nothing that a beer cant fix

verse 2 jon pardi
youre on a lake and youre fishin
its hot and all that youre gettin is a little nibble here and there
youre sitttin watchin your team losin that championship ring
and youre feelin like life aint fair
