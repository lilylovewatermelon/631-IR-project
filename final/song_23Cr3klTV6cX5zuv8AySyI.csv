7 am
the garbage truck beeps as it backs up
and i start my day thinking about what ive thrown away
could i push rewind
oh the credits traverse signifying the end
but i missed the best part could we please go back to the start

prechorus
forgive my indecision

chorus
then again then again
then again youre always first when no ones on your side
but then again then again
then again a day will come when i want off that ride babe

verse 2
11 am
by now you would think that i would be up
but my bed sheets shade the heat of choices ive made
and what did i find
i never thought i could want someone so much
cause now youre not here and im knee deep in that old fear

prechorus
forgive my indecision
i am only a man
see incubus liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
then again then again
then again youre always first when no ones on your side
but then again then again again again
then again a day will come when i want off that ride baby

bridge
12 pm and my dusty telephone rings
heavy head up from my pillow who could it be
i hope its you
its you

chorus
then again then again
then again youre always first when no ones on your side
but then again then again again again
then again the day has come and i want off that ride babe3embed"
