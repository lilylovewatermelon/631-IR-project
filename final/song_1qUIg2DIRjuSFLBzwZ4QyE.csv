feels so familiar
you walking in here
wearing just what you know makes me weak
and im already ordering you a drink
baby and then were
gonna get out of here
just like the last time and the time before
were at your house and through the door

chorus
and were falling all over again
like a flashback to way back when
back when we were us
couldnt get enough
but we both know how this ends
you can leave it up to me
to say things that i dont mean
and ill leave it up to you
to turn i love you
into boy where you been
and just like that
just as fast as we began
were all over again

verse 2
ill think youre out of my system
at least til i miss ya
ill start going through withdrawals
thats about the time youll call
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
and well be falling all over again
like a flashback to way back when
back when we were us
couldnt get enough
but we both know how this ends
you can leave it up to me
to say things that i dont mean
and ill leave it up to you
to turn i love you
into boy where you been
and just like that
just as fast as we began
were all over again

bridge
well i know where well wind up
cause trouble loves to find us
and i guess goodbyes just too tough
cause last time was the last time but

chorus
were falling all over again
like a flashback to way back when
back when we were us
couldnt get enough
but we both know how this ends
you can leave it up to me
to say things that i dont mean
and ill leave it up to you
to turn i love you
into boy where you been
and just like that
just as fast as we began
were all over again
outro
oh were all over again
well i know where well wind up
and i guess goodbyes just too toughembed"
