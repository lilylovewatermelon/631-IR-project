when the sun goes down on my side of town
that lonesome feelin comes to my door
and the whole world turns
blue

verse 2
theres a rundown bar cross the railroad tracks
ive got a table for two way in the back
where i sit alone
and think of losin you

prechorus
i spend most every night
beneath the light of a neon moon

chorus
now if you lose your one and only
theres always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance
in and out of the beams of a neon moon

verse 3
i think of two young lovers runnin wild and free
i close my eyes and sometimes see
you in the shadows
of this smokefilled room
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 4
no tellin how many tears ive sat here and cried
or how many lies that ive lied
tellin my poor heart
shell come back someday

prechorus
oh but ill be alright
as long as theres light from a neon moon

chorus
oh if you lose your one and only
theres always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance
in and out of the beams of a neon moon

verse 5
the jukebox plays on drink by drink
and the words of every sad song seem to say what i think
and this hurt inside of me
aint never gonna end

prechorus
oh but ill be alright
as long as theres light from a neon moon
chorus
oh if you lose your one and only
theres always room here for the lonely
to watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
of a neon moon

outro
come watch your broken dreams dance
in and out of the beams of a neon moon
oh watch your broken dreams dance
in and out of the beams of a neon moon8embed"
