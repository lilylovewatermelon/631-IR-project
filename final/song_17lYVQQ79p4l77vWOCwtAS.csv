he was my boonierat buddy for a year in nam
he said is my country just a little off track
took em twentyfive years to welcome me back
but its better than not coming back at all
many a good man i saw fall
and even now every time i dream
i hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

drive on it dont mean nothin
my children love me  but they dont understand
and i got a woman who knows her man
drive on it dont mean nothin it dont mean nothin
drive on

i remember one night tex and me
rappelled in on a hot lz
we had our 16s on rock and roll
but with all that fire was scared and cold
we were crazy we were wild
and i have seen the tiger smile
i spit in a bamboo vipers face
and id be dead but by gods grace

drive on it dont mean nothin
my children love me  but they dont understand
and i got a woman who knows her man
drive on it dont mean nothin it dont mean nothin
drive on
you might also likeit was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
and nobody tried to be john wayne
i came home but tex did not
and i cant talk about the hit he got
i got a little limp now when i walk
and i got a little tremolo when i talk
but my letter read from whiskey sam
youre a walkin talkin miracle from vietnam

drive on it dont mean nothin
my children love me  but they dont understand
and i got a woman who knows her man
drive on it dont mean nothin it dont mean nothin
drive onembed"
