our first kiss was christmas in the walmart toy department
she said i should take you with me when i leave
we were searchin new york for a fancy new apartment
she said central park is sea world for trees

chorus
you ask about the cows wearin my sweater
its somethin about the weather that makes them lie down
the only time i feel i might get better is when we are together

verse 2
i like socks with sandals shes morе into scented candles
oh ill nеver get that smell out of my bag
it was poorly handled
the day we both got canceled
because im a racist and youre some kind of slag

chorus
you ask about the cows wearin my sweater
its somethin about the weather that makes them lie down
the only time i feel i might get better is when we are together
oh together

bridge
im better at writin was just a way to get you bitin
oh the truth is that our egos are absurd
i thought we were fightin
but it seems i was gaslightin you
i didnt know that it had its own word
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 8you might also likechorus
you still ask about the cows wearin my sweater
its something about the weather that makes them lie down
the only time i feel i might get better is when we are together4embed"
