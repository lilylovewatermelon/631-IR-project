verse 1
i kept it solid the whole time ayy
i aint never ever play both sides ayy
east side nigga bout gunfire ayy
pull up in a van and the door slide ayy
we aint never throwin no white flag straight up
gotta get smoke when the bros die straight up
they gon spin til the car hot straight up
dont call my phone til some more die

interlude
many men wish death upon—
many men wish death upon—
many men wish death upon me
blood in my eye dawg and i cant see
im tryin to be what im destined to be
and niggas tryin to take my life away

outro morgan freeman
the evil man envies the good in others
what this means is all hatred is really born from hatred of self
and can only serve to aid in ones own destruction
this is the downfall of many men22embed"
