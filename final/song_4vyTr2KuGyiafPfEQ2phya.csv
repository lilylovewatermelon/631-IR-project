oh no here we go again
i look to receive what the earth and sea
had thought itd be best not to even give me
even give me

now you say that i never bother you the way he did
now open eyes i saw the moon divorce the sky
is this what its like dont run

verse 2
spell out spell out
spell out to me babe
so every week well meet a bed for the backseat
a love drunk memory but such a beautiful routine

chorus
now you say that i never bother you the way he did
now open eyes now i saw the moon divorce the sky tonight

verse 3
this remedy is worse than the disease and slowly killing me
we like to run our blood thin
and laugh at things we never did
we like to run our blood thin
and laugh at things
resay say hello
resay say hello we like to run our blood thin
resay say hello we like to run our blood thin
