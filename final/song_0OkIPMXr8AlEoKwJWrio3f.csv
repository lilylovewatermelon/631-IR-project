music accompanied  hesperus sings

queen and huntress chaste and fair
now the sun is laid to sleep
seated in thy silver chair
state in wonted manner keep
hesperus entreats thy light
goddess excellently bright

earth let not thy envious shade
dare itself to interpose
cynthias shining orb was made
heavn to clear when day did close
bless us then with wished sight
goddess excellently bright

lay thy bow of pearl apart
and thy crystal shining quiver
give unto the flying hart
space to breathe how short soever
thou that makst a day of night
goddess excellently bright

cyn
when hath diana like an envious wretch
that glitters only to his soothed self
denying to the world the precious use
of hoarded wealth withheld her friendly aid
monthly we spend our stillrepaired shine
and not forbid our virginwaxen torch
to burn and blaze while nutriment doth last
that once consumed out of joves treasury
a new we take and stick it in our sphere
to give the mutinous kind of wanting men
their lookdfor light  yet what is their desert
bounty is wrongd interpreted as due
mortals can challenge not a ray by right
yet do expect the whole of cynthias light
but if that deities withdrew their gifts
for human follies what could men deserve
but death and darkness  it behoves the high
for their own sakes to do things worthily
are
most true most sacred goddess for the heavens
receive no good of all the good they do
nor jove nor you nor other heavenly powers
are fed with fumes which do from incense rise
or sacrifices reeking in their gore
yet for the care which you of mortals have
whose proper good it is that they be so
you well are pleased with odours redolent
but ignorant is all the race of men
which still complains not knowing why or when

cyn
else noble arete they would not blame
and tax or for unjust or for as proud
thy cynthia in the things which are indeed
the greatest glories in our starry crown
such is our chastity which safely scorns
not love for who more fervently doth love
immortal honour and divine renown
but giddy cupid venus frantic son
yet arete if by this veiled light
we but discoverd what we not discern
any the least of imputations stand
ready to sprinkle our unspotted fame
with note of lightness from these revels near
not for the empire of the universe
should night or court this whatsoever shine
or grace of ours unhappily enjoy
place and occasion are two privy thieves
and from poor innocent ladies often steal
the best of things an honourable name
to stay with follies or where faults may be
infers a crime although the party free
are
how cynthianly that is how worthily
and like herself the matchless cynthia speaks
infinite jealousies infinite regards
do watch about the true virginity
but phoebe lives from all not only fault
but as from thought so from suspicion free
thy presence broadseals our delights for pure
whats done in cynthias sight is done secure

cyn
that then so answerd dearest arete
what th argument or of what sort our sports
are like to be this night i not demand
nothing which duty and desire to please
bears written in the forehead comes amiss
but unto whose invention must we owe
the complement of this nights furniture

are
excellent goddess to a mans whose worth
without hyperbole i thus may praise
one at least studious of deserving well
and to speak truth indeed deserving well
potential merit stands for actual
where only opportunity doth want
not will nor power both which in him abound
one whom the muses and minerva love
for whom should they than crites more esteem
whom phoebus though not fortune holdeth dear
and which convinceth excellence in him
a principal admirer of yourself
even through the ungentle injuries of fate
and difficulties which do virtue choke
thus much of him appears  what other things
of farther note do lie unborn in him
them i do leave for cherishment to shew
and for a goddess graciously to judge
cyn
we have already judged him arete
nor are we ignorant how noble minds
suffer too much through those indignities
which times and vicious persons cast on them
ourself have ever vowed to esteem
as virtue for itself so fortune base
whos first in worth the same be first in place
nor farther notice arete we crave
then thine approvals sovereign warranty
let t be thy care to make us known to him
cynthia shall brighten what the world made dim

exit arete

the first masque

enter cupid disguised as anteros followed by storge aglaia euphantaste and apheleia
cup
clear pearl of heaven and not to be farther ambitious in
titles cynthia the fame of this illustrious night among others
hath also drawn these four fair virgins from the palace of their
queen perfection a word which makes no sufficient difference
betwixt hers and thine to visit thy imperial court for she
their sovereign not finding where to dwell among men before her
return to heaven advised them wholly to consecrate themselves to
thy celestial service as in whose clear spirit the proper element
and sphere of virtue they should behold not her alone their
everhonoured mistress but themselves more truly themselves to live enthronised  herself would have commended them unto thy favour more particularly but that she knows no commendation is more available with thee than that of proper virtue  nevertheless she willed them to present this crystal mound a note of monarchy and symbol of perfection to thy more worthy deity which as here by me they most humbly do so amongst the rarities thereof that is the chief to shew whatsoever the world hath excellent howsoever remote and various  but your irradiate judgment will soon discover the secrets of this little crystal world  themselves to appear more plainly because they know nothing more odious then false pretexts have chosen to express their several qualities thus in several colours

the first in citron colour is natural affection which given us
to procure our good is sometime called storge and as every one is
nearest to himself so this handmaid of reason allowable
selflove as it is without harm so are none without it her
place in the court of perfection was to quicken minds in the
pursuit of honour  her device is a perpendicular level upon a
cube or square the word se suo modulo alluding to that true
measure of ones self which as every one ought to make so is it
most conspicuous in thy divine example

the second in green is aglaia delectable and pleasant
conversation whose property it is to move a kindly delight and
sometime not without laughter her office to entertain assemblies
and keep societies together with fair familiarity  her device
within a ring of clouds a heart with shine about it the word
curarum nubila pello an allegory of cynthias light which no
less clears the sky then her fair mirth the heart

the third in the discoloured mantle spangled all over is
euphantaste a wellconceited wittiness and employed in honouring the court with the riches of her pure invention  her device upon a petasus or mercurial hat a crescent the word sic laus ingenii inferring that the praise and glory of wit doth ever
increase as doth thy growing moon

the fourth in white is apheleia a nymph as pure and simple as the soul or as an abrase table and is therefore called simplicity
without folds without plaits without colour without counterfeit
and to speak plainly plainness itself  her device is no device
the word under her silver shield omnis abest fucus alluding to
thy spotless self who art as far from impurity as from mortality

myself celestial goddess more fit for the court of cynthia than
the arbours of cytherea am called anteros or loves enemy the
more welcome therefore to thy court and the fitter to conduct this
quaternion who as they are thy professed votaries and for that
cause adversaries to love yet thee perpetual virgin they both
love and vow to love eternally

reenter arete with crites
cyn
not without wonder nor without delight
mine eyes have viewd in contemplations depth
this work of wit divine and excellent
what shape what substance or what unknown power
in virgins habit crownd with laurel leaves
and olivebranches woven in between
on seagirt rocks like to a goddess shines
o front  o face  o all celestial sure
and more than mortal  arete behold
another cynthia and another queen
whose glory like a lasting plenilune
seems ignorant of what it is to wane
nor under heaven an object could be found
more fit to please  let crites make approach
bounty forbids to pall our thanks with stay
or to defer our favour after view
the time of grace is when the cause is new

are
lo here the man celestial delia
who like a circle bounded in itself
contains as much as man in fulness may
lo here the man who not of usual earth
but of that nobler and more precious mould
which phoebus self doth temper is composed
and who though all were wanting to reward
yet to himself he would not wanting be
thy favours gain is his ambitions most
and labours best who humble in his height
stands fixed silent in thy glorious sight

cyn
with no less pleasure than we have beheld
this precious crystal work of rarest wit
our eye doth read thee now instiled our crites
whom learning virtue and our favour last
exempteth from the gloomy multitude
with common eye the supreme should not see
henceforth be ours the more thyself to be

cri
heavens purest light whose orb may be eclipsed
but not thy praise divinest cynthia
how much too narrow for so high a grace
thine save therein the most unworthy crites
doth find himself for ever shine thy fame
thine honours ever as thy beauties do
in me they must my dark worlds chiefest lights
by whose propitious beams my powers are raised
to hope some part of those most lofty points
which blessed arete hath pleased to name
as marks to which my endeavours steps should bend
mine as begun at thee in thee must end


the second masque

enter mercury as a page introducing eucosmos eupathes eutolmos and eucolos
mer
sister of phoebus to whose bright orb we owe that we not
complain of his absence these four brethren for they are
brethren and sons of eutaxia a lady known and highly beloved of
your resplendent deity not able to be absent when cynthia held a
solemnity officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence for
as there are four cardinal virtues upon which the whole frame of
the court doth move so are these the four cardinal properties
without which the body of compliment moveth not  with these four
silver javelins which they bear in their hands they support in
princes courts the state of the presence as by office they are
obliged which though here they may seem superfluous yet for
honours sake they thus presume to visit thee having also been
employed in the palace of queen perfection  and though to them
that would make themselves gracious to a goddess sacrifices were fitter than presents or impresses yet they both hope thy favour  and in place of either use several symbols containing the
titles of thy imperial dignity

first the hithermost in the changeable blue and green robe is
the commendablyfashioned gallant eucosmos whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence and delight of the surveying eye whom ladies understand by the names of neat and elegant  his symbol is divae virgini in which he would express thy deitys
principal glory which hath ever been virginity

the second in the rich accoutrement and robe of purple empaled
with gold is eupathes who entertains his mind with an harmless
but not incurious variety all the objects of his senses are
sumptuous himself a gallant that without excess can make use
of superfluity go richly in embroideries jewels and what not
without vanity and fare delicately without gluttony and
therefore not without cause is universally thought to be of fine
humour  his symbol is divae optimae an attribute to express
thy goodness in which thou so resemblest jove thy father

the third in the blushcoloured suit is eutolmos as duly
respecting others as never neglecting himself commonly known by the title of good audacity to courts and courtly assemblies a
guest most acceptable  his symbol is divae viragini to
express thy hardy courage in chase of savage beasts which harbour in woods and wildernesses

the fourth in watchet tinsel is the kind and truly benefique
eucolos who imparteth not without respect but yet without
difficulty and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem
double by the timely and freely bestowing thereof  he is the
chief of them who by the vulgar are said to be of good nature
his symbol is divae maximae an adjunct to signify thy
greatness which in heaven earth and hell is formidable

music  a dance by the two masques joined during which cupid and mercury retire to the side of the stage
cup
is not that amorphus the traveller

mer
as though it were not do you not see how his legs are in
travail with a measure

cup
hedon thy master is next

mer
what will cupid turn nomenclator and cry them

cup
no faith but i have a comedy toward that would not be lost
for a kingdom

mer
in good time for cupid will prove the comedy

cup
mercury i am studying how to match them

mer
how to mismatch them were harder

cup
they are the nymphs must do it i shall sport myself with
their passions above measure

mer
those nymphs would be tamed a little indeed but i fear thou
has not arrows for the purpose

cup
o yes here be of all sorts flights rovers and
buttshafts  but i can wound with a brandish and never draw bow
for the matter

mer
i cannot but believe it my invisible archer and yet
methinks you are tedious

cup
it behoves me to be somewhat circumspect mercury for if
cynthia hear the twang of my bow shell go near to whip me with
the string therefore to prevent that i thus discharge a brandish
upon—it makes no matter which of the couples  phantaste and
amorphus at you  waves his arrow at them

mer
will the shaking of a shaft strike them into such a fever of
affection

cup
as well as the wink of an eye but i pray thee hinder me
not with thy prattle

mer
jove forbid i hinder thee marry all that i fear is
cynthias presence which with the cold of her chastity casteth
such an antiperistasis about the place that no heat of thine will
tarry with the patient

cup
it will tarry the rather for the antiperistasis will keep it
in

mer
i long to see the experiment

cup
why their marrow boils already or they are all turnd
eunuchs

mer
nay ant be so ill give over speaking and be a spectator
only

the first dance ends

amo
cynthia by my bright soul is a right exquisite and
spendidious lady yet amorphus i think hath seen more fashions i
am sure more countries but whether i have or not what need we
gaze on cynthia that have ourself to admire

pha
o excellent cynthia yet if phantaste sat where she does
and had such attire on her head for attire can do much i say
no more—but goddesses are goddesses and phantaste is as she is
i would the revels were done once i might go to my school of glass
again and learn to do myself right after all this ruffling

music they begin the second dance

mer
how now cupid heres a wonderful change with your brandish
do you not hear how they dote

cup
what prodigy is this no word of love no mention no
motion

mer
not a word my little ignis fatue not a word

cup
are my darts enchanted is their vigour gone is their
virtue—

mer
what  cupid turned jealous of himself ha ha ha

cup
laughs mercury

mer
is cupid angry

cup
hath he not cause when his purpose is so deluded

mer
a rare comedy it shall be entitled cupids

cup
do not scorn us hermes

mer
choler and cupid are two fiery things i scorn them not
but i see that come to pass which i presaged in the beginning

cup
you cannot tell perhaps the physic will not work so soon
upon some as upon others  it may be the rest are not so resty

mer
ex ungue you know the old adage as these so are the
remainder

cup
ill try this is the same shaft with which i wounded
argurion

waves his arrow again

mer
ay but let me save you a labour cupid there were certain
bottles of water fetchd and drunk off since that time by these
gallants

cup
jove strike me into the earth the fountain of selflove

mer
nay faint not cupid

cup
i rememberd it not

mer
faith it was ominous to take the name of anteros upon you
you know not what charm or enchantment lies in the word you saw
i durst not venture upon any device in our presentment but was
content to be no other then a simple page  your arrows
properties to keep decorum cupid are suited it should seem
to the nature of him you personate

cup
indignity not to be borne

mer
nay rather an attempt to have been forborne

the second dance ends

cup
how might i revenge myself on this insulting mercury
theres crites his minion he has not tasted of this water
waves his arrow at crites  it shall be so  is crites
turnd dotard on himself too

mer
that follows not because the venom of your shafts cannot
pierce him cupid

cup
as though there were one antidote for these and another
for him

mer
as though there were not or as if one effect might not
arise of diverse causes  what say you to cynthia arete
phronesis time and others there

cup
they are divine

mer
and crites aspires to be so

music they begin the third dance

cup
but that shall not serve him

mer
tis like to do it at this time  but cupid is grown too
covetous that will not spare one of a multitude

cup
one is more than a multitude

mer
aretes favour makes any one shotproof against thee cupid
i pray thee light honeybee remember thou art not now in adonis
garden but in cynthias presence where thorns lie in garrison
about the roses  soft cynthia speaks

cyn
ladies and gallants of our court to end
and give a timely period to our sports
let us conclude them with declining night
our empire is but of the darker half
and if you judge it any recompence
for your faire pains t have earnd dianas thanks
diana grants them and bestows their crown
to gratify your acceptable zeal
for you are they that not as some have done
do censure us as too severe and sour
but as more rightly gracious to the good
although we not deny unto the proud
or the profane perhaps indeed austere
for so actaeon by presuming far
did to our grief incur a fatal doom
and so swoln niobe comparing more
than he presumed was trophaeed into stone
but are we therefore judged too extreme
seems it no crime to enter sacred bowers
and hallowed places with impure aspect
most lewdly to pollute  seems it no crime
to brave a deity  let mortals learn
to make religion of offending heaven
and not at all to censure powers divine
to men this argument should stand for firm
a goddess did it therefore it was good
we are not cruel nor delight in blood—
but what have serious repetitions
to do with revels and the sports of court
we not intend to sour your late delights
with harsh expostulation  let it suffice
that we take notice and can take revenge
of these calumnious and lewd blasphemies
for we are no less cynthia than we were
nor is our power but as ourself the same
though we have now put on no tire of shine
but mortal eyes undazzled may endure
years are beneath the spheres and time makes weak
things under heaven not powers which govern heaven
and though ourself be in ourself secure
yet let not mortals challenge to themselves
immunity from thence  lo this is all
honour hath store of spleen but wanteth gall
once more we cast the slumber of our thanks
on your taen toil which here let take an end
and that we not mistake your several worths
nor you our favour from yourselves remove
what makes you not yourselves those clouds of masque
particular pains particular thanks do ask

the dancers unmask

how let me view you  ha are we contemnd
is there so little awe of our disdain
that any under trust of their disguise
should mix themselves with others of the court
and without forehead boldly press so far
as farther none  how apt is lenity
to be abused severity to be loathd
and yet how much more doth the seeming face
of neighbour virtues and their borrowd names
add of lewd boldness to loose vanities
who would have thought that philautia durst
or have usurped noble storges name
or with that theft have ventured on our eyes
who would have thought that all of them should hope
so much of our connivence as to come
to grace themselves with titles not their own
instead of medcines have we maladies
and such imposthumes as phantaste is
grow in our palace  we must lance these sores
or all will putrify  nor are these all
for we suspect a farther fraud than this
take off our veil that shadows many depart
and shapes appear beloved arete—so
another face of things presents itself
than did of late  what featherd cupid masqued
and masked like anteros  and stay more strange
dear mercury our brother like a page
to countenance the ambush of the boy
nor endeth our discovery as yet
gelaia like a nymph that but erewhile
in male attire did serve anaides—
cupid came hither to find sport and game
who heretofore hath been too conversant
among our train but never felt revenge
and mercury bare cupid company
cupid we must confess this time of mirth
proclaimd by us gave opportunity
to thy attempts although no privilege
tempt us no farther we cannot endure
thy presence longer vanish hence away

exit cupid

you mercury we must entreat to stay
and hear what we determine of the rest
for in this plot we well perceive your hand
but for we mean not a censorian task
and yet to lance these ulcers grown so ripe
dear arete and crites to you two
we give the charge impose what pains you please
th incurable cut off the rest reform
remembering ever what we first decreed
since revels were proclaimd let now none bleed

are
how well diana can distinguish times
and sort her censures keeping to herself
the doom of gods leaving the rest to us
come cite them crites first and then proceed

cri
first philautia for she was the first
then light gelaia in aglaias name
thirdly phantaste and moria next
main follies all and of the female crew
amorphus or eucosmos counterfeit
voluptuous hedon taen for eupathes
brazen anaides and asotus last
with his two pages morus and prosaites
and thou the travellers evil cos approach
impostors all and male deformities—

are
nay forward for i delegate my power
and will that at thy mercy they do stand
whom they so oft so plainly scornd before
tis virtue which they want and wanting it
honour no garment to their backs can fit
then crites practise thy discretion

cri
adored cynthia and bright arete
another might seem fitter for this task
than crites far but that you judge not so
for i not to appear vindicative
or mindful of contempts which i contemnd
as done of impotence must be remiss
who as i was the author in some sort
to work their knowledge into cynthias sight
so should be much severer to revenge
the indignity hence issuing to her name
but theres not one of these who are unpaind
or by themselves unpunished for vice
is like a fury to the vicious mind
and turns delight itself to punishment
but we must forward to define their doom
you are offenders that must be confessd
do you confess it

all
we do

cri
and that you merit sharp correction

all
yes

cri
then we reserving unto delias grace
her farther pleasure and to arete
what delia granteth thus do sentence you
that from this place for penance known of all
since you have drunk so deeply of selflove
you two and two singing a palinode
march to your several homes by niobes stone
and offer up two tears apiece thereon
that it may change the name as you must change
and of a stone be called weepingcross
because it standeth cross of cynthias way
one of whose names is sacred trivia
and after penance thus performd you pass
in like set order not as midas did
to wash his gold off into tagus stream
but to the well of knowledge helicon
where purged of your present maladies
which are not few nor slender you become
such as you fain would seem and then return
offering your service to great cynthia
this is your sentence if the goddess please
to ratify it with her high consent
the scope of wise mirth unto fruit is bent

cyn
we do approve thy censure belovd crites
which mercury thy true propitious friend
a deity next jove beloved of us
will undertake to see exactly done
and for this service of discovery
performd by thee in honour of our name
we vow to guerdon it with such due grace
as shall become our bounty and thy place
princes that would their people should do well
must at themselves begin as at the head
for men by their example pattern out
their imitations and regard of laws
a virtuous court a world to virtue draws

exeunt cynthia and her nymphs followed by arete and crites—
amorphus phantaste etc go off the stage in pairs singing the following

palinode

amo
from spanish shrugs french faces smirks irpes and all
affected humours

chorus  good mercury defend us

and to the well of knowledge haste
where purged of your maladies
you may of sweeter waters taste
and with refined voice report
the grace of cynthia and her court

exeunt

                                  the epilogue

gentles bet known to you since i went in
i am turnd rhymer and do thus begin
the author jealous how your sense doth take
his travails hath enjoined me to make
some short and ceremonious epilogue
but if i yet know what i am a rogue
he ties me to such laws as quite distract
my thoughts and would a year of time exact
i neither must be faint remiss nor sorry
sour serious confident nor peremptory
but betwixt these  lets see to lay the blame
upon the childrens action that were lame
to crave your favour with a begging knee
were to distrust the writers faculty
to promise better at the next we bring
prorogues disgrace commends not any thing
stiffly to stand on this and proudly approve
the play might tax the maker of selflove
ill only speak what i have heard him say
by—tis good and if you liket you may

ecce rubet quidam pallet stupet oscitat odit
hoc volo nunc nobis carmina nostra placent
