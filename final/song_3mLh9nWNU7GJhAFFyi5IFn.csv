i think you got the best of me
youre sleepin with the enemy
you left me all alone alone alone alone
the beat drops im solo
my heart stops i already know
you left me all alone alone alone alone

chorus
im sick and tired of the mess you made me
youre never gonna catch me cry oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you die oohwhoa oohwhoa
without me youre nothing oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you die oohwhoa oohwhoa

verse 2
ive let go finally over you
this drama that you put me through
im better all alone alone alone alone
the beat drops youre solo
its last call and its gotten old
now look whos all alone alone alone alone

chorus
im sick and tired of the mess you made me
youre never gonna catch me cry oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you die oohwhoa oohwhoa
without me youre nothing oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you die oohwhoa oohwhoa
you might also likebridge
i trusted you
you were the first
then you lied
and it gets worse
you broke me down
now just look around
whos all alone
whos all alone now

chorus
im sick and tired of the mess you made me
youre never gonna catch me cry oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you die oohwhoa oohwhoa
without me youre nothing oohwhoa oohwhoa
you must be blind if you cant see
youll miss me til the day you dieembed"
