im just looking out the window and its cold outside
there are two boys yelling behind me and im terrified
counting trees as they pass me by
and im trying not to look across the aisle
cause mayas letting dan put his hand up her skirt
and shes got her hand down his pants

prechorus
i know the driver sees it
i know hes peeking in the rearview mirror
he says nothing
trying to ignore it its fucking boring
im quietly observing‚ im saying nothing

chorus
no ones watching us‚ dont give a fuck
wheels on the bus
im holding it down up in the front
wheels on the bus
ooh‚ ooh ooh
wheels on the bus

verse 2
now ima light it up and pass it
puff‚ puff and pass it
dont be a dick and babysit cmon just pass it over here
counting cars as they pass me by
and im trying not to look a row behind me
cause jasons got his ass on the glass
and i hate him‚ driver hit a bump fast
