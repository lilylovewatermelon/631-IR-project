when will we be paid for the work weve done
when will we be paid for the work weve done

verse 1
we have worked this country from shore to shore
our women cooked all your food and washed all your clothes
we picked all your cotton and laid the railroad steel
worked our hands to the bone at your lumber mill i said

chorus
when will we be paid for the work weve done
when will we be paid for the work weve done

verse 2
weve fought in your wars in every land
to keep this country free yall for women children and men
but anytime we ask for pay alone
thats when everything seems to turn out wrong
weve been beat up beat up called names called names shot down and stoned
but every time we do right someone say we wrong

chorus
when will we be paid for the work weve done
when will we be paid for the work weve done

we have given our sweat and all our tears
we stumbled through this life for more than 300 years
weve been separated from the language we knew
stripped of our culture people you know its true tell me now

chorus
when will we be paid for the work weve done
when will we be paid for the work weve done

outro
will we ever be proud of my country tis of thee
will we ever sing out loud sweet land of liberty
when will we be paid for the work weve done
tell me now for the work weve done
will we ever have peace and harmony
i wanna know will we ever be paid
when will we be paid for the work weve doneembed"
