when your down and out
and you cant go on
when the road you walk
and the tears you cry
start to sink too much
look inside yourself look inside yourself
for the strength to pull through for the strength to pull through
gotta set your sights
it will be alright
coz it all comes down to you

you can get it you can get it
you can have it all
you can win it
never have to fall
if the fires in your eyes if the fires in your eyes
everyday is a brand new start
you can get it you can get it
you can take the prize
you can own it
if hope is in your eyes
all you got to do is fight all you got to do is fight
you can get it you can get it you can get it you can get it tonight

and you cant breathe free
and the friends you made dont return the calls
and pretend you dont exist
look into my eyes look into my eyes
coz you can always count one me

you can have it all
you can win it
never have to fall
if the fires in your eyes if the fires in your eyes
everyday is a brand new start

if hope is in your eyes
all you got to do is fight all you got to do is fight

and youll get there soon yeah youll get there

never have to fall
if the fires in your eyes if the fires in your eyes
everyday is a brand new start
