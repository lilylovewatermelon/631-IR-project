sunshine beatin on the good times
moonlight raisin from the grave
string band playing wornout honkytonks
pretty young thing goin dancin in the rain

verse 2
highheel lady spittin at the nickajacks
businessman with a needle and a spoon
coyote chewin on a cigarette
pack o young boys goin howlin at the moon

chorus
hey darlin sleepin on the blacktop
hey darlin runnin through the trees honey
hey darlin leavin for the next town
lessn my sense catches up with me

verse 3
three dead in a crash on the number 4
two witnesses below and up high
not sure whose will be done
you can call me a sinner for wonderin why

chorus
hey darlin sleeping on the blacktop
hey darlin running through the trees honey
hey darlin leaving for the next town
lessn my sense catches up with me
see colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 4
corn liquor tastes sweeter in this town
could it be its the same as the last
i swear ive seen your face elsewhere before
just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

chorus
hey darlin sleeping on the blacktop
hey darlin running through the trees honey
hey darlin leaving for the next town
lessn my sense catches up with me
hey darlin sleeping on the blacktop
hey darlin running through the trees honey
hey darlin leaving for the next town
lessn my sense catches up with me

outro
