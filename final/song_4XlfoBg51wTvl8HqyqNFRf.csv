i can remember a place i used to go
chrysanthemums of white they seemed so beautiful
i can remember i searched for the amaranth
id shut my eyes to see
verse 2
oh how i smiled then so near the cherished ones
i knew they would appear saw not a single one
oh how i smiled then waiting so patiently
id make a wish and bleed

chorus
while i waited i was wasting away
while i waited i was wasting away

verse 3
i can remember dreamt them so vividly
soft creatures draped in white light kisses gracing me
i can remember when i first realized
dreams were the only place to see them

chorus 2
while i waited i was wasting away
while i waited i was wasting away
while i waited i was wasting away
hope was wasting away
faith was wasting away
i was wasting away

i never never wanted this
i always wanted to believe
i never never wanted this
how could i have become
i never never wanted this
but from the start id been deceived
i never never wanted this
how could i have become

i never never wanted this
i always wanted to believe
i never never wanted this
i never never wanted this
but from the start id been deceived
i never never wanted this

bridge 2
inside a crumbling effigy
but you promised
so dies all innocence
but you promised me

chorus 2
while i waited i was wasting away
while i waited i was wasting away
while i waited i was wasting away
hope was wasting away
faith was wasting away
i was wasting awayembed"
