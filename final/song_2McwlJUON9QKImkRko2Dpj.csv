with you although i am poor i feel like a king
with you
with you though i have nothing i feel i have everything

but without you my dreams will soon fade away
id be here crying day after day ohh
promise me youll never never never
never leave me

oh when im with you
with you oh life means everything to me
with you
with you just like a child im happy as i can be

but without you im lost like a child left alone
crying for its mother and wishing she was home
i know i know i know i know
i know youll never never never leave me

ohh you are my love
for your wonderful wonderful wonderful love i live
you are my life
for your wonderful love my life id gladly give

for only when im with you
with you oh do i do i do i feel the way that i do

id be here crying day after day ohh
