headlights on an interstate
seems like im running late
but i know im only headed down the drain
an empty bottle and another shot
i give it everything i got
but nothing can seem to numb this pain

prechorus
where im going wont be far
too much whiskey and poor choices
and selfinflicted scars

chorus
baby dont cry for me when im gone
dont be surprised if it dont take too long
just know i loved you with all of my heart
just too much whiskey and poor choices
and selfinflicted scars

verse 2
i remember being a child
never dreamed of running wild
but something just slipped into my veins
take a pill and id wash it down
then id find myself running round
the devil on my back drives me insane

onenight stands and old guitars
too much whiskey and poor choices
and self inflicted scars

chorus
baby dont cry for me when im gone
dont be surprised if it dont take too long
just know i loved you with all of my heart
just too much whiskey and poor choices
and them selfinflicted scars

bridge
baby i know that youve been praying
for an old soul that aint worth saving
you hold me together when im falling apart
after too much whiskey and poor choices
and them selfinflicted scars

outro
you hold me together when im falling apart
after too much whiskey and poor choices
and them selfinflicted scarsembed"
