verse 1
once upon a time we swore not to say goodbye
something got a hold of us and we changed
then you sat alone in pride
and i sat at home and cried
howd our fairytale just end up this way

prechorus
we went round for round til we knocked love out
we were laying in the ring not making a sound
and if thats a metaphor of you and i
why is it so hard to say goodbye

chorus
i cant wait to hate you make you pain like i do
still cant shake you off still cant shake you off
i cant wait to break through these emotional changes
seems like such a lost cause
i cant wait to face you break you down so low
theres no place left to go
i cant wait to hate you oh

ooh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
and i wish i could press reset and feel that feeling again
i sit and press rewind and watch us every night
wanna pause it but i cant make you stay just gotta let it play

prechorus
we went round for round til we knocked love out
we were laying in the ring not making a sound
and if thats a metaphor of you and i
why is it so hard to say goodbye why

chorus
i cant wait to hate you make you pain like i do
still cant shake you off still cant shake you off

im tired of tryna fake through
but theres nothing i can do
