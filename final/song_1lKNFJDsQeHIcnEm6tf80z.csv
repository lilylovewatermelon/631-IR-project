you talk about life you talk about death
and everything in between
like its nothing
and the words are easy

you talk about me and talk about you
and everything i do
like its something
that needs repeating

prechorus 1
i dont need an alibi
or for you to realize
the things we left unsaid
are only taking space up in our heads

make it my fault win the game
point the finger place the blame
it does me up and down
it doesnt matter now

chorus 1
cause i dont care if i
ever talk to you again
this is not about emotion
i dont need a reason not to
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likecare what you say
or what happened in the end
this is my interpretation
and it dont dont make sense

verse 2
the first two weeks turn into ten
i hold my breath and wonder when
itll happen
does it really matter

if half of what you said is true
and half of what i didnt do
could be different
would it make it better

prechorus 2
if we forget the things we know
would we have somewhere to go
the only way is down
i can see that now

chorus 1
cause i dont care if i
ever talk to you again
this is not about emotion
i dont need a reason not to
care what you say
or what happened in the end
this is my interpretation
and it dont dont make sense

bridge
its really not
such a sacrifice

chorus 2
if i
ever talk to you again
this is not about emotion
i dont need a reason not to

care what you say
or what happened in the end
this is my interpretation
and it dont dont make sense

outro
and it dont have to make no
sense to you at all
cause this is my interpretation
