woman panting

verse 1
you hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin wrong
you stylish when you got nothin on yeah
and all i do is make these fuckin songs
so finally i made a fuckin song
and now she comin closer
up she goes she wanna jump my bones
you want it dont ya
i was a soldier now im comin home the war is over
kick down the door i hold your bends you never break
you need to smell your sweet aroma
see i knows you smell like cinnamon kissin your lips
i lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
my dick on business trips
my tongue twistin is ticklin just a little bit
im swimmin inside of your skin like a river
in the caribbean

bridge
its okay that you like it babe i like it baby
and its alright that you misbehave
its okay to be this way this way
to live this way baby baby ooh baby

right now lets go get lost
jet ive been way too high for way too long
im so exhausted
whether thats your mind or line we still get crossed
first your name is gone
never understand until you have to stand alone
can i have a hand to hold
a bandaid for my damaged soul i paint the planet gold

they didnt want a man when it was man im broke
and now they know me and what i dont need

the way we are im takin care of each and every part
i open up your legs and go straight for your heart
the way we are the way we are
