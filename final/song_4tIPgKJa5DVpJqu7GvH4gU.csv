im from the city of the codeine candy paint with fallin screens
diamonds in my grill and ear you know i live a ballers dream
my music gotta be screwed up i came in the game and moved up
a lot of people hate the fact that mike jones blew up
i got diamonds shinin on my cross candy blind me from the gloss
i keep my hand on nina ross for haters who wanna break me off
84s underneath my ride 45 keep it by my side
mob until i die females fall when i pass by
