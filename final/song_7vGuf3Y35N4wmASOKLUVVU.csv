yeah id rather be a lover than a fighter fighter
cause all my life ive been fighting
never felt a feeling of comfort oh
and all this time ive been hiding
and i never had someone to call my own oh nah
im so used to sharing
love only left me alone
but im at one with the silence

chorus
i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been silent for too long

drop
ive been quiet for too long
ive been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been quiet for too long

verse 2
im in need of a savior savior but im not asking for favors
my whole life ive felt like a burden
i think too much and i hate it
im so used to being in the wrong im tired of caring
loving never gave me a home so ill sit here in the silence

i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been silent for too long

drop
ive been quiet for too long
ive been quiet for too long
i found peace in your violence
cant tell me theres no point in trying
im at one and ive been quiet for too long124embed"
