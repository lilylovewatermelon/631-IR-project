quiet room
san francisco

what the hell was all
that talkin round
where is it now sunny california
i wake with you i feel your coat sleep late afternoons
i hitched along but i turned wrong
how you moved me along with your shepherd songs
every time you opened up to singâ€¦

the still sun never moves across the sky
funny thing time
she made you mine
and shell rob you blind

lay down in your new town
walk the ground
glass and houses fill the fields

now the moon sees everything
in this sanitarium
can i get through like the moon gets through
across the sea
treacherous
and now youve gone after all weve known
and after all that ive been told
californias cold
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likelay down in your new town
walk the ground
how you made me weep on sansom st
and how you made the weather comeembed"
