a ring at the pawn shop and a crib for the kid
i heard some word there was work up in hindman
im going tomorrow and hope that there is
my sweat and my wages they dont seem to weigh out
im gettin more aches than im gainin in gold
whoever said you could raise you a family
just aworkin your ass off knee deep in coal

well the sign at the church says ill reap what im sowin
but i aint lost sleep itll come in due time
and if the lord wants to take me im here for the taking
cause hells probably better than tryin to get by
you can see me on the front page itll be out tomorrow
a boy in his twenties shot down in his prime
for trying to hold up the texaco station
theyll say i was desperate theyre probably rightsee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like1embed"
