everybody wanna ask where i came from
young kid who bang drums money dont you worry ima make some
somebody changin the world it only takes one
never scared of death but i aint ready for that day to come
a million people in the world i dont hate one
even them dummies robbin people with some fake guns
make mistakes young boy thats just what i heard
and you dont ever figure out what you dont wonder first
i got another verse invincible and nothin hurts
a hundred words comin up with whatll have your bubble burst
we can just fuck you dont need to take my number first
gettin right to it i aint really tryna cuddle first
i used to try everything with her but nothin worked
got her backwards like she heard the thunder first
these are the days of our lives and i aint lyin kid
bein free tell me what kind of crime that is
it said it cant let me spit a couple sentences
always good penmanship make sure you all remember this
you just entered into blue slide park
the place where dreams comin true thats where you find heart
up until the sun come up yeah my crew grind hard
see me out throughout the day but you wont find me in the dark
say im smart with remarks such remarkable bars
who knew this music would get me a couple cars
that just sit in park cause im out somewhere travelin
mackin on the preschool honeys you were somewhere tattlin
mac has been known to always spaz again
every single track with him oh hes just so talented
dream of countin money til my fingers get some calluses
king with many palaces a fuckin golden fork to eat my salad with
i observe askin what did he design
i see an artificial future for a digital mind
muhammad ali yeah im him in his prime
just that normal kid in class you was sittin behind
didnt really pay attention to him spittin his rhymes
but now you see his car try gettin inside
no hell no
haha i wanna go back home

keep it hold up cant remember what the days like
late night cant remember what the days like
reminiscin on stop signs and brake lights
cause it seems that im always on the move move move
when they gonna let me back home
yeah
i wanna go back home
i wanna go back home10embed"
