you know whats kinda funny
just seeing you sitting here all by yourself in your uniform
sung
you remind me of a girl i once knew
gah by now she’s well in middle age
probably 41 42

jenna spoken
huh thank you

dr pomatter spoken
what oh my god no no no no
sung
she was a waitress at a shop i used to frequent quite a lot
nice teeth and small hands and snuck me goodies i couldn’t afford then
she was sweet to me
reminds me of you

jenna spoken
hmm oh well nobody ever really notices me that way so

dr pomatter spoken
somebody did right

jenna spoken
hmm
dr pomatter spoken
no because you have the the baby youd
sung
shed make the pies fresh every day
like you i guess but i must say
if pies were books yours would be shakespeares letters
you remind me of her but better

it only takes a taste
when its something special
it only takes a taste
when ya know its good
sometimes one bite is more than enough
to know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of

jenna
that reminds me of a thing we would say
me and my momma in the kitchen when wed bake
shed say jenna you can tell the whole story with a taste

dr pomatter
yeah no thats exactly what i mean
i swear that as those flavors mixed and melted i could hear the sirens sing
it was truly something special one taste and i want the whole thing

i must say
it felt like i was carried away
intoxicated made me escape the room i was in
i cant help but wonder how your hands must have felt
creating such a masterful thing
you might also likejenna
just one bite
caused all that wondering

dr pomatter
it only takes a taste

jenna  dr pomatter
it only takes a taste when you know its good
sometimes one bite is more than enough
to know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of1embed"
