couldnt wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all i could think about
a little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
fivehundred dollars it was mine all mine and i never wanted nothing more

verse 2
i took katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
just a fool trying to play it cool hoping shed let me cross the line
i was praying that she couldnt tell i never been that far before
the first times a one time feeling and i never wanted nothing more
no i never wanted nothing more

chorus
well im what i am and im what im not
im sure happy with what ive got
i live to love and laugh a lot
and thats all i need

verse 3
my buddies all tried to change my mind
but i told them that id thought it through
katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say i do
her little ring is a little thing but its all i could afford
now shes mine all mine till the day i die and i never wanted nothing more

verse 4
one sunday i listened to the preacher and i knew he was preaching to me
i couldnt help it i walked up front and i got down on my knees
right then and there i swear i changed when i found the lord
glory hallelujah good god almighty i never wanted nothing more

chorus
well im what i am and im what im not
im sure happy with what ive got
i live to love and laugh a lot
and thats all i need

outro
never wanted nothing more
and i never wanted nothing moreembed"
