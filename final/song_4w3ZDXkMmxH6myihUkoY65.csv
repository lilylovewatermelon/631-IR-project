every time i do it i do it for my hood
and every time i do it i do it for yo hood
and every time i do it i do it for they hood
its understood i do it for the hood

verse 1
the streets love jeezy and i love em back
if i still had work id front ya a sack
its all gravy still reaching wit my words
and make em feel good like the first and the third
take you back when i was sixteen wit a bankroll
posted on a corner like a light pole
they used to call us track stars
before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
and everybody on the block got the same agenda
hustle from the beginning of january til the end of december
wasnt smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
on that hen dog straight got a nigga drinking brown 711 nigga you know
you know 10 to 4 shake em up talk shit get my drink and let em go
even when im on the road the gangstas stay in touch
why the fuck you think they love me so much ha ha

hook x2

verse 2
im talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
it aint nothing we hearing shots all night
ford taurus pulls up everybody run
white boys jump out pointing wit they guns 50 50
ford taurus leave everybody came back
hope dem boyz didnt find my sack
real recognize real i suppose
i guess thats why the gangstas be at all my shows
got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
still catch me in the jects fuckin wit them hoes projects
like coocoo cal
lord i wish mad lou could see me now
wish gold mouth was home mel man was free
a lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me
closest i ever been to commercial when i watch tv
and everybody know i rep these streets faithfully
