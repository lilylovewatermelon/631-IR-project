maybe i act on confused behavior
maybe waves crash like semitrailer
maybe ill spend my offtime without you
it seems like we need our own space

and all this time i wasted away
i do not feel good unless you stay stay stay
and all the time i chased you away
simply to catch back up with

chorus
you
your solitude is welcome welcome
your attitude is welcome welcome
your solitude is welcome welcome
your attitude is welcome

verse 2
all you see is red lights behind me
maybe this isnt what you wanted baby
and i dont blame you falling backwards
no ones ever quite confused you this way

prechorus
and all this time we wasted away
we dont feel good unless were gray gray
and all the times i chased you away
i simply dont feel good
