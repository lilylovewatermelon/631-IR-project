welcome
welcome to the end
do not panic there is nothing to fear
everything around you is changing
nothing stays the same
this version of myself is not permanent
tomorrow i will be different
the energy never dies
energy cannot be destroyed or created
it always is and it always will be
this is the end and the beginning
forever infinite
welcome
