the open road the path of greatness
is at your fingers
go be the one that keeps on fighting
go be the stranger
just put your foot in front the other
crow like a rooster
be all in all together something
fear is a danger

i say

chorus
spill out on streets of stars
and ride away
find out what you are
face to face

verse 2
the windows are the perfect picture
theyre always changing
go on get lost jump in the waters
when they are raging

i say
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likechorus x2
spill out on streets of stars
and ride away
find out what you are
face to face
once youve had enough
carry on
dont forget to love
before youre gone4embed"
