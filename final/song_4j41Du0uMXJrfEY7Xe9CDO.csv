all my life they let me know
how far i would not go
but inside the beast still grows
waiting chewing through the ropes

prechorus
who are you to change this world
silly boy
no one needs to hear your words
let it go

chorus
carnivore carnivore
wont you come digest me
take away everything i am
bring it to an end
carnivore carnivore
could you come and change me
take away everything i am
everything i am

verse 2
i will hide myself below
ill be what you wanted
kept inside i wont let go
till i burn beyond control

who are you to change this world
silly boy
no one needs to hear your words
let it go

chorus

wont you come digest me
take away everything i am
bring it to an end
make me fall make me bleed
go ahead and change me
take away everything i am
everything i am

never enough
who i am is not good enough
never enough
who i am

wont you come digest me
