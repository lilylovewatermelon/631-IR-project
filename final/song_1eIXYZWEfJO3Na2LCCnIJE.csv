said patience aint no virtue with you
i done wasted plenty time pacin around hate this coupe
you had bitches on the side i let my mind wonder too
you relentless nigga i dont need rent nigga
text me like im waiting for you to come lie to me
ruin my day sayin shit to hurt me i cant compete
still on the way i lay awake if youre not around me
im so on to you still gone for you

chorus
needin you to talk to me in your love language
show me yeah how to connect to you
help me understand how you speak your love language

verse 2
bad as i wanna be yours i cant get with your program
sex hittin like a slow jam stick around cause i want to
bad as i wanna keep focused
you remind me im imperfect and it sucks to admit
nobody put that purpose in me like you do still
nobody get that work up out me like you do
nobody get the truth up out me quite like you

call me like you got confessions queued up

call me like you dont regret missin this old thing back call me
when you know the difference between me and chickens

you dont wanna live
i dont wanna go ooh no
i dont wanna be alone oh
all that i know is mirrors inside me
they recognize you please dont deny me2embed"
