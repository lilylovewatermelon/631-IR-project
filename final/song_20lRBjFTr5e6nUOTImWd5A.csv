you could be waiting for a day that wont come
and you could be so much more than youve become
and i have found my feet 257 weeks
but you could be waiting for a day that wont come
you could be waiting for your life to begin
and you could be so much more than than youve been
and i have found my feet 257 weeks
but you could be waiting for your life to begin

verse 2
and its so sad
youre so good and im so bad
but you wont see me wasting the best thing i ever had
and its such a shame
that i cant tell you anything
you wont hear me still you endear me now

verse 3
hard to see past the window facing forward looking back
over years spent tracing wondering how you left your track
underwater breathing burns your lungs and breaks your back
but you could be waiting right here for a day that wont come

prechorus
and its so sad
youre so good and im so bad
but you wont see me wasting the best thing i ever had
and its such a shame
that i cant tell you anything
you wont hear me still you endear me now yeah
