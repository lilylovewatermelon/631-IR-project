man you really know how to get someone down
everything was fine until you came around
and ive been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
after all wasnt i the one who said
to keep your feet on the ground
man you really brought me back down

chorus
hold on to hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me

verse 2
you got me tied up but i stay close to the window
and i talk to myself about the places that i used to go
im hoping someday maybe ill just float away
and ill forget every cynical thing you say
when you gonna hear me out
man you really bring me down

chorus
hold on to hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me
see paramore liveget tickets as low as 211you might also likebridge
reality will break your heart
survival will not be the hardest part
its keeping all your hopes alive
when all the rest of you has died
so let it break your heart

chorus
hold on to hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
hold on to hope if you got it
dont let it go for nobody
they say that dreaming is free
but i wouldnt care what it cost me26embed"
