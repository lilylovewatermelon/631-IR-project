nights flying down the 10 nearly 2 am
happiness begins
days lifted in a haze we werent just a phase
we werent just pretend just pretend

i remember low lows and high highs
we threw our hands up palms out to the skies

chorus joe jonas joe jonas  nick jonas
it was fun when we were young and now were older
those days when we were broke in california
we were upanddown and barely made it over
but id go back and ride that roller coaster
it was fun when we were young and now were older
those days that are the worst they seem to glow now
we were upanddown and barely made it over
but id go back and ride that roller coaster with you
