fathers hands were lined with dirt
from long days in the field
and mothers hands are serving meals
in a caf√© on main street
with mouths to feed
just trying to keep clothing on our backs
and all i hear about
is how its so bad its so bad

chorus
its too bad its stupid
too late so wrong so long
its too bad that we had no time to rewind
lets walk lets talk
lets talk

verse 2
you left without saying goodbye
although im sure you tried
you call the house from time to time
to make sure were alive
but you werent there
right when i needed you the most
and now i dream about it
and how its so bad its so bad

its too bad its stupid
too late so wrong so long
its too bad that we had no time to rewind
lets walk lets talk
lets talk
its too bad its stupid
too late so wrong so long
its too bad that we had no time to rewind
lets walk lets talk

verse 3
fathers hands are lined with guilt
for tearing us apart
guess it turned out in the end
just look at where we are
we made it out
we still got clothing on our backs
and now i scream about it
and how its so bad its so bad

chorus
its too bad its stupid
too late so wrong so long
its too bad that we had no time to rewind
lets walk lets talk
its too bad its stupid
too late so wrong so long
its too bad that we had no time to rewind
lets walk lets talk
outro
long time lets walk lets talkembed"
