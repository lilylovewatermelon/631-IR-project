i watched you cry bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
you said you wished you did not love me anymore
you left your flowers in the backseat of my car
the things we said and did have left permanent scars

prechorus 1
obsessed depressed at the same time
i cant even walk in a straight line
ive been lyin in the dark no sunshine
no sunshine
no sunshine

chorus
she cries
this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
youre not even there

from love she tried so hard to save
