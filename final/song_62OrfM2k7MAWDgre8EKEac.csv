ive sung a lot of songs ive made some bad rhymes
ive acted out my life on stages with ten thousand people watching
but we are alone yeah and im singing this song for you

i know your image of me is what i hope to be
ive treated you unkindly many times but baby cant you see
theres no one more important to me
baby baby cant you see through me
we are alone and im singing this song for you

you taught me precious secrets
of the truth withholding nothing
you came out in front when i was hiding but you have nothing to hide
and now im so much better and if my words they dont come together
listen to the melodies listen to the melodies
cause my love ooh baby cause my love cause my love ooh
is in there ooh is in there hiding
baby i loved you in a place in a place in a place in a place
where theres no space or time

for only you only you ooooooooooooh
