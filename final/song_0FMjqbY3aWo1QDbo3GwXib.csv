verse
i think of you i havent slept
i think i do but i dont forget
my body moves goes where i will
but though i try my heart stays still
it never moves just wont be led
and so my mouth waters to be fed
and youre always in my head

chorus
youre always in my head
youre always in my head
youre always in my head

always in my
always in my
