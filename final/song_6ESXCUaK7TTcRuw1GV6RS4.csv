im tired of replacing my dreams
always twisting always screams
to follow down the strangest roads
in back seats indoors
and love what you want me to love

chorus bleachers
oh i will bleed
when you want me to bleed
but i dont want to know
too much of anything
because it all hurts me

verse 2 bleachers
come on dont push me down that road
always twisting always sold
i will follow all made up how youd like
in back seats indoors
and love when you want me to love

chorus bleachers
oh i will bleed
when you want me to bleed
i dont want to know
too much of anything
because it all hurts me
oh it all hurts me

being trapped in like a total weird bubble world
because theres a giant ocean frozen underneath its surface
and the cracks on its surface made it clear that there was warm water bubbling up from within
and i really wanna be grateful for the experience that ive had3embed"
