i want a new yellow ferrari from the 90s in the driveway
but i know that you wouldnt like that
i want it now i want it loud i want it my way
but everybody doesn’t vibe like that

chorus
dont tell me about the rules and break them
and dont tell me about mistakes
and make the same ones i have made before
dont say you love me more
better not say it
i met her at church
but she could be satan

verse 2
you and i are two oceans apart
were on earth to break each others hearts in two
and its hard with you
when im too far from you
i look at the stars do you

chorus
dont tell me about the rules and break them
and dont tell me about mistakes
and make the same ones i have made before
dont say you love me more
better not say it
i met her at church
but she could be satan
you might also likeoutro
youre la and im newbury park
but you’re the flame i use when it gets dark
youve got enough pain for both of us
ive got all these things im focused on
you treat all the rules like youre the queen
but you and i are few and far between17embed"
