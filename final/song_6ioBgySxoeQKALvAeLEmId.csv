hoo
hoo
come on girls
do you believe in love
cause i got something to say about it
and it goes something like this

chorus
dont go for second best baby
put your love to the test
you know you know youve got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then youll know your love is real

verse 1
you dont need diamond rings
or eighteen karat gold
fancy cars that go very fast
you know they never last no no
what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you til you cant come down
youll never come down

and maybe then youll know your love is real

verse 2
long stem roses are the way to your heart
but he needs to start with your head
satin sheets are very romantic
what happens when youre not in bed
you deserve the best in life
so if the time isnt right then move on
second best is never enough
youll do much better baby on your own
baby on your own

chorus
dont go for second best baby
put your love to the test
you know you know youve got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then youll know your love is real

express yourself
youve got to make him express himself
hey hey hey hey
so if you want it right now make him show you how
express what hes got oh baby ready or not

and when youre gone he might regret it
think about the love he once had
try to carry on but he just wont get it
hell be back on his knees
to express himself
youve got to make him express himself
hey hey

verse 3
what you need is a big strong hand
to lift you to your higher ground
make you feel like a queen on a throne
make him love you til you cant come down
youll never come down

bridge
and when youre gone he might regret it
think about the love he once had
try to carry on but he just wont get it
hell be back on his knees so please

chorus
dont go for second best baby
put your love to the test
you know you know youve got to
make him express how he feels
and maybe then youll know your love is real
