wish i could i couldve said goodbye
i wouldve said what i wanted to
maybe even cried for you
if i knew it would be the last time
i wouldve broke my heart in two
tryin to save a part of you

chorus
dont want to feel another touch
dont wanna start another fire
dont wanna know another kiss
no other name falling off my lips
dont wanna to give my heart away
to another stranger
or let another day begin
wont even let the sunlight in
no ill never love again
ill never love again
ooouuu ooou oou

oh

verse 2
when we first met
i never thought that i would fall
i never thought that id find myself
lying in your arms
and i want to pretend that its not true
oh baby that youre gone
cause my world keeps turning and turning and turning
and im not movin on

bridge
i dont wanna know this feeling
unless its you and me
i dont wanna waste a moment ooh
and i dont wanna give somebody else the better part of me
i would rather wait for you

chorus
dont want to feel another touch
dont want to start another fire
