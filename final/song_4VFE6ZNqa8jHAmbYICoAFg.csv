that sunday morning choir calling church doors open wide
that hallelujah shoot right through ya make you feel alive
that key under the mat you know right where its at
its waiting with the porch light on
dont bother calling no need for knocking just come on home
come on home my love is

chorus florida georgia line  backstreet boys
never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
now until the day i die unconditionally
you know im always gonna be here for ya
no ones ever gonna love you more than
god your mama and me
god your mama and me
unconditionally god your mama and me

verse 2 nick carter
loud as shotgun angels singing with the radio
praying with you every mile down any dead end road
you can tell me every secret that you been keeping
ill hold it lock and key
up with you all night holding you all night i never leave
you better believe my love is

chorus florida georgia line  backstreet boys
never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
now until the day i die unconditionally
you know im always gonna be here for ya
no ones ever gonna love you more than
god your mama and me
god your mama and me
unconditionally god your mama and me
you better believe it you better believe it

every move you make you know ill follow you wherever you go
baby you know my love is

chorus florida georgia line  backstreet boys
never gonna run dry never gonna come up empty
now until the day i die unconditionally unconditionally
you know im always gonna be here for ya
no ones ever gonna love you more than
god your mama and me
god your mama and me
unconditionally god your mama and me
