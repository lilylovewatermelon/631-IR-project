signs of love overshadowed by dreams
baby dont worry cause you aint alone
only time running days without nights
tears pass through

verse 1
he said im the one whos got to leave
i said nobodys really got to leave cause
i dont hear enough explanation
all i need is admiration
big frustration bro
he goes life is short we gave a shot
but didnt work honey cause we had
a whole lot going on and on and on

chorus
signs of love overshadowed by dreams
baby dont worry cause you aint alone
only time running days without nights
tears pass through

every time look at the picture in the frame
gaze in fascination so hard
you still think that is nothing but love
rain still falls
you might also likebaby i remember you had dreams
that were not tainted by sorrow
cloudy sky overshadowed by rain
baby dont cry

a love son replaced by soundless speed
you have created it again
countless tears falling down you will see
signs of loveembed"
