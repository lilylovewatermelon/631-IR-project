driftin off to the evening news
she said honey what would you do
if youd never met me
i just laughed said i dont know
but i could take a couple guesses though
and then tried to dig real deep
said darling honestly

id do a lot more offshore fishin
id probably eat more drivethru chicken
take a few strokes off my golf game
if id have never known your name
id still be driving that old green nova
i probably never would have heard of yoga
be a better football fan
but if i was a single man
alone and out there on the loose
well id be looking for a woman like you

i could tell that got her attention
so i said oh yeah i forgot to mention
i wouldnt trade a single day
for 100 years the other way
she just smiled and rolled her eyes
cause shes heard all of my lines
i said cmon on girl seriously
if i hadnt been so lucky
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeid be shootin pool in my bachelor pad
playing bass in my cover band
restocking up cold bud light
for poker every tuesday night
yeah id have a dirtbike in the shed
and not one throw pillow on the bed
id keep my cash in a coffee can
but if i was a single man
alone and out there on the loose
well id be looking for a woman like you

she knows what a mess
id be if i didnt have her here
but to be sure
i whispered in her ear

you know i get sick deepsea fishin
and you make the best fried chicken
i got a hopeless golf game
i love the sound of your name
i might miss that old green nova
but i love watchin you do yoga
id take a gold band on my hand
over being a single man
cause honestly
i dont know what id do
if id never met a woman like you5embed"
