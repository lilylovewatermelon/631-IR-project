how i wish i could surrender my soul
shed the clothes that become my skin
see the liar that burns within my needing
how i wish id chosen darkness from cold
how i wish i had screamed out loud
instead ive found no meaning

chorus
i guess its time i run far far away
find comfort in pain
all pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
hides my true shape like dorian gray
ive heard what they say but im not here for trouble
its more than just words its just tears and rain

verse 2
how i wish i could walk through the doors of my mind
hold memory close at hand
hold memory close at hand
help me understand the years
how i wish i could choose between heaven and hell
how i wish i would save my soul
im so cold from fear

chorus
i guess its time i run far far away
find comfort in pain
all pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
hides my true shape like dorian gray
ive heard what they say but im not here for trouble
far far away
find comfort in pain
all pleasures the same it just keeps me from trouble
its more than just words its just tears and rain
