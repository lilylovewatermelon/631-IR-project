i dont know what i want if im completely honest
i guess i could start a war i guess i could sleep on it
i dont know what i want if im completely honest
i guess i could start a war i guess i could sleep on it

prechorus
but hey there kids with guns
your neighbours complain but they dont know where they come from
i guess its just bad advice for someone so upstanding
so maybe just ask them twice or be a bit demanding

chorus
you dont know how to give love to anyone
you dont know how to pretend
you told your kids that theyd live long forever
but the kids dont wanna come home again
no the kids dont wanna come home again

verse 2
havent you any shame have you got no morals
teaching them how to aim no sadness and no sorrow
well hey there mother o mine
your kids are sick but theyre gonna be just fine
i said possibly not if you keep raising them this way
youre just leading them to die oh your disbelief and dismay

your neighbours complain but they dont know where they come from

chorus
you dont know how to give love to anyone
you dont know how to pretend
you told your kids that theyd live long forever
but the kids dont wanna come home again
no the kids dont wanna come home again

break

chorus
you dont know how to give love to anyone
you dont know how to pretend
you told your kids that theyd live long forever
but the kids dont wanna come home again
no the kids dont wanna come home again
no the kids dont wanna come home again
no the kids dont wanna come home

spoken outro
what did you just write that song about of all the kids dont wanna go home
they do well they do now dont they
they dont
you dont you dont wanna go home
then why did you write that whole song about it if we dont want to go home
you want us to go home but why did you write the song about how all the kids dont wanna go home
cause he felt like it
