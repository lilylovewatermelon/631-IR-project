cause all the roads they lead to where you are
and all the streetlights shine like they were stars

and we can do anything we can be anything
ill meet you tonight on top of the world
as real as it seems
youre only in my dreams

verse 2
look out across the water
faces of lonely daughters and mothers who care
but just cant be there

i have to find a way to show you i care
even if youre not there
