i cant make no guarantees guarantees no
half this shit ain’t what it seems like what it seems no
i cant trust you at the scene at the scene oh
you dont love me you a fiend aye you a fiend oh
i can’t give you what you need what you need oh
i see hoe shit in your genes in your genes oh
fuck that talk if it aint cream if it aint cream yeah
you dont know what you aint seen oh yeah yeah

verse 1
ok a snake can act a friend
i knew what eve didnt
they gon make this shit sound sweet
just as long as they got some to eat
but the minute that you slip they be the key witness
spreading lies through they damn teeth
til the day you off your damn feet
it be different
specially when they hear that beat kicking
see you in the whip they wanna be whipping
watch whoever on your passenger side
you might end up with your keys missing
niggas quick to talk behind the scenes
i ain’t really with that sneak dissing
shawty said i ain’t gon be shit
i said she don’t know what she missing
you might also likego ahead and give me my space
you aint eating off of my plate
ive been killing for a minute now
pay attention to the crime rate
competition i aint met mine
got a nigga making headlines
i gave niggas time to hop on
they just couldn’t meet the deadline

chorus 1
i cant make no guarantees guarantees no
half this shit aint what it seems like what it seems no

i cant give you what you need what you need oh
i see hoe shit in your genes in your genes oh
fuck that talk if it aint cream if it aint cream yeah

verse 2
i dont want attention from you
i seen first hand what the fuck attention could do
niggas know damn well they shouldnt be mentioning you
but how could they not
when you in a droptoptopnotchtopspot
told them boys it would go like this
name a young nigga who flow like this
all that hate i would get back then came from the same ones who know my shit
get me paid
grow my hits
ride my wave
blow my dick
shooting at a nigga you sure might miss
fucking with a goat aint no right risk

bridge
