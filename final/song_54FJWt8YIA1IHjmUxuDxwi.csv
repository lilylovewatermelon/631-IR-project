interlude jack harlow
mmm mmm mmm mmm
ahah

verse 2 jack harlow
i played you my first hit before it dropped
you were in the drivers seat and i was on the aux
you made the stank face thats how i knew it was hot
lookin back i gotta wonder if you would have thought
that my life wouldve changed like this
that every station in america would play my shit
that i would do a remix and i could take my pick
of any rappers that i wanted and theyd get on the shit
hmm i cant imagine you did
the way you see it aint no way that i dont have a new bitch
and it aint fair cause you know i got a whole lotta friends
thats gon tell me who they seen you on the avenue with uh
the playing field aint level thats how i engineered it
you dont know when ima pop up and when im disappearin
lately its been somethin i dont really like in your spirit
wallis lane made the beat and nickie jon engineered it uh

chorus jack harlow
she aint flyin in spirit
shes a delta bitch not the kind with the pyramids ah
you got somethin that im tryna experience uh
leavin comments got em all gettin curious
couple phone calls now we callin it serious
i say im in love when i fall for appearances
its a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
last one i did i caught a vibe with the bottle girl
verse 3 jack harlow
told her that im leavin but ill call when im here again
that was west virginia dont know when ill be there again
people in my circle wonder when ill be arrogant
feel like they cant wait to say i stepped out of character ah
she said that she wanted me to take care of her nah
she said she want me to london and paris her
she said do your thing long as i dont embarrass her
damn i aint even get to test out my character ah ooh

chorus jack harlow
she aint flyin in spirit
shes a delta bitch not the kind with the pyramids
you got somethin that im tryna experience
leavin comments got em all gettin curious
couple phone calls now we callin it serious
i say im in love when i fall for appearances
its a lotta clubs tryna call for appearances
last one i did i caught a vibe with the bottle girl1embed"
