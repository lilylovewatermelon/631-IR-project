yeah

verse 1
black dirty teeth in the crease
was the proof too good to be believed
its the cunt with the tongue
who belongs on broken knees
so far it occurs to me
that everybody in the world is afraid of me
just one more sin and down we go
but the news is out and i think im going to
kill myself or fuck myself or tell myself
about the only thing that matters now

prechorus
we bury what we fear the most
approaching original violence
is the silence where you hide it
cause i dont recognize you anymore

chorus
to each his own
life can do with one less watereddown excuse
if this is over you can tell me its no use use
just tell me its over

today we will deceive our better selves
into assimilating pain from something else
put on your face and show me why
behind the scenes we had to simply comply
now the community doesnt feel
any better than it used to be
i want to be a judge in a criminal case
you covered up did you cultivate
be yourself not yourself know yourself
cause no one seems to know you now

prechorus
we carry what we cant control
approaching original violence
in the silence theres a nihilist
who doesnt care and never did

chorus
to each his own
life can do with one less watereddown excuse
there comes a time where we canâ€™t take the same abuse
if this is over you can tell me its no use use

verse 3
drug out pissed on everythings the same
bitch and moan it doesnt matter nothings gonna change
i dont wanna watch another brother fucking die
so discarded fallen by the side
dont tell me its the only way
just another reason why you never take the bait
the trials the scheming the burden of the beast
both your faces turn your back on everything
you fought to save a dream
bridge
ooh
now that its over
when this is over
yeah

prechorus
we are the angels fear to tread
approaching original violence
were the silence well deny it
we cant continue on like this

chorus
to each his own
life can do with one less watereddown excuse
there comes a time where we cant take the same abuse
my god it wouldve taken just one word to stay from you
now that this is over you can tell me its no use
now that this is over you can tell me its no use use
just tell me its over

outro
it doesnt matter what you say
it doesnt matter what you do
we cant continue on like this21embed"
