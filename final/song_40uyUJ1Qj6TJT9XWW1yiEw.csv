havent had a lot of company in a long time
but if i were expecting some
id whip up a really—ugh—substantial meal
you see how strong i am heh
its from eating all this stuff

good healthy meal like the fillet

now thats what they call soul food
now you got blackeyed peas
carrot greens
collard greens
cornbread
watermelon
and for dessert
pork butts

eat heartily gentlemen

i got a really stressful day and i really really needed some food
something healthy like beets

showed you how good it is
well you may say i dont think id care for that
so you could also fix yourself ayou might also like1embed"
