some of the ugliest things took the longest time to make
and some of the easiest habits are the hardest ones to break
and im not asking for value nor the pain
but i am asking for a way out of this lie

chorus
cause i cant wait for you
to catch up with me
and i cant live in the past
and drown myself in memories

verse 2
welcome to nowhere and finding out where it is
and fixing your problems and starting over again
youre feeding your ego with what you can see outside
and youre killing yourself for not speaking your mind

chorus
cause i cant wait for you
to catch up with me
and i cant live in the past
and drown myself in memories

in memory
see shinedown liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likebridge
i wonder why you make believe
you live your life straight through me
i cannot understand why
you question me and then you lie
i will not justify your ways
i cannot show you an escape
i do not know you any more
i never knew you anyway

chorus
cause i cant wait for you
to catch up with me
and i cant live in the past
and drown myself in memories

chorus
cause i cant
wait
and i cant live in the past
and drown myself in memories
