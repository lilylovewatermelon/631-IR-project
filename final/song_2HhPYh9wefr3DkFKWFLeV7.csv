go ahead
throw your rocks at me
from your little glass house
and then take off running
youre no better than me
weve both made mistakes havent we

i wont undo what im doin
sit in judgment of what makes us human
i dont claim to be proud but
my head wont be hung in shame

i didnt plan it
but the light turned red and i ran it
and im still standing
its not what i wanted but now that its right here

i understand it
a story written by my own hand
its life biting right at your heels
i didnt plan it
but its finally something to feel
oh

look around you
aint no saints here baby
were all just looking for a little less crazy
and sometimes its a hard left turn
down a road you never thought youd see
you might also likei didnt plan it
taking back whats been taken for granted
and i cant stand it
im sick of the way ive been waiting to break free
i needed saving
and a good mistake needed making
maybe you need the same thing

something to feel
to race through your blood
and remind you youre here
to open your eyes and look around
and see the sky when youre underground

i didnt plan it
but thats life
and im finally feeling alive
its not right but its mine
and its finally something to feel1embed"
