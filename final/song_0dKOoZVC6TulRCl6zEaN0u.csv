third verse kardinal offishall

ey yo

they call me kardie
mr evolution
now you can dance while you think about the revolution
and while you vex having delusions of persecution
imma stay flawless an instrument of execution
out of many still grows one people
justice  still remain unequal
and im a diamond in the dirt
and there is no sequel
many try but they cannot replicate what we do
hear evil speak that evil
speak good to the hood there is no retrieval
think about while you sippin on your 
if my words could talk theyd say
hook tpain

i wanna go home with you
i wanna go home with you
now hear the choir say i wanna go home with you
i wanna go home with you
i wanna go home with you

now hear the choir say
chanting
now hear the choir say
