ive been a winding road oh i know you know
sometimes a stranger in my home
keep going back and forth through the open door
im still learning to be still

this girl aint going anywhere
this girl aint going anywhere
i can promise you this now i know for sure
this girl aint going anywhere

verse 2
ive run for miles and lost sight of where you are
but youve seen me all along
maybe im the last to know when ive gone too far
and yet im always by your side

chorus
this girl aint going anywhere
this girl aint going anywhere
i can promise you this now i know for sure
this girl aint going anywhere
