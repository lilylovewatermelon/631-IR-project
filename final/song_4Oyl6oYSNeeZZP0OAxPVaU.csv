verse 1
a loser hides behind
a mask of my disguise
and who i am today
is worse than other times
you dont know what ive done
im wanted and on the run
im wanted and on the run
so im takin this moment to live in the future

chorus
release me from the present im obsessin all these questions
why im in denial that they tried the suicidal session
please use discretion when youre messin with the message man
these lyrics arent for everyone only few understand

my people singin
eh eh eh eh
hope youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
people they rhyme like this were all impressed by this
they rip it flip it but these are just triplets
wrote this in three minutes three words to a line
its just poetry divided im the kind of guy
who takes every moment he knows he confided in
music to use it for others to use it
youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
life is up here but you comment below
and the comments will always become common
motivation to promote your shows next episode
so your brain knows to keep going even though hope
is far from this moment
but you and i know it gets better when morning finally rears its head
together were losers remember the future
remember the morning is when night is dead
chorus
release me from the present im obsessin all these questions
why im in denial that they tried the suicidal session
please use discretion when youre messin with the message man
these lyrics arent for everyone only few understand
please use discretion when youre messin with the message man
these lyrics arent for everyone only few understand
