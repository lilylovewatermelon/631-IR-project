lately ive been noticing
i say the same things he used to say
and i even find myself acting the very same way
i tap my fingers on the table
to the rhythm in my soul
and i jingle the car keys
when im ready to go
when i look in the mirror
hes right there in my eyes
staring back at me and i realize

chorus
the older i get
the more i can see
how much he loved my mother and my brother and me
and he did the best that he could
and i only hope when i have my own family
that everyday i see
a little more of my father in me

verse 2
there were times i thought he was being
just a little bit hard on me
but now i understand he was making me
become the man he knew that i could be
in everything he ever did
he always did with love
and im proud today to say im his son
when somebody says i hope i get to meet your dad
i just smile and say you already have

the older i get
the more i can see
how much he loved my mother and my brother and me
and he did the best that he could
and i only hope when i have my own family
that everyday i see
a little more of my father in me

bridge
hes in my eyes
my heart my soul
my hands my pride
and when i feel alone
and i think i cant go on
i hear him saying son youll be alright
everythings going to be alright
yes it is

chorus
the older i get
the more i can see
how much he loved my mother and my brother and me
and he did the best that he could
and i only hope when i have my own family
that everyday i see
a little more of my father in me
outro
a little more of my father in me
i hope everyday i see in me
in me
in me
i hope everyday i see
a little more of my father in me1embed"
