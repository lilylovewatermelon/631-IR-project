you were born inside of a raindrop
i watched you falling to your death
and the sun well she could not save you
shed fallen down too now the streets are wet

verse 2
body of water toxic and timeless
atlantic ocean new york skyline
i always get lost when i leave the village
so i couldnt come meet you in brooklyn last night

chorus 1
but i sing glory from my lowest
and i will say peace to the people i meet
while the world waits for an explosion
that instant of life that wipes the slate clean

postchorus 1
so dont be fooled no dont get lied to
love was always cruel
and dont act strange dont be a stranger
it happened to me now its happening to you
but if you take that train under water then we could talk it through

well if i could tame all of my desires
wait out the weather that howls in my brain
because it seems that its always changing
the winds indecision the sorrowful rain

verse 4
yeah i was a postcard i was a record
i was a camera until i went blind
and now im riding all over this island
looking for something to open my eyes

chorus 2
but i still sing glory from my high rise
and i will say thanks if youre pouring my drinks
while the world waits for an explosion
that moment in time when well be set free

postchorus 2
so dont stay mad just let some time pass
and in the morning youll wake feeling new
and if i dont come back i mean if i get side tracked
its only cause i wanted to
im keeping up with the moon on an allnight avenue
