we love doing shit from the real scratch organically
invisible scars been thru some war like the veterans
caribbeans to pacific ocean deep mentality
ashawn spook i keep it spookier than halloween
like halogen they aint hot without my plug
you could feel air different when im hopping out the suv
808 socks on hats down low im in my sweats
thats my high fashion lookin sophisticated than
all you fake rich rappers they aint never had a history
now we need a rapper background check and their credibilities
찔리지 다들 화려한 스티커 같은 놈들
접착력 떨어질 차례 또 뭐하고 사나 보자
marina del rey 향해 다시 나는 노 저어
눈을 감어 찾아 father let me talk just tryna focus
i aint tryna watch em cuz they all be lookin awkward
hollywood 근처도 못가본 바쁜척 하기 바뻐
opеra house to champs elysees concord
wiltern whеrever you name it they screaming the encores
puttin 808 on the map we bout to conquer
they smelling money on me that is natural no tom fords
낮춰 니 자세 인생은 오고 가지
오르막길 멋진 파티 뒤에 청손 누가 하리
같이 올라갈땐 잡지 내려갈땐 남이
되는 갑이 을인 척 의리인 척 잘 떨지 가식
you might also likestyliztik jones
i beat up the beat you punched by pacquiao
and everybody eat we bunch of crocodiles
its back to the hoodie goin back to macau
the alpha and omega nothing after is found
in a room of gladiators i am maximus style
we making these raps only facts is allowed
mostly meditate with a package of loud
laughing in the clouds relaxing in the flowers
never turn down this is maximum power
eating roscoes off the sun setting gower 
up to the sunrise countin money took hours
time flies when you running plays and its grind time
doing numbers in your head thinking einstein
the king got a mind like biochemists
the flyest image im cooler than cryogenics
the rod is vinige  of course if i go in it
and nine go with it the windows tinted mind your business
provided privileges ones with the grindest spirit
the lord forgive ya if you got a spine its timid 
the fine will win it stepping dollars in designer denim
running shit im carl louis in the rhyme olympics
the gold medalist you know about my fellowship
the shock is everywhere youre listening to the dream team
i know a little bit about life yeah same thing
bizzy
never die 절대 이번 판을 막판이라 생각해
한 방에 털어넣어 올인
너가 백 억을 벌 때 주위에 몰린
지금 아무 짝에 쓸데 없는 벌떼
내가 나가는 방향성 is everybody okay
원래 너의 것이 아니야 손 떼
안 좋은 손 버릇 툭 떼찌한다 꿈 깨
다 지나가게 되있지만 something is forever
다 질리는 느낌 뻘쭘한 뻘짓
구리다 선구리 빼 대가리 박아
집에 가서 조신하게 좆이나 잡아
애초에 알아봤어 you fake motherfucker
친구들 싸움 나면 도망가는 fucker
다음날 찾아와 괜찮냐는 fucker
쥐새끼가 쥐새끼지 신념 없는 fucker
you dont even listen to wutang motherfucker

ok im so unapologetic
between peace  keys for more static
the  some more the core was four letters
 ts for all measures
god bless the means for me whos more desperate
the grease blood over lees for lords seats
i flood the east without an ark from noah
we all bleed dont let the stream haunt the glow 
yeah its so game from legends looking back on where i came
it mightve gave me severage
all the pain sustained was a lane to heaven
write rhymes that could slay and sever
better late than deader
everybody dies late or setup
but with better days than looking at the date its never
hearing my enemies cry was the sanest ending
they love my true spell cuz my pain expensive
touching a million alone was a lame objective
but put my family on was the main reception
cutting some family off with no pain receptors
commit you feel like will when you face with legends
brace your blessings they gotta make way for me
wish it get real they relatives are praying for me
the waves are sort of a maze from eight stories
red guts in amg laying dormant
illson
im feeling motivated my mind is meditated
you feeling agitated cuz your mind is medicated
오지랖 남들 얘기할 시간 im dedicated
keep myself educated keep my energy elevated
i do this daily basis whether you love or hate it
im never hesitating but im patient as an asian
this life im celebrating we gettin hella faded
i know you waited for this moment baby glad you made it
accelerating writing with performance like mercedes
and we bonafide feeling like im back in early eighties
we burning up the stages we patying with the ladies
but yall dont see the process behind writing thousand pages
time is limited but my limit is infinitiy
got no time for 시기 질투 aint no room for petty shit
i dont do no 기믹질 no this aint no mimicking
i aint just a energy for ya to come press ten a feet
baby this some realest shit 이 눈 먼 자들의 도시 속
im giving out this gold 가들은 못 보지 또
cuz they beyond some dumb shit got up the system
they be politicking nitpicking dead licking
ass kissing lipsynching clown 시끼
feeding everybody with the pisses poison you sipping
짜가 힙찔 black fishing thats some weak shit
니 voice 안에 정작 니 자신은 missingembed"
