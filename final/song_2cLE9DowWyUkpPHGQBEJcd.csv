ext cityscape  night

gotham city  the city of tomorrow  stark angles
creeping shadows dense crowded as if hell had erupted
through the sidewalks  a dangling fat moon shines
overhead

ext gotham square  night

pushers wave to hookers  street hustlers slap highfives
with threecard monte dealers  they all seem to know
each other with one conspicuous exception

a tourist family mom dad and little jimmy march
warily down the main drag  just out of a show  but the
respectable theatre crowd has thinned out and now 
playbills in hand  theyre on gothams meanest street

		mom
	for gods sake harold can we
	please just get a taxi

		dad
	im trying to get a 
		shouting
	taxi
three cabs streak pass and disappear  jimmy reads map

		jimmy
	were going the wrong way

nearby street types are beginning to snicker

		dad
	put that away  well look like
	tourists

two cops lean on their patrol car outside an allnight
souvlaki stand sipping coffee and chatting with a
hooker

the hooker smiles at jimmy  jimmy smiles back  mom
yanks him off down the street and glowers at dad

		dad
	well never get a cab  lets cut
	over to seventh

		jimmy
	seventh is that way

		dad
	i know where we are
ext side street  night that moment

deserted street lined with strippeddown cars  family
marches into the darkness

		voice
	hey mister  gimme a dollar

a derelict  nineteen or twenty acnescarred  his
ratty tshirt  i love gotham city  family moves on
pretending not to hear

		derelict
	mister  how about it  one dollar
		standing up
	are you deaf   do you speak
	english

tourists cross street  derelict doesnt follow

their pace quickens  a shadowy figure in the alleyway
a gloved hand slams a gun across dads neck

he crumples  mom grabs jimmy and backs up against a
brick wall too terrified to scream  the derelict races
across the street to join his confederate the street
punk whos already searching for dads wallet
moms ready to snap  street punk trains his gun on
jimmy

		street punk
	do the kid a favor lady  dont
	scream

tears stream down her face  she stifles a scream and
clutches jimmy  hes paralyzed with fear

the two punks chuckle and race away

moms selfcontrol disintegrates  she begins to scream
before moving to unconscious dad  scream echoes

ext cathedral  night

a darkly ornate gothic anomaly  old city cathedral once
grand long since boarded up

stone gargoyles gaze down from their shadowy rooftops

moms scream uninterrupted from the previous scene
echoes up  and one of the gargoyles moves

ext rooftop  night

six stories up

the punks  nick and eddie  hunker down on the tar
andgravel roof sizing up their take

		nick
	all right  american express
		tossing the credit
		 card at eddie
	dont leave home without it

a chill wind blows as nick counts cash  theres a
distant metallic clang eddie hears it and tenses up

		eddie
	lets beat it man  i dont like
	it up here

		nick
	what are ya scared of heights

		eddie
	i dunno  after what happened to
	johnny gobs 

		nick
	look johnny gobs got ripped and
	walked off a roof all right  no
	big loss

		eddie
	no man  that aint what i heard
	at all
		beat
	i heard the bat got him

		nick
	the bat  gimme a break will
	you eddie

		eddie
	five stories straight down
	there was no blood in the body

		nick
	no shit  it was all over the
	pavement

another sound  now even nick cant ignore the slight
tingle at the base of his spine

		nick
	shut up
		conclusively
	there aint no bat

at the opposite corner of the roof some fifteen yards
away at the end of a line a strange black silhouette
is dropping slowly implacably into frame

		eddie
	you shouldnta turned the gun on
	that kid man  you shouldnta 

		nick
	you want your cut of this money or
	dont you  now shut up  shut
	up 

both punks freeze at the sudden inexplicable sound of
boots crunching on gravel  they turn slowly  their
jaws drop

at the edge of the roof bathed in moonlight is a black
apparition

eddie freezes a choked gurgle in his throat  the black
figure advances and spreads its arms slowly majes
tically  great shadowy wings flap in the wind

on its chest is the emblem of a bat in an oval yellow
field glowing like a target in the darkness

nick drops to the gravel grabs the gun and fires twice
two clean hits  the strange black figure is knocked
bodily to the roof

		nick
	 im gettin outta here

he bends to retrieve his loot  eddie lets out an odd
preverbal squeal

 and nick sees the human bat back on its feet night
marish undead moving slowly and inevitably closer

panic  stolen money flutters out of nicks hands  he
scuttles frantically across the roof  the black spectre
is blocking his path to the fire escape  trapped like a
rat nick fires wildly

eddies face is pale  the bat treads calmly past  a leg
snakes out  a black boot catches eddie high on the chest
 lifts him cleanly off his feet  and sends him flying
through the air  eddie slams into a brick chimney and
slumps unconscious

the bat doesnt even break his stride  nick charges past
the black wraith toward the fire escape

a gloved hand slices through the air and nick pitches
forward his legs ensnared in a tangle of wires  scream
ing he drags himself across the gravel roof the bat at
his heels til theres no place left to go  nick
cowers on the edge

nick keeps shooting  eyes closed  hammer falls on an
empty chamber but nick still pulls the trigger  he
moans

bat grabs nick by the shirt hoists him into the air

		nick
	dont kill me dont kill me

nick opens his eyes the bat is standing on the ledge
of the roof  holding him out at arms length over six
stories of nothingness  a rasping voice

		batman
	youre trespassing ratbreath

nick looks down  far far below cars wink silently past

he looks up  and sees in the mirrored lenses where
batmans eyes should be the twin reflections of his own
stricken face

		nick
	trespassing  you dont own the
	night

		batman
	tell your friends  tell all your
	friends  i am the night

nick howls  batman heaves him roughly back onto the tar
andgravel surface of the roof  and then  casually
without a moments hesitation  steps off the ledge
into midair

trembling nick crawls to the ledge and looks over
finding absolutely no trace of the batman

nick is still screaming as we pan up to gothams moon
main credits roll

		  batman

int apartment  night

a womans apartment sparsely furnished but tasteless
modern chairs and coffee table in front of a tv set
highfashion magazine picture blowups all modeled by
the same girl on walls

in the foreground  a mans hand long elegant and
manicured manipulates a deck of cards doing a one
handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse

the tv news has highlights of harvey dents victory
speech

walls

		alicia
	pretty tough talk about carl

		jack
	dont worry about it  it this
	clown could tough grissom id
	have killed him by now

alicia knots jacks loose tie playfully about his neck

		alicia

own reflection in a nearby vanity  not interested in
her

	and besides he doesnt know

jack remotes off the tv

vanity  he runs a hand through sculpted hair checks his
fine threads

he smiles at himself before turning to the door

ext street  night that moment

eckhardt emerges onto the side street  and spies a
stretch limo idling nearby  leaning on the hood waving
hi is the dandyish jack napier  jacks odd driver bob
hawkins polishes the door handle

jack swaggers up and tosses eckhardt a sandwich bag

		jack
	i brought you a little snack
	eckhardt

eckhardt looks at the sandwich inside  its full of 100
dollar bills  the cop throws a nervous glance back in
knoxs direction and stuffs it quickly in his coat

		eckhardt
	why dont you broadcast it napier

		jack
	shut up and listen  harvey dent
	is sniffing around one of our
	companies

eckhardt bristles

		eckhardt
		testy
	thats my territory jack  if
	theres a problem 

suddenly jack grabs eckhardt by the lapels of his
topcoat

		jack
	eckhardt your problems are our
	problems

		eckhardt
		knocking his hands
		 away
	i answer to grissom not to
	psychos

	thinking about the future

		eckhardt
		sneers
	you mean when you run the show
	you got no future jack  youre
	an a1 nut boy and grissom knows
	it

jack claps a hand on eckhardts face and shoves him full
force into a wall  stunned eckhardt turns bright red
and grabs jack by the coat collar and whips out his gun

jack calmly takes his hand from eckhardts face as the
latter brings the gun up

		jack
		relaxed
	watch the suit

breathing heavily eckhardt lets go of jacks coat and
lowers the gun

		jack
		smiles
	see  you can make a good decision
	when you try

jack laughs insanely in eckhardts ashen face exits
when jack is out of earshot eckhardt mutters
menacingly

watching is only one in a whole vast bank of video mon

in the house  the background is blurry indistinct but
we seem to be in the midst of a vast dark cave

on another screen guests move backward with exaggerated
speed as a videotape rewinds  at the panel bruce wayne
hits a button  and watches commissioner gordon talking
to a uniformed patrolman

sparks fly  a safecracker in welders mask trains a
blowtorch on the office safe  behind him jacks hoods
are at work on the filing cabinets  jack stands watch
ing squinting through the fumes  he holds a silk
handkerchief over his nose and mouth

the safecracker kills his blowtorch and opens the metal

one of the hoods opens fire  half of his colleagues dive
back into the office looking for a rear exit  the
others take off across the catwalks

int factory floor  a moment later

cops shoot back as the hoods scatter  the cops bullets
puncture ducts and pipes from which gas and unpleasant
looking liquid begins to leak

all at once a corrugated steel door rises  and com
missioner gordon marches in with a squadron of uniformed
cops  he grabs a startled eckhardt by the shoulder

gone and follows with gun drawn

down on the floor racing throwing switches  anything
to create a diversion  gigantic machines roar to life
overhead chemical tanks rotate into place above giant
basins and spew out their contents

cops an jacks tail  he shoots at them and runs

hoods 3 and 4 scuttle across the elevated walkways
firing at the police and puncturing mare ducts pipes
and containers thereby releasing more chemicals  their
heads turn at the sound of a sudden clang 

 as batman drops onto the catwalk from above  for a
moment they gape  then hood 4 takes off running hood
3 turns and levels his gun at batman 

 who goes to his belt for a miniature spear gun and
fires at hood 3 planting a barbed hook in the hoods
jacket spinning him around  hood 3 drops his gun slips
and  with a terrible shriek  topples over the railing

the hook in his jacket jerks him up short leaving him
to dangle thirty feet above the factory floor

his gaze whips upward from the dangling hood to the
figure on the catwalk  as hes just realized there
is a bat

	oh my god

int chemical supply room  that moment

jack looking for an exit  behind him a steel door
begins to rise  more cops  he picks up the axe and
runs to bottom of iron stairs to huge steel containers
with danger  highly toxic written on them under skull
and crossbones  he swings the axe releasing a river of
wildcolored poisons

angle on cops

at the bottom of the stairs they retreat hastily bump
ing into each other as poisons flood toward them  jack
on other side of the chemical moat throws away the axe
and climbs the stairs

int factory floor  a moment later

a river of chemicals courses out into the main refinery
cops slip and slide on the wet surface of the factory
floor gasping on acid fumes

metal stairs leading to catwalk

jack climbs metal stairs  above him vats of churning
chemical sludge  and sluice gates opening on the east
river  its the waste dump

up on the catwalk batman slips into the shadows and
watches jack approach

jack reaches the catwalk  located above the center of
it is a glass paneled window propped open by a support
ing rod  beyond this is a forty foot drop to the swirl
ing black currents of the east river and freedom  to
reach the window jack will be exposed to police bullets
he makes a dash for it and has begun to climb up to it
on the catwalk railings when batman hurtles in and puts
him in a wrestling hold  jack struggles for a moment
then registers whats hit him and freaks out

batman moves  jack spins on batman

their eyes meet for a second

tight on batman

 a questioning look on his face  a spark

tight on jack

 a small smile plays on his lips

on trigger

 he fires point blank at batman

on batman

  he swings his heavy cape  the bullet ricochets
directly back at jack

an ungodly howl of pain echoes out from the catwalk
above  jack reels and staggers clutching at his cheeks
blood gushes from between his fingers

jack napier has been shot through the face

he staggers into the catwalk railing and topples over
just managing to grab hold of the lowest rung  directly
beneath him is a catch basin full of bubbling toxic waste

on catwalk  that moment

batman leaps and tries to grab jacks hand

jack drops but catches himself on a pipe  hes slipping

batman reaches gets a poor grip  he stares perplexed
at the stricken expression in jacks eyes

batman raises his hands in a gesture of surrender  as
the cops advance from both ends of the catwalk  he
flicks two tiny capsules at the nearby wall

a blinding flash of light  colors burst in a wild pyro
technic display  cops stumble backwards momentarily
dazzled as a thick wall of black smoke conceals batman
from view

a tiny grappling hook rockets out of the dense curling
cloud and catches on the edge of a window in the roof

the cops are firing wildly into the smoke  but the black
majestic figure of the batman whips upward disappearing

hes walking the same way still at a distance from
joker  but his recognition of him is growing

on joker

he reaches his car  driver rushes to get him out of
there

bruce now gets close enough to see jokers face through
the window  jokers car speeds away past him

other cars containing other mimes speed away too  a
silence descends  only the sounds of crying and ebbing
fear

bruce stands looking after joker
suddenly vicki is there

		vicki
	bruce

no answer  he hardly seems to notice she is there

bruce turns to her  sweat pouring down his face  looks
right into her eyes  she looks at him and sees the signs
of deep trauma in his eyes

		bruce
	im sorry vicki

he turns and disappears into the crowd

a few patrons are viewing paintings in a square open
atrium enclosed on all four sides by a balcony  one

waiter brings her a small parcel wrapped in brown paper
bearing a single word  urgent

		waiter
	miss vale this just arrived for
	you

as the waiter leaves she tears off the wrapper  inside
is a small white box and a note  scribbled in crayon

		      dear v vale
		 put this on right now

vicki opens the box to find a miniature gas mask

a strange hissing noise  a few feet away purple smoke
billows from airconditioning vent

trays of food crash to the floor as waiters pass out
art lovers drop forks go face down in their pasta salad

vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth
within seconds shes the only one conscious in the room

int museum  atrium  that moment

purple smoke plumes up as we tilt down toward the floor
of the atrium  patrons lie sprawled on the floor
twisted at odd angles out cold

the doors burst open and in walks joker looking dapper
in his street makeup and big purple pop artists hat
he is surrounded by his entourage of ugly goons  one is
carrying a huge ghetto blaster which is thumping out
music others are toting battles of champagne and glasses
and all have cans of aerosol paint sticking out of their
packets  this is a moving nonstop party  the joker
wanders past the artwork examining it with an apprecia
tive eye

		joker
	okay everybody lets broaden our
	minds

stepping over collapsed patrons he stops at blue boy
and holds up a pearlhandled cane to get a better
perspective  then he pulls a thin sharp sword from the
head of the cane and carves a big joker smile in the
canvas

manets barmaid a degas ballerina  all get the zorro
treatment  behind him his ugly cronies go to work
spraying paint on every canvas the joker has missed

he cocks an eyebrow at edvard munchs the scream

		joker
	i kinda like this one  leave it

int tea room  night moment later

vicki at her table still wearing the gas mask scared
as hell  the joker saunters over and pulls up a chair
he is flanked by two ugly henchmen one carrying a pair
of candlesticks the other the ghetto blaster

		joker
	i think its safe to take that off

as vicki terrified removes the gas mask the joker
signals to the two ugly goons who swiftly place the
ghetto blaster and candlesticks on the table and exit

the joker reaches for his lighter and switches on the
ghetto blaster which produces romantic music  a long
jet of flame shoots out of the lighter as he lights the
candles

		joker
		seductively
	youre beautiful

		vicki
		nervous
	thank you

	in an old fashioned sort of way

		joker
		with deep sincerity
		 into vickis eyes
	let me tell you what ive got in

down again

	oh im in trouble now

		vicki
	why is she wearing a mask

		joker
	well shes just a sketch really
	alicia  come here have a seat

	mask

alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask

		joker
	you see miss vale alicias been
	made over in line with my new
	philosophy  now like me shes
	a living work of art

were looking at alicias profile as the mask comes off
the side thats turned to us is indeed beautiful  but
the side we cant see sends vicki right over the edge
vicki lurches out of her seat knocking it over her face
frozen in horror

		joker
		modestly
	im no picasso  you like it

vicki tips a chair in his path  horrified she tries to
placate him

		vicki
	its great  but what can i do for
	you  i

		joker
		miming it out
	a little song a little dance
	and batmans head upon a lance
	tell me what you know about

he makes a flapping with his hands indicating batman

		vicki
	i dont know anything about batman

		joker
		getting sexy
	really well what do you think
	about a little you and me

		vicki
	i think youre insane

		joker
	i am  i thought i was a pisces
		brightly
	cmon lets make up  heres a
	flower

theres a bright purple boutonniere in his lapel  he
holds it up for vickis inspection as he moves menacingly
closer

		vicki
	no

the joker squeezes a concealed bulb  a jet of clear
liquid spurts out of the flower narrowly missing vicki

she gasps bumps into a table  acrid black smoke rises
from the floor where the clear liquid hit  acid

vicki backs into a waiters cart  her hand closes around
a pitcher  she flings it at the jokers head  dousing
his face with water

his hands go up and he doubles over shrieking makeup
running through his fingers and onto his suit

		joker
		like the wicked witch
		 of the west dissolving
	no  no  im melting  im
	melting  oh god  im melting
	help me

vicki is appalled  she moves towards him  her instinct
in spite of everything is to help him in his suffering
as she gets close to him and extends a hand he leaps up
abruptly taking his hands from his melting face ex
posing the hideous ravaged mess beneath the makeup

		joker
		gleefully
	boo

he advances on vicki

and then  suddenly  a skylight shatters  a caped
shadow drops to the floor of the tearoom  and all at
once the joker finds himself face to face with batman

on batmans wrist is a steel gauntlet  he aims it at
the joker  the joker stiffens thinking hes about to
be shot  the batman then fires the gauntlet the barrel
of which splits in two before sending two metal spikes on
wires in opposite directions either side of the joker

the metal spikes embed themselves in walls on both sides
of the atrium creating an escape wire for the batman
in the wink of an eye he grabs vicki and plunges over
the balcony leaving the joker stunned with amazement

int museum  atrium  that moment

the jokers ugly goons can only gape in awe as batman and
vicki swoop past  swinging across the floor and straight
through an arched doorway labelled exit

		joker
		recovering
	those toys  where does he get
	those wonderful toys
		to the goons
	well dont just stand there  go
	and ask him

the goons charge off

ext fluegelheim  night moment later

a sign on a black metal stand  closed for the day 
hurtles through the glass doors  batman and vicki
hustle through he points her to a side alley  batman
lobs a smoke pellet into the doorway of the fluegelheim

		batman
	get in the car

		vicki
	which car

vicki suddenly feels quite stupid  because  while
there are many cars parked along the side alley  there
is only one batmobile

		vicki
	 oh

the batmobile is sleek futuristic and well inde
scribable  vicki climbs in and is dazzled by a stunning
array of electronic gadgetry

		batman
	ignition

as he sprints down the alley a computer display on the
dashboard registers his unique voiceprint  a tinny
synthesized voice repeats the command

		computer vo

the engines are revving up as batman vaults in

jokers goons stumble hacking coughing blinded by smoke
they scatter as the batmobile barrels out of the alley

choking goons climb into their van and two cars

ext street  a moment later

the batmobile disappears round a corner in a cloud of
dust

ext streets  a moment later

pedestrians scatter as the jokers two goon cars swerve
hard left and barrel through a crowded intersection

ext streets  a moment later

batmobile approaches intersection at high speed  the
rightside indicator begins to flash  it seems incredible
that at this velocity batman should think it possible to
make a rightangle turn  as the batmobile draws level
with the corner a spike with a wire attached to it
rockets out of the side of the vehicle and embeds itself
in a wall  this enables the batmobile to turn the corner
without slowing down or spinning off across the inter
section  having completed the turn the wire separates
from the car which continues without losing speed

int batmobile  that moment

onlookers gawk as the sleek supercar rips up the pavement

mobile spins on its axis 180 degrees and goes back where
it came from

tion team  a huge piece of heavy machinery backs up
slowly and inexorably blocking the intersection

batman guns the engine  swerves left  tries to glide
past  and hits the brakes  stopping inches short of
a headon collision with a lamppost

he jumps out of the car  no chance to get through  on
lookers and construction workers cluster around them the
jokers van is two blocks back and coming up fast

jokers van does a uturn and rumbles sedately off

off the side street  the driver shouts into a radio

ext street  night that moment

batman and vicki race down the sidewalk  the car is
gaining on them  a sudden spray of bullets shatters a
storefront

batmans pov

he sees a ragamuffin little girl playwalking her doll
around the corner

he rushes and slides on the street pulling the girl out
of the way of a hail of bullets

on little girl

she is wideeyed  she holds up the dolly for batman to
see

		little girl
	is it halloween

batman smiles and rushes back to pick up vicki from
behind a parked car  the goons drive by again  batman
and vicki run into a blind alley

int alleyway  night

they watch the goons glide past the mouth of the alley
batman looks up five stories sees a catwalk

		batman
	how much do you weigh

		vicki
	 a hundred and eight

hes doing some quick mental calculations when the car
reappears  backing up  blocking their only avenue
of escape  galvanized batman unfurls a rope heaves a
batarang upward and grabs vicki roughly about the waist

		batman
	hang on

thugs pile out of the car  the batarang catches on the
catwalk and batman triggers the springaction reel on
his utility belt

bullets zing past as batman and vicki whip upward like
fish on a line  one story two stories and then

they slow  they stop  they dangle in midair as the
jokers goons advance  batman wriggles twists  vicki
screams

her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism
theyre stranded two stories up  sitting ducks

		batman
	whatever happens  dont let go

hes detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it
around vickis belt  he lets go

vicki rockets upward at blinding speed shrieking all the
way  batman his cape billowing plummets downward

vicki slams up into the catwalk and bobs on the line as
batman lands with a loud crash overturning a row of
garbage cans  the goons are on him in a flash  batman
manages to slam two goons into a wall but before he can
get to his feet goon iii slams a lead pipe into the back
of his skull

thugs circle around him  the lead thug holds his col
leagues back draws his gun and fires two shots point
blank at the yellowandblack insignia on batmans
chest  the body jerks they edge closer  and stop

		goon i
	 no blood

		goon ii
	jesus  who is it  check his
	wallet

		goon iii
	wait a minute

goon iii screws up his courage and crouches beside the
body  he examines the batmans tunic

		goon iv
	what is that

		goon iii
	some kind of body armor

		goon i
	hes human after all  take the
	mask off

ext rooftop  on vicki

vicki has pulled herself up onto a roof  down below the
thugs are removing batman 5 cowl  but at this height 
and this angle  she cant see his face  she reaches
for her camera bag

angle on goons

gaping at the shadowed unconscious face of bruce wayne
note  we never see his face and they cant either

		goon i
	get out of the way i cant see
	him

and at that very instant a flash gun explodes overhead

startled the thugs look up

		goon iii
	goddam its the girl

on vicki

a chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as
the goons open fire  she ducks back behind the overhang
holds the camera out over the ledge and keeps on flashing
using her telephoto lens

on the thugs

no sight of vicki  they begin to relax a little

		goon ii
	did you hit her

		goon i
	i think so  wax him

they turn their guns on bruce  ready to fire

a gloved hand snakes out grabs goon i by the coattail
and yanks him directly into the line of fire  goon ii
has pulled the trigger twice before he knows whats
happened

in one fluid motion bruce heaves goon is lifeless body
through the air knocking goon ii backward over a garbage
can  goon ii falls and cracks his head on the nearest
wall

goon iii takes a rabbit punch to the throat  on the way
down he catches a steeltoed boot in the gut

four seconds after all this began batman is alone in the
alleyway with goon iv

goon iv has his gun out but hes shaking too much to
pull the trigger  batman smiles  goon iv screams and
runs for his life

through all this vickis camera has been poised on the
ledge snapping away  batman looks up

ext rooftop  on vicki

she peeks down at the alley  limp goons everywhere
and in addition batman sees her

angle  on vicki

she thinks fast  she may have a clean photo of batmans
face  she removes the roll drops it down her blouse
and escapes across the roof

ext alley  on batman

batman sees her disappear  he looks around spots the
batmobile two blocks away  the car is still there the
chromesteel shields intact  but dozens of cops and
curiosityseekers are swarming all over the fearsome
machine  batman snorts in frustration

just then a giant threeton caterpillar winch rumbles up
the street toward the batmobile  hes about to get towed

he takes a radio transmitter from his utility belt

		batman
	shields open

ext street  on batmobile

two cops are crawling along the hood of the car  from
within they hear the tinny computerized voice

		computer vo
	shields open

the steel plates begin to retract

		batman vo
		over radio
	ignition

		computer vo
	ignition

		cop
	theres somebody in there

the stunned cops gaze into the batmobiles cockpit  then
tumble off the hood as the turbine engines roar to life
and the batmobile begins to move

cops and onlookers quickly clear a path  they stand there
stunned as the futuristic auto picks up speed and advances
toward the end of the block  the left turn signal flashes
dutifully  and the batmobile vanishes around the corner

pandemonium breaks loose as the cops bolt for their cars

						cut to

vicki

running across rooftops with much fear  she shimmies
down a ladder only one roof to go to get to the street
and freedom  she hears sirens

ext street  night

sirens wail  passersby stare slackjawed at the driverless
batmobile as it tears down the street passing darting
dodging buses and cutting off taxis  all with a squad of
cop cars in hot pursuit

on vicki

shes come to an obstacle  its a fivefoot drop to the
street below  vicki clambers down kerplunk and quickens
her pace tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder
every couple of steps

then suddenly she walks smack into batman

		batman
	not even a thank you

		vicki
		embarrassed
	well  i think you might thank
	me  you were as good as dead

		batman
	you weigh a little more than 103

sirens approach  batman takes her gently by the
shoulders

		batman
	youd better come with me

		vicki
	 where are we going

no reply

ext alleyway  night

street level  batman emerges pulling vicki

ext alleyway  night

batman sees the batmobile rounding the corner  with vicki
in front of him he steps directly into the path of the
onrushing headlights

		batman
	stop

brakes squeal  the batmobile stops one yard short of
batman and vicki  a moment later batman is at the wheel

sirens build  lights flash  the cop cars are now
visible behind them  batman floors the pedal the bat
mobiles powerful afterburners kick in and the hapless
cops kill their sirens as batman zooms off into the night
at 140 mph

						dissolve to

int batmobile  night

batman drives down a deserted stretch of road lined by
ancient tall pines  vicki tries to see out  batman
pushes a button and changes the polarization of the
glass  she cant see out  hes stoic

		vicki
	this is kidnapping

		batman
	looks like it

int batmobile  night moment later

vicki studies batmans face  he flicks a switch on
lights behind his head which dazzle vicki making it
impossible for her to see him

vicki frowns looks through the windshield and sees 
much to her horror  an enormous sheer cliff wall
looming dead ahead

wideeyed she looks at batman  still smiling he hits
the gas  speeding up  she lets out a scream

angle on cliff wall

suddenly the cliff wall vanishes altogether  revealing
in its place the gaping mouth of an underground cavern

batmobile zooms through  a moment later the cliff wall
 which is nothing more than a mirror projection  winks
back into existence showing no trace of the cavern

int batcave  night

another world  a vast dank world of perpetual night
unchanged by the centuries

stalactites hang from walls  cramped craggy passageways
spiral off mazelike descending into darkness

and then  an incongruous sight  vast banks of blinking
computers  a fullyequipped machine shop  a stateof
theart crime lab  this is the batcave

batman climbs out of the car  he keeps his distance from
vicki  she steps from the batmobile a little shaky

dappled pools of light create an almost operatic stage for
batman and vicki to alternately hide and reveal themselves
in  vicki steps carefully into the light  trying to see
batman better

		batman
	watch your step in here

vicki stops just over the edge of a deep black pit  she
kicks a pebble over  long seconds pass no sound  she
looks up  suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of
gymnasts rings  she backs away

suddenly vickis head jerks up abruptly  in the dim
recesses overhead bats are screaming  she shivers

		vicki
	bats  theyre  terrifying

		batman
	thats the idea

batman pats the cage of a wounded bat its wing is
splinted

		batman
	theyre also great survivors

vicki steps away repulsed

batman is rustling papers  she cant see what hes doing
she begins to examine a row of batsuits hanging nearby

		vicki
	what are these made out of

		batman
	it doesnt have a name

while he seems pleased at vickis fascination with his
lair he nevertheless remains guarded  vicki moves
toward batman intent on getting a close look at him

		vicki
	what are you going to do with me

batman realizing what vicki is trying to do moves away
from her into shadow

		batman
	youre going to do something for
	me

vicki again begins to approach batman  keeping in shadow
he moves behind a lab table  on the table amid the
beakers and test tubes are dozens of tainted products
makeup deodorant etc  nearby a computer printer begins
to chatter vicki watches information scrolling across the
main monitor

		vicki
		looking at the
		 tainted products
	what is all this

batman turns but keeps his face out of the light

		batman
	the police have got it wrong
	theyre looking for one product
	its much bigger than that  the
	jokers tainted hundreds of basic
	chemicals at the source

		vicki
	but then whole shipments of
	every product would be poisoned
	wed all be dead

		batman
	no  each product only contains
	one component  the poison only
	works when theyre mixed  hair
	spray wont do it alone  but
	hair spray and perfume and lipstick
	will be toxic and  untraceable

		vicki
		impressed
	how did you figure that out

no answer  batman steps away

		batman
	take this to the press

he hands her a thick envelope  she looks it over
cautiously

		vicki
	i may have some trouble with that
	a lot of people think you and the
	joker work together

		      batman
	do me a favor  dont flatter my
	enemy  the mans psychotic

		      vicki
	some people say the same about
	you

this is a new idea to batman  he pauses for a moment

		batman
	what people

		vicki
	well lets face it youre not
	exactly normal are you

		batman
	its not a normal world

vicki stares at him  shes suddenly chilled

		vicki
		peering into the
		 darkness
	why did you bring me here

		batman os
		a beat then from
		 another direction
	people need that information

		vicki
	but you could have just sent it

she looks around  where is he  no sound

suddenly he is near  she backs up

		batman
	youre right i could have  there
	is something else

she looks down  she has backed up nearly to the gaping
hole

		vicki
	what

		batman
	you have something i want

batman suddenly steps very close to her  she holds her
hand to her breast

		vicki
	what could i have that you want

batman swirls his cape up over her

her eyes widen  she starts to scream

he embraces her  she stops

and as she closes her eyes  he produces an ampule of
knockout gas which he breaks under her nose  she slumps

the room spins  sound of bats wings

						dissolve to

int bedroom  afternoon

vicki awakens  she feels her face  was it a dream

she steps shakily to the mirror  touches her lips  what
happened  did he  make love to her  then she touches
her breast  no film

		vicki
	the film  he took the film

phone rings

		vicki
	hellhello

		knox
	vicki  are you all right  you
	want me to come over there

		vicki
		seeing something on
		 her table
	no wait  allie

she reaches out of frame and brings the envelope batman
gave her up to the phone

		vicki
	allie can you still make the
	evening edition if i bring
	something to you

		knox
	just barely  is it hot

		vicki
	yeah its hot

		knox
	how hot

she hangs up

		vicki
	very hot

ext newsstand  day

the early edition of the globe carries the banner
headline

		    war of the freaks
	 joker and batman clash at flugelheim

a delivery truck cruises past dumping a bundle of after
noon editions on the sidewalk  war of the freaks has

 supplanted by more pressing news

		bruce
		thinking

alfred heads for the door  he stops and pulls himself
tall

int vickis apartment  afternoon

a knock at the door  vicki opens it and bruce is
standing there smiling a flower in his hand a shoulder
bag on his shoulder vicki is very surprised  she
recovers  still cool

		vicki
	well if it isnt the invisible
	man

		bruce
	you saw through me

hands her the flower  she looks at it warmly

		vicki
	come in

bruce enters  she looks at flower like it could squirt
something on her  bruce smiles  a beat of nervous
silence

		bruce
	so

		vicki
		hesitates then
	listen i know that were supposed
	to ease into this sort of thing
	but im really perplexed about
	you

		bruce
	yeah i know thats why i came
	i

		vicki
	you lied to me about leaving town
	you wont return my phone calls
	then i saw you march through
	bullets like you were trying to
	commit suicide

		bruce
	look i i did kind of lose it
	for a while  but some things just
	affect me

		vicki
	affect you  you were a totally
	different person

		bruce
	you have to understand crime
	i love this city

		vicki
	see now hes back the sweet
	caring guy but you seem to be
	at least two people  whats going
	on

bruce stands and looks out the window  torn

		bruce
	look vicki  theres something
	you should know

a knock at the door interrupts him  vicki lingers and
then goes to the door

peering through the peephole she sees a delivery boy

		vicki
	whos there

		delivery boy
	package for miss vale

delivery boy hands package in she signs and shuts door
vicki examines the mysterious package  its another
brownpaper parcel addressed in crayon

		vicki
	bruce im frightened

bruce looks at the parcel  grabbing his shoulder bag he
takes package to the kitchen

		bruce
	shut the door  just in case

		vicki
	be careful  dont set it off

she shuts the door  leaving bruce alone in kitchen

int kitchen  day

bruce opens his bag and lifts out a false bottom to
reveal his utility belt  he removes a tiny ultrasound
scanner from the utility belt  rather like a stetho
scope with a sonar display where the earpieces should be
 and runs it over the package

		vicki os
	what do you think

		bruce
	nothing ticking

int living room  day

vicki moves next to the door and listens

int kitchen  day

bruce takes a small gas mask from his belt puts it on
then slits the wrapping with a steak knife  nothing
happens

		vicki os
	whats happening  are you okay

she knocks  he jumps  hes tense  bruce carefully
pulls back the flaps  suddenly the top of the package
bursts open


int living room  day

vicki jumps at the noise

		vicki
	bruce are you all right

no answer

		vicki
	bruce im coming in

she grabs for the door and pushes through

int kitchen  day

bruce stares at the package  no utility belt in sight

		bruce
	very poetic

on box

 a gloved hand on a spring holding a bunch of dead
flowers has erupted through the top of the package and
wobbles about  there is a large embossed card in the
flowers  bruce lifts out the card and she reads it

		vicki
	roses are red violets are blue
	these flowers are dead you could
	be too
		suddenly very
		 frightened
	he sent something just before he
	arrived the last time

bruce nods her out of there  vicki heads for the living
room but before she can get through the kitchen door
the joker bob and one other goon burst through the door

		joker
	miss me

the joker sees bruce and stops in his tracks

		joker
	well ms vale another rooster
	in the henhouse

the joker pulls a gun and moves toward bruce  he traces
the outline of bruces cheek with the gun

		joker
	tell me something my friend you
	ever danced with the devil by the
	pale moonlight

bruce is alarmed  a memory fragment clicks

		bruce
	what

		joker
	i ask that question of all my prey
	before i send a draft through
	their domes  i just like the sound
	of it

bob chuckles  bruce is torn should he fight  should he
reveal his identity  suddenly he realizes his utility
belt is sitting in plain view on the kitchen counter
the joker has yet to notice  bruce backs slowly against
the counter shielding the belt from view

		joker
	vicki dont let my happygolucky
	appearance fool you  im really
	very upset
		getting angrier
	you were dining with me  talking
	art i was a man who was getting
	somewhere with a beautiful woman
	and then all of a sudden without
	a word of apology you take off
	with that sideshow phony

he moves closer to her

		joker
		bizarrely sincere
		 bad poetry
	im only laughing on the outside
	my smile is skin deep if you
	could see inside im really crying
	you might join me for a weep

he cups his hand under vickis chin  bruce charges at
him

a backhand from a goon knocks bruce off his feet  as he
reels backward he contrives to knock the utility belt
off the counter by sweeping his arm across it

bruce sprawls in a heap in the corner

in a flash  joker points his gun at bruce and pulls the
trigger  a tiny flag  bang  pops out of the
muzzle prompting great hilarity all around  joker
howls  bruce sweats

		joker
	came on i want you to shoot some
	snaps  make me immortal  itll
	be good for you

bob hands vicki her camera and bag and jacket

a scream from out in the street below calls her to the
window

ext street below  her pov  day

a police car has run up on the sidewalk  two policemen
are staggering in the street grabbing their throats
a woman runs horrified from the scene

int vickis apartment  day

		joker
	looks like theyre rethinking
	their spot in the social order

bag

suddenly the joker is there

		joker
	listen bruce never rub another

wall as the bullet hits him

joker exits

int vickis apartment  kitchen  moments later

bruce is coming around he checks his side no blood
he then looks at his shoulder bag it has a hole in it
he takes out the utility belt  it has a bullet embedded
in it

bruce struggles up straps on the utility belt dials a
number on its digital pad  red lights scan and then
beep  bruce runs into the bedroom

int bedroom  day

he rummages around for something in her closet  finds a
black something and exits

ext apartment  hallway  moment later

bruce sprints across the hallway and up a stairway

ext rooftop  day moment later

bruce bursts onto the roof just in time to see van pull
out into the traffic

he pulls the black nylon ski cap over his head  and
bounds off across the rooftops

ext cross street  day moment later

the van passes by  pedestrians staring goggleeyed at
the rooftops

far above them a man  oddly garbed in a suit a tie
a yellow belt and a black ski mask  is gliding across
the intersection on a rope

int van  that moment

the joker is being thrown around a bit by the speeding
swerving van  suddenly he reaches forward and grabs bob

		joker
		violently
	slow down you maniac

the joker turns to vicki putting his hand on her knee
she tries to move away from him

		joker
		sadly trying to
		 gain her sympathy
	im a little highstrung  yknow
	ive recently had tragedy in my
	life  day before yesterday
	alicia hurled herself out of the
	window  couldnt adjust to my new
	aesthetic

he hands her a porcelain mask  it has a crack in it

		joker
	but you cant make an omelette
	without breakin some eggs

ext intersection  day that moment

the jokers van guns through a red light just missing a
mounted policeman standing by his horse  his horse
shies rears back turns in a circle  the policeman
already in bad shape struggles with his throat moving
slow as molasses  his face contorts into a smile and he
shakes his head slowly

bruce lands on horses back  cop turns slowly around
sees bruce  bruce looks with alarm at the policeman

his pov  another policeman

staggers down the street his hands grasping his throat
joker has done his evil work

ext side street  moments later

bruce on horseback charging past elegant brownstones
drawing stares from passersby  on his belt is a flashing
red signal light

ext riverview drive  that moment

a yellow vw bug rips up the street at 70 mph

int volkswagen bug  that moment

we cant see the driver  but we do see on the seat
beside him a video display with a shifting grid map of
the city  and on it a flashing signal blinking in
perfect sync with the one on bruces belt

ext side street  that moment

bruce sees the vw bug rounding the corner and streaking
towards him  he reins in the horse it rears back on its
hind legs the bug pulls up

 and alfred hands bruce a bundle of batclothes

		bruce
	alfred find the records on my
	family  i want to check something

ext central square gotham city  day

the square where the unveiling is taking place has been
closed to traffic  there are barricades at the entrance

a temporary stage has been erected around a shrouded
statue on one side of the square  a small crowd is
gathered

off to one side  policeman

crouches in the grass  two people try to help him

closer on policeman

he struggles to move his head to look up  we see  his
face is contorting into a smile

back at stage

a junior high school band is playing the happy birthday
theme

		mayor
		gushing
	happy birthday gotham city  you

joker pushes through the crowd at the bottom of the steps
leading up to the stage

		mayor
	i dedicate the statue of a man
	who embodies the past present
	and future of our great city

mayor pulls a cord and drops the shroud around the statue
revealing  not john t gotham  but

a garish polychrome statue of the joker wielding two uzi
machine guns like they were sixshooters  expressionism
on acid

		joker
		excited
	start shootin my sweet  im

he fires a burst into the air knocking down one corner
of the anniversary banner  joker laughs maniacally

suddenly from nowhere a bat bolo zings through the air
its heavy ends wrap symmetrically around the head of the
statue  a hissing rises from the bomblike bolo ends

vicki looks up as people rush away from the stage people
are screaming

batman  on top building

firing the bolos from a crossbow sort of weapon

suddenly a blast as both ends of the bob explode and
knock the head of the statue off  joker is stunned

		joker
	my very face destroyed

two goons fire at batman

on batman

he fires two lines into the ground and swings down be
tween them to the stage  bullets fly around him  two
goons attack him and he kicks them both down and heads
for joker

around as goons flee

video noise wipes half the image away leaving a split
screen  on one side is the mayor  on the other

face behind him  is the joker  but a very different
joker indeed  relaxed and very lucid  with his flesh
colored makeup on he manages to make his grin almost
friendly

batman looks up from where he has fallen

his pov

up into belfry where there are thousands of bats stirring

on batman

he activates a sonar device on his belt  a shrill whine
lifts into the air

						cut to

ext belltower parapet  that moment

helicopter hovers at the side of the belltower  joker
steps up onto the wall between two gargoyles and puts
his foot onto one of the rungs of the ladder  he looks
up as he hears unearthly screaming from belfry

ext belltower parapet  that moment

suddenly the air is full of bats diving and flapping
all over the place  the noise from batmans belt climbs
in pitch  as it does so the bats fly faster  they swarm
above joker in an ever thickening black cloud

ext belltower parapet  moments later

the swarm of bats sweeps out and engulfs him  he screams
tries to beat them off

on bats

suddenly batman steps through the cloud

he grabs joker  pulling him off the ladder  batman
lifts him bodily up off the ground by front of his coat
he pushes him back against a gargoyle

joker struggles and the gargoyle crumbles and joker
slips backward  joker knows hes a dead man and he
smiles  he grabs for batmans cowl and grips it as he
falls

		joker
	i saved the last dance for you
both of them tumble down into the endless darkness

ext cathedral tower  night

two bodies fall in pas de deux  joker screams  sound of
wind rushing by

ext falling pov  night

camera falls downward  lights float lazily up at us from
the onrushing street below

ext falling  night  tight

batman fires a hook and a line back up at the roof

on hook

it lands on roof and skitters along looking for a crevice
to hook on

on joker

he stares back at batman as he drifts away  jokers
laughing all the way down

on hook

skittering

on batman

he spreads his cape slowing down a bit

on gargoyle

hook skitters to it and seizes on its grimacing jaws

on joker slow motion

he plummets to earth crashing on cathedral steps
laughter stops

on batman slow motion

he falls turns upsidedown and stops in midair

coming to the end of a long tether from the top of the
tower  he bounces a bit and hangs upsidedown  like a
bat  a scream fills the air

ext church steps  overhead angle

were looking down at the joker whose body lies splayed
and broken on the steps  we drift downward closer
until his face fills the screen his chilling grin still
intact

the jokers expression is almost childlike as he stares
aimlessly at the stars

a flashbulb pops 

reverse angle

to see vicki vale taking the photo of the year  she
looks down at him and shakes her head  a shout from
elsewhere wakes her up

		voice
	batmans fallen to the ground
	over there

vicki spins around  looks in that direction and follows
the voice

ext cathedral grounds  night

people run toward the place where batman has fallen

closer

we see the figure of batman completely covered with his
cape facedown in the courtyard  a circle of people
press and police surround him  commissioner gordon
steps into the circle

		voice
	turn him over now well see who
	this guy is

gordon approaches the body

vicki rushes up  looks down at the capecovered body
looking at her camera conflicted she raises it to take
her prize photo

on cape

 as gordon pulls back cape and turns over the body

tight on face

in his own clothes

 she flashes a picture and brings down her camera  a
smile plays across her face

on knox

 he blinks his eyes at the light
