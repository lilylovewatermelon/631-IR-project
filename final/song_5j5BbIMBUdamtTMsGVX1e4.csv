in a car outside we stalk the idle kind
if youre leaving just let me know
tobacco and peppermint dusting for fingerprints
a film in her eyes from the glow
some rules are made with all intentions to break
and she defends it with a warped rationale
and ive seen what happens to the wicked and proud
when they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown

chorus
and we learn as we age
weve learned nothing
and my body still aches
and you take cause they give
though i love you
and my body it leaks like a sieve

verse 2
when it got cold outside smoke beneath the playground lights
if youre coming home just let me know
sucking on your breath mint dissected and stuck with pins
a film in her eyes from the glow
concrete and water shes looking for her daughter
at midnight in torrential downpour
and everything i said about how messed up your head is
got cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor

and we learn as we age
weve learned nothing
and my body still aches
and you take cause they give
though i love you
and my body it leaks like a sieve
and we learn as we age
weve learned nothing
and my body still aches
and you take cause they give
though i love you
and my body it leaks like a sieve

bridge
take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters
take the picture from the frame and its a long ways to the floor
cut your finger on the edge cause its sharper than they told you
take a leap from out the window cause its way too far to go through the door

chorus
and we learn as we age
weve learned nothing
and my body still aches
and you take cause they give
though i love you
and my body it leaks like a sieve2embed"
