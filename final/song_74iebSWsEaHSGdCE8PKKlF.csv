verse 1 dj paul
get the dope chop it up
get the plate i cant wait
fifth of henn in my hand
ask for some you too late
now im high really high
man im about to shout
i see you over there talking
but what the fuck you talking about
oh im blazed in a daze
purple haze and ash trays
mac mike you got the light
we green this aint no fucking day
black havener
craving the vapors of chronic
dj p with no weed and no white
this shit is so fucking ironic

i got them blood shot red eyes
look into my eyes
did you see a big surprise
can you tell a nigga high
i can fly i can float
meet your boy up on the boat
watch me dive into the water
like titanic when it broke
yo keep the weed coming
keep them drinks coming
niggas walking around
in a daze like they need something
green bumming
lighters flicking
on the road their aint no finish
send them back
stop in the kitchen
nigga this is just the beginning
yeah

verse 3 ​​lord infamous​
hearses circling my house with wackass rappers in the rear
hella lame in my ear i come to ruin your career
vocal cords sore cyborg morgue souvenir
skins are pale the bodies smelly  death is in the atmosphere
peace is extinct bloody street make them stink
planes crash ships sink every pulse gets weak
every enemies bleed feel the nuclear nigga heat
may i propose a toast its coming close to world war iii
fright night under moonlight memphis butcher
mutilate and torture pressure cooker satan took ya
ill beat ya till theres nothing left but slop feed you to the swamp
running through the forest like gump bloody tree trunk
bitch you want a piece of these might as well take the heart
there was no love from the start sprinkled body parts
woe onto you my foe cause you just dont know
smoked out snorted drunk blowed

verse 4 twista
got me gone off herb and the erk when i swerve to the curb for the derb in a burban
fresh off earling hangin out where they serve they still got some phillies and we pearling
chill out while they working from the bank dawg
money on a fifth of henn tell the motherfucker drink up
while the skunk weed start to stank up
bitches go and get some gin we gon get the party cranked up
put your bank up we gon need more
reefer chain cause our cryptic addicted to weed smoke
hit the swishers and proceed slow
take a pull choke shit this weed dope
and im off my square now went and bailed out
but a nigga trying to go stopping ya
dropping ya if you trying to get us while we usin
im rolling with the three six mafia popping ya popular
bucking niggas with the rhyme
close encounters of the herb kind
leave you sitting on the curb crying
south side getting bucked up in a party with a burb mind
we gonna tear this bitch up
cause we fucked up gone off that sticky
when the zoloft then hit me
having paranoid illusions of nigga trying to get me
infatuated with drugs
smoked out snorted out drunk and then blowed
getting crunk in that mode
twista gotta stay high smoke a skunk til im old
now chucking like im sea sick
on the front porch with the mob and we be thick
roll when you see twista and three 6
who can bog the motherfucking mind
like an eclipse on the weed tip2embed"
