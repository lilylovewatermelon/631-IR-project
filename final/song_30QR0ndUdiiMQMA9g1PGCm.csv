take me home
take me home its the one place i can rest in peace
turn off my phone
so many messages i wish i could just delete
questioning my existence existence
questioning my decisions decisions
burning down all the bridges bridges
dig a moat now im finished
sorry dont want you to visit no
no
one last pic and ill be gone
make it count put the flash on
never really felt like i belonged
so ill be on my way and i wont be long
ill be dead by dawn
ill be dead by dawn
ill be dead by dawn
ill be dead by dawn

verse 2 lil dark
scrolling through my texts
shit i left unread
never tryna deal with that
theres bliss up in my ignorance
ten dope dealers
ex want me to see her
cant trust her dont believe her
reply turn into a needle yeah
dont wanna do it again
got shit im not tryna relive
head fucked up and im sick
these old habits will kill me quick
quicker than i can blink
quicker than i could think
lift me up dont want to sink
pour me up i need a drink
what the fuck do i do
when sabotage is all i know oh
i done dug myself
my own grave in this hole oh more woah
kill me slow slow
curtains closed low
fuck i dont see whats the point of going on nosee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like93embed"
