freedoms just a word today
freedoms just a word
when someone takes your word away
its seldom ever heard
so take a sentence full of things
youre not supposed to say
carry on but dont write it down
or youll be gone

verse 2
love is just a song today
love is just a song
when someone takes the song away
you seldom sing along
so take those lyrics serious
and sing your life away
carry on but dont write em down
or theyll be gone

chorus
all we ever do is talk
we like to ride but we never walk
we make it so damn easy
we get bored
why cant anybody see
whats good for you is good for me
i cant take your silly world
i cant take your silly world no more

peace is just two fingers now
peace was just a phase
when someone put it on a shirt
you knew to count the days
so take those fingers tape em up
and shove em up your ass
and carry on but dont try it now
cause peace is gone

chorus
all we ever do is talk
we like to ride but we never walk
we make it so damn easy
we get bored
why cant anybody see
whats good for you is bad for me
i cant take your silly world
i cant take your silly world no more

postchorus
we fight our instincts
we go to extremes
we fight our instincts
we go to extremes
outro
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
we fight our lives
