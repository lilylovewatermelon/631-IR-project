girl you know ive known you forever
how many nights we hung out together
same little crowd little bar little town
round this old dance floor
my boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
making a motion like could yall get any closer
they wanna know whats up why im still holding ya
even when the song is over

chorus
theres a rumor going round about me and you
stirring up our little town the last week or two
so tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
i feel it dont you feel it too
theres a rumor going round and round and round
what dyou say we make it true
we make it true
oh we make it true

verse 2
well i can shut em down tell them all theyre crazy
i can do whatever you want me to do baby
or you could lay one on me right now
we could really give them something to talk about

theres a rumor going round about me and you
stirring up our little town the last week or two
so tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
i feel it dont you feel it too
theres a rumor going round and round and round
what dyou say we make it true baby

bridge
oh be honest girl now
do you want to do this or not
should we keep them talking girl
or should we just make them stop

chorus
theres a rumor going round about me and you
stirring up our little town the last week or two
so tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
i feel it and you feel it too
theres a rumor going round and round and round
whatdyou say we make it
make it true
whatdyou say we make it true

lets really give them something to talk about baby
theres a rumor going round2embed"
