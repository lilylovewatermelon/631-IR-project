solo pienso en ti
eres la reina de mi vida
mi corazon es para ti
i wanna treat you like a queen
i wanna love you tonight
sexy lady with the pretty brown eyes let me know if you down to ride

i remember when i met you
you was stading with your friends at the bar looking so fly
from the hotel sweet to the bubbles in the bath tub
no matter what you want to do i got your back love
let me give it to you baby let me rub your back
as a matter of a fact
with the lights down low with the beat thats slow imma make you loose control
let me touch them private places
homerun hit like four bases
making all them sexy faces
damn girl you drive me crazy
i wont stop until the panties drop
foggy windows in the parking lot
holiday inn or the mary yaht
dime lo que quieras i make it real hot

chorus
quiero que sepas que todos los dias
solo pienso en ti
eres la reina de mi vida
mi corazon es para ti
i wanna treat you like a queen
i wanna love you tonight
sexy lady with the pretty brown eyes let me know if you down to ride
you might also likelet me know girl

let me treat that body like a playground
from the top of the slide to the mary go round
dont stop till you get enough
till your eyes roll back and your legs lock up
ooh wee i know you like that feeling when im killing
that kitty kat kat and i break your back and you loose your breathe like a carty yat
must me that sex maniac in me
gotta hit it one time or maybe three
you know that i gotta make it hotter than a hundred degrees
tell me one thing
in the morning when you wake up
what you wanna do
yo quiero hacer el amor with nobody else than you

chorus
i told you lady that im going to love you so right
let me touch that body in the places that nobody has ever touched before
let me just love you right let me show you what i feel
your my one and only lady and thats why our love is so so real

chorus
come on now

another one baby come on
