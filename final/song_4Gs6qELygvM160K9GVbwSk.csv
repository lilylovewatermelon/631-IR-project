if youre looking for somebody you can talk to
when the heartache and the troubles overcome you
theres a man you can count on
that you can put your problems on

chorus
youve got questions you need directions
arms to hold you for all eternity
look no further because theres no other
for a lover and an understander
jesus is the answer

verse 2
youre out there wondering
what got you into such a big old mess
youve been feeling so undeserving of forgiveness
but theres a king up on a throne
that lets you know youre not alone

chorus

bridge
sometimes life is a no win situation
get down on your knees and hell be right there waiting
