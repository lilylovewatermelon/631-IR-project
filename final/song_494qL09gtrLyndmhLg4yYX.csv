lefou
who you never gaston youve got to pull yourself together

gosh it disturbs me to see you gaston
looking so down in the dumps
every guy hered love to be you gaston
even when taking your lumps
theres no man in town as admired as you
youre evryones favorite guy
evryones awed and inspired by you
and its not very hard to see why
you might also likeno ones slick as gaston
no ones quick as gaston
no ones necks as incredibly thick as gaston
for theres no man in town half as manly
perfect a pure paragon
you can ask any tom dick or stanley
and theyll tell you whose team they prefer to be on

crowd
no ones big like gaston
a king pin like gaston

lefou no ones got a swell cleft in his chin like gaston
gaston as a specimen yes im intimidating
crowd my what a guy that gaston

give five hurrahs
give twelve hiphips

lefou
gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips

crowd
no one fights like gaston
douses lights like gaston
in a wrestling match nobody bites like gaston
girls for theres no one as burly and brawny
gaston as you see ive got biceps to spare
lefou not a bit of hims scraggly or scrawny
gaston thats right and evry last inch of mes covered with hair

crowd
no one hits like gaston
matches wits like gaston

lefou in a spitting match nobody spits like gaston
gaston im espcially good at expectorating  ptooey
crowd ten points for gaston

gaston
when i was a lad i ate four dozen eggs
evry morning to help me get large
and now that im grown i eat five dozen eggs
so im roughly the size of a barge

crowd
no one shoots like gaston
makes those beauts like gaston

lefou then goes tromping around wearing boots like gaston
gaston i use antlers in all of my decorating
crowd
say it again
whos a man among men
and then say it once more
whos the hero next door
whos a super success
dont you know cant you guess
ask his fans and his five hangerson
theres just one guy in town whos got all of it down

lefou
and his names gast
gaste
gastooh

crowd
