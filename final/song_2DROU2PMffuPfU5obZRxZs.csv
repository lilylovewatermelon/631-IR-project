ive been blessed and i have sinned
wear the scars of where ive been
lucky to be alive and breathe
in this midnight air
i swear youre right here
get the chills on my skin
and thats when i get this feeling

chorus
youre shinin down on me showing me the way
angel in the night here to save the day
like a light out of the dark straight across the sky
up there in that starlight starlight tonight
yeah tonight

verse 2
runnin down this dream
up against this road
sometimes the only thing that i got
keeps me movin on
right where i need to be
no matter where i go
never too far from home

chorus
got you shinin down on me showing me the way
angel in the night here to save the day
like a light out of the dark straight across the sky
up there in that starlight starlight tonight
oh tonight

to the good that die young
fighters for the freedom fought that keeps me free
and all the heroes in my heart who taught me to believe
and thats why i believe in things i cant see

chorus
shinin down on me showing me the way
angel in the night here to save the day
like a light out of the dark straight across the sky
up there in that starlight starlight tonight
yeah up there in that starlight starlight tonight
yeah tonight
shinin down on meembed"
