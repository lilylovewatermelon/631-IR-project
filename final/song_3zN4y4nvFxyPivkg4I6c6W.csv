its as simple as something that nobody knows
that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
on the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
and her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
its as common as something that nobody knows
that her beauty will follow wherever she goes
up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
would she love me forever i know she could

intro 2

just good friends wouldnt give me none
but all i wanted was some

verse 1
shes got a whole lot of reasons
she cant think of a single one
that can justify leaving
and he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
man he got too much time to waste
his dreams are like commercials
but her dreams are picture perfect and
our dreams are so related though theyre often underestimated

chorus 1
its as simple as something that nobody knows
that her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
on the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
and her feet are all covered with tar balls and

when this little girl came and she sat next to me

you go with the flow you dont stop
move like a jellyfish rhythm is nothing
you go with the flow you dont stop
