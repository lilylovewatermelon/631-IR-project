ive got miles of regrets and confusing friends
but perhaps its just my stupid head in the end
thinking should i wait here or make my way home
you said go you said go

verse 2
making up problems that dont exist
why do i let myself dream like this
were floating away my bodys in space
we are going home

chorus
missing pieces of my skull
ill sew on patches of my own soul
theres nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
cause from up here the sky is my thoughts
and were all so small

verse 3
meteor shower quick take cover
but the hues in our hair complement one another
id sell my own bones for sapphire stones
cause blue is your favourite colour

chorus
missing pieces of my skull
ill sew on patches of my own soul
theres nothing you or i can do so let the stars fall
cause from up here the sky is my thoughts
and were all so small
were all so

my heart and the earth share the same rule
it starts with love and it ends with u
but dont go outside its dangerous tonight
without me right here by your side
take it slow youll know
which way to go
sew up your skull
take your time
and well be just fine

outro
missing pieces of my skull
ill sew on patches of my own soul22embed"
