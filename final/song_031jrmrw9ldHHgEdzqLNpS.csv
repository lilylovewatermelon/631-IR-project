the dust has finally settled down
the sun is shining on
these pieces that are scattered all around
this house was everything we knew
its where we kept our love
and every single memory of me and you

prechorus 1
every letter every note
every dress you ever wore under your coat thrown away

chorus
brick by brick
we can build it from the floor
if we hold on to each other
well be better than before
and brick by brick
well get back to yesterday
when i made your body shiver
and when you took my breath away
you took my breath away

verse 2
the sky has made it back to blue
everything thats left
is telling us the worst of it is through
home has never felt so right
theres nothing in the way
theres nothing in between us
knowing where were going is inside
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeprechorus 2
every letter that i wrote
every dress you never wore under your coat thrown away

chorus
brick by brick
we can build it from the floor
if we hold on to each other
well be better than before
and brick by brick
well get back to yesterday
when i made your body shiver
and when you took my breath away

verse 3
all the pictures that weve taken
and the songs that we have played
that have all kept track and followed back the love that we have made
now theyre spread out on the surface
where we can try to congregate
its not too late to believe that we can have it all again

chorus
brick by brick
we can build it from the floor
if we hold on to each other
well be better than before
and brick by brick
well get back to yesterday
when i made your body shiver
and when you took my breath away
took my breath away
outro
brick by brick
well get back to yesterday
when i made your body shiver
and when you took my breath away
you took my breath awayembed"
