a little whiskey on the rocks
brooks and dunn on the box
marlboro haze in the air
somethin like a movie scene
yeah technicolor dream
you look so good it aint fair
time usually flies when im with you
but what if right now we slow it all down
and lean in and let the night move

chorus
at neon light speed
slow and steady step into the back beat
disco ball stars up on the ceiling
let me hold you close
while the rooms spins around you and me
at neon light speed

verse 2
when the last calls comes we can pick back up
the life wе checked at the door
aw but girl right now
lеt me twirl you around
this old juke joint dance floor
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likechorus
at neon light speed
slow and steady step into the back beat
disco ball stars up on the ceiling
let me hold you close
while the rooms spins around you and me
at neon light speed

chorus
at neon light speed
slow and steady step into the back beat
disco ball stars up on the ceiling
let me hold you close
while the rooms spins around you and me
at neon light speed
umm hmm
oh neon light speedembed"
