verse 1
my mama been told me dont give no poor performance
and whatever you gon do just do it
never thought bout doin music
i was tryna build my phone up
contacts full of drug abusers
ridin around with that mexican tryna figure out what my cousin doin
prison with the migos found out they was sellin bricks
wish i wouldve knew that shit i wouldve been lit
swear to god since i was seventeen i been hood rich
i be at james harden house im all in houston in the mix
im talkin bout spare time in new york i buy floor seats to watch the knicks
and i dont even know no players
i just wan show off my new drip and put my chains in layers
i might just stand up and go crazy someone make the layup
and we aint squashin shit for free you niggas gotta pay us
you niggas better pay up yeah

i dont want know no problems with yall niggas yall got women tendencies
i dont gotta sell drugs no more im bossed up i got plenty business
ridin round in that lam truck i wreck this bitch it aint rented
