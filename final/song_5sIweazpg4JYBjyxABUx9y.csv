landing on a runway in chicago and im groundin all my dreams
of ever really seeing california cause i know whats in between
is something sensual in such nonconventional ways
tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say

chorus
tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say
tonight im writing you a million miles away
tonight is all about we miss you we miss you we miss you we miss you
tonight is all about we miss you

verse 2
and i cant forget your style or your cynicism
somehow it was like you were the first to listen
to everything we said
my smiles an open wound without you
and my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back

chorus
tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say
tonight im writing you a million miles away
tonight is all about we miss you we miss you we miss you we miss you
tonight is all about we miss you now

tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that i cant say
