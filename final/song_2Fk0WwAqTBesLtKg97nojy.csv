so i guess its over baby déjà vu again
whod have thought that time dont stop
and somehow girl the world keeps spinnin
and guess ive turned myself into a solitary man
aint like im the only one thats in the shoes that i am

chorus
do you hear that do you hear that
im right back im right back
at the sound of lonely callin
do you hear that do you hear that
its where im at its where im at
its the sound of teardrops fallin down down
a slammin door and a lesson learned
i let another lover crash and burn

verse 2
i know that it might sound jaded and i have to say
i think love is overrated but i dont like throwin it away
i know you could probably tell me right where i went wrong
some guys cant have all the luck if others dont sing sad songs

chorus
do you hear that do you hear that
im right back im right back
at the sound of lonely callin
do you hear that do you hear that
its where im at its where im at
its the sound of teardrops fallin down down
a slammin door and a lesson learned
i let another lover crash and burn thats right

chorus

a slammin door and a lesson learned
