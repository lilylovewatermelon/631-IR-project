fly away with me tonight
take me on a oneway flight in your loving arms
and everythings going to be alright
youre the one who took my hand
when no one else could understand
youre the one who moves me
like nobody else can

take me down where i want to be
turn around this man who lives inside of me
take me down and love me all night long
hold me close and make me strong
take me down take me down tonight

verse 2
in your eyes i see a light
its your emotions glowing bright
so keep the fires burning
and let it warm me through the night
you can be a part of me
cause youre what love was meant to be
you and me baby

you dont have to stay forever
lets just put our hearts together
share another night in ecstasy
we know that its feeling better
every time we get together
maybe love was meant for you and me
