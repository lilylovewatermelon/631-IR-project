from sand and stone
level and true
i built my house on shifting sands
by my hands a realm on earth
and from the date
a giant palm
a golden shield for every man
in time before we couldnt stand
were the first

chorus
and my throne is your throne
and the rings on my hand
are your gold
and my sun is your sun to the end
and my bones are your bones
from the grain to the sand
to the stone

interlude

verse 2
the crushing wind
the serpents tooth
buried me in the shifting sands
from my hands it fell on the ground
a rotten date
seen in the palm
the golden shield it weighed us down
a sunken tomb
a phantom town were the last

and my throne is your throne
and the rings on my hand
are your gold
and my sun is your sun to the end
and my bones are your bones
from the grain to the sand
to the stone

outro
to the stone
to the stone
to the stone
to the stone
to the stoneembed"
