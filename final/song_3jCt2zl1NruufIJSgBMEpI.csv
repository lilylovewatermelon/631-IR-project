dont tell me that the west has won
we worked hard to reverse that notion
closer than anyone but were not for each other no
ive got to crack my eyes to watch the wind blow

chorus
cats cradle is a fable we all know that
soon as i can i will slide that under the table
i met your mother and your father and i liked them
they bicker the way we bicker
the way we bicker

verse 2
a black cat just snuck up on me
activities and distractions are my remedy
youre writing by lamp light youre writing by the moon rise
a stark contrast to the montclairian buzz skies

chorus
cats cradle is a fable we all know that
soon as i can i will slide that under the table
i met your mother and your father  i liked them
they bicker the way we bicker
back when our blood was thicker than oil
and the soil was in every spark and every plug and everything
my departure made my nerves sting
its leaving a person place or thing you know you shouldnt

on jet lag im past that
plainly none of this is that bad
he said let me be clear this womans crazy
i caught a glimpse of your truth as you turned to me

outro
and it was kind and it was stubborn just like id like mine to be
so i will dissuade i will just sleep
i can be patient probably
i can be patient probably
i can be patient probablyembed"
