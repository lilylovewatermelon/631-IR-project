theres so many things
i didnt say
and even though
it may be too late
i want you to know
i still love you so
every car i meet
looks like your car
every movie i see
you play the leading part
youre on my mind
cant leave you behind

chorus
when i close my eyes
youre all i see
in the dark of night
youre in my dreams
throughout the day
youre easy to find
youre always there
when i close my eyes

verse 2
in my mind i know
youre far away
but here in my heart
nothing has changed
im still holding you
like i used to
on a busy street
in a crowded room
wherever i go
its just me and you
together again
girl it never ends

when i close my eyes
youre all i see
in the dark of night
youre in my dreams
throughout the day
youre easy to find
youre always there
when i close my eyes

outro
youre always there
when i close my eyesembed"
