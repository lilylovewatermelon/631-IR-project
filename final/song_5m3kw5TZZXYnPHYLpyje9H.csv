and did you think i was just for the weekend
like something you could just hold down and go
well now youve dropped yourself right in the deep end
only you will know
im not the type to wash and go oh
how you appreciate harder and faster
im not the type that can cope with it slow
in the end it would spell your disaster
only you will know
im not the type to wash and go ohoooh

prechorus
just a crush not too serious
and nothing will ever be
just a crush im delirious
you thought youd only use me for the weekend

chorus
just for the weekend
for the weekend
just for the weekend

verse 2
and do you think i am blind to your weakness
im just deciding on which way to go
everybody will think im the sweetest
only you will know that i could be your friend or foe ohoooh
