bronze by gold heard the hoofirons
steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn
chips picking chips off rocky thumbnail chips horrid
and gold flushed more
a husky fifenote blew blew
blue bloom is on the gold pinnacled hair
a jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin rose of castille
trilling trilling i dolores
peep whos in the peepofgold
tink cried to bronze in pity
and a call pure long and throbbing longindying call
decoy soft word but look the bright stars fade o rose notes chirruping
answer castille the morn is breaking
jingle jingle jaunted jingling
coin rang clock clacked
avowal sonnez i could rebound of garter not leave thee
sweetheart goodbye
avowal warm

verse cathy berberian
when love absorbs
war war the tympanum
a sail a veil awave upon the waves
horn hawhorn
when first he saw alas
full tup full throb
warbling ah lure alluring
martha come
clapclop clipclap clappyclap
goodgod henev erheard inall
deaf bald pat brought pad knife took up
a moonlight nightcall far far
i feel so sad p s so lonely blooming
listen
the spiked and winding cold seahorn
have you the
each and for other plash and silent roar
