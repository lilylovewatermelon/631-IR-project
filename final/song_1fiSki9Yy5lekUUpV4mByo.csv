you can kiss my love goodbye
your lipstick stains washed with tears i cry
for the first time in a while
i can see through the lies
bringing secrets to light
how could i be so naive to think i had you

chorus
maybe im just dumb
im a fool so naive
i guess i shouldve known
you dont love me
oooohooahh
you dont love me
maybe im just dumb

verse 2
down bad
all my friends say youre the worst
down bad
but i cant see it vision blurred
i know i look kinda crazy crazy crazy
ooh yeah but im feeling good
as of lately
ooh yeah i let you live in my brain
cause i kinda like the pain
breathe breathe
