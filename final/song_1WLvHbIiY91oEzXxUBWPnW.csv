one went out at a busstop in edinburgh
one went out in an english park
one went out in a night club when i was fifteen
little lights in my heart

verse 2
one went out when i lied to my mother
said the cigarettes she found were not mine
one went out within me
now i smoke like a chimney
its getting dark in this heart of mine
its getting dark in this heart of mine

chorus
were born with millions
of little lights shining in the dark
and they show us the way
one lights up every time you feel love in your heart
one dies when it moves away

verse 3
one went out in the back streets of manchester
one went out in an airport in spain
one went out have no doubt
when i grew up and moved out
of the place where the boy used to play
see passenger liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeverse 4
one went out when uncle ben got his tumor
we used to fish and i fish no more
though we will not return
i know one still burns
on a fishing boat of the new jersey shore
on a fishing boat of the new jersey shore

chorus
were born with millions
of little lights shining in the dark
and they show us the way
one lights up every time you feel love in your heart
one dies when it moves away
were born with millions
of little lights shining in our hearts
and they die along the way
till were old and were cold
and were lying in the dark
cause theyll all burn out one day
theyll all burn out one day
oh oh theyll all burn out one day
theyll all burn out one day
