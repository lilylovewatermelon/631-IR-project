used to be a dreamer
dreamin of a fire

verse 1
uh my mama used to pray that shed see me in yale
its fucked up she gotta see me in jail
on the visit with lil papi it hurt even though i seemed to be well
they got a smoker with a key to my cell damn
and even worst my judge black dont wanna see me do well
its either that or black people for sale
gave me two to four years like fuck your life meet me in hell
and let it burn like lucifer you look even stupider
tryna impress them people in power when power abusin us
for 44 dollars a hour you coward they using ya
is it selfhate that made you send me upstate
this where the socalled real niggas sweeping up for cupcakes
and thats your phone time if you aint got no money you aint online
hey call your son call your daughter just to wish them more prime
oh god dont let them streets get a hold of em
your daughter fuckin now its gon be a cold summer
your son trapping and your homie giving os to him
and if he fuck that paper up he puttin holes through him
and you just wanna make it home so you can show it to him
and them people aint finna give no parole to ya
they want blood we all hangin with a noose on our neck
my celly mom just died he wanna use my collect
and he wont make it to the wake unless he give em a check
we still niggas though what you expect

i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin feelin evil
uhh trauma
when them drugs got a hold of your mama
and the judge got a hold on your father
go to school bullet holes in the locker

verse 2
aint no ptsds them drugs keep it at ease
they shot that boy 20 times when they couldve told him just freeze
couldve put him in a cop car but they let him just bleed
the ambulance they coming baby just breathe
thats what the old lady said when she screamed
this nightmare on elm street friday the 13th
and in the 13th amendment it dont say that we kings
they say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
they told kaep stand up if you wanna play for a team
and all his teammates aint saying a thing stay woke
if you dont stand for nothing you gon fall for something
and in the 60s if you kneeled youd prolly be killed
but they dont kill you now they just take you out of your deal
kill your account look where money get spilled
check it and they dont kill you now they just take you out of your deal
kill your account look where money get spilled
chorus
i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin feelin evil
uhh trauma
when them drugs got a hold of your mama
and the judge got a hold on your father
go to school bullet holes in the locker

verse 3
how many times you send me to jail to know that i wont fail
invisible shackles on the king cause shit im on bail
i went from selling out arenas now shit im on sale
them cold nights starting to feel like hell uhh
watching a black woman take my freedom
almost made me hate my people
when they label you felon its like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy
23 hours in a cell somebody save me
im on a jail call trying to explain it to my baby
i gotta do the calendar twice and thats a maybe
trauma

chorus
i just won
i was on the corner with the reefa
and they got us warring for our freedom
see my brother blood on the pavement
how you wake up in the mornin feelin evil
uhh trauma
when them drugs got a hold of your mama
and the judge got a hold on your father
go to school bullet holes in the locker9embed"
