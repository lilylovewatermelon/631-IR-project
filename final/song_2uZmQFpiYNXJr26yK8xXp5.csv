now is your time to die
weve gathered here to say goodbye
no more youll cry
no reason left for you to fight

feel pain no more
emotions never felt before
where do we go we go
shell never know

chorus
holding on to you to keep from falling
your eyes are closing now
another chapters ending

verse 2
hard times we always saw
theres nothing left of you no more
fear has no place no place
cover her face

chorus
holding on to you to keep from falling
your eyes are closing now
another chapters ending
