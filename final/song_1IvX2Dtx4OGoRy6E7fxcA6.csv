theres a pain
theres no doubt
ive been through hell
but on my way out

prechorus
and all the ways ive been torn
stripped my heart to the core
all of my fears combined
walking the thinnest of lines

chorus
when the sunlight hits the dust
and i cant get up
when the noise is way too much
i close the void and burn it off
but theres a crack in every wall
is there a way out after all
if i lose my grip and fall
will i

verse 2
theres a place
with no hate
touched by grace
quiet as faith

emptied my hеart laid down my cards
played my best part wanting a new start
all of my fеars combined
taught me to run and hide

chorus
when the sunlight hits the dust
and i cant get up
when the noise is way too much
i close the void and burn it off
but theres a crack in every wall
is there a way out after all
if i lose my grip and fall

bridge
theres a dissonance in all that i do
yeah nothing feels right or true
black out on the floor just once more
the place i call my home
yeah i could die here and nobody would know
die here and nobody would know

chorus
when the sunlight hits the dust
and i cant get up
when the noise is just too much
i close the void and burn it off
but theres a crack in every wall
is there a way out after all
if i lose my grip and fall
will i die10embed"
