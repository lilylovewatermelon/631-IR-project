i heard the truth was built to bend
a mechanism to suspend
the guilt is what you will require
and still youve got to dance little liar
just like those fibs to pop and fizz
and youll be forced to take that awful quiz
and youre bound to trip
and shell detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

chorus
and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when theres dirt beneath the dirt
the liar takes a lot less time

verse 2
im sure its clear and plain to read
its not an alibi you need just yet
oh no its something for those beads of sweat
yes that will get you back to normal
and after you have dabbed the patch
youll breathe and then proceed to scratch
the varnish off that newly added calmness
so as not to raise any alarms too soon

and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when theres dirt beneath the dirt

bridge
the liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
can you hack your mind being riddled
with the wrong memories

instrumental break

chorus
and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when theres dirt between the dirt28embed"
