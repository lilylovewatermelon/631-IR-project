prechorus
turned to a whole different person drive my whip
crash my whip off the drugs im swervin

chorus
sticks and stones may break my bones
but the drugs wont hurt me the drugs wont hurt me
exgirlfriend keeps calling my phone
but the bitch cant hurt me so im not worried
all alone did it on my own
so i show no mercy i show no mercy
with my bros but i got my pole screaming
please dont urge me please dont urge me yuh

verse
screaming please dont urge me
and fuck these hoes all they do is irk me
i smoke my dope and i pop my perky
and lock my phone cause these hoes be lurking yuh
yeah these hoes be lurking
a bad lil bitch with her hips so curvy
i drive my whip off the drugs im swervin
she ride my dick off the drugs she swervin woah
