weve waited so damn long were sick and tired
i wont leave any doubt or stone unturned
ive got a collar full of chemistry from your company
so maybe tonight ill be the libertine

chorus
oh show me your love your love your love your love
give me more but its not enough your love
show me your love your love your love your love
before the world catches up your love
cause theres always time for second guesses
i dont want to know
if youre gonna be the death of me
thats how i want to go

verse 2
youve got it all worked out with so little time
memories that id black out if you were mine
youve got a pocket full of reasons why youre here tonight
so baby tonight just be the death of me

chorus
oh show me your love your love your love your love
give me more but its not enough your love
show me your love your love your love your love
before the world catches up your love
cause theres always time for second guesses
i dont want to know
if youre gonna be the death of me
thats how i want to go

before the world catches up

outro
oh show me your love your love your love your love
