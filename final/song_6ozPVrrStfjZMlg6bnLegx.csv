love how you close your eyes when i pull you in closer
tonights movin fast but we aint takin it slower
you hit me harder than a drink does
youre gonna take me all the way up
something about you baby got me goin crazy
i dont know what to do

chorus
ive never met a girl like you
thats ever done it quite like you do
your kiss is doublebarrel bourbon on rocks
your lips are just the cherry on top
ive never been high like this
turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
your eyes are so diamond body so gold
an i dont want to let you go
ive never met a girl like you

verse 2
love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
love how you do that thing yeah you know what gets me
im talkin slow motion all night long
baby love you with the lights on

chorus
ive never met a girl like you
thats ever done it quite like you do
your kiss is doublebarrel bourbon on rocks
your lips are just the cherry on top
ive never been high like this
turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
your eyes are so diamond body so gold
