im not your every day around the way
dont go barhoppin chillin on the block
on a cell phone frontin
never that cause im not that kinda girl
i need to know how you roll
and how you get down no drama
drop my money in the bank
take me home and meet your mama
can you handle that
cause im that kinda girl
im that kinda girl

verse 1
boy you aint impressin me
with your jewelry your designer clothes
or the games that you try to play
think you need to know i got my own
dont need you for your dough
hearin me maybe then we can flow let me know
make me smile maybe we can chill
keep it real show me something i can feel
cause im not your average ordinary type
could you be that kinda guy i like

chorus
im not your every day around the way

never that cause im not that kinda girl
i need to know how you roll
and how you get down no drama
drop my money in the bank
take me home and meet your mama
can you handle that
cause im that kinda girl
im that kinda girl

everytime i be up at the spot chilling with my crew
well be hanging out get in a little late
you start bugging out
i dont think its fair
you dont like the clothes i wear
how i do my hair
i dont really care
but its not for you
and i aint got nothin to prove
there cant be any us if there cant be any trust
nothing to discuss no doubt
im not that kinda girl to let you play me out

chorus
im not your every day around the way
dont go barhoppin chillin on the block
