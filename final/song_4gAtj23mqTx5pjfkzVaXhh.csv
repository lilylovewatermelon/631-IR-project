fallin apart
you mightve thought i was playing a part in the art ive created
but most of the words reflect whats happened or what is waiting to start happenin
i keep on damagin myself tryna fill the void
with all this water round my neck im bout to drip until i drown
all these drugs up in my nose i taste the drip that shits so sour
all these cars that i bought either dont start or they got impounded
pursued the american dream the nightmares what i doubted
catch a flight to london or ill catch a flight to lyon
show my face in public show another one at home
see my name on the marquee letters falling down
littering a cold dark street somewhere downtown
soon as i reached cloud nine it started stormin
heavy thunderstorms in every city that im tourin
life aint like a rap video thats just a warnin
hopin to see the sun when i wake up in the mornin

verse 2 hearse boy
all this misery misery misery fuck
look at my history no mystery where i might end up just shut up
dont wanna hear it its my decision
may be my last words so just please listen
so long its been torture bein here
so gone getting high been how i cope with fear
same song and im sick of singin it
let me move on its for my benefit
but come one come all to my downfall
bear witness to everything that i cant solve
my therapist made me promise before i end it all
that her phone would be the one i choose to call crying asking
is it really worth it
whats beneath the surface or behind the curtain
really dont think i wanna take this any further
made one last attempt to figure out my purpose
i called her phone it said not in service

when life gets hard gets hard
keep on marchin on keep on marchin on
even if the finish line is far or you have to push the car push the car
keep on marchin on keep on marchin on not in service
when life gets hard gets hard
keep on marchin on keep on marchin on
even if the finish line is far or you have to push the car push the car
keep on marchin on keep on marchin on43embed"
