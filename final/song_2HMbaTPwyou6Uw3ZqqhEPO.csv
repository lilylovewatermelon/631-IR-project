i want the talk show
guess thatll have to do
up all night bbming you
outta tylenol head still aches
got enough strength to flip a pancake
got the luggage packed waiting by the front
quarter after 5 its already 1
ill say it one last time
walking out the door at 459

chorus
515 not a minute more
ready for the knock on my door
515 not a minute more
ready for the waves on my shore
and at 516 if youre not with me
you can catch me in the next city
never knew you meant that much to me until 515

verse 2
i think ive gone dumb
sick on puppy love
wanna break out
think ive had enough
the walls are caving in and my thick skin is feeling kinda thin
youve found your way back in
never thought in may when we came to june
i would feel this way about you
but ill say it one last time
im walking out the door at 459

515 not a minute more
ready for the knock on my door
515 not a minute more
ready for the waves on my shore
and at 516 if youre not with me
you can catch me in the next city
never knew you meant that much to me until 515
