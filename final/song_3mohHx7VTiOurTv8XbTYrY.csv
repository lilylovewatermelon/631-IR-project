and when we get home
i know we wont be home at all
this place we live
it is not where we belong
and i miss who we were
in the town that we could call our own
going back to get away
after everything has changed

chorus josh farro hayley williams
could you remind me of a time
when we were so alive everything has changed
do you remember that
do you remember that everything has changed
could you help me push aside
all that i have left behind everything is changed
do you remember that
do you remember that

verse 2 hayley williams
so we stand here now
and no one knows us at all
i wont get used to this
i wont get used to being gone
and going back wont feel the same
if we arent staying
going back to get away
after everything has changed
