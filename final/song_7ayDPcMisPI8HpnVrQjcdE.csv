let’s turn it up loud mix it up strong
lean it back slow get your feel good on
cut em off short roll it up tight
let it unwind tonight
drop down the top down on the pontiac
wherever you wind up is where the party’s at
break out the bottle of bacardi black
and don’t look back ’cause

chorus
heres to the good times here’s to the sunshine
heres to the ice you float your beer in
to the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin
oh my my
she’s a little bit tipsy
leans in for a kiss shes stealin your heart just like a gypsy
and there you are just a drunken star just fallin in her eyes
here’s to the good times
while there’s still time

verse 3
well lay it all out spray it on sweet
carve it in oak and permanent ink
park it way back fog it on up
singin whoa whoa
radio spillin from a single cab
she looks so good with her silver tabs
hangin on a branch by the river
thats a memory thatll get you when you look back
you might also likechorus
heres to the good times here’s to the sunshine
heres to the ice you float your beer in
to the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin
oh my my
she’s a little bit tipsy
leans in for a kiss shes stealin your heart just like a gypsy
and there you are just a drunken star just fallin in her eyes
here’s to the good times
while there’s still time

bridge
drop down the top down on the pontiac
wherever you wind up is where the party’s at
break out the bottle of bacardi black
and don’t look back ’cause

chorus
heres to the good times heres to the sunshine
heres to the ice you float your beer in
to the tops that pop and the tan lines disappearin
oh my my
she’s a little bit tipsy
leans in for a kiss shes stealin your heart just like a gypsy
and there you are just a drunken star just fallin in her eyes
here’s to the good times
outro
heres to the good times and the moonshine
and them blue eyes under the moonlight
heres to the good times
heres to the good times buzzin on moonshine
lovin you all night under the moonlight
heres to the good times
while there’s still time1embed"
