time goes by you cant get it back
its a oneway ride you gotta make it last
aint nobody got no plans to settle down
all were thinkin bout is right here and right now

chorus
we got our hands up rockin like a boat
rollin with the flow poppin like the 4th of july
we drink it all up every little sip
taste it on your lips every single drop of life
were gonna live this neverending summer
were just growin younger

verse 2
well today dont care if we stay out all night
let down your hair honey its all gonna be alright
aint nobody here to tell us what to do
aint no stopping baby you got me and i got you

chorus
we got our hands up rockin like a boat
rollin with the flow poppin like the 4th of july
we drink it all up every little sip
taste it on your lips every single drop of life
