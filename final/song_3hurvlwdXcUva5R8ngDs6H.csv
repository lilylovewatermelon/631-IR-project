verse 1
first thing when i wake up
and right before i close my eyes at night
i think
sense
feel man like
im under some kind of microscope
satellites over my head
transmitters in my dollars
hawking watching scoping jocking
scrutinizing me
checking to see what im doing
where i be
who i see
how and where and with whom i make my money
what is this
excuse me miss
may i have your phone number and your social security
who me
when all i came to do is buy my double or triple a batteries
please

verse 2
look here at this watch of mine
gotta open it up
dont know whos been in it
tracking where i go
finding out all my biness
security
video cameras locked on me
in every dressing room
on every floor
in every store
damn can i get that democracy
and equality
and privacy
you busy watching me watching me
that your blind baby
you neglect to see
the drugs coming into my community
weapons coming into my community
dirty cops in my community
and you keep saying that im free
and you keep saying that im free
and you keep saying that im free
busy watching me
