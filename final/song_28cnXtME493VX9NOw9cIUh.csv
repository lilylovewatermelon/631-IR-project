verse 1
i hurt myself today
to see if i still feel
i focus on the pain
the only thing thats real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but i remember everything

chorus
what have i become
my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

verse 2
i wear this crown of thorns
upon my liars chair
full of broken thoughts
i cannot repair
beneath the stains of time
the feelings disappear
you are someone else
i am still right here

what have i become
my sweetest friend
everyone i know
goes away in the end
and you could have it all
my empire of dirt
i will let you down
i will make you hurt

outro

a million miles away
i would keep myself
i would find a way146embed"
