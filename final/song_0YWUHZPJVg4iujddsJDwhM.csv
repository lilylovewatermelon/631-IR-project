oh yeah yeah

verse 1
last night i took a walk in the snow
couples holding hands places to go
seems like everyone but me is in love
santa can you hear me
i signed my letter that i sealed with a kiss
i sent it off it just said this
i know exactly what i want this year
santa can you hear me

prechorus 1
i want my baby baby
i want someone to love me
someone to hold
maybe maybe maybe maybe
hell be all my own in a big red bow

chorus
santa can you hear me
i have been so good this year
and all i want is one thing
tell me my true love is near
hes all i want just for me
underneath my christmas tree
ill be waiting here
