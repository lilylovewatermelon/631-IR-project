take a breath take it deep
calm yourself he says to me
if you play you play for keeps
take the gun and count to three
im sweating now moving slow
no time to think my turn to go

chorus
and you can see my heart beating
you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving
i know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger trigger trigger trigger

verse 2
say a prayer to yourself
he says close your eyes
sometimes it helps
and then i get a scary thought
that hes here means hes never lost

chorus
and you can see my heart beating
oh you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving
know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger
you might also likebridge
as my life flashes before my eyes
im wondering will i ever see another sunrise
so many wont get the chance to say goodbye
but its too late to think of the value of my life

chorus
and you can see my heart beating
no woah you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving no
know that i must pass this test
and you can see my heart beating
oh you can see it through my chest
now im terrified but im not leaving no no
know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger trigger trigger trigger45embed"
