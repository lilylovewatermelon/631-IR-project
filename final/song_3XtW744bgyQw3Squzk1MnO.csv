he was a quarter the way insane
but he aint to blame
cause with a trust fund like that
id be the same

his father was the engine
and his mother was the light
she had a pension
and valued money over time
i used to see his sister
her name was jenny gasoline
i used to see her picture
on the cover of a dirty magazine
but she looked best when she was mine
sugar dont you worry
dont you shed a tear
theyve got enough black gold
for another year
well just have to wait and see
if theyve got enough
if theyve got enough
for you and me

theres been an accident on
23rd and preston
someone got arrested
and all them brokers
they be broken in the park
and all them liquids that theyre choking on is dark
darker than a georgia night with a heavy heart
you might also likesugar dont you worry
dont you shed a tear
theyve got enough black gold
for another year
well just have to wait and see
if theyve got enough
if theyve got enough
for you and
just bought some octane
cut my dollar in half
you should try it out sometime
oh yeah
theres nothing like going way too fast
way too fast

sugar dont you worry
dont you shed a tear
theyve got enough black gold
for another year
well just have to wait and see
if theyve got enough
theyve got enough
one more time
theyve got enough
for you and me1embed"
