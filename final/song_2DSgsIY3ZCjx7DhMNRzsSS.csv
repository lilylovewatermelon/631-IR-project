intro billie joe armstrong
sing us the song of the century
it sings like american eulogy
the dawn of my love and conspiracy
of forgotten hope and the class of 13
tell me a story into that good night
sing us a song for me

part 2 mass hysteria

chorus billie joe armstrong

mass hysteria
verse 1 billie joe armstrong
red alert is the color of panic
elevated to the point of static
beating into the hearts of the fanatics and the neighborhoods a loaded gun
idle thoughts lead to fullthrottle screamin
and the wealth is asphyxiatin
mass confusion is all the new rage and its creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria

verse 2 billie joe armstrong
true sounds of maniacal laughter
and the deaf mutes misleadin the choir
the punchline is a natural disaster and its sung by the unemployed
fight fire with a riot
the class war is hangin on a wire
because the martyr is a compulsive liar when he said its just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria

chorus billie joe armstrong
mass hysteria
mass hysteria

bridge billie joe armstrong
theres a disturbance on the oceanside
they tapped into the reserve
the static response is so unclear now
mayday this is not a test
as the neighborhood burns
america is fallin
and vigilantes warnin ya
callin christian and gloria

verse 4 mike dirnt
well i wanna take a ride to the great divide
beyond the up to date and the neogentrified
the high definition for the low resident
where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
i can hear the sound of a beatin heart
it bleeds beyond a system that is fallin apart
with money to burn on a minimum wage
well i dont give a shit about the modern age

chorus billie joe armstrong  mike dirnt
i dont wanna live in the modern world
i dont wanna live in the modern world
i dont wanna live in the modern world
i dont wanna live in the modern world
