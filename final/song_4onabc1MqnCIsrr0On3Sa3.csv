i only have so long
to make a safe place for you
i can twist my fingers in and
build another one
look through this face and find it
let the hands of the man guide it
when i put you through this
when i put you through this youll need me

prechorus
ooh suffer to be mine
i want to be cruel to be kind
ill get inside your head
live so hard youll wish you were dead yeah

chorus
a touch of the wicked
a touch of the wicked

i cant help living for you
i wish i could climb inside you
slip you on like a second skin and
be another one
youll live forever with me
you can have another soul and rape me
when i step into this
when i step into this youll be me
