verse 1 lupe fiasco
and my return yeah is more like a reup
i hold a whole like a teacup
world in one hand while the other hand throw the peace up
my other hand throwing we without the e up westside
i got like five more man im something like shiva
in that fall of rome number four deluxe
see ive been around the world like the gnome
but i come from a zone where the homes are beat up
the folks unknowns and the stones all meet up
police tap my phone got my songs on speaker
say he spat the poems got their domes all geeked up
to get up on they thrones and become young leaders
oprah put it on my culture now if that aint wrong
imus got it from the rhymers now if that aint blown
they gave my man fortyfour now if that aint long
i put it all on my shoulders now if that aint strong
i made it out alive from the streets of the west side chi
now if that aint home you better tell em

verse 2 lupe fiasco
and in my flyness ive become the hero and the sidekick
the rider and the nigga thatll ride with
in your ear like the maker of the vivrant
assalamu alaikum to the maker of the vivrant
them other niggas i dont vibe with
now i was bout three when the eyes went
but i could see everything that you trying to be
you cant hide it
while you coming out your throat like a heimlich
i came up out the belly like an hype script
only my circumstance revised it
hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
im trying to go public so i can get to private
then send busy to go and get the pirates
then hit africa try to fix the virus
go back to the hood tell huggy open the hydrants
rip stack b ima keep you alive kid

verse 3 snoop dogg
lupey its snoopy lets go wild
tiptoe through the door do it doggystyle
and tell all my chicks in chiicago
lupey hit the lotto snoopy hit the bottle
dolemite tight they bite they might follow
take this chill pill lil nigga swallow
recital is very homicidal
the big screen will capture it cause its highdefinition
listen cooking collard greens in the kitchen
them alphabet boys on a mission
if you ever get cash you better get it quick fast
cause nowadays niggas get to snitchin on yo bitch ass
even your boys best believe in them toys out your game
specially when a nigga know your real name
blam blam with the blammer
smile nephew you on candid camera film at eleven
dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
fnf and sn double op
