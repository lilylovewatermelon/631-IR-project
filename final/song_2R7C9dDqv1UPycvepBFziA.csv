tall dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
its the same thing to me
hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say yay
and you smile and say how are you”
i say just fine
i always forget to tell you i love you
i love you forever

chorus
i watch superman fly away
youve got a busy day today
go save the world ill be around
and i watch superman fly away
come back ill be with you someday
ill be right here on the ground
when you come back down

verse 2
tall dark and beautiful
hes complicated hes irrational
but i hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
hes not all bad like his reputation
and i cant hear one single word they say
and youll leave got places to be and ill be okay
i always forget to tell you i love you
i loved you from the very first day
