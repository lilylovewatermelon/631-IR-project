the markings on your surface
your speckled face
flawed crystals hang from your ears
i couldnt gauge your fears
i cant relate to my peers
id rather live outside
id rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
maybe im a fool
maybe i should move and settle
two kids and a swimming pool
im not brave
brave
im not brave

verse 2
im living over city
and taking in the homeless sometimes ive
been living in an idea
an idea from another mans mind
maybe im a fool
to settle for a place with some nice views nice views
maybe i should move settle down
two kids and a swimming pool
im not brave
id rather live outside
id rather live outside
id rather go to jail
ive tried hell
its a loop what would you recommend i do
the other side of the loop is a loop
this this fe— this feel this feel this feels
this feels how molly must feel
this feels how molly must feel
how molly must feel
this feels how molly must feel
how molly must feel

this is not my life
its just a fond farewell to a friend
its just a fond farewell to a friend
this is not my life
its just a fond farewell to a friend
its not what im like
its just a fond farewell

verse 3
speaking of nirvana it was there
rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
there with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping yeah
dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
that could think of the dreamer that thought
that could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of god
i be dreaming of dreaming a thought
that could dream about a thought
that could think of dreaming a dream
where i cannot where i cannot

verse 4
less morose and more present
dwell on my gifts for a second a moment
one solar flare were consumed
so why not spend this flammable paper on the film thats my life
high flights inhale the vapor exhale once and think twice
eat some shrooms maybe have a good cry about you
see some colors light hang glide off the moon
outro
in the dark
in the dark
id do anything for you
in the dark
id do anything for you
in the dark
id do anything for you
in the dark
id do anything for you
in the dark
id do anything for you anything for you
in the dark
id do anything for you anything for155embed"
