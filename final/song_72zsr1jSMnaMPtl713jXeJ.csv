we were shooting at a mountain of dirt
well nothing was broken nothing was hurt
but i probably really should have been at work
but if my free times gone would you promise me this

chorus
that you will please bury me with it
please bury me with it

verse 2
well as sure as planets come i know that they end
and if im here when that happens
you promise me this my friend

chorus
please bury me with it
i just dont need none of that mad max bullshit

verse 3
well the suit got tight and it split at the seams
but i kept it out of habit and i kept it real clean
but if its getting faded if its running out of thread
could you do this for me my friend

chorus
and please just please bury me with it
please bury me with it

well we moved to the left and we moved to the right
and sure as hell we stayed out almost every single night
but if the partys over if the fun has to end
could you do this for me my friend

please bury me with it

good news for people who love bad news
weve lost the plot and we just cant choose
we are hummingbirds who are just not willing to move
and theres good news for people who love bad news
we are hummingbirds who lost the plot and we will not move
we have good news for anyone who loves bad news

verse 5
we were aiming for the moon
we were shooting at the stars
but the kids were just shooting at the buses and the cars
so dont drink the water
dont you breathe the air
and if its gotten to that point then i have to declare
chorus
that you just please bury me with it
please bury me with it

verse 6
well fads they come and fads they go
and god i love that rock and roll
well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss
life handed us a paycheck
we said we worked harder than this

chorus
please bury me with it
please bury me with it

outro
ah shit now
we are hummingbirds who are just not willing to move
and theres good news for people who love bad news
we are hummingbirds whove lost the plot and we will not move
we have good news for anyone who loves bad news5embed"
