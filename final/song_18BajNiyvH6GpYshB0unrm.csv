ill bet youve never heard ol marshal dillon say
miss kitty have you ever thought of running away
settling down would you marry me
if i asked you twice and begged you pretty please
shed have said yes in a new york minute
they never tied the knot his heart wasnt in it
he just stole a kiss as he rode away
he never hung his hat up
at kittys place

chorus
i shouldve been a cowboy
i shouldve learned to rope and ride
wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
stealing a young girls heart
just like gene and roy
singing those campfire songs
oh i shouldve been a cowboy

verse 2
i mightve had a sidekick with a funny name
running wild through the hills chasing jesse james
ending up on the brink of danger
riding shotgun for the texas rangers
go west young man havent you been told
californias full of whiskey women and gold
sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
with a dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

wearing my sixshooter riding my pony on a cattle drive
stealing a young girls heart
just like gene and roy
singing those campfire songs
oh i shouldve been a cowboy
