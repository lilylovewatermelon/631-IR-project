that wasnt funny but she laughed so hard she almost cried
theyre countin months theyve been together almost fortynine
hes makin fun of how she acted round the holidays
she wears a ring but they tell people that theyre not engaged
they met in class for metaphysical philosophy
he tells his friends i like her cause shes so much smarter than me
theyre havin talks about their futures until 4 am
and im happy for them im happy for thеm im happy for them im happy for them

chorus
but i wanna feel all that love and еmotion
be that attached to the person im holdin
someday ill be fallin without caution
but for now im only peoplewatchin

verse 2
im only lookin just to live through you vicariously
ive never really been in love not seriously
i had a dream about a house behind a picket fence
next one i choose to trust i hope i use some common sense
but i cut people out like tags on my clothing
i end up all alone but i still keep hoping

chorus
i wanna feel all that love and emotion
be that attached to the person im holdin
someday ill be fallin without caution
but for now im only peoplewatchin
