tell me can you see me now
while you were busy lost in the crowd
i was busy making myself
into someone free from doubt
i was down and left on the shelf
i wanted a story to tell

prechorus
i scream it to the people
started calling
singing words that came from all the fallen
down down
now now

chorus
its time to breakout
so everybody just scream out
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no chains no chains wont make me break down
and i can finally see now
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no chains no chains wont hold me down

tell me how it feels to know
im not a puppet under control
i cut the strings a long time ago oh
i guess that i should thank you though
cause all you was the fire for my soul
and now im up here running the show

prechorus
i scream it to the people
started calling
singing words that came from all the fallen
down down
now now

chorus
its time to breakout
so everybody just scream out
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no chains no chains wont make me break down
and i can finally see now
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no chains no chains wont hold me down
postchorus
no chains no chains wont hold me

bridge
and when the dust is settled down
youll be all alone thinking how
everyone is singing aloud

chorus
its time to breakout
so everybody just scream out
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no truth no chains wont make me break down
and i can finally see now
im the only one im the only one
im the only one
no chains no chains wont hold me down1embed"
