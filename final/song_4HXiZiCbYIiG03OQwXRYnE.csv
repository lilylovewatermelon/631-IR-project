there we were
in the back of that old z71
the road was dirt
a couple kids waitin on the sun
cherry red
baby i still recall the taste
we were a few beers shy of freedom
i had my hands around your waist

prechorus
you said babe im gettin cold
i said climb on in my jacket
you already know
like my heart you can have it

chorus
oh i dont remember what the radio was playin
i was hangin like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin
all i know is there was magic in that chevy
baby you were glowin god was throwin
stars like confetti ah
stars like confеtti ah

verse 2
yeah rusted truck dustedup boots
and high on a pеrfume buzz
that seeforever sky wasnt near as high as us
yeah our hearts were beatin faster
than a runaway midnight train
we couldnt say forever
but we said it anyway
see dustin lynch liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeprechorus
baby hold me tight and never let me go
look up at the sky heavens puttin on a show

chorus
i dont remember what the radio was playin
i was hangin like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin
all i know is there was magic in that chevy
baby you were glowin god was throwin
stars like confetti ah
we made a wish on everyone ah
we held on til it was done woah
