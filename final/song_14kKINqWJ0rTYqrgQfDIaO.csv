yo whats up doom this is bumpy knuckles
just calling to say that im proud of the work you been doing dog
you know this whole album and all that that youve been working on my dude
its like its like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to
look into the mind of a villain you know like somebody who really has
a serious outlook on their craft you know theres a lot of clowns out here
with you know painted faces and when they take the paint off
its just a clown with no paint on their face doom laughing
so please understand my dude im watching you man and i see what you doing
its the og man bumpy knuckles straight fly aight
my motto for 2009 is fuck everybody doom laughing aight
so when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd
ask them to put it back up
and when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody doom laughing
cause thats what everybodys gonna say when they have to show respect for you
ahh fuck him fuck him thats the dinkest shit in the world if they write this
well fuck you
cause everybody wanna be what you are
you nahmean they cant find
themselves
aight stay focused my dude i appreciate your work
aight soon come bumpy knuckles mf doom— soon come
