are surely found to be holy in the presence of the lord
tell me all that youâ€™re feeling and i will believe every word
cause to think you would speak out in lies
baby that just sounds absurd
and if you want me to go i will
but if you need me to stay baby thatd be a thrill

cause tomorrow will be a long hard road out of ohio and ill hate every mile
that takes me back to kentucky and away from your smile

hold me and tell me you need me
i need you more than you know
cause now that ive found what i wanted its hard to let it go
and the hills have always been home
but now that ive found you the shadows seem cold

and tomorrow will be a long hard road out of ohio and ill hate every mile
that takes me back to kentucky and away from your smile

and if you want me to go i will
but if you need me to stay baby thatd be a thrill
cause tomorrow will be a long hard road out of ohio and ill hate every mile
that takes me back to kentucky and away from your smilesee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeembed"
