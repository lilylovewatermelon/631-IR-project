i dont want us to have a fight
but in the background i can hear you chatting shite
i hear it every night
and you think youre being really cool
and youve been doing it since we were both at school
now who looks like a fool

prechorus
youre no friend of mine girl
and ive known it for a while girl
youre just a waste of time girl
why dont you have another line girl

chorus
tell me what did you expect
have you got no self respect
reputation to protect
soon youll be a nervous wreck
tell me what did you expect
have you got no self respect
reputation to protect
soon youll be a nervous wreck

verse 2
what happen to the good old days
i was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
who are you anyway
i know youve heard this all before
i know some people whove been calling me a whore
dont know you anymore

chorus
tell me what did you expect
