looking back in my childhood
wasnt too bad but it wasnt that great
i carry the luggage like a bag of bricks
feels like its holding me down again

prechorus
staring down a pitch black road
painted lines show me the direction
sun is burning on my face
sun is setting me on fire

chorus
nobody told me where to go
nobody told me where to run

verse 2
i cant find my way back home
lost my head down there somewhere
could we just be gone alone
lived in doubt and fear ive shown

prechorus 2
gazing down a long gray road
i see the stop sign way up ahead
the sun is burning on my face
the sun is setting me on fire
