at the corner café… she scrapes some quarters off the table
says thanks yeah now maybe ill be able
to get that black mercedes ive been savin for
aw the other girls say you oughta undo a couple buttons
start showin off a little somethin
she says naw you go head think id rather stay poor
see im just makin rent
she said this aint where my road ends

chorus
this may not be my town but itll do for now
til i can figure out who i am and where im goin
shes slingin eggs and bacon with a college education
just hangin out and waitin for a better plan shes ok not knowin
shes young and the worlds wide open

verse 2
theres a rusty old ford
lives out back behind the diner
sittin there waitin on her
to make her mind up
itchin to sling a little gravel
take her who know where
maybe head out west
its in gods hands i guess
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
this may not be my town but itll do for now
til i can figure out who i am and where im goin
shes slingin eggs and bacon with a college education
just hangin out and waitin for a better plan shes ok not knowin
shes young and the worlds wide open

outro
she throws down that apron
takes the money shes been makin
her lifes out there waitin
got a better plan
thats where shes goin goin goin
shes young and the worlds wide openembed"
