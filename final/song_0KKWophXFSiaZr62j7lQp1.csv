lets make this complicated
thinking is overrated
were busting out of this shitty little town and
green grass and colored lenses
tear down these picket fences
burn in our beds while the city lies sleeping

chorus
why oh why
are we starting up and going down
and my oh my
just the two of us in nothingtown
our superhero play
well leave this town today
hold on tighter with my lighter shining through

verse 2
these city streets are burning
rose red your wheels are turning
make me believe someday we could really leave and
blindfold a new direction
stop asking better questions
dont figure out that were never getting out and

chorus
why oh why
are we starting up and going down
and my oh my
just the two of us in nothingtown
our superhero play
well leave this town today
and ill row it if you steer it
ill yell until you hear it
hold on tighter with my lighter shining through
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
why oh why
are we starting up and going down
and my oh my
just the two of us in nothingtown
our superhero play
our dreams get in the way
and ill row it if you steer it
ill yell until you hear it
hold on tighter with my lighter shining through

outro
still stuck in nothingtown
still stuck in nothingtown
come on lets goembed"
