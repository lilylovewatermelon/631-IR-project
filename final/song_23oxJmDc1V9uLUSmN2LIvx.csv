theres a place off ocean avenue
where i used to sit and talk with you
we were both sixteen and it felt so right
sleepin all day stayin up all night
stayin up all night

verse 2
theres a place on the corner of cherry street
we would walk on the beach in our bare feet
we were both eighteen and it felt so right
sleepin all day stayin up all night
stayin up all night

chorus
if i could find you now things would get better
we could leave this town and run forever
let your waves crash down on me and take me away

verse 3
theres a piece of you thats here with me
its everywhere i go its everything i see
when i sleep i dream and it gets me by
i can makebelieve that youre here tonight
that youre here tonight

if i could find you now things would get better

let your waves crash down on me and take me away

i remember the look in your eyes
when i told you that this was goodbye
you were beggin me not tonight
not here not now
were looking up at the same night sky ooh
and keep pretendin the sun will not rise ooh
well be together for one more night ooh
somewhere somehow

chorus
if i could find you now things would get better
we could leave this town and run forever
i know somewhere somehow well be together
let your waves crash down on me and take me away18embed"
