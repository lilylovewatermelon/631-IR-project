my teeth are rottin away
i’ve leathered all my skin
and my blood is gettin thin
my whole fuckin character’s changed
i dont know who i used to be
but it certainly isnt me
anymore and more i drink i am afraid
that im just killin myself
got me fearin for my health
im scared as hell is just a place on earth
and i pray to god i leave
before satan pours another drink

chorus
im just living like the man
i’m just living like the man on fire
i just don’t care that much
im just living like the man
i’m just living like the man on fire
i just dont care that much

verse 2
combustible confused and free
i no longer see that coast
that i always used to see
and i think you drifted far from me
why am i talkin to a ghost
that ive never even seen
and i haven’t even heard you speak
in several months go by so quick
maybe youre just full of shit
you never last im sorry i just said that
maybe life was just a bet
that i lost to drugs and cigarettes

im just living like the man
im just living like the man on fire
i just dont care that much
im just living like the man
im just living like the man on fire
i just dont care that much

bridge
in my mind i will wander and wait
til i see your fire escape
my teeth are rottin away
ive leathered all my skin
and my blood is gettin thin

chorus
im just living like the man
im just living like the man on fire
i just dont care that much
im just living like the man
im just living like the man on fire
i just dont care that much4embed"
