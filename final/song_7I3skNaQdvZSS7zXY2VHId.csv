sometimes i feel cold even paralyzed
my interior world needs to sanitize
ive got to step through or i’ll dissipate
ill record my step through for my basement tapes

chorus
nice to know my kind will be on my side
i dont believe the hype
and you know you’re a terrible sight
but youll be just fine
just dont believe the hype

verse 2
yeah they might be talking behind your head
your exterior world can step off instead
it might take some friends and a warmer shirt
but you dont get thick skin without getting burnt

chorus
nice to know my kind will be on my side
i dont believe the hype
and you know youre a terrible sight
but youll be just fine
just dont believe the hype
take me with you

we’re gonna rely pretty heavily
on technology
and energy
to cover up the fact that we’re only two people
but i think we can do it
no i dont know which way i’m going
but i can hear my way around
no i dont know which way im going
but i can hear my way around
no i dont know which way i’m going
but i can hear my way around
no i dont know which way im going
but i can hear my way around
but i can hear my way around

chorus
nice to know my kind will be on my side
i dont believe the hype
and you know youre a terrible sight
but youll be just fine
just dont believe the hype
dont believe the hype
nice to know my kind will be on my side
i dont believe the hype
and you know youre a terrible sight
but youll be just fine
just dont believe the hype
nice to know my kind will be on my side
i dont believe the hype
and you know youre a terrible sight
but youll be just fine
