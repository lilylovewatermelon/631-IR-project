i wanna ride your wave again
dont tell me i can just pretend
i love you but theres still a taste
dont know if youll always be amazed
right now
i wanna love you tonight

verse 2
why did you have to say goodnight
i love you but it dont feel right
nobody seems to really know
this feelings getting overgrown
slow down
i wanna love you tonightyou might also like19embed"
