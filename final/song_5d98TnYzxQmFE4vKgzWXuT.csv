standin at the back door
she tried to make it fast
one tear hit the hardwood
it fell like broken glass
she said sometimes love slips away
and you just can’t get it back
let’s face it
for one split second
she almost turned around
but that would be like pouring raindrops
back into a cloud
so she took another step
and said i see the way out and im gonna take it

chorus
i dont wanna spend my life jaded
waitin to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by
wasted

verse 2
another glass of whiskey but it still dont kill the pain
so he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
he said its time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
gotta face it

cause i dont wanna spend my life jaded
waitin to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by
wasted
oh i dont wanna keep on wishin missin
the still of the morning the color of the night
i aint spendin no more time
wasted

bridge
she kept driving along
till the moon and the sun were floatin sidebyside
he looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
for the first time in a while
hey yeah

chorus
oh i dont wanna spend my life jaded
waitin to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by
wasted
oh i dont wanna keep on wishin missin
the still of the morning the color of the night
i aint spendin no more time
wasted
oh i dont wanna spend my life jaded
waitin to wake up one day and find
that i let all these years go by
wasted
yeah yeah
oh i dont wanna keep on wishin missin
the still of the morning the color of the night
i aint spendin no more time
