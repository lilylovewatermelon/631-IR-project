they thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn as they hung you from trees in your backyard
they thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded katrina
he thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire virginia tech columbine stop the violence

they think its cool to ride down on you in blue and white and unmarked cars busting you upside your head
