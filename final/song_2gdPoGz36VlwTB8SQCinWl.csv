bluegrass and string band music

bluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in american music  followers dont look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life  youll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members and many make it their lifes work  that kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music whether its history and tradition they hear or that they hear it as a true expression of americana the performers and their audiences are passionate youll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by leslie blake price entitled bluegrass nation a historical and cultural analysis of americas truest music

any discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknowledge the contributions of the carter family  they were one of the most influential groups in country music history and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to folk stories in song  the original group consisted of ap his wife sara and her sister maybelle  they influenced all that followed in country and folk music from woody guthrie pete seeger and doc watson all the way up to bob dylan emmylou harris and ketch secor

its unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the carter familys contributions ap collected hundreds of appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today  they recorded hundreds of songs but will the circle be unbroken wildwood flower and keep on the sunny side will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music

that foundation work was builtup by those who followed  in bluegrass there are no better examples of where we are today today than earl skruggs foggy mountain breakdown the foggy mountain boys rollin in my sweet babys arms or the osborne brothers rocky top but here is a short list of more recent and also great examples of bluegrass and string musicold crow medicine shows sweet amarillothe steeldrivers wearin a holethe grascals old friend of minedailey  vincents take me back and leave me therealy bain jerry douglas and russ barenbergs
