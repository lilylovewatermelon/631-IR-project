you hear a new song and its your favorite
but pretty soon youll be changing the station
and all your old shoes are lookin brand new
they wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
heavy into everything ready for the next thing
to catch your eye for a while then youre over it
you change your mind on it
soon as the shines gone
like you always do but you dont know it yet but

chorus
whoa whoa
whoa whoa
i aint gonna be that easy to leave
whoa whoa
whoa whoa
girl im gonna make you miss me
make you wish that you were sleepin in my shirt
lie about my jacket and tell everyone its yours
when your phone rings after midnight and youre thinkin maybe its me
im gonna make you miss me

verse 2
youre cold and hot
you burn out like a match
keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
you think its easy but thats a lie
the only reason that youre good at goodbye is
every boy youve ever met was too easy to forget
well i aint goin out like that

writing letters that youre never gonna mail
stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
cause you cant fall asleep and youre wishin you were with me

when youre dialin my number listening to my favorite bands
