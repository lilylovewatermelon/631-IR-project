ill never forget that feeling
when i watched you disappear
when you made me stop believing
i could fight away the fear

prechorus
now the smoke has cleared and the end is near
it was my illusion
like a broken dream i was incomplete
but your love was never the missing piece

chorus
i feel like im breathin again
i feel like im seein again
i feel like im breathin again
i got it under control oh oh
i got it under control oh oh
i got it under control oh oh

verse 2
now all thats real is faded
like a car into the night
like a pain killer i take it
and i watch the world ignite
