i know you miss me
who its gon be if it aint me lil baby
im in your city
cause i need it one more time
might lose it all i swear
i need it tonight ooh ah

verse 1 lil baby
how we get so deep so fast
bae stop playin ill beat your ass
you be on some toxic shit but i cannot get off this bitch i
havent seen you in three months i miss you can i see you bae
every time i see one of your pictures that shit drives me crazy
girl i know you miss a nigga
especially how i kiss it
message say delivered
why the fuck you keep goin missing on me
every time he get back in the picture you act different on me
ayy tell that nigga we gon have to share you i aint trippin on it
one more time might be the best for both of us
maybe we should talk about it later when we sober up
maybe we should keep it goin maybe we should let it go
feel like if its meant its what it is so just let it flow
got somethin to handle so ima be here for a couple hours
figured out you like them my assistant keep on sendin flowers
they got they own business tell me why the fuck they all in ours
mama raised a lot of things but she aint raised no fuckin coward
we went to the moon last time im tryna go back
we been doin our thing for a while but they dont know that
i be buyin you all type of bags but you cant show that
i be playin the cut until you come back

i know you miss me
who its gon be if it aint me lil baby
im in your city
cause i need it one more time
might lose it all i swear
i need it tonight ooh ah

verse 2 lil baby
thinkin how we played out
really i feel off about it but aint never said it
we aint gotta talk about it
theyll never know when im with you i play a different role
cant move off emotion this shit deep now i got selfcontrol
i aint never tried to hold you niggas try to high and low me
i can break it down in dumbest terms and show you how you owe me
still try and back door me i know how to go about it
i know everything but i treat you like i dont know about it
wildin in skyami we took shrooms and caught a different vibe
bitches cant fuck with you you the one for real i peep your style
i gotta get to it im ot so its gon be a while
it feel a lil better when i aint seen you yeah

chorus fridayy
i know you miss me
who its gon be if it aint me lil baby
im in your city
cause i need it one more time
might lose it all i swear
i need it tonight ooh ah2embed"
