took a fuckin sip from my ash can
it didnt bother me too much
i spit another tooth in the trash can
i gave up on keepin me in touch

chorus
when i go out it aint gonna hurt at all
a choir of angels euthanasia

verse 2
behold a sober moment
too short and far between
i should crack one open
to celebrate bein clean

chorus
when i go out it aint gonna hurt at all
an end to anger euthanasia
when i go out it aint gonna hurt at all
familiar stranger euthanasia

outro
they say its painless
