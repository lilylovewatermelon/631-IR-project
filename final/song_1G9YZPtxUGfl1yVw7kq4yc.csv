hit me 310
and ill be home at some point
past sundown because traffic
you already know that oh
ill put on a show
if you just come over
im sorry your house is in glendale
or somewhere far

i would drive all night to get to you
but my curfew is early and moms up at home
i would run for miles to get to you
but you gotta understand i cant cause

im all out of luck
im minorly stuck oh

verse 2

well meet by the freeway
its shady but better than nothing
