this town is my home its deep in my soul
thats why im at home even when im on the road

verse 1
grew up in the backdrop of a small town nissan truck dropped down
volkswagen rabbit with the top down sitting on bbss how that sound
yeah yall remember that dont ya dont ddont ddont ddont donts ya
thats where i come from houston county no distance a tour bus can take me
make me forget getting my ass whipped in the parkin lot of mazzios
skippin church the first time i heard planet rock come out a boom box
that may be the day god saved my soul soul i take a little bit
of everything i ever learned with me anywhere on this globe i go
nobody can take that i think back linda may gave me the name
now danny boones in your radio and for those that think that i changed i did
the world out there took a na√Øve kid scarred his heart and beat him down
and this songs me comin back around from outta town what up folk

hook
this town is my home its deep in my soul
thats why im at home even when im on the road

northside high school makin beats on the top of my desk whenever the teacher left the room
three years of ridin the bench wantin to play more than the last thirteen seconds of the game
trying to get a name hangin with the hoodlums my girlfriend ended up doin every one of them
none of em ever thought i knew but i do but its cool cuz i used to do your boo too
stealing cigarettes and malt liquor rockin the pep rally in a cardigan sweater
vowed that i would quit partying never
but now we got death and meth and nothing left but questions in our minds
and do you think this town is ever going to change in our time
its in the sky a mile high
its on your table that black label
its in your locker that bottle of vodka
sardines and pork and beans
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likehook
this town is my home its deep in my soul
thats why im at home even when im on the road

i sit on the trunk of a 66 pontiac where the party at
im askin my kinfolk as the sun gets low
can i get a hit of your cognac
hell no yall know aint nothing but a corner left
did yall hear about peanut he nutted up
four police cars he was raising hell
took mace and billy club to shut him up
well been sittin here by myself
drinkin easy jesus with a dime to sell
laying low cause i just got out of jail myself
one of these days im gonna leave this place
and yall might never ever see my face again
friends been friends since we were little bitty
now were grown and this is our home

hook
this town is my home its deep in my soul
thats why im at home even when im on the roadembed"
