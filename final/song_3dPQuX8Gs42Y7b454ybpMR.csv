im gonna fight em off
a seven nation army couldnt hold me back
theyre gonna rip it off
takin their time right behind my back
and im talkin to myself at night because i cant forget
back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette

prechorus
and the message comin from my eyes says leave it alone
instrumental chorus

verse 2
dont wanna hear about it
every single ones got a story to tell
everyone knows about it
from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
and if i catch it comin back my way im gonna serve it to you
and that aint what you want to hear but thats what ill do

prechorus
and the feelin comin from my bones says find a home
instrumental chorus

im goin to wichita
far from this opera forevermore
im gonna work the straw
make the sweat drip out of every pore
and im bleedin and im bleedin and im bleedin right before the lord
all the words are gonna bleed from me and i will think no more

prechorus
and the stains comin from my blood tell me go back home
