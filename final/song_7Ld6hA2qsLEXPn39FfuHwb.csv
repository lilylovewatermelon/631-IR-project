wasnt really thinking wasnt looking
wasnt searching for an answer
in the moonlight when i saw your face

saw you looking at me
saw you peeking out from under moon beams
through the palm trees
swaying in the breeze

i know im feeling so much more than ever before
and so im giving more to you than i thought i could do
dont know how it happened dont know why but you dont really need a reason
when the stars shine
just to fall in love

made to love each other made to be together for a life time
in the sunshine
flying in the sky
i know im feeling so much more than ever before
and so im giving more to you than i though i could do
now i know love is real
so when sky high as the angels dry
letting you and i fly loveyou might also likeembed"
