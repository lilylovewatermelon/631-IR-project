hey look out for that movin van drivin down our streets
you better lock up your man before he meets

verse 1 corny collins council girls  amber
the new girl in town who just came on the scene
the new girl in town cant be more than sixteen
and shes got a way of makin a boy act like a clown
woah woah woah woah
we dont know what to do bout the new girl in town

verse 2 corny collins council girls  shelley  tammy
the new girl in town seems to dance on air
the new girl in town shes got the coolest hair
you better tell the homecoming queen to hold on to her crown
woah woah woah woah
or shes gonna lose it to the new girl in town

bridge shelly tammy amber all
shes hip
so cool
im gonna get her after school
and yet wed like to be like her
cause shes the kitten that the cats prefer

verse 3 the dynamites
spoken
ladies step aside
sung
the new girl in town has my guy on a string
the new girl in town hey look shes wearin his ring
i cant stop crying and so in my own tears im gonna drown
woah woah woah woah
cause he wants to rendezvous with the new girl
we kinda sad and blue yes its true girl
wed like to say to the new girl in town
the new girl in town
woah woah woah woah

from out of the blue girl
