floating underwater
ever changing picture
hours out from land
in tune with all our dreams
the ocean takes me in
to watch you shake it
watch you wave your powers
tempt with hours of pleasure

prechorus
take me one more time
take me one more wave
take me for one last ride
im out of my head

chorus
tonight
tonight
tonight
tonight
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
tonight we ride

cruising through the city
after hours with me
fusing all our powers
heres to all our dreams

prechorus
take me one more time
take me one more wave
take me for one last ride
im out of my head

chorus
tonight
tonight
tonight
tonight
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
the sound of the waves collide
tonight we ride25embed"
