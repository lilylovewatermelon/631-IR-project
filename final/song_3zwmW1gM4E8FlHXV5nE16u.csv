someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone
someone kills the pain spinning in the silence
she finally drifts away
someone gets excited in a chapel yard catches a bouquet
another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

prechorus
yeah and to be yourself is all that you can do
hey to be yourself is all that you can do

verse 2
someone finds salvation in everyone another only pain
someone tries to hide himself down inside himself he prays
someone swears his true love until the end of time another runs away
separate or united healthy or insane

chorus
to be yourself is all that you can do all that you can do oh
to be yourself is all that you can do  all that you can do oh
to be yourself is all that you can do  all that you can do oh
to be yourself is all that you can do

and even when youve paid enough
been pulled apart or been held up
every single memory of the good or bad
faces of luck dont lose any sleep tonight
im sure everything will end up alright
