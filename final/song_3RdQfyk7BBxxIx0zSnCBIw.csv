we started living in an old house
my ma gave birth and we were checking it out
it was a baby boy so we bought him a toy
it was a ray gun and it was 1981

verse 2
we named him baby he had a toothache
he started crying it sounded like an earthquake
it didnt last long because i stopped it
i grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

verse 3
now were a family and were alright now
we got money and a little place to fight now
we dont know you and we dont owe you
but if you see us around i got something else to show you

instrumental break

verse 4
now its easy when you dont know better
you think its sleazy then put it in a short letter
we keep warm but theres just something wrong with you
just feel that youre the hardest little button to button
you might also likeverse 5
i had opinions that didnt matter
i had a brain that felt like pancake batter
i got a backyard with nothing in it
except a stick a dog and a box with something in it

chorus
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button ohoh
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button ohoh
the hardest button to button
the hardest button to button
