my heart dont race when someones at my door
ive almost given up thinking youre ever gonna call
i dont believe in magic anymore
i just dont lie awake at night
asking god to get you off my mind
its gettin better all the time
its gettin better all the time

yeah i got to work on time again this morning
this ol job is all that i got left
and no one even noticed id been crying
but at least i dont have whiskey on my breath
yeah i think im gonna make it
cause god wont make a mountain i cant climb
its gettin better all the time
its gettin better all the time

god i hope youre happy
girl i wish you well
i just might get over you
you cant ever tell

i always thought that id do something crazy
if i ever saw you out with someone else
but when the moment came last night i couldnt say a word
i stood there in the dark all by myself
yeah i could have said a million things
but all i did was keep it locked inside
its gettin better all the time
its gettin better all the time
