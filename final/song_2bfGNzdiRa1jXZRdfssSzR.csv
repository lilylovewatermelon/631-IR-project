i need a gun to keep myself among
poor people who are burning in the sun
but they aint got a chance they aint got a chance
i need a gun cause all i do is dance
cause all i do is dance

instrumental break

chorus san fernandez youth chorus
i need a gun to keep myself among
the poor people who are burning in the sun
but they aint got a chance they aint got a chance
i need a gun cause all i do is dance
cause all i do is dance
verse bootie brown
in my backpack i got my act right in case you act quite difficult
and your result weaken with anger and discontent
some are seekin and searchin like nimoy
im a peaceloving decoy ready for retaliation
i change your whole location to a pine box six under
impulsive dont ask why or wonder
orders given to me is strike and im thunder
with lightningfast reflexes
on constant alert from the constant hurt
that seems limitless with no drop in pressure
it seems like everybodys out to test ya til they see you break
you cant conceal the hate that consumes you
im the reason why you fill up your isuzu
chill with your old lady at the tilt
i got a ninetyday extension and im filled with guilt
from things done and seen
your waters from a bottle mines from a canteen
at night i hear the shots ring so im a light sleeper
the cost of life it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert with my street sweeper
the war is over so said the speaker
with the flight suit on
maybe to him im just a pawn
so he can advance
remember when i used to dance
man all i wanna do is dance
