yeah

verse 1
you hold me inside your iris like a
a terminal stain on life
you condescend to my primal brain and
twist me around like a knife

prechorus
cant begin to explain
the feelings i have restrained
dont ask me how i am
because youre too busy planning your epitaph
let me tell you

chorus
dont try to be the one person
who has stayed just to say
they never left me
aggravated complicated someone say it
god i never learn

verse 2
you keep me hidden behind a curtain
an audible human display
you feed me orchids to give me courage
and keep me in line with disdain

cant begin to explain
the feelings i have restrained
dont ask me how i am
because youre too busy planning your epitaph
let me tell you

chorus
dont try to be the one person
who has stayed just to say
they never left me
aggravated complicated someone say it
god i never learn

bridge
i have nothing left for you
you left me with nothing
and i have nothing left for you
you left me with nothing

verse 3
i live at arms length and die a little
between your constants by day
i want my soul back before its over
i cant even wish you away
prechorus
cant begin to explain
the feelings i have restrained
dont ask me how i am
because youre too busy planning your epitaph
let me tell you

chorus
dont try to be the one person
who has stayed just to say
they never left me
aggravated complicated someone say it
god i never learn
