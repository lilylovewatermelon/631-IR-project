well i been spendin all my money on weed n pills
tryin to write a song thatll pay the bills
but it aint came yet so guess ill have to rob a bank
i guess it could be worse it aint that bad
at least i aint sittin in ol baghdad
in the middle of a hot damn desert sittin in a tank
well every time the wife talks a baby gets mentioned
im so broke i cant pay attention
lord how it tears me up to see her cry
oh i been spendin all my nights on the internet
looking for a clue but aint found one yet
just a bunch of mopars guitars  other stuff i cant buy

chorus
well now lord if you can hear me
wont you throw a damn dog a bone
cause if the devil shows up with a better deal
this old souls agoin down
oh i sing em real pretty sing em real sad
and all the people in the crowd say he aint halfbad
well they call me king turd up here on shit mountain
if you want it you can have the crown

verse 2
well i been sittin on my ass like a bump on a log
watchin andy and ol boss hog
i guess i ought to get up and go out and find a job
instead of sittin on the couch trying to find the next line
im sure theres gotta be a better use of my time
like figurin out which one of these banks im agonna go rob
well the name of the game is hurry up and wait
but that aint putting no food on my plate
or gas in my car and i drive a bronco
so lord if i could just get me a record deal
i might not have to worry about my next meal
but ill still be trying to figure out what the hell rhymes with bronco
you might also likechorus
well now lord if you can hear me
wont you throw a damn dog a bone
cause if the devil shows up with a better deal
this old souls agoin down
oh i sing em real pretty sing em real sad
and all the people in the crowd say he aint halfbad
well they call me king turd up here on shit mountain
if you want it you can have the crown
well they call me king turd up here on shit mountain
if you want it you can have the crown4embed"
