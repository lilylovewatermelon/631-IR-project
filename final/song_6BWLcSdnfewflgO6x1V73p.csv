i think you know what im getting at
i find it so upsetting that
the memories that you select
you keep the bad but the good you just forget
and even though im angry i can still say
i know my heart will break the day
when you peel out and drive away
i cant believe this happened

prechorus
and all this time i never thought
that all we had would be all for naught

chorus
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you
cause you took this too far too far

verse 2
make your decision and dont you dare think twice
go with your instincts along with some bad advice
this didnt turn out the way i thought it would at all
you blame me but some of this is still your fault
i tried to move you but you just wouldnt budge
i tried to hold your hand but youd rather hold your grudge
i think you know what im getting at
you said goodbye and i just dont want you regretting that
you might also likechorus
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you

bridge
and wisdom always chooses
these black eyes and these bruises
over the heartache that they say
never completely goes away
i just cant believe this happened
and wisdom always chooses and one day well see this come around
these black eyes and these bruises and one day well see this come around
over the heartache that they say
never completely goes away

chorus
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you
no i dont hate you
dont want to fight you
know ill always love you but right now i just dont like you
cause you took this too far
outro
what happened to us
i heard that its me we should blame
what happened to us
why didnt you stop me from turnin out this way
and know that i dont hate you
and know that i dont want to fight you
and know ill always love you
but right now i just dontembed"
