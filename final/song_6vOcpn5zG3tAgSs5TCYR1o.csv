you see all the flowers in the weeds
youre scared of the dark when you sleep
you cover up your arms with your sleeves
even in hundred degree heat
your father was awfully mean
your favorite color is green
it reminds you of the summer you turned three
runnin through sprinklers on your street

prechorus
and you laugh and you dance in the wind
and you sway and you hug and you kiss
but theres darkness behind those eyes
even when you smile

chorus
oh summer child
you dont have to act like all you feel is mild
you dont really love the sun it drives you wild
youre lyin summer child

verse 2
arеnt you way too busy takin care of everybody
to takе care of yourself
when the sun goes missing arent the flowers just as pretty
arent the oceans just as deep
the trees as green and as for me
ill watch you weep

oh summer child
you dont have to act like all you feel is mild
you dont really love the sun it drives you wild
youre lyin summer child12embed"
