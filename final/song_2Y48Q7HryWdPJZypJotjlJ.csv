when i feel that chill smell that fresh cut grass
im back in my helmet cleats and shoulder pads
standing in the huddle listening to the call
fans going crazy for the boys of fall
they didnt let just anybody in that club
took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
to get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
kings of the school man were the boys of fall

chorus
well its turn and face the stars and stripes
its fighting back them butterflies
its call it in the air alright yes sir we want the ball
and its knocking heads and talking trash
its slinging mud and dirt and grass
its i got your number i got your back when your backs against the wall
you mess with one man you got us all
the boys of fall

verse 2
in little towns like mine thats all they got
newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops
the old men will always think they know it all
young girls will dream about the boys of fall
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
well its turn and face the stars and stripes
its fighting back them butterflies
its call it in the air alright yes sir we want the ball
and its knocking heads and talking trash
its slinging mud and dirt and grass
its i got your number i got your back when your backs against the wall
you mess with one man you got us all
the boys of fall

chorus
well its turn and face the stars and stripes
its fighting back them butterflies
its call it in the air alright yes sir we want the ball
and its knocking heads and talking trash
its slinging mud and dirt and grass
its i got your number i got your back when your backs against the wall
you mess with one man you got us all
the boys of fall
