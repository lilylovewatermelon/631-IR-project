ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy thats probably tago
had to run that bitch back
i swear once they see where a nigga come from
all of this shit that you had to go through bruh
they dont understand
i bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw hey lilkdubb

verse
young nigga from the bottom of the map
came up riding with the strap iron on his lap
one false move get whacked
got the whole hood on his back
and its just like that
for my niggas trapped in the trap
pray to god we all make it back pray we all make it back
gotta pray we all make it back
and i know its raw that i rap
but a street nigga first
tell the crackers free mac deezy
ma look at your son im on tv
they didnt believe me
nigga went and got it off the greezy
its hard but i make it look easy a crazy achievement
wont really fuck with no rappers
all these niggas hustling backwards
misguiding  the youth
but long as i know the truth
thats another subject for after
and im riding in the rover
12 keep on trying to pull me over
asking a nigga if i stole it i bought it i own it
i remember walking to school
catching the bus early morning like ma i aint going
i was in the hallways roaming
but i still got my diploma i got my diploma
went to school all twelve years just to get a job selling donuts man thats crazy
i aint with the minimum waging
i aint with the modern day slavery
the fuck is you saying
told the crackers fuck you pay me
had to tell em fuck you pay me
its back to the block
well i guess its back to the block
in the streets running round playing hooky hooky
and i aint never sold no crack but im so street i can cook it
you might also likebridge
and i know its hard to find a way
but youre bound to see brighter days
a million dollars cant change me nigga
cause hard times made me nigga
a hard grind saved me nigga
i got it off the pavement nigga
i got it off the pavement my nigga

chorus
young nigga from the bottom of the map
came up riding with the strap yeah yeah
