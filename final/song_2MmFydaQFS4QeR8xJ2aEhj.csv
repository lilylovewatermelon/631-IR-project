verse 1
clearly this is new for me
i get excited when youre here my dear

this time love wont let me leave
please be patient hesitation aside

but in the meantime let me say whats on my mind

chorus

girl you and me together well take over the world
you know i love you i need your soul
so happy i just wanna let everybody know

bridge 1

when i was scared to let it show
having too much fun this and that or what
now that youre mine
ha yeah somewhere along the way everything fell in place
