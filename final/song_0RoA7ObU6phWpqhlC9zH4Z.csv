i close my eyes and i can see
a world thats waiting up for me
that i call my own
through the dark through the door
through where no ones been before
but it feels like home

prechorus ziv zaifman
they can say they can say it all sounds crazy
they can say they can say ive lost my mind
i dont care i dont care so call me crazy
we can live in a world that we design

chorus ziv zaifman
cause every night i lie in bed
the brightest colors fill my head
a million dreams are keepin me awake
i think of what the world could be
a vision of the one i see
a million dreams is all its gonna take
oh a million dreams for the world were gonna make

verse 2 ziv zaifman
theres a house we can build
every room inside is filled
with things from far away
special things i compile
each one there to make you smile
on a rainy day
