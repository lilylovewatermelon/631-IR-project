i thought i had myself all figured out
but ive spent my whole life holding myself down
and it seems to be that sort of thing i keep doing constantly
addicted to the pain i cause myself
my head is floating somewhere in the clouds
while im paid to entertain a lively crowd
they sing my songs and feel my pain cause pain is what creates my fame
a vicious cycle some day ill get out

chorus
i cant believe im standing here at all
i cant believe i made it this far
on my way with a smile on my face
to the top and im not falling off
and all i need is a microphone ill sing
about the things that have been hurting me
its safe to say all the kids i relate
to their lives so just keep holding on

verse 2
its hard enough try walking in my shoes
to be picked on by my peers too much abuse
and im tired of not fitting in true friends is my final wish
just let me be myself and make it through
i have tried so hard to be a better soul
i have worked so hard at making myself whole
and through it all my better years are still ahead my mind is clear
just trust me when i say im in control
