were the best of friends and we share our secrets
she knows everything that is on my mind ohh
lately somethins changed as i lie awake in my bed
a voice here inside my head softly says

chorus
why dont you kiss her
why dont you tell her
why dont you let her see the feelings that you hide
cause shell never know if you never show the way you feel inside

verse 2
oh im so afraid to make that first move
just a touch and we could cross the line ohh
every time shes near i wanna never let her go
confess to her what my heart knows
hold her close

chorus
why dont you kiss her
why dont you tell her
why dont you let her see the feelings that you hide
cause shell never know if you never show the way you feel inside

bridge
what would you say
i wonder would she just turn away
or would she promise me that shes here to stay
it hurts me to wait
i keep asking myself

why dont you kiss her tell her you love her
why dont you tell her tell her you need her
why dont you let her see the feelings that you hide
cause shell never know if you never show the way you feel inside
why dont you kiss her why dont you kiss herembed"
