you and me forever
we belong together
and well always endeavor
throughout any type of weather

chorus
you want everything to be just like
the stories that you read but never write
you gotta learn to live and live and learn
you gotta learn to give and wait your turn
or youll get burned

verse 2
you wrote our names down on the sidewalk
the rain came and washed em off
so we should write em again on wet cement
so people a long time from now will know what we meant

chorus
you want every morning to be just like
the stories that you read but never write
you gotta learn to live and live and learn
you gotta learn to give and wait your turn
my only concern
you might also likeverse 3
im adding something new to the mixture
so theres a different hue to your picture
a different ending to this fairytale
when the sunset into which we sail

chorus
you want everything to be just like
the stories that you read but you cant write
you gotta learn to live and live and learn
you gotta learn to give and wait your turn
or youll get burned5embed"
