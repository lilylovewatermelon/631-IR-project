there aint nobody asking me where ive been
there aint nobody that would name me as a friend
there aint nobody thats droppin by to say hi
there aint nobody thats caring whether i live or die
i have nobody to tell about my growing angers
i have nobody to tell about me following strangers
there aint nobody making sure im taking all of my pills
there aint nobody slowing me down and keeping me still
im truly alone

chorus
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone truly alone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone im so alone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone truly alone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone

verse 2 violent j
there aint nobody telling me not to jump off
there aint nobody telling me not to chop your block off
i get so bloody i ruin all of my clothes
i get so bloody i sit in the dark alone
i have nobody to tell about my dark fantasies
i have nobody to tell about my dark realities
there aint nobody around me nobody wanna be friends
i get so bloody all on me the mess never ends
im truly alone

they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone truly alone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone im so alone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone my brain is gone completely gone
they say a man can only be alone for so long
before the mans mind is gone

verse 3 violent j
i walked into a super k and went to the back
i started askin questions checkin out the chainsaw rack
they had a test model i pulled the cord and got it runnin
turned the blade on the kid working and blood started gunnin
what the fuck am i doing i dropped the shit and started crying
i made it down two aisles before some hero clotheslined me
i got up grabbed a shovel and stabbed him in the gut
i pulled it out and hammered it across the back of his nug
im hearing sirens going off its no blue light specials
i turned murderer caving in to daily life pressures
but fuck that now all yall gonna know me
seein me on tv being like look there go my homie
im more than lonely im lost lives are the cost
i just beat some bitch in the head stabbed her twice and took off
they cant find me im hidin in the flannel coat rack
i jump out and attack and put a gash in your neck
i finally made to the front door and to the parking lot
thats when i got shot a lot i got got
police with bullets and more bullets pluggin me deep
im seeing flashes hearing screamin and its all over me
i see a crowd of people being held behind the police tape
all watching me die i think i made no mistake
i finally got some recognition dying on my knees
ready for hell because compared to my life it should be an ease
outro
like easy
cake walk
im ready2embed"
