well ive been lost in this town
even though i know my way around
didnt take me long until i found the devil
with just one word i knew his voice
is the one i heard in every choice i made
just trying to be a rebel
in a small town in a small town

if you jumped off of our front porch
youd land right where the civil war was fought
and its never been forgotten
its twenty miles to the interstate
theres a burger king and a motel 8
and the only thing between here and there is cotton

chorus
and jeffrey prays to jesus asking him please just help us through one more day
jenny gets high she wastes her life but me i just ran away
from a small town from a small town

verse 2
sometimes it was heaven sometimes hell
kind of like church kind of like jail
theres a water tower says welcome to nowhere
as soon as i could i was long gone
my jeans were torn and my hair was long
now i cant believe i want to go back there
to a small town to a small town
