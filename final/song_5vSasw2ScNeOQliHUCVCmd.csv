verse 1
our love what we once treasured
your ways what i remember most of all
cant quite get away from the days we love so heavenly
your kiss such a sweet surrender
that day when i let my temper get the best of what we used to have
now i got to ask you can you make it

chorus
like it used to be
bring back your love to me
i remember when our love was new
and all i needed in my life was you
and baby it felt so right to me
please make it like it used to be
like it used to be

verse 2
now i wont usually press nobody
but why cant words said so hastily
be forgotten and forgiven me
thought the love that we had count for anything else
only one way to find out how and you know how baby
make it baby
