oh do you feel it now musics up in ya
do you feel it loud straight through your ears man
its that mean bass singing pleasure to meet ya
the green and black throw it up so we see ya

verse 2
yall feel the sound its coming straight through the waves
while the music from the earth keeps us sane
im feeling that herb when the sun hits my face
you create your mind so make your mental space

prechorus
much respect to all the people thinking green
not just the color but the message in between
now heres a mental weapon that youll use frequently
to stop evil people and end their beliefs

chorus
green turned to black green smoked to black green turned to black
yea thats what we stand for
green turned to black green smoked to black green turned to black
yea thats what we stand for

verse 3
well mr tough guy he fights physically
when all the people really need is some peace
it are these moments where we turn to our weed
it never caused no death no disease

dont try and make it seem like were some foolish youth
throwing away our lives as were searching for the truth
dont need authorityrules while we go unheard
still there aint no crime using herbs

prechorus
much respect to all the people thinking green
not just the color but the message in between
yes heres a mental weapon that youll use frequently
to stop evil people and end their beliefs
