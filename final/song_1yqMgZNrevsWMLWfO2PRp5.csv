ooh oohoohooh

verse 1
stole a key
took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
took a car downtown and took what they offered me
to set me free
i saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

interlude
oohoohooh

verse 2
in my scarecrow dreams
when they smash my heart into smithereens
be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
be a cartoon heart

chorus
light a fire a fire a spark
light a fire a flame in my heart
well run wild well be glowing in the dark
oohoohooh
well be glowing in the dark
oohoohooh ahooh

all the boys all the girls all that matters in the world
all the boys all the girls all the madness that occurs
all the highs all the lows as the room aspinning goes
well run riot well be glowing in the dark

interlude
ooh oohoohooh ah

outro
so well soar luminous and wired
well be glowing in the dark23embed"
