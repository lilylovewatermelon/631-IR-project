plane crash
yeah illa illa illa
yo im just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me ’cause i feel like i wanna punch the world in the fuckin face right now
yeah
verse
let me explain just how to make greatness
straight out the gate im ’bout to break it down
aint no mistakes allowed but make no mistake im bout
to rape the alphabet i may raise some brows
if i press the issue just to get the anger out brrr
full magazine could take staples out
savage but aint thinkin bout no bank account
but bitch im off the chain like kala brown
motherfucker shut the fuck up when i’m talkin’ lil bitch
i’m sorry wait whats your talent oh critiquin
my talent oh bitch i dont know who the fuck y’all are
to give a subpar bar or even have an opinion of you
you mention me millions of views attention in news
i mention you loselose for me winwin for you
billions of views your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
dont get misconstrued business as us
shitlist renewed so get shit to do
or get dissed cause i just dont get
what the fuck half the shit is that youre listenin to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though probly no
get this fuckin audio out my audi yo adiós
i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though
not even dissin it just aint for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get it
maybe your cups full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill
i should eat a pill probably i will
old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror i dont see my breath
possibly im dead i must be possessed
like an evil spell im evil evil spelled
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vice president mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ man how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick
you wont ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the thames might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah
turn down for what
i aint loud enough nah turn the valium up illa illa illa
cause i dont know how im gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesnt matter what caliber
i spit at ill bet a hundred thousand bucks
youll turn around and just be like man how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks
and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu
but last week an exfan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
itll help me get back to myself and shell love me ooouuu
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing
so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg azae
lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
im fed up with bein humble
and rumor is im hungry im sure you heard rumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to
what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it
im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two
and dump on you if you aint joyner
if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner
im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds
but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin i no longer got it
cause you missed a line and never caught it
cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it
cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist
and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest illa illa illa
even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom
if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i dont see why yall even started with me
i get in beefs my enemies die
i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased
im east side never be caught slippin
now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink
i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats
i dont even close my fuckin eyes when i sneeze
aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage
the thing aint even orange—oh my god thats a reach
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine or you think water is pink
dawg thats a date — looks like an olive to me
look theres an apple — no its not its a peach
so fingerbang pootie tang
burger king gucci gang dookie dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for 2018 to get underway
but im gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah
invite em in like a one a day
im not done preach
cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand was it even worth it
cause the way i see people turnings
makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose
im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined
cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back id at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that hes deserted
but i think its workin
these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous
and hes too scurred to answer me with words
cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least hes heard it
cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him
or ask if im linked to terrorists
i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists
but my beef is more media journalists
hold up hold up hold up
i said my beef is more meaty a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes i mean eating a penis
cause theyve been pannin my album to death
so ive been givin the media fingers
dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but theyve been puttin me through the ringer
so i aint ironin shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleanersyou might also like736embed"
