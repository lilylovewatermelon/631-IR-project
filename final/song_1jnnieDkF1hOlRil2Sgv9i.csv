when your mind is a mess so is mine i cant sleep
cause it hurts when i think my thoughts arent at peace
with the plans that we make the chances we take
theyre not yours theyre not mine
theres waves that can break
all the words that we said and the words that we mean
words can fall short cant see the unseen
cause the world is awake for somebodys sake
now please close your eyes
woman please get some sleep

chorus
and know that if i knew all of the answers
i would not hold them from you
know all of the things that i know
we told each other there is no other way

verse 2
too much silence can be misleading
youre drifting i can hear it in the way that youre breathing
we dont really need to find reason
cause out the same door that it came well its leaving its leaving
leaving like a day thats done and part of a season
resolve is just a concept thats as dead as the leaves
but at least we could sleep its all that we need
when we wake we would find our minds would be free
to go to sleep

and know that if i knew all of the answers
i would not hold them from you
know all of the things that i know
cause we told each other there is no other way6embed"
