say whats wrong my longtime friend
somethings bothering you
tell me what the problem is
ill see what i can do
there are times we disagree
we agree more than we dont
we wont always see eye to eye
but we will more than we wont

chorus
we got friendship
the kind that lasts a lifetime
through all the hardship
you know youre a friend of mine
we got friendship
the kind that lasts a lifetime
through all the hardship
you know youre a friend of mine

verse 2
if youre on the street ill take your hand
if youre hungry ill give you food
if its money you need i got some saved
if youre sick ill visit you
ive been where you are right now
you saw me through it all
ill lean on you you can lean on me
im never gonna let you fall

verse 3
talk to me old pal of mine
if you feel you cant go on
dont you sweat it aint over yet
this bond we share is strong
now your welfare is my concern
you weigh less than you think
ill carry you through the sinking sand
see if i let you sink
