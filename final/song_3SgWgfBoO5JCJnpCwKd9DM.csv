ima put this on everything
mm
gotta be fuckin madonna or somethin
you proud of me im rockin prada this summer

verse
hidin dope in my dreads
crackers in my left lane but im stayin ahead
even in the next life im takin this bread
ima be duckin the fed time
yeah when everybody left me i still had my dreads
id never cut em but if i ever do ima put em in a bag
she a thrill head and a pill head
corona season i finally could walk around with a mask
aint smokin no weed aint drinkin no lean im payin attention to the bag
aint poppin no percs im stayin alert this money been comin in fast
got my heart in a cast yeah
she dressin up in her dress she say for the sake of our love
ima rose gold all your diamonds and accessories too
i know im an uglyass lil nigga but i look better with you
we puttin sg on everything for whatever we do
i keep a maid in some lingerie got a seethrough roof
i know lamar gon win the super bowl first bust to the chiefs
every time lil kodak in detroit i got the buffs on fleek
im keepin chelise and chanel i dont even care if she sleep
bulgari diamonds in my hair she like it more when its neat
when you been through everything like me dont nothin seem that amazin
like all the realest niggas been takin dick up the anus
nowadays everybody wannabe gangsters
nowadays ive been controllin my anger
keep boogers in the face like im still a lil baby
hittin donuts in the wraith just left the yo with lil baby
two babies on the way from two different ladies
that i knew back then way before i was famous
i was gettin my dick sucked by tierra and my mama told them
i killed me a nigga by kiera but she already know
im taxin all my kids seven like im still sellin dope
my people say they proud of me cause they been seein my growth
i dont throw money i left the playhouse throwin racks out the door
i dont throw money im at the bank house throwing racks on the floor
i love you in every form i told you i aint playing
dont leave me dont leave me mami let me know youre still praying
yeah this time i want everything need more money more diamonds
this time i want everything ima guarantee that you smiling
