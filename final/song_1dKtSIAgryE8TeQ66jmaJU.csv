come on now get your ass out of bed
you heard what the man said
the crew is already gone
we were all kinda high but man what were you on
tried to take a shuttle to spain
they kicked me off of the plane
i guess ill go to japan
it all looks the same when you stump for the man

chorus
and down in the valley we crawl in the alley
who knew the 101 was so long
before you get sold you get bought for a song

verse 2
sake in aluminum cans
it fell in the wrong hands
and now were chewing the scene
stumbling out of the lexington queen
walking through a german hotel
and not walking very well
i gotta get to the van
excuse me im weaving as fast as i can
and tom wont admit he got lost in the city
hes saying that the directions are wrong
you might also likerefrain
before you get sold you get bought for a song
before you get sold you get bought for a song

chorus
and down in the valley we crawl in the alley
who knew the 101 was so long
before you get sold you get bought for a song

refrain
before you get sold you get bought for a song
before you get sold you get bought for a songembed"
