lock broken slur spoken
wound open game token
i didnt know you were keeping count
rain soaking blind hoping
you said i was freeloading
i didnt know you were keeping count

chorus
high infidelity
put on your records and regret me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around dancing around it

refrain
do you really wanna know where i was april 29th
do i really have to chart the constellations in his eyes

verse 2
storm coming good husband
bad omen
dragged my feet right down the aisle
at the house lonely good money
id pay if youd just know me
seemed like the right thing at the time

you know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
the slowest way is never loving them enough
do you really wanna know where i was april 29th
do i really have to tell you how he brought me back to life

chorus
high infidelity
put on your records and regret me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around dancing around it

refrain
do you really want to know where i was april 29th
do i really have to chart the constellations in his eyes
you know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
the slowest way is never loving them enough

chorus
high infidelity
put on your records and regret meeting me
i bent the truth too far tonight
i was dancing around dancing around it
high infidelity
put on your headphones and burn my city
your picket fence is sharp as knives
i was dancing around dancing around it

postchorus
oh theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
and its never enough its never enough

outro
lock broken slur spoken

i didnt know you were keeping count
but oh you were keeping count15embed"
