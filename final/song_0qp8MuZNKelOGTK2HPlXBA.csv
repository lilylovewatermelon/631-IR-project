crazy kids understand

crazy kids understand
out late going crazy kids innocent

chorus aap rocky
the girls just want fun
the boys we make noise
the girls kiss the girls
i thank god ahh
the kids will be alright just fine
i heard about all of the long trials in life
all the drugs on my mind
all the troubles i can find
still i smile
the kids will be alright just fine
all the colors are alive
no longer black or white ahh

verse aap rocky
uh kiss the kids call your baby daddy
tell em whos daddy
call your pappy tell him that you happy
shout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly
inside sunny energize
think about it like you feelin alive
on the mama boy she swear to god
lady said that she aint into guys
brand new cedes with the intercom
table made is for the dinner vibe
aint a killer so dont kill the vibe
disrespect them thats a different side
adderall and alcohol yeah
the teachers called the doctor called
the block too hot the marshall called
see em grow and watch em crawl

still i smile
the kids will be alright just fine
