to need someone and not be needed anymore
i know nobodys to blame
my tongues still papercut speaking your name

perhaps you dont understand
when i want you to care but now my worlds in your hands
what am i supposed to do
pretend im happy for you

waited all day to cry
now im here my eyes are dry
couldnt help you in the end
dont know what i was looking to mend

perhaps youve not sung a song
of seeing yourself to every way come up wrong
the world cant hurt me no more
when im the very best at making myself soreyou might also like5embed"
