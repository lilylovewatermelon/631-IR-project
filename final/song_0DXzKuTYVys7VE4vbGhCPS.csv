when youre living in the streets and youre running from cops
and everyday thats just the price you pay
when youre living by the words and the things you say

a little loving from the wrong side
of the bed you sleep in for the long night

wait and see because you know you need somebody
oh yeah somebody oh yeah somebody oh yeah
