many years ago
hoping i would find true love
along the broken road
but i got lost a time or two
wiped my brow and kept pushing through
i couldnt see how every sign
pointed straight to you

that every longlost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
yes he did

i think about the years i spent
just passing through
id like to have the time i lost
and give it back to you
but you just smile and take my hand
youve been there you understand
its all part of a grander plan
that is coming true
you might also likeevery longlost dream
led me to where you are
others who broke my heart
they were like northern stars
pointing me on my way
into your loving arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you

and now im just rolling home
into my lovers arms
this much i know is true
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to you
that god blessed the broken road
that led me straight to youembed"
