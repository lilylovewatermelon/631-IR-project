i knew a girl who hated the world
she used her body to sell her soul
every town theyd break her and pay
tear out her heart and leave her in pain

prechorus
i never found out how she survived
all of the sadness she kept inside
i never found out how she could lie
with a smile on her face and the scratches shed hide

chorus
you could love her if you paid
you could have her everyday
you could love her if you prayed
you could have her every way oh

verse 2
down on her knees she bled on the floor
this hopeless life she wanted no more
dead in her eyes and cold to the bone
she opened her eyes and saw she was alone

prechorus
she never found out how much i tried
all of the sadness she kept made me blind
she never found out how much i cried
the rope so tight on the night that she died
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likechorus
you could love her if you paid
you could have her everyday oh
you could love her if you prayed
you could have her every way oh

prechorus
i never found out how she survived
a life lived in lies is a life of denial
i never found out how she could lie
a smile on her face and the darkness inside

chorus
you could love her if you paid
you could have her everyday oh
you could love her if you prayed
you could have her every way oh

outro
you could love her if you paid
you could have her everyday oh
you could love her if you prayed
you could have her every way oh1embed"
