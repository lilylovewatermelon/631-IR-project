postchorus eminem

oh yeah new year next phase begin
look whos got you goin crazy again
im a trend i set one every time im in
i go out and just come back full circle again
you a fad that means you something that we already had
but once youre gone you dont come back oh
too bad youre off the map now radar cant even find you
we stay on the grind you slip we outgrind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin whining and bitchin
sit and observe listen youll learn if you pay attention
why ten multiplatinum albums later three diamond
worldwide were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

verse 2 dr dre eminem  both
the buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
i dont gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we aint showin off we just going off popular consensus
but critics say that doc is soft doc is talk
doc is all washed up knock it off who the fuck is doc impressin
doc is this doc is that you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc cause doc left you all guessin
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record what
we gon have this motherfucker hoppin in a second bump bump
thats why we always save the best cut last
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
cause we done swam with the sharks wrestled with alligators
spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
whom if it wasnt for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
who may have never got to see our faces
graced the cover of rolling stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and dre to
pass the mic and we can play the
back and forth all day like the hot potato game
thats why we came to
chorus eminem  50 cent
cause we came here to set this party off right

well come through the side

and plenty honeys involved and sunny sundays and palm trees
cali everyday is just another party
from the valleys all the way to them 8 mile alleys
lets rally hands up for the grand finale

blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
