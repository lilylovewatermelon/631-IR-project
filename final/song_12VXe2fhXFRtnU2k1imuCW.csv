hold me amongst all your cards
oh we were sea bound and aimless at best
clutching to the wheel and those charts
but that sea was just a gambler at heart

oh there we were the sun hit the starboard
and we were as free as we could be
we waited for land oh we waited for thee
we aimed to stay calm and cool
but that sea was just a gambling fool
come to me mary come you know you once were queen
the ocean is holding all the kings
and tossed aside the weary

how id love to steer you straight into those waters
while those daunting clouds above began to pour
and when were found well kiss that ground
and roll around on that lovers floor

come to me mary come you know you once were queen
the ocean is holding all the kings
and tossed aside the weary

the ocean holding everything
and tossed aside the weary
