turning in the grain again
the bells begin to chime
time she says theres no turning back
keep your eyes on the tracks
through the fields somewhere theres blue
oh time will tell shell see us through

verse 2
howling out the windy hills
and all the time we took
you should know just how it steals
keep your hand on the wheel
and through it all somewhere we knew
where time will tell shell see us through

bridge
and all fire and flames took all we trust
were kicking up dust
stations fade just like they do
oh time will tell we always knew
