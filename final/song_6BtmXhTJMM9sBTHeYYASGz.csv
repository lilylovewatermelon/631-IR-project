so this is what you meant
when you said that you were spent
and now its time to build from the bottom of the pit
right to the top
dont hold back
packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

prechorus
i dont ever wanna let you down
i dont ever wanna leave this town
cause after all
this city never sleeps at night

chorus
its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am

verse 2
so this is where you fell
and i am left to sell
the path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
right to the top
dont look back
turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likeprechorus
i dont ever wanna let you down
i dont ever wanna leave this town
cause after all
this city never sleeps at night

chorus
its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am
its time to begin isnt it
i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am

this road never looked so lonely
this house doesnt burn down slowly
to ashes to ashes

chorus

i get a little bit bigger but then ill admit
im just the same as i was
now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am

now dont you understand
that im never changing who i am103embed"
