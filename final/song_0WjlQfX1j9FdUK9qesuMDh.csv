   combray at a distance from a twentymile radius as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in holy week was no more than a church epitomising the town representing it speaking of it and for it to the horizon and as one drew near gathering close about its long dark cloak sheltering from the wind on the open plain as a shepherd gathers his sheep the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed here and there in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting to live in combray was a trifle depressing like its streets whose houses built of the blackened stone of the country fronted with outside steps capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards were so dark that one had as soon as the sun began to go down to draw back the curtains in the sittingroom windows streets with the solemn names of saints not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of combray such as the rue sainthilaire the rue saintjacques in which my aunts house stood the rue saintehildegarde which ran past her railings and the rue du saintesprit on to which the little garden gate opened and these combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me today that in fact one and all of them and the church which towered above them in the square seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magiclantern while at times i feel that to be able to cross the rue sainthilaire again to engage a room in the rue de loiseau in the old hostelry of the oiseau flesché from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind now and then in the same warm gusts of comfort would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make golos acquaintance and to chat with geneviève de brabant

   my grandfathers cousin—by courtesy my greataunt—with whom we used to stay was the mother of that aunt léonie who since her husbands my uncle octaves death had gradually declined to leave first combray then her house in combray then her bedroom and finally her bed and who now never came down but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief physical exhaustion illness obsessions and religious observances her own room looked out over the rue saintjacques which ran a long way further to end in the grandpré as distinct from the petitpré a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met and which monotonous and grey with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a calvary or a crib my aunts life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they aired the other they were rooms of that country order which just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues wisdom habits a whole secret system of life invisible superabundant and profoundly moral which their atmosphere holds in solution smells natural enough indeed and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside but already humanised domesticated confined an exquisite skilful limpid jelly blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the storeroom smells changing with the year but plenishing domestic smells which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread smells lazy and punctual as a village clock roving smells pious smells rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them the air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing so succulent that i could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment particularly on those first mornings chilly still of the easter holidays when i could taste it more fully because i had just arrived then at combray before i went in to wish my aunt good day i would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room where the sun a wintry sun still had crept in to warm itself before the fire lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat i would turn to and fro between the prayerdesk and the stamped velvet armchairs each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar while the fire baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room was thickly clotted which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already raised and started to set puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake an immense puffpastry in which barely waiting to savour the crustier more delicate more respectable but also drier smells of the cupboard the chestofdrawers and the patterned wallpaper i always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript resinous dull indigestible and fruity smell of the flowered quilt

   in the next room i could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself she never spoke save in low tones because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there which she might displace by talking too loud but she never remained for long even when alone without saying something because she believed that it was good for her throat and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable besides in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance endowed them with a protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret and failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity unfortunately having formed the habit of thinking aloud she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room and i would often hear her saying to herself i must not forget that i never slept a wink—for never sleeping a wink was her great claim to distinction and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary in the morning françoise would not call her but would simply come to her during the day when my aunt wished to take a nap we used to say just that she wished to be quiet or to rest and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say what made me wake up or i dreamed that she would flush and at once correct herself

   after waiting a minute i would go in and kiss her françoise would be making her tea or if my aunt were feeling upset she would ask instead for her tisane and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemists little package on to a plate the amount of limeblossom required for infusion in boiling water the drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis in whose intervals the pale flowers opened as though a painter had arranged them there grouping them in the most decorative poses the leaves which had lost or altered their own appearance assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests a thousand trifling little details—the charming prodigality of the chemist—details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation gave me like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real limeblossoms like those i had seen when coming from the train in the avenue de la gare altered but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms which had grown old and as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older in these little grey balls i recognised green buds plucked before their time but beyond all else the rosy moony tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses—marking as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been in bloom—shewed me that these were petals which before their floweringtime the chemists package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring that rosy candlelight was still their colour but halfextinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs and which may be called the twilight of a flower presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom a little madeleine of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft

   at one side of her bed stood a big yellow chestofdrawers of lemonwood and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar on which beneath a statue of our lady and a bottle of vichycélestins might be found her servicebooks and her medical prescriptions everything that she needed for the performance in bed of her duties to soul and body to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers on the other side her bed was bounded by the window she had the street beneath her eyes and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life like a persian prince the daily but immemorial chronicles of combray which she would discuss in detail afterwards with françoise

   i would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case i made her tired she would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow pale and lifeless on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns—or the beads of a rosary and she would say to me now my poor child you must go away go and get ready for mass and if you see françoise downstairs tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you she must come up soon to see if i want anything

   françoise who had been for many years in my aunts service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house there had been in my infancy before we first went to combray and when my aunt léonie used still to spend the winter in paris with her mother a time when i knew françoise so little that on new years day before going into my greataunts house my mother put a fivefranc piece in my hand and said now be careful dont make any mistake wait until you hear me say good morning françoise and i touch your arm before you give it to her no sooner had we arrived in my aunts dark hall than we saw in the gloom beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude it was françoise motionless and erect framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche when we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity blended with a tender respect for the upper classes which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice good morning françoise at this signal my fingers parted and i let fall the coin which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand but since we had begun to go to combray there was no one i knew better than françoise we were her favourites and in the first years at least while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt she enjoyed us with a keener relish because we had in addition to our dignity as part of the family for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any greek tragedian the fresh charm of not being her customary employers and so with what joy would she welcome us with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us on the day of our arrival just before easter when there was often an icy wind while mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews and if her grandson was goodlooking and what they were going to make of him and whether he took after his granny

   later when no one else was in the room mamma who knew that françoise was still mourning for her parents who had been dead for years would speak of them kindly asking her endless little questions about them and their lives

   she had guessed that françoise was not overfond of her soninlaw and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter as the two could not talk so freely when he was there and so one day when françoise was going to their house some miles from combray mamma said to her with a smile tell me françoise if julien has had to go away and you have marguerite to yourself all day you will be very sorry but will make the best of it wont you

   and françoise answered laughing madame knows everything madame is worse than the xrays she pronounced x with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her an unlettered womans daring to employ a scientific term they brought here for mme octave which see what is in your heart—and she went off disturbed that anyone should be caring about her perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence with its simple joys and sorrows might offer some interest might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself

   my aunt resigned herself to doing without françoise to some extent during our visits knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid one who looked as smart at five oclock in the morning in her kitchen under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain as when dressed for churchgoing who did everything in the right way who toiled like a horse whether she was well or ill but without noise without the appearance of doing anything the only one of my aunts maids who when mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory at first to a stranger doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention knowing very well that they have no real need of him that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it who on the other hand cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity and do not look for that superficial responsiveness that slavish affability which may impress a stranger favourably but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality

   when françoise having seen that my parents had everything they required first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion or to furnish an explanation in regard to some important event
   just fancy françoise mme goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister if she loses any more time on the way i should not be at all surprised if she got in after the elevation

   well thered be nothing wonderful in that would be the answer or

   françoise if you had come in five minutes ago you would have seen mme imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother callot has do try to find out from her cook where she got them you know youve been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring you might be able to get some like these for our visitors

   i shouldnt be surprised if they came from the curés françoise would say and

   im sure you wouldnt my poor françoise my aunt would reply raising her shoulders from the curés indeed you know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus not asparagus at all i tell you these ones were as thick as my arm not your arm of course but mypoor arm which has grown so much thinner again this year or


   françoise didnt you hear that bell just now it split my head

   no mme octave

   ah poor girl your skull must be very thick you may thank god for that it was maguelone come to fetch dr piperaud he came out with her at once and they went off along the rue de loiseau there must be some child ill

   oh dear dear the poor little creature would come with a sigh from françoise who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her even in some distant part of the world without beginning to lament or

   françoise for whom did they toll the passingbell just now oh dear of course it would be for mme rousseau and to think that i had forgotten that she passed away the other night indeed it is time the lord called me home too i dont know what has become of my head since i lost my poor octave but i am wasting your time my good girl

   indeed no mme octave my time is not so precious whoever made our time didnt sell it to us i am just going to see that my fire hasnt gone out

   in this way françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them in the course of these morning sessions of the earliest happenings of the day but sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for françoise to come upstairs and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house

   but mme octave it is not time for your pepsin françoise would begin are you feeling faint
   no thank you françoise my aunt would reply that is to say yes for you know well that there is very seldom a time when i dont feel faint one day i shall pass away like mme rousseau before i know where i am but that is not why i rang would you believe that i have just seen as plainly as i see you mme goupil with a little girl i didnt know at all run and get a pennyworth of salt from camus its not often that théodore cant tell you who a person is

   but that must be m pupins daughter françoise would say preferring to stick to an immediate explanation since she had been perhaps twice already into camuss shop that morning

   m pupins daughter oh thats a likely story my poor françoise do you think i should not have recognised m pupins daughter

   but i dont mean the big one mme octave i mean the little girl he one who goes to school at jouy i seem to have seen her once already his morning

   oh if thats what it is my aunt would say she must have come over for the holidays yes that is it no need to ask she will have come over for the holidays but then we shall soon see mme sazerat come along and ring her sisters doorbell for her luncheon that will be it i saw the boy from galopins go by with a tart you will see that the tart was for mme goupil

   once mme goupil has anyone in the house mme octave you wont be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there for its not so early as it was would be the answer for françoise who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction

   oh not before midday my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation darting an uneasy glance at the clock but stealthily so as not to let it be seen that she who had renounced all earthly joys yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that mme goupil was expecting company to luncheon though alas she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle and it will come in the middle of my luncheon she would murmur to herself her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time at least you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates these were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her she would put on her spectacles and spell out ali baba and the forty thieves aladdin or the wonderful lamp and smile and say very good indeed

   i may as well go across to camus françoise would hazard seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there

   no no its not worth while now its certain to be the pupin girl my poor françoise i am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing

   but it was not for nothing as my aunt well knew that she had rung for françoise since at combray a person whom one didnt know at all was as incredible a being as any mythological deity and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the rue du saintesprit or in the square one of these bewildering phenomena careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one did know either personally or in the abstract in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in combray it would turn out to be mme sautons son discharged from the army or the abbé perdreaus niece come home from her convent or the curés brother a taxcollector at châteaudun who had just retired on a pension or had come over to combray for the holidays on first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in combray people whom you didnt know at all simply because you had failed to recognise or identify them at once and yet long beforehand mme sauton and the curé had given warning that they expected their strangers in the evening when i came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk if i was rash enough to say to her that we had passed near the pontvieux a man whom my grandfather didnt know

   a man grandfather didnt know at all she would exclaim thats a likely story none the less she would be a little disturbed by the news she would wish to have the details correctly and so my grandfather would be summoned who can it have been that you passed near the pontvieux uncle a man you didnt know at all

   why of course i did my grandfather would answer it was prosper mme bouilleboeufs gardeners brother

   ah well my aunt would say calm again but slightly flushed still and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didnt know at all after which i would be warned to be more careful of what i said and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks everyone was so well known in combray animals as well as people that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she didnt know at all she would think about it incessantly devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours
   that will be mme sazerats dog françoise would suggest without any real conviction but in the hope of peace and so that my aunt should not split her head

   as if i didnt know mme sazerats dog—for my aunts critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact

   ah but that will be the new dog m galopin has brought her from lisieux

   oh if thats what it is

   it seems its a most engaging animal françoise would go on having got the story from théodore as clever as a christian always in a good temper always friendly always everything thats nice its not often you see an animal so wellbehaved at that age mme octave its high time i left you i cant afford to stay here amusing myself look its nearly ten oclock and my fire not lighted yet and ive still to dress the asparagus

   what françoise more asparagus its a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year you will make our parisians sick of it

   no no madame octave they like it well enough theyll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters and they wont eat it out of the back of their spoons youll see

   church why they must be there now youd better not lose any time go and look after your luncheon

   while my aunt gossiped on in this way with françoise i would have accompanied my parents to mass how i loved it how clearly i can see it still our church at combray the old porch by which we went in black and full of holes as a cullender was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasantwomen going into the church and of their fingers dipping into the water had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force to impress itself on the stone to carve ruts in it like those made by cartwheels upon stone gateposts against which they are driven every day its memorial stones beneath which the noble dust of the abbots of combray who were buried there furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter for time had softened and sweetened them and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins either surging out in a milky frothing wave washing from its place a florid gothic capital drowning the white violets of the marble floor or else reabsorbed into their limits contracting still further a crabbed latin inscription bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church one of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure like the king on a playingcard who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone between earth and heaven and in the blue light of its slanting shadow on weekdays sometimes at noon when there was no service at one of those rare moments when the airy empty church more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings seemed to have almost a habitable air like the hall—all sculptured stone and painted glass—of some mediaeval mansion you might see mme sazerat kneel for an instant laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the bakers and was taking home for her luncheon in another a mountain of rosy snow at whose foot a battle was being fought seemed to have frozen the window also which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung but flakes illumined by a sunrise—the same doubtless which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone and all of them were so old that you could see here and there their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass there was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows of blue principally like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile king charles vi but either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns a rare and transient fire—the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacocks tail then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that i was following my parents who marched before me their prayerbooks clasped in their hands a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate but beyond which could be distinguished dearer than all such treasures a fleeting smile from the sun which could be seen and felt as well here in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry as on the pavement of the square or the straw of the marketplace and even on our first sundays when we came down before easter it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of saint louis this dazzling and gilded carpet of forgetmenots in glass

   two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of esther in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of france and to esther those of a lady of guermantes whose lover he had been their colours had melted into one another so as to add expression relief light to the pictures a touch of red over the lips of esther had strayed beyond their outline the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere while the green of the trees which was still bright in silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel but had quite gone at the top separated in a paler scheme above the dark trunks the yellowing upper branches tanned and halfobliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun all these things and still more than these the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures such as the golden cross wrought it was said by saint eloi and presented by dagobert and the tomb of the sons of louis the germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper because of which i used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairyhaunted valley where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock a tree a marsh the tangible proofs of the little peoples supernatural passage—all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town a building which occupied so to speak four dimensions of space—the name of the fourth being time—which had sailed the centuries with that old nave where bay after bay chapel after chapel seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar except where near the porch a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the towerstair and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it like a row of grownup sisters who to hide him from the eyes of strangers arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified unmannerly and illdressed younger brother rearing into the sky above the square a tower which had looked down upon saint louis and seemed to behold him still and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a merovingian night through which guiding us with groping fingertips beneath the shadowy vault ribbed strongly as an immense bats wing of stone théodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of sigeberts little daughter in which a deep hole like the bed of a fossil had been bored or so it was said by a crystal lamp which on the night when the frankish princess was murdered had left of its own accord the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is today and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone through which it had gently forced its way

   and then the apse of combray what am i to say of that it was so coarse so devoid of artistic beauty even of the religious spirit from outside since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar jagged with flints in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church and certainly in later years were i to recall all the glorious apses that i had seen it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of combray only one day turning out of a little street in some country town i came upon three alleyways that converged and facing them an old wall rubbed worn crumbling and unusually high with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of combray and at that moment i did not say to myself as at chartres i might have done or at rheims with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction but instinctively i exclaimed the church

   the church a dear familiar friend close pressed in the rue sainthilaire upon which its north door opened by its two neighbours mme loiseaus house and the pharmacy of m rapin against which its walls rested without interspace a simple citizen of combray who might have had her number in the street had the streets of combray borne numbers and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds before going into mme loiseaus and after leaving m rapins there existed for all that between the church and everything in combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which i have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind in vain might mme loiseau deck her windowsills with fuchsias which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions head downwards and whose flowers had no more important business when they were big enough to taste the joys of life than to go and cool their purple congested cheeks against the dark front of the church to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned if my eyes could discern no interval my mind preserved the impression of an abyss

   from a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of sainthilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which combray had not yet appeared when from the train which brought us down from paris at eastertime my father caught sight of it as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn its little iron cock veering continually in all directions he would say come get your wraps together we are there and on one of the longest walks we ever took from combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of sainthilaires steeple but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the fingernail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape to so pure a piece of nature this little sign of art this single indication of human existence as one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower half in ruins which still stood by its side though without rivalling it in height one was struck first of all by the tone reddish and sombre of its stones and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it to see it rising above the violet thundercloud of the vineyards a ruin of purple almost the colour of the wild vine

   often in the square as we came home my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it from the tower windows placed two and two one pair above another with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity it released it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element had struck them and driven them forth then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air abruptly soothed they would return and be absorbed in the tower deadly no longer but benignant some perching here and there not seeming to move but snapping perhaps and swallowing some passing insect on the points of turrets as a seagull perches with an anglers immobility on the crest of a wave without quite knowing why my grandmother found in the steeple of sainthilaire that absence of vulgarity pretension and meanness which made her love—and deem rich in beneficent influences—nature itself when the hand of man had not as did my greataunts gardener trimmed it and the works of genius and certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself to affirm its individual and responsible existence it was the steeple which spoke for the church i think too that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of combray what she prized above anything else in the world namely a natural air and an air of distinction ignorant of architecture she would say

   my dears laugh at me if you like it is not conventionally beautiful but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me if it could play the piano i am sure it would really play and when she gazed on it when her eyes followed the gentle tension the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose like hands joined in prayer she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles which at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher to have become truly remote like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto an octave above the accompanying air

   it was the steeple of sainthilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation every hour of the day every point of view in the town from my bedroom window i could discern no more than its base which had been freshly covered with slates but when on sundays i saw these in the hot light of a summer morning blaze like a black sun i would say to myself good heavens nine oclock i must get ready for mass at once if i am to have time to go in and kiss aunt léonie first and i would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the square i could feel the heat and dust of the market the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass penetrating its odour of unbleached calico to purchase a handkerchief or something of which the draper himself would let her see what he had bowing from the waist who having made everything ready for shutting up had just gone into the back shop to put on his sunday coat and to wash his hands which it was his habit every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise cunning and success

   and again after mass when we looked in to tell théodore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from thiberzy for luncheon we had in front of us the steeple which baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of holy bread with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight pricked its sharp point into the blue sky and in the evening as i came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when i must say good night to my mother and see her no more the steeple was by contrast so kindly there at the close of day that i would imagine it as being laid like a brown velvet cushion against—as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure had sunk slightly so as to make room for it and had correspondingly risen on either side while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence to elongate its spire still further and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words

   even when our errands lay in places behind the church from which it could not be seen the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple which would stand up now here now there among the houses and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church and indeed there are many others which look best when seen in this way and i can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of combray i shall never forget in a quaint norman town not far from balbec two charming eighteenthcentury houses dear to me and venerable for many reasons between which when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river the gothic spire of a church itself hidden by the houses soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts but in a material so different so precious so beringed so rosy so polished that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side between which it had been washed on the beach the purple crinkled spire of some seashell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour even in paris in one of the ugliest parts of the town i know a window from which one can see across a first a second and even a third layer of jumbled roofs street beyond street a violet bell sometimes ruddy sometimes too in the finest prints which the atmosphere makes of it of an ashy solution of black which is in fact nothing else than the dome of saintaugustin and which imparts to this view of paris the character of some of the piranesi views of rome but since into none of these little etchings whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution was it able to contribute an element i have long lost the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle but believe in it as in a creature without parallel so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of combray from the streets behind the church whether one saw it at five oclock when going to call for letters at the postoffice some doors away from one on the left raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops or again when one had to go in and ask for news of mme sazerat ones eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther descending slope and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple or yet again if pressing further afield one went to the station one saw it obliquely shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution or from the banks of the vivonne the apse drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spirepoint into the heart of heaven it was always to the steeple that one must return always it which dominated everything else summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle raised before me like the finger of god whose body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding it for that reason with them and so even today in any large provincial town or in a quarter of paris which i do not know well if a passerby who is putting me on the right road shews me from afar as a point to aim at some belfry of a hospital or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which i am to take my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline and the passerby should he turn round to make sure that i have not gone astray would see me to his astonishment oblivious of the walk that i had planned to take or the place where i was obliged to call standing still on the spot before that steeple for hours on end motionless trying to remember feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again and then no doubt and then more uneasily than when just now i asked him for a direction i will seek my way again i will turn a corner but the goal is in my heart

   on our way home from mass we would often meet m legrandin who detained in paris by his professional duties as an engineer could only except in the regular holiday seasons visit his home at combray between saturday evenings and monday mornings he was one of that class of men who apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful have acquired an entirely different kind of culture literary or artistic of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession but by which their conversation profits more literary than many men of letters we were not aware at this period that m legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer and so were greatly astonished to find that a wellknown composer had set some verses of his to music endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application scornful bitter and conscientious tall with a good figure a fine thoughtful face drooping fair moustaches a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy a talker such as we had never heard he was in the sight of my family who never ceased to quote him as an example the very pattern of a gentleman who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner my grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well a little too much like a book for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted lavallière neckties his short straight almost schoolboyish coat she was astonished too at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy at fashionable life and snobbishness—undoubtedly he would say the sin of which saint paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness

   worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling or indeed of understanding that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation besides she thought it in not very good taste that m legrandin whose sister was married to a country gentleman of lower normandy near balbec should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles going so far as to blame the revolution for not having guillotined them all

   well met my friends he would say as he came towards us you are lucky to spend so much time here tomorrow i have to go back to paris to squeeze back into my niche

   oh i admit he went on with his own peculiar smile gently ironical disillusioned and vague i have every useless thing in the world in my house there the only thing wanting is the necessary thing a great patch of open sky like this always try to keep a patch of sky above your life little boy he added turning to me you have a soul in you of rare quality an artists nature never let it starve for lack of what it needs

   when on our reaching the house my aunt would send to ask us whether mme goupil had indeed arrived late for mass not one of us could inform her instead we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of gilbert the bad françoise was at once dispatched to the grocers but returned emptyhanded owing to the absence of théodore whose dual profession of choirman with a part in the maintenance of the fabric and of grocers assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs

   ah my aunt would sigh i wish it were time for eulalie to come she is really the only person who will be able to tell me

   eulalie was a limping energetic deaf spinster who had retired after the death of mme de la bretonnerie with whom she had been in service from her childhood and had then taken a room beside the church from which she would incessantly emerge either to attend some service or when there was no service to say a prayer by herself or to give théodore a hand the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt léonie to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers she was not above adding occasional pocketmoney to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the curés linen or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of combray above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some order and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt léonie who now saw hardly anyone else except the reverend curé my aunt had by degrees erased every other visitors name from her list because they all committed the fatal error in her eyes of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested one group the worse of the two and the one of which she rid herself first consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself and preached even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good her who had had two dreadful sips of vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours than all her medicine bottles and her bed the other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said and so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room after considerable hesitation and at françoise urgent request and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid dont you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days or who on the other hand when she said to them i am very low very low nearing the end dear friends had replied ah yes when one has no strength left still you may last a while yet each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again and if françoise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunts face whenever she saw from her bed any of these people in the rue du saintesprit who looked as if they were coming to see her or heard her own doorbell ring she would laugh far more heartily as at a clever trick at my aunts devices which never failed for having them sent away and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress whom she felt to be superior to all these other people inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them in short my aunt stipulated at one and the same time that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life commiserate with her in her sufferings and assure her of an ultimate recovery

   in all this eulalie excelled my aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute the end is come at last my poor eulalie twenty times eulalie would retort with knowing your illness as you do mme octave you will live to be a hundred as mme sazerin said to me only yesterday for one of eulalies most rooted beliefs and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate was that mme sazerats name was really mme sazerin

   i do not ask to live to a hundred my aunt would say for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days

   and since besides this eulalie knew as no one else knew how to distract my aunt without tiring her her visits which took place regularly every sunday unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation appetising enough to begin with but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if eulalie were a minute late in coming for if unduly prolonged the rapture of waiting for eulalie became a torture and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time and yawning and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn eulalies ring if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day when she was no longer expecting it would almost make her ill for the fact was that on sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit and the moment that our luncheon was ended françoise would become impatient for us to leave the diningroom so that she might go upstairs to occupy my aunt but—and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at combray—the proud hour °f noon descending from the steeple of sainthilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown would long have echoed about our table beside the holy bread which too had come in after church in its familiar way and we would still be found seated in front of our arabian nights plates weighed down by the heat of the day and even more by our heavy meal for upon the permanent foundation of eggs cutlets potatoes preserves and biscuits whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us françoise would add—as the labour of fields and orchards the harvest of the tides the luck of the markets the kindness of neighbours and her own genius might provide and so effectively that our bill of fare like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life—a brill because the fishwoman had guaranteed its freshness a turkey because she had seen a beauty in the market at roussainvillelepin cardoons with marrow because she had never done them for us in that way before a roast leg of mutton because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to settle down in the seven hours before dinner spinach by way of a change apricots because they were still hard to get gooseberries because in another fortnight there would be none left raspberries which m swann had brought specially cherries the first to come from the cherrytree which had yielded none for the last two years a cream cheese of which in those days i was extremely fond an almond cake because she had ordered one the evening before a fancy loaf because it was our turn to offer the holy bread and when all these had been eaten a work composed expressly for ourselves but dedicated more particularly to my father who had a fondness for such things a cream of chocolate inspired in the mind created by the hand of françoise would be laid before us light and fleeting as an occasional piece of music into which she had poured the whole of her talent anyone who refused to partake of it saying no thank you i have finished i am not hungry would at once have been lowered to the level of the philistines who when an artist makes them a present of one of his works examine its weight and material whereas what is of value is the creators intention and his signature to have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the piece was still being played and under the composersvery eyes

   at length my mother would say to me now dont stay here all day you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside but get a little fresh air first dont start reading immediately after your food

   and i would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough ornamented here and there like a gothic font with a salamander which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender allegorical body on the bench without a back in the shade of a lilactree in that little corner of the garden which communicated by a service door with the rue du saintesprit and from whose neglected soil rose in two stages an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building my aunts backkitchen one could see its redtiled floor gleaming like porphyry it seemed not so much the cave of françoise as a little temple of venus it would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman the fruiterer the greengrocer come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the firstfruits of their fields and its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove

   in earlier days i would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple for before going upstairs to read i would steal into the little sittingroom which my uncle adolphe a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major used to occupy on the ground floor a room which even when its opened windows let in the heat if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour suggesting at once an openair and an oldfashioned kind of existence which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gunroom but for some years now i had not gone into my uncle adolphes room since he no longer came to combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family by my fault and in the following circumstances once or twice every month in paris i used to be sent to pay him a visit as he was finishing his luncheon wearing a plain alpaca coat and waited upon by his servant in a workingjacket of striped linen purple and white he would complain that i had not been to see him for a long time that he was being neglected he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat whose fire was never lighted whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky and its furniture upholstered in satin as at my grandparents only yellow then we would enter what he called his study a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed against a dark background a plump and rosy goddess driving a car or standing upon a globe or wearing a star on her brow pictures which were popular under the second empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested pompeii which were then generally despised and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason despite any others which they may advance namely that they suggest the second empire and there i would stay with my uncle until his man came with a message from the coachman to ask him at what time he would like the carriage my uncle would then be lost in meditation while his astonished servant stood there not daring to disturb him by the least movement wondering and waiting for his answer which never varied for in the end after a supreme crisis of hesitation my uncle would utter infallibly the words a quarter past two which the servant would echo with amazement but without disputing them a quarter past two very good sir i will go and tell him

   at this date i was a lover of the theatre a platonic lover of necessity since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one and so incorrect was the picture i drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that i almost believed that each of the spectators looked as into a stereoscope upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually

   every morning i would hasten to the moriss column to see what new plays it announced nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play and also from the colour of the bills still damp and wrinkled with paste on which those words stood out nothing unless it were such strange titles as the testament de césar girodot or oediperoi inscribed not on the green bills of the opéracomique but on the winecoloured bills of the comédiefrançaise nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the diamants de la couronne than the sleek mysterious satin of the domino noir and since my parents had told me that for my first visit to the theatre i should have to choose between these two pieces i would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other for those were all that i knew of either attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title until in the end i had shewn myself such vivid such compelling pictures of on the one hand a play of dazzling arrogance and on the other a gentle velvety play that i was as little capable of deciding which play i should prefer to see as if at the dinnertable they had obliged me to choose between rice à limpératrice and the famous cream of chocolate

   all my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors whose art although as yet i had no experience of it was the first of all its numberless forms in which art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment between one actors tricks of intonation and inflection and anothers the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance and from what i had been told of them i would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which i used to murmur to myself all day long lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it being irremovable

   and later in my schooldays whenever i ventured in class when the masters head was turned to communicate with some new friend i would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly got our second delaunay and so on and if in his judgment febvre came below thiron or delaunay below coquelin the sudden volatility which the name of coquelin forsaking its stony rigidity would engender in my mind in which it moved upwards to the second place the rich vitality with which the name of delaunay would suddenly be furnished to enable it to slip down to fourth would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life

   but if the thought of actors weighed so upon me if the sight of maubant coming out one afternoon from the théâtrefrançais had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love how much more did the name of a star blazing outside the doors of a theatre how much more seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street the hair over her forehead abloom with roses did the face of a woman who i would think was perhaps an actress leave with me a lasting disturbance a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life

   i classified in order of talent the most distinguished sarah bernhardt berma bartet madeleine brohan jeanne samary but i was interested in them all now my uncle knew many of them personally and also ladies of another class not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind he used to entertain them at his house and if we went to see him on certain days only that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met so we at least thought as for my uncle his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows who had perhaps never been married and countesses whose highsounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather often if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation i would hear my father say with a smile to my mother one of your uncles friends and i would think of the weary novitiate through which perhaps for years on end a grown man even a man of real importance might have to pass waiting on the doorstep of some such lady while she refused to answer his letters and made her hallporter drive him away and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress unapproachable by all the world but for him an intimate friend

   and so—on the pretext that some lesson the hour of which had been altered now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me and would continue to prevent me from seeing my uncle—one day not one of the days which he set apart for our visits i took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual i slipped out and instead of going to read the playbills on their column for which purpose i was allowed to go out unaccompanied i ran all the way to his house i noticed before his door a carriage and pair with red carnations on the horses blinkers and in the coachmans buttonhole as i climbed the staircase i could hear laughter and a womans voice and as soon as i had rung silence and the sound of shutting doors the manservant who let me in appeared embarrassed and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me he went in however to announce my arrival and the same voice i had heard before said oh yes do let him come in just for a moment it will be so amusing is that his photograph there on your desk and his mother your niece isnt she beside it the image of her isnt he i should so like to see the little chap just for a second

   i could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry finally the manservant told me to come in

   on the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days but opposite to him in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine my uncertainty whether i ought to address her as madame or mademoiselle made me blush and not daring to look too much in her direction in case i should be obliged to speak to her i hurried across to kiss my uncle she looked at me and smiled my uncle said my nephew without telling her my name or telling me hers doubtless because since his difficulties with my grandfather he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance

   how like his mother he is said the lady

   but you have never seen my niece except in photographs my uncle broke in quickly with a note of anger

   i beg your pardon dear friend i passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill it is true i only saw her for a moment and your staircase is rather dark but i saw well enough to see how lovely she was this young gentleman has her beautiful eyes and also this she went on tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead tell me she asked my uncle is your niece mme—— is her name the same as yours

   he takes most after his father muttered my uncle who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy in repeating mammas name aloud than to bring the two together in the flesh hes his father all over and also like my poor mother

   i have not met his father dear said the lady in pink bowing her head slightly and i never saw your poor mother you will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another

   i felt somewhat disillusioned for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom i had seen from time to time at home especially the daughter of one of our cousins to whose house i went every new years day only better dressed otherwise my uncles friend had the same quick and kindly glance the same frank and friendly manner i could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which i admired in photographs of actresses nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead i had difficulty in believing that this was one of those women and certainly i should never have believed her one of the smart ones had i not seen the carriage and pair the pink dress the pearly necklace had i not been aware too that my uncle knew only the very best of them but i asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance and yet when i thought of what her life must be like its immorality disturbed me more perhaps than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form by its secrecy and invisibility like the plot of a novel the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middleclass parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the floweringpoint of her beauty had raised to fame or notoriety this woman the play of whose features the intonations of whose voice like so many others i already knew made me regard her in spite of myself as a young lady of good family her who was no longer of a family at all

   we had gone by this time into the study and my uncle who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence offered her a cigarette

   no thank you dear friend she said you know i only smoke the ones the grand duke sends me i tell him that they make you jealous and she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold in a foreign language why yes she began again suddenly of course i have met this young mans father with you isnt he your nephew how on earth could i have forgotten he was so nice so charming to me she went on modestly and with feeling but when i thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting which she made out had been so charming i who knew my fathers coldness and reserve was shocked as though at some indelicacy on his part at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality it has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle painstaking women that they devote all their generosity all their talent their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty for like all artists they never seek to realise the value of those dreams or to enclose them in the foursquare frame of everyday life and their gold which counts for little to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and illpolished lives of men and just as this one filled the smokingroom where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat with her charming person her dress of pink silk her pearls and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a grand duke so in the same way she had taken some casual remark by my father had worked it up delicately given it a turn a precious title set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes a gem of the first water blended of humility and gratitude and so had given it back transformed into a jewel a work of art into something altogether charming

   look here my boy it is time you went away said my uncle

   i rose i could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink but i felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her my heart beat loud while i counted out to myself shall i do it shall i not and then i ceased to ask myself what i ought to do so as at least to do something blindly hotly madly flinging aside all the reasons i had just found to support such action i seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me

   isnt he delicious quite a ladies man already he takes after his uncle hell be a perfect gentleman she went on setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of english accentuation couldnt he come to me some day for a cup of tea as our friends across the channel say he need only send me a blue in the morning

   i had not the least idea of what a blue might be i did not understand half the words which the lady used but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them and i was beginning to feel extremely tired

   no no it is impossible said my uncle shrugging his shoulders he is kept busy at home all day he has plenty of work to do he brings back all the prizes from his school he added in a lower tone so that i should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction you cant tell he may turn out a little victor hugo a kind of vaulabelle dont you know

   oh i love artistic people replied the lady in pink there is no one like them for understanding women them and really nice men like yourself but please forgive my ignorance who what is vaulabelle is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawingroom you know you promised to lend them to me i will take great care of them

   my uncle who hated lending people books said nothing and ushered me out into the hall madly in love with the lady in pink i covered my old uncles tobaccostained cheeks with passionate kisses and while he awkwardly enough gave me to understand without actually saying that he would rather i did not tell my parents about this visit i assured him with tears in my eyes that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day i would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude so strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which i had been invested i found it simpler to let them have a full account omitting no detail of the visit i had paid that afternoon in doing this i had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness how could i have thought such a thing since i did not wish it and i could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which i myself saw none every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies without fail to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing and do not we forget to do so feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves i imagined like everyone else that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them and i had not the least doubt that when i deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance i had made at my uncles i should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment i myself had based on the introduction unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which i suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncles conduct my father and grandfather had words with him of a violent order as i learned indirectly a few days later passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage î felt at once all the grief the gratitude the remorse which i should have liked to convey to him beside the immensity of these emotions i considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty and might make him think that i regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy i decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture and turned my head away my uncle thought that in doing so i was obeying my parents orders he never forgave them and though he did not die until many years later not one of us ever set eyes on him again

   and so i no longer used to go into the little sittingroom now kept shut of my uncle adolphe instead after hanging about on the outskirts of the backkitchen until françoise appeared on its threshold and announced i am going to let the kitchenmaid serve the coffee and take up the hot water it is time i went off to mme octave i would then decide to go indoors and would go straight upstairs to my room to read the kitchenmaid was an abstract personality a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate for we never found the same girl there two years running in the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus the kitchenmaid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature some way gone in pregnancy when we arrived at combray for easter and it was indeed surprising that françoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket fuller and larger every day whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks these last recalled the cloaks in which giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings of which m swann had given me photographs he it was who pointed out the resemblance and when he inquired after the kitchenmaid he would say well how goes it with giottos charity and indeed the poor girl whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her even to her face and the vertical squared outlines of her cheeks did distinctly suggest those virgins so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather in whom the virtues are personified in the arena chapel and i can see now that those virtues and vices of padua resembled her in another respect as well for just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body without appearing to understand what it meant without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the arena beneath the label caritas and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at combray incarnates that virtue for it seems impossible that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face by a fine stroke of the painters invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a winepress to extract their juice or still more as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher and she is holding out her flaming heart to god or shall we say handing it to him exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the groundlevel above the invidia again should have had some look on her face of envy but in this fresco too the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism the serpent hissing between the lips of envy is so huge and so completely fills her wideopened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted like a childs who is filling a balloon with his breath and that envy and we ourselves for that matter when we look at her since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips have no time almost to spare for envious thoughts

   despite all the admiration that m swann might profess for these figures of giotto it was a long time before i could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom where the copies he had brought me were hung that charity devoid of charity that envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue or by the introduction of the operators instrument a justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of combray whom i used to see at mass many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of injustice but in later years i understood that the arresting strangeness the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols while the fact that these were depicted not as symbols for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed but as real things actually felt or materially handled added something more precise and more literal to their meaning something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted and even in the case of the poor kitchenmaid was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it and in the same way again are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical painful obscure internal intestinal aspect towards that seamy side of death which is as it happens the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden a difficulty in breathing a destroying thirst than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of death

   there must have been a strong element of reality in those virtues and vices of padua since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servantgirl while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they and quite possibly this lack or seeming lack of participation by a persons soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has apart from its aesthetic meaning a reality which if not strictly psychological may at least be called physiognomical later on when in the course of my life i have had occasion to meet with in convents for instance literally saintly examples of practical charity they have generally had the brisk decided undisturbed and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon the face in which one can discern no commiseration no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity and no fear of hurting it the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy the sublime face of true goodness

   then while the kitchenmaid—who all unawares made the superior qualities of françoise shine with added lustre just as error by force of contrast enhances the triumph of truth—took in coffee which according to mamma was nothing more than hot water and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid i would be lying stretched out on my bed a book in my hand in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail transparent coolness against the afternoon sun behind its almost closed shutters through which however a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings remaining motionless between glass and woodwork in a corner like a butterfly poised upon a flower it was hardly light enough for me to read and my feeling of the days brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below in the rue de la curé by camus whom françoise had assured that my aunt was not resting and that he might therefore make a noise upon some old packingcases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust though the din of them in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of bloodred stars and from the flies who performed for my benefit in their small concert as it might be the chamber music of summer evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer will always bring that summer back to your mind the flies music is bound to the season by a closer a more vital tie—born of sunny days and not to be reborn but with them containing something of their essential nature it not merely calls up their image in our memory but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist that they are close around us immediately accessible

   this dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam that is to say equally luminous and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer which my senses if i had been out walking could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose which thanks to the adventures related in my books which had just excited it bore like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life

   but my grandmother even if the weather after growing too hot had broken and a storm or just a shower had burst over us would come up and beg me to go outside and as i did not wish to leave off my book i would go on with it in the garden under the chestnuttree in a little sentrybox of canvas and matting in the farthest recesses of which i used to sit and feel that i was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family

   and then my thoughts did not they form a similar sort of hidinghole in the depths of which i felt that i could bury myself and remain invisible even when i was looking at what went on outside when i saw any external object my consciousness that i was seeing it would remain between me and it enclosing it in a slender incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form for it would volatilise itself in some way before i could touch it just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture since it is always preceded itself by a zone of evaporation upon the sort of screen patterned with different states and impressions which my consciousness would quietly unfold while i was reading and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book i was reading and my desire to appropriate these to myself whatever the book might be for even if i had purchased it at combray having seen it outside boranges whose grocery lay too far from our house for françoise to be able to deal there as she did with camus but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller even if i had seen it tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway a doorway more mysterious more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral i should have noticed and bought it there simply because i had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of in my hearing by the schoolmaster or the schoolfriend who at that particular time seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of truth and beauty things halffelt by me halfincomprehensible the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts

   next to this central belief which while i was reading would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world towards the discovery of truth came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which i would be taking part for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur often in a whole lifetime these were the events which took place in the book i was reading it is true that the people concerned in them were not what françoise would have called real people but none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a real person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression pure and simple of real people would be a decided improvement a real person profoundly as we may sympathise with him is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses that is to say he remains opaque offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift if some misfortune comes to him it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either the novelists happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections impenetrable by the human spirit their equivalent in immaterial sections things that is which the spirit can assimilate to itself after which it matters not that the actions the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth since we have made them our own since it is in ourselves that they are happening that they are holding in thrall while we turn over feverishly the pages of the book our quickened breath and staring eyes and once the novelist has brought us to that state in which as in all purely mental states every emotion is multiplied tenfold into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream but a dream more lucid and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep why then for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world a few of which only we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know and the keenest the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them it is the same in life the heart changes and that is our worst misfortune but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination for in reality its alteration like that of certain natural phenomena is so gradual that even if we are able to distinguish successively each of its different states we are still spared the actual sensation of change

   next to but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element would come the view more or less projected before my eyes of the country in which the action of the story was taking place which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when i raised them from my book in this way for two consecutive summers i used to sit in the heat of our combray garden sick with a longing inspired by the book i was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers where i could see an endless vista of sawmills where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress and nearby rambling and clustering along low walls purple flowers and red and since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water and whoever she might be the woman whose image i called to mind purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours

   this was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture for the scenes in the books i read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind because of the selection that the author had made of them because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word as it might be interpreting a revelation these scenes used to give me the impression—one which i hardly ever derived from any place in which i might happen to be and never from our garden that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised—of their being actually part of nature herself and worthy to be studied and explored

   had my parents allowed me when i read a book to pay a visit to the country it described i should have felt that i was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth for even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in surrounded by our own soul still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison rather do we seem to be borne away with it and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it to break out into the world with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly all around us that unvarying sound which is no echo from without but the resonance of a vibration from within we try to discover in things endeared to us on that account the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them we are disillusioned and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed in our minds to the association of certain ideas sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who as we very well know are situated outside ourselves where we can never reach them and so if i always imagined the woman i loved as in a setting of whatever places i most longed at the time to visit if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them who opened to me the gate of an unknown world that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts no it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments—which i isolate artificially today as though i were cutting sections at different heights in a jet of water rainbowflashing but seemingly without flow or motion—were only drops in a single undeviating irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life

   and then as i continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their closepacked intimate source in my consciousness and before i come to the horizon of reality which envelops them i discover pleasures of another kind those of being comfortably seated of tasting the good scent on the air of not being disturbed by any visitor and when an hour chimed from the steeple of sainthilaire of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until i heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning in the blue sky above me of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading until the good dinner which françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book and as each hour struck it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before the latest would inscribe itself close to its predecessor on the skys surface and i would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last there must then have been an hour which i had not heard strike something which had taken place had not taken place for me the fascination of my book a magic as potent as the deepest slumber had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence sweet sunday afternoons beneath the chestnuttree in our combray garden from which i was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when i think of you and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them while i went on with my book and the heat of the day declined in the gradual crystallisation slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnutleaves of your silent sonorous fragrant limpid hours

   sometimes i would be torn from my book in the middle of the afternoon by the gardeners daughter who came running like a mad thing overturning an orangetree in its tub cutting a finger breaking a tooth and screaming out theyre coming theyre coming so that françoise and i should run too and not miss anything of the show that was on days when the cavalry stationed in combray went out for some military exercise going as a rule by the rue saintehildegarde while our servants sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings stared at the people of combray taking their sunday walks and were stared at in return the gardeners daughter through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the avenue de la gare would have spied the glitter of helmets the servants then hurried in with their chairs for when the troopers filed through the rue saintehildegarde they filled it from side to side and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood

   poor children françoise would exclaim in tears almost before she had reached the railings poor boys to be mown down like grass in a meadow its just shocking to think of she would go on laying a hand over her heart where presumably she had felt the shock

   a fine sight isnt it mme françoise all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives the gardener would ask just to draw her and he would not have spoken in vain

   not caring for their lives is it why what in the world is there that we should care for if its not our lives the only gift the lord never offers us a second time oh dear oh dear youre right all the same its quite true they dont care i can remember them in 70 in those wretched wars theyve no fear of death left in them theyre nothing more nor less than madmen and then they arent worth the price of a rope to hang them with theyre not men any more theyre lions for by her way of thinking to compare a man with a lion which she used to pronounce lieon was not at all complimentary to the man

   the rue saintehildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the avenue de la gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us and flashing in the sunlight the gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come and he was thirsty besides with the sun beating down upon his head so then suddenly his daughter would leap out as though from a beleaguered city would make a sortie turn the street corner and having risked her life a hundred times over reappear and bring us with a jug of liquoricewater the news that there were still at least a thousand of them pouring along without a break from the direction of thiberzy and méséglise françoise and the gardener having made up their difference would discuss the line to be followed in case of war

   dont you see françoise he would say revolution would be better because then no one would need to join in unless he liked

   oh yes i can see that certainly its more straightforward

   the gardener believed that as soon as war was declared they would stop all the railways

   yes to be sure so that we shant get away said françoise

   and the gardener would assent with ay theyre the cunning ones for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so

   but françoise would hasten back to my aunt and i would return to my book and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside long after order had been restored an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of cornbray and in front of every house even of those where it was not as a rule done the servants and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare festooning their doorsteps with a dark irregular fringe like the border of shells and seaweed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach as though trimming it with embroidered crape when the sea itself has retreated

   except on such days as these however i would as a rule be left to read in peace but the interruption which a visit from swann once made and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me called bergotte had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom but on a wholly different background the porch of a gothic cathedral that i would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom i dreamed

   i had heard bergotte spoken of for the first time by a friend older than myself for whom i had a strong admiration a precious youth of the name of bloch hearing me confess my love of the nuit doctobre he had burst out in a bray of laughter like a buglecall and told me by way of warning you must conquer your vile taste for a de musset esquire he is a bad egg one of the very worst a pretty detestable specimen i am bound to admit natheless he added graciously that he and even the man racine did each of them once in his life compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing one is

                  la blanche oloossone et la blanche camire

   and the other

                  la fille de minos et de pasiphaë

   they were submitted to my judgment as evidence for the defence of the two runagates in an article by my very dear master father lecomte who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods by which token here is a book which i have not the time just now to read a book recommended it would seem by that colossal fellow he regards or so they tell me its author one bergotte esquire as a subtle scribe more subtle indeed than any beast of the field and albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism a tenderness in suffering fools for which it is impossible to account and hard to make allowance still his word has weight with me as it were the delphic oracle read you then this lyrical prose and if the titanic masterbuilder of rhythm who composed bhagavat and the lévrier de magnus speaks not falsely then by apollo you may taste even you my master the ambrosial joys of olympus it was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him and that he himself called me my master but as a matter of fact we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name

   unfortunately i was not able to set at rest by further talks with bloch in which i might have insisted upon an explanation the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry from which i if you please expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing for as it happened bloch was not invited to the house again at first he had been well received there it is true that my grandfather made out that whenever i formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me that friend was invariably a jew to which he would not have objected on principle—indeed his own friend swann was of jewish extraction—had he not found that the jews whom i chose as friends were not usually of the best type and so i was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfathers humming the o god of our fathers from la juive or else israel break thy chain singing the tune alone of course to an umtitumtitum trala but i used to be afraid of my friends recognising the sound and so being able to reconstruct the words

   before seeing them merely on hearing their names about which as often as not there was nothing particularly hebraic he would divine not only the jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family

   and what do they call your friend who is coming this evening

   dumont grandpapa

   dumont oh im frightened of dumont

   and he would sing

                 archers be on your guard
               watch without rest without sound

   and then after a few adroit questions on points of detail he would call out on guard on guard or if it were the victim himself who had already arrived and had been obliged unconsciously by my grandfathers subtle examination to admit his origin then my grandfather to shew us that he had no longer any doubts would merely look at us humming almost inaudibly the air of

                 what do you hither guide the feet
               of this timid israelite

   or of

               sweet vale of hebron dear paternal fields

   or perhaps of

               yes i am of the chosen race

   these little eccentricities on my grandfathers part implied no illwill whatsoever towards my friends but bloch had displeased my family for other reasons he had begun by annoying my father who seeing him come in with wet clothes had asked him with keen interest

   why m bloch is there a change in the weather has it been raining i cant understand it the barometer has been set fair

   which drew from bloch nothing more instructive than sir i am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained i live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them

   my poor boy said my father after bloch had gone your friend is out of his mind why he couldnt even tell me what the weather was like as if there could be anything more interesting he is an imbecile

   next bloch had displeased my grandmother because after luncheon when she complained of not feeling very well he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes

   you cannot imagine that he is sincere she observed to me why he doesnt know me unless hes mad of course

   and finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot and made not the least apology saying merely i never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as time i would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of china or the malayan kriss but i am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious besides being quite bleakly bourgeois implements the umbrella and the watch

   in spite of all this he would still have been received at combray he was of course hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me they had in the end decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmothers illness were genuine enough but they knew either instinctively or from their own experience that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives and that regard for moral obligations loyalty to our friends patience in finishing our work obedience to a rule of life have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports ardent but sterile they would have preferred to bloch as companions for myself boys who would have given me no more than it is proper by all the laws of middleclass morality for boys to give one another who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened that morning to have thought of me with affection but who since they were incapable of inclining in my favour by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my greataunt furnished a type who after quarrelling for years with a niece to whom she never spoke again yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune because she was her nextofkin and it was the proper thing to do

   but i was fond of bloch my parents wished me to be happy and the insoluble problems which i set myself on such texts as the absolutely meaningless beauty of la fille de minos et de pasiphaëtired me more and made me more unwell than i should have been after further talks with him unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mothers mind and he would still have been received at combray but for one thing that same night after dinner having informed me a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life making it happier at one time and then more unhappy that no woman ever thought of anything but love and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my greataunt herself had led a gay life in her younger days and had been notoriously kept i could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents the next time bloch called he was not admitted and afterwards when i met him in the street he greeted me with extreme coldness

   but in the matter of bergotte he had spoken truly

   for the first few days like a tune which will be running in ones head and maddening one soon enough but of which one has not for the moment got hold the things i was to love so passionately in bergottes style had not yet caught my eye i could not it is true lay down the novel of his which i was reading but i fancied that i was interested in the story alone as in the first dawn of love when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted then i observed the rare almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points where a hidden flow of harmony a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style and it was at such points as these too that he would begin to speak of the vain dream of life of the inexhaustible torrent of fair forms of the sterile splendid torture of understanding and loving of the moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals that he would express a whole system of philosophy new to me by the use of marvellous imagery to the inspiration of which i would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime one of these passages of bergotte the third or fourth which i had detached from the rest filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy i had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison a joy which i felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul deep undivided vast from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away for what had happened was that while i recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases the same bursts of music the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure i now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of bergottes works which traced a purely bidimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind but rather of the ideal passage of bergotte common to every one of his books and to which all the earlier similar passages now becoming merged in it had added a kind of density and volume by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged

   i was by no means bergottes sole admirer he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mothers a highly literary lady while dr du boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished bergottes latest volume and it was from his consulting room and from a house in a park near combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for bergotte a raregrowth in those days but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout europe and america and even in the tiniest villages rare still in its refinement but in that alone what my mothers friend and it would seem what dr du boulbon liked above all in the writings of bergotte was just what i liked the same flow of melody the same oldfashioned phrases and certain others quite simple and familiar but so placed by him in such prominence as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part and also in the sad parts of his books a sort of roughness a tone that was almost harsh and he himself no doubt realised that these were his principal attractions for in his later books if he had hit upon some great truth or upon the name of an historic cathedral he would break off his narrative and in an invocation an apostrophe a lengthy prayer would give a free outlet to that effluence which in the earlier volumes remained buried beneath the form of his prose discernible only in a rippling of its surface and perhaps even more delightful more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began or of where it died away these passages in which he delighted were our favourites also for my own part i knew all of them by heart i felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me of pineforests or of hailstorms of notredame de paris of athalie or of phèdre by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence and so dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern did he not bring them within my reach i wished that i might have his opinion some metaphor of his upon everything in the world and especially upon such things as i might have an opportunity some day of seeing for myself and among such things more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of france upon certain views of the sea because the emphasis with which in his books he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty but alas upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me i had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which i was striving to raise myself convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit i had so completely obliterated them all that if i happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had in his infinite bounty restored it to me had pronounced it to be beautiful and right it happened now and then that a page of bergotte would express precisely those ideas which i used often at night when i was unable to sleep to write to my grandmother and mother and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters and so too in later years when i began to compose a book of my own and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that i could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking i would find the equivalent of my sentences in bergottes but it was only then when i read them in his pages that i could enjoy them when it was i myself who composed them in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what i seemed to have detected in my mind and in my fear of their not turning out true to life i had no time to ask myself whether what i was writing would be pleasant to read but indeed there was no kind of language no kind of ideas which i really liked except these my feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love a love which brought me no pleasure but was for all that intense and deep and so when i came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and selftormentings i was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things just as a cook who once in a while has no dinner to prepare for other people can then find time to gormandise himself and so when i had found one day in a book by bergotte some joke about an old family servant to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony but which was in principle what i had often said to my grandmother about françoise and when another time i had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute truth which were his writings a remark similar to one which i had had occasion to make on our friend m legrandin and moreover my remarks on françoise and m legrandin were among those which i would most resolutely have sacrificed for bergottes sake in the belief that he would find them quite without interest then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the realms of truth were less widely separated than i had supposed that at certain points they were actually in contact and in my newfound confidence and joy i wept upon his printed page as in the arms of a longlost father

   from his books i had formed an impression of bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man who had lost his children and had never found any consolation and so i would read or rather sing his sentences in my brain with rather more dolce rather more lento than he himself had perhaps intended and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation more than anything else in the world i cherished his philosophy and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion it made me impatient to reach the age when i should be eligible to attend the class at school called philosophy i did not wish to learn or do anything else there but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of bergotte and if i had been told then that the metaphysicians whom i was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing i should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come

   one sunday while i was reading in the garden i was interrupted by swann who had come to call upon my parents

   what are you reading may i look why its bergotte who has been telling you about him

   i replied that bloch was responsible

   oh yes that boy i saw here once who looks so like the bellini portrait of mahomet ii its an astonishing likeness he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones when his beard comes hell be mahomet himself anyhow he has good taste for bergotte is a charming creature and seeing how much i seemed to admire bergotte swann who never spoke at all about the people he knew made an exception in my favour and said i know him well if you would like him to write a few words on the titlepage of your book i could ask him for you

   i dared not accept such an offer but bombarded swann with questions about his friend can you tell me please who is his favourite actor

   actor no i cant say but i do know this theres not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to berma he puts her above everyone have you seen her

   no sir my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre

   that is a pity you should insist berma in phèdre in the cid well shes only an actress if you like but you know that i dont believe very much in the hierarchy of the arts as he spoke i noticed what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmothers sisters that whenever he spoke of serious matters whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject he would take care to isolate to sterilise it by using a special intonation mechanical and ironic as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it as who should say the hierarchy dont you know as silly people call it but then if it was so absurd why did he say the hierarchy a moment later he went on her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world as—oh i dont know— and he began to laugh shall we say the queens of chartres until then i had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something parisian and refined in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmothers sisters and i had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which swann moved where by a natural reaction from the lyrical enthusiasms of earlier generations an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts formerly regarded as vulgar and anything in the nature of phrasemaking was banned but now i found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities he appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion and to be at his ease only when he could furnish with meticulous accuracy some precise but unimportant detail but in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion holding a brief as they say for something that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own i thought again of the dinner that night when i had been so unhappy because mamma would not be coming up to my room and when he had dismissed the balls given by the princesse de léon as being of no importance and yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life for what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same time he made out that they were absurd i noticed too in the manner in which swann spoke to me of bergotte something which to do him justice was not peculiar to himself but was shared by all that writers admirers at that time at least by my mothers friend and by dr du boulbon like swann they would say of bergotte he has a charming mind so individual he has a way of his own of saying things which is a little farfetched but so pleasant you never need to look for his name on the titlepage you can tell his work at once but none of them had yet gone so far as to say he is a great writer he has great talent they did not even credit him with talent at all they did not speak because they were not aware of it we are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled great talent in our museum of general ideas simply because that physiognomy is new and strange we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent we say rather originality charm delicacy strength and then one day we add up the sum of these and find that it amounts simply to talent

   are there any books in which bergotte has written about berma i asked m swann

   i think he has in that little essay on racine but it must be out of print still there has perhaps been a second impression i will find out anyhow i can ask bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us he never misses a week from one years end to another he is my daughters greatest friend they go about together and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles

   as i was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of swanns wife and daughter had for a long time had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes i was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips as i had heard our neighbour mme sazerat say that mme swann did to gratify not her husband but m de charlus and i felt that to her we must be an object of scorn which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter such a pretty little girl as i had heard and one of whom i used often to dream always imagining her with the same features and appearance which i bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily but with a charming effect but from this afternoon when i had learned that mile swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances bathed as in her natural element in such a sea of privilege that if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner she would be answered in those two syllables radiant with celestial light would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family bergotte that for her the intimate conversation at table corresponding to what my greataunts conversation was for me would be the words of bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings and on which i would fain have heard him utter oracles and that above all when she went to visit other towns he would be walking by her side unrecognised and glorious like the gods who came down of old from heaven to dwell among mortal men then i realised both the rare worth of a creature such as mile swann and at the same time how coarse and ignorant i should appear to her and i felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that i was filled at once with longing and with despair and usually from this time forth when i thought of her i would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral explaining to me what each of the statues meant and with a smile which was my highest commendation presenting me as her friend to bergotte and invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me the charm of the hills and valleys of the he de france and of the plains of normandy would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture i had formed in my mind of mile swann nothing more remained but to know and to love her once we believe that a fellowcreature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creatures love for ourselves can win us admission that is of all the preliminary conditions which love exacts the one to which he attaches most importance the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life and that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman whose uniform makes them less particular about his face they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest more gallant more adventurous more tender and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable i dare say in an outsidebroker

   while i was reading in the garden a thing my greataunt would never have understood my doing save on a sunday that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing on a weekday she would have said how you can go on amusing yourself with a book it isnt sunday you know putting into the word amusing an implication of childishness and waste of time my aunt léonie would be gossiping with françoise until it was time for eulalie to arrive she would tell her that she had just seen mme goupil go by without an umbrella in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at châteaudun if she has far to go before vespers she may get it properly soaked

   very likely which meant also very likely not was the answer for françoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative

   there now went on my aunt beating her brow that reminds me that i never heard if she got to church this morning before the elevation i must remember to ask eulalie françoise just look at that black cloud behind the steeple and how poor the light is on the slates you may be certain it will rain before the day is out it couldnt possibly keep on like this its been too hot and the sooner the better for until the storm breaks my vichy water wont go down she concluded since in her mind the desire to accelerate the digestion of her vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing mme goupils new dress ruined

   very likely

   and you know that when it rains in the square theres none too much shelter suddenly my aunt turned pale what three oclock she exclaimed but vespers will have begun already and ive forgotten my pepsin now i know why that vichy water has been lying on my stomach and falling precipitately upon a prayerbook bound in purple velvet with gilt clasps out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church my aunt while she swallowed her drops began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin when taken so long after the vichy would still be able to overtake it and to send it down three oclock its unbelievable how time flies

   a little tap at the window as though some missile had struck it followed by a plentiful falling sound as light though as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead then the fall spread took on an order a rhythm became liquid loud drumming musical innumerable universal it was the rain

   there françoise what did i tell you how its coming down but i think i heard the bell at the garden gate go along and see who can be outside in this weather

   françoise went and returned its mme amédée my grandmother she said she was going for a walk its raining hard all the same

   im not at all surprised said my aunt looking up towards the sky ive always said that she was not in the least like other people well im glad its she and not myself whos outside in all this

   mme amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest said françoise not unkindly refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was a bit off her head

   theres benediction over eulalie will never come now sighed my aunt it will be the weather thats frightened her away

   but its not five oclock yet mme octave its only halfpast four

   only halfpast four and here am i obliged to draw back the small curtains just to get a tiny streak of daylight at halfpast four only a week before the rogationdays ah my poor françoise the dear lord must be sorely vexed with us the world is going too far in these days as my poor octave used to say we have forgotten god too often and he is taking vengeance upon us

   a bright flush animated my aunts cheeks it was eulalie as ill luck would have it scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when françoise reappeared and with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which she had no doubt her tidings would give my aunt articulating each syllable so as to shew that in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech she was repeating as a good servant should the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use said his reverence the curé would be delighted enchanted if mme octave is not resting just now and could see him his reverence does not wish to disturb mme octave his reverence is downstairs i told him to go into the parlour

   had the truth been known the curés visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as françoise supposed and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid the curé an excellent man with whom i am sorry now that i did not converse more often for even if he cared nothing for the arts he knew a great many etymologies being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church he had even planned to compile a history of the parish of combray used to weary her with his endless explanations which incidentally never varied in the least degree but when his visit synchronized exactly with eulalies it became frankly distasteful to my aunt she would have preferred to make the most of eulalie and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time but she dared not send the curé away and had to content herself with making a sign to eulalie not to leave when he did so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone

   what is this i have been hearing father that a painter has set up his easel in your church and is copying one of the windows old as i am i can safely say that i have never even heard of such a thing in all my life what is the world coming to next i wonder and the ugliest thing in the whole church too

   i will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest for although there are certain things in sainthilaire which are well worth a visit there are others that are very old now in my poor basilica the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored the lord knows our porch is dirty and out of date still it is of a majestic character take for instance the esther tapestries though personally i would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them but experts put them next after the ones at sens i can quite see too that apart from certain details which are—well a trifle realistic they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation but dont talk to me about the windows is it common sense i ask you to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour to which i should be hard put to it to give a name on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level and yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because if you please those are the tombstones of the abbots of combray and the lords of guermantes the old counts you know of brabant direct ancestors of the present duc de guermantes and of his duchesse also since she was a lady of the guermantes family and married her cousin my grandmother whose steady refusal to take any interest in persons had ended in her confusing all their names and titles whenever anyone mentioned the duchesse de guermantes used to make out that she must be related to mme de villeparisis the whole family would then burst out laughing and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral i feel sure that there was a guermantes in it somewhere and for once i would side with the others and against her refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her schoolfriend and the descendant of geneviève de brabant

   look at roussainville the curé went on it is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks i am not certain by the way of the etymology of roussainville i should dearly like to think that the name was originally rouville from radulfi villa analogous dont you see to châteaurouxcastrum radulfi but we will talk about that some other time very well the church there has superb windows almost all quite modern including that most imposing entry of louisphilippe into combray which would be more in keeping surely at combray itself and which is every bit as good i understand as the famouswindows at chartres only yesterday i met dr percepieds brother who goes in for these things and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work but as i said to this artist who by the way seems to be a most civil fellow and is a regular virtuoso it appears with his brush what on earth i said to him do you find so extraordinary in this window which is if anything a little dingier than the rest

   i am sure that if you were to ask his lordship said my aunt in a resigned tone for she had begun to feel that she was going to be tired he would never refuse you a new window

   you may depend upon it mme octave replied the curé why it was just his lordship himself who started the outcry about the window by proving that it represented gilbert the bad a lord of guermantes and a direct descendant of geneviève de brabant who was a daughter of the house of guermantes receiving absolution from saint hilaire

   but i dont see where saint hilaire comes in

   why yes have you never noticed in the corner of the window a lady in a yellow robe very well that is saint hilaire who is also known you will remember in certain parts of the country as saint illiers saint hèlier and even in the jura saint ylie but these various corruptions of sanctus hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed saints take for example my good eulalie the case of your own patron sancta eulalia do you know what she has become in burgundy saint eloi nothing more nor less the lady has become a gentleman do you hear that eulalie after you are dead they will make a man of you

   father will always have his joke

   gilberts brother charles the stammerer was a pious prince but having early in life lost his father pepin the mad who died as a result of his mental infirmity he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth so much so that whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember he would massacre the whole place to the last inhabitant gilbert wishing to be avenged on charles caused the church at combray to be burned down the original church that was which théodebert when he and his court left the country residence he had near here at thiberzy which is of course theodeberiacus to go out and fight the burgundians had promised to build over the tomb of saint hilaire if the saint brought him victory nothing remains of it now but the crypt into which théodore has probably taken you for gilbert burned all the rest finally he defeated the unlucky charles with the aid of william which the curé pronounced willam the conqueror which is why so many english still come to visit the place but he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of combray for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass and cut off his head théodore has a little book that he lends people which tells you the whole story

   but what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry which is full of grandeur certainly in your case since you are not very strong i should never recommend you to climb our seven and ninety steps just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at milan it is quite tiring enough for the most active person especially as you have to go on your hands and knees if you dont wish to crack your skull and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes in any case you should be well wrapped up he went on without noticing my aunts fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever possibly be capable of climbing into his belfry for theres a strong breeze there once you get to the top some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there no matter on sundays there are always clubs and societies who come some of them long distances to admire our beautiful panorama and they always go home charmed wait now next sunday if the weather holds you will be sure to find a lot of people there for rogationtide you must admit certainly that the view from up there is like a fairytale with what you might call vistas along the plain which have quite a special charm of their own on a clear day you can see as far as verneuil and then another thing you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other as for instance the course of the vivonne and the ditches at saintassiselèscombray which are separated really by a screen of tall trees or to take another example there are all the canals at jouylevicomte which is gaudiacus vicecomitis as of course you know each time that i have been to jouy i have seen a bit of a canal in one place and then i have turned a corner and seen another but when i saw the second i could no longer see the first i tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another it was no good but from the top of sainthilaire its quite another matter the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map only you cannot make out the water you would say that there were great rifts in the town slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up to get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once up here on the top of sainthilaire and down there at jouylevicomte

   the curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away eulalie also

   here my poor eulalie she said in a feeble voice drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand this is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers

   oh but mme octave i dont think i ought to you know very well that i dont come here for that so eulalie would answer with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment every sunday as though each temptation were the first and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her for if it so happened that eulalie when she took the money looked a little less sulky than usual my aunt would remark afterwards i cannot think what has come over eulalie i gave her just the trifle i always give and she did not look at all pleased

   i dont think she has very much to complain of all the same françoise would sigh grimly for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped sunday by sunday into eulalies hand but so discreetly passed that françoise never managed to see them it was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on eulalie she already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout combray jouylevicomte and other cities of men on account of my aunts many farms her frequent and prolonged visits from the curé and the astonishing number of bottles of vichy water which she consumed françoise was avaricious only for my aunt had she had control over my aunts fortune which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity she would however have seen no great harm in what my aunt whom she knew to be incurably generous allowed herself to give away had she given only to those who were already rich perhaps she felt that such persons not being actually in need of my aunts presents could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account besides presents offered to persons of great wealth and position such as mme sazerat m swann m legrandin and mme goupil to persons of the same class as my aunt and who would naturally mix with her seemed to françoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people who hunted and shot gave balls and paid visits a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile but it was by no means the same thing if for this princely exchange of courtesies my aunt substituted mere charity if her beneficiaries were of the class which françoise would label people like myself or people no better than myself people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as mme françoise just to shew that they considered themselves to be not as good and when she saw that despite all her warnings my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased and to fling money away with both hands or so at least françoise believed on undeserving objects she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon eulalie there was not in the neighbourhood of combray a farm of such prosperity and importance that françoise doubted eulalies ability to buy it without thinking twice out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had brought in it must be added that eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of françoise so every sunday after eulalie had gone françoise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall she hated eulalie but was at the same time afraid of her and so felt bound when eulalie was there to look pleasant but she would make up for that after the others departure never it is true alluding to her by name but hinting at her in sibylline oracles or in utterances of a comprehensive character like those of ecclesiastes the preacher but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt after peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether eulalie had shut the frontdoor behind her flatterers know how to make themselves welcome and to gather up the crumbs but have patience have patience our god is a jealous god and one fine day he will be avenged upon them she would declaim with the sidelong insinuating glance of joash thinking of athaliah alone when he says that the

                                  prosperity
                        of wicked men runs like a torrent past
                        and soon is spent

   but on this memorable afternoon when the curé had come as well and by his interminable visit had drained my aunts strength françoise followed eulalie from the room saying mme octave i will leave you to rest you look utterly tired out

   and my aunt answered her not a word breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last and lying there with closed eyes as though already dead but hardly had françoise arrived downstairs when four peals of a bell pulled with the utmost violence reverberated through the house and my aunt sitting erect upon her bed called out has eulalie gone yet would you believe it i forgot to ask her whether mme goupil arrived in church before the elevation run after her quick

   but françoise returned alone having failed to overtake eulalie it is most provoking said my aunt shaking her head the one important thing that i had to ask her

   in this way life went by for my aunt léonie always the same in the gentle uniformity of what she called with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness her little jogtrot respected by all and sundry not merely in her own house where every one of us having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life had become gradually resigned to its observance but in the village as well where three streets away a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packingcase would send first to françoise to make sure that my aunt was not resting—her little jogtrot was none the less brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year like a fruit hidden among its leaves which has grown and ripened unobserved by man until it falls of its own accord there came upon us one night the kitchenmaids confinement her pains were unbearable and as there was no midwife in combray françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from thiberzy my aunt was unable to rest owing to the cries of the girl and as françoise though the distance was nothing was very late in returning her services were greatly missed and so in the course of the morning my mother said to me run upstairs and see if your aunt wants anything

   i went into the first of her two rooms and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side asleep i could hear her breathing in what was almost distinguishable as a snore i was just going to slip away when something probably the sound of my entry interrupted her sleep and made it change speed as they say of motorcars nowadays for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note then she awoke and half turned her face which i could see for the first time a kind of horror was imprinted on it plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream she could not see me from where she was lying and i stood there not knowing whether i ought to go forward or to retire but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her a smile of joy a pious act of thanksgiving to god who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams feebly illumined her face and with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself halfaloud when she thought herself alone she murmured the lord be praised we have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchenmaids baby and ive been dreaming that my poor octave had come back to life and was trying to make me take a walk every day she stretched out a hand towards her rosary which was lying on the small table but sleep was once again getting the mastery and did not leave her the strength to reach it she fell asleep calm and contented and i crept out of the room on tiptoe without either her or anyones else ever knowing from that day to this what i had seen and heard

   when i say that apart from such rare happenings as this confinement my aunts little jogtrot never underwent any variation i do not include those variations which repeated at regular intervals and in identical form did no more really than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life so for instance every saturday as françoise had to go in the afternoon to market at roussainvillelepin the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier and my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits that she clung to it as much as to the rest she was so well routined to it as françoise would say that if on a saturday she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour it would have upset her as much as if she had had on an ordinary day to put her luncheon forward to its saturday time incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave saturday for all of us an individual character kindly and rather attractive at the moment when ordinarily there was still an hour to be lived through before mealtime sounded we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance followed by the special favour of an omelette an unmerited steak the return of this asymmetrical saturday was one of those petty occurrences intramural localised almost civic which in uneventful lives and stable orders of society create a kind of national unity and become the favourite theme for conversation for pleasantries for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases it would have provided a nucleus readymade for a legendary cycle if any of us had had the epic mind at daybreak before we were dressed without rhyme or reason save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity we would call to one another goodhumoredly cordially patriotically hurry up theres no time to be lost dont forget its saturday while my aunt gossiping with françoise and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual would say you might cook them a nice bit of veal seeing that its saturday if at halfpast ten some one absentmindedly pulled out a watch and said i say an hourandahalf still before luncheon everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once why what are you thinking about have you forgotten that its saturday and a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt léonie about this absurd mistake to amuse her the very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change after luncheon the sun conscious that it was saturday would blaze an hour longer in the zenith and when some one thinking that we were late in starting for our walk said what only two oclock feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of sainthilaire which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it or on the banks of the bright and everflowing stream which even the angler had abandoned and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them the whole family would respond in chorus why youre forgetting we had luncheon an hour earlier you know very well its saturday

   the surprise of a barbarian for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with saturdays special customs who had called at eleven oclock to speak to my father and had found us at table was an event which used to cause françoise as much merriment as perhaps anything that had ever happened in her life and if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known beforehand that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on saturday it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself fully as she sympathised from the bottom of her heart with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter and so had replied with no further enlightenment of the others surprise at seeing us already in the diningroom you see its saturday on reaching this point in the story françoise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes and then to add to her own enjoyment would prolong the dialogue inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word saturday had conveyed nothing and so far from our objecting to these interpolations we would feel that the story was not yet long enough and would rally her with oh but surely he said something else as well there was more than that the first time you told it

   my greataunt herself would lay aside her work and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses

   the day had yet another characteristic feature namely that during may we used to go out on saturday evenings after dinner to the month of mary devotions

   as we were liable there to meet m vinteuil who held very strict views on the deplorable untidiness of young people which seems to be encouraged in these days my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance and then we would set out for the church it was in these month of mary services that i can remember having first fallen in love with hawthornblossom the hawthorn was not merely in the church for there holy ground as it was we had all of us a right of entry but arranged upon the altar itself inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches tied to one another horizontally in a stiff festal scheme of decoration and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves over which were scattered in profusion as over a bridal train little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness though i dared not look at them save through my fingers i could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things and that it was nature herself who by trimming the shape of the foliage and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery higher up on the altar a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace holding so unconcernedly like a final almost vaporous bedizening its bunch of stamens slender as gossamer which clouded the flower itself in a white mist that in following these with my eyes in trying to imitate somewhere inside myself the action of their blossoming i imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils by a young girl in white careless and alive

   m vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us he belonged to a good family and had once been musicmaster to my grandmothers sisters so that when after losing his wife and inheriting some property he had retired to the neighbourhood of combray we used often to invite him to our house but with his intense prudishness he had given up coming so as not to be obliged to meet swann who had made what he called a most unsuitable marriage as seems to be the fashion in these days my mother on hearing that he composed told him by way of a compliment that when she came to see him he must play her something of his own m vinteuil would have liked nothing better but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point always putting himself in their place that he was afraid of boring them or of appearing egotistical if he carried out or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires on the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit i had accompanied them but they had allowed me to remain outside and as m vinteuils house montjouvain stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs among which i took cover i had found myself on a level with his drawingroom upstairs and only a few feet away from its window when a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived i had seen m vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye but as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner he was afraid no doubt of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions and every time that my mother in the course of her visit had returned to the subject of his playing he had hurriedly protested i cannot think who put that on the piano it is not the proper place for it at all and had turned the conversation aside to other topics simply because those were of less interest to himself

   his one and only passion was for his daughter and she with her somewhat boyish appearance looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders my grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle delicate almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face dusted all over with freckles of this otherwise stolid child when she had spoken she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding and one would see in clear outline as though in a transparency beneath the mannish face of the good sort that she was the finer features of a young woman in tears

   when before turning to leave the church i made a genuflection before the altar i felt suddenly as i rose again a bittersweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthornblossom and i then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour in which i imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts or the sweetness of mile vinteuils cheeks beneath their freckles despite the heavy motionless silence of the hawthorns these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae of which i was reminded by seeing some stamens almost red in colour which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers

   outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with m vinteuil in the porch boys would be chevying one another in the square and he would interfere taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big if his daughter said in her thick comfortable voice how glad she had been to see us immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister latent in her had blushed at this thoughtless schoolboyish utterance which had perhaps made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders they would clamber into a little dogcart which she herself drove and home they would both go to montjouvain as for ourselves the next day being sunday with no need to be up and stirring before high mass if it was a moonlight night and warm then instead of taking us home at once my father in his thirst for personal distinction would lead us on a long walk round by the calvary which my mothers utter incapacity for taking her bearings or even for knowing which road she might be on made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation because every year as we came down from paris we would be warned to take special care when we got to combray not to miss the station to be ready before the train stopped since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct out of the lands of christendom of which combray to me represented the farthest limit we would return by the boulevard de la gare which contained the most attractive villas in the town in each of their gardens the moonlight copying the art of hubert robert had scattered its broken staircases of white marble its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar its beams had swept away the telegraph office all that was left of it was a column half shattered but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time i would by now be dragging my weary limbs and ready to drop with sleep the balmy scent of the limetrees seemed a consolation which i could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion and not worthy of the effort from gates far apart the watchdogs awakened by our steps in the silence would set up an antiphonal barking as i still hear them bark at times in the evenings and it is in their custody when the public gardens of combray were constructed on its site that the boulevard de la gare must have taken refuge for wherever i may be as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance i can see it again with all its limetrees and its pavement glistening beneath the moon

   suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother—where are we utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea he would shrug his shoulders and laugh and then as though it had slipped with his latchkey from his waistcoat pocket he would point out to us when it stood before our eyes the backgate of our own garden which had come handinhand with the familiar corner of the rue du saintesprit to await us to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown my mother would murmur admiringly you really are wonderful and from that instant i had not to take another step the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where for so long my actions had ceased to require any control or even attention from my will custom came to take me in her arms carried me all the way up to my bed and laid me down there like a little child

   although saturday by beginning an hour earlier and by depriving her of the services of françoise passed more slowly than other days for my aunt yet the moment it was past and a new week begun she would look forward with impatience to its return as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure this was not to say however that she did not long at times for some even greater variation that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has when those people who through lack of energy or imagination are unable to generate any motive power in themselves cry out as the clock strikes or the postman knocks in their eagerness for news even if it be bad news for some emotion even that of grief when the heartstrings which prosperity has silenced like a harp laid by yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand even a brutal hand even if it shall break them when the will which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires and consequent sufferings would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances coercive and it may be cruel of course since my aunts strength which was completely drained by the slightest exertion returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose the reservoir was very slow in filling and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities but which she had no idea—and could never decide how to employ and i have no doubt that then—just as a desire to have her potatoes served with béchamel sauce for a change would be formed ultimately from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never tired—she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days on which she so much depended a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm instantaneous in its happening but violent enough to compel her to put into effect once for all one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus she was genuinely fond of us she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease coming at a moment when she felt well and was not in a perspiration the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire in which all the rest of us had already perished a fire which in a little while would not leave one stone standing upon another but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste provided that she rose at once from her bed must often have haunted her dreams as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies crushed but courageous moribund but erect the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment with no time to be lost no room for weakening hesitations to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of mirougrain where there was a waterfall inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation from the first of those little unforeseen facts the first word of calamitous news whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual physical death so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility she would fall back from time to time to add an interest to her life upon imagining other minor catastrophes which she would follow up with passion she would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that françoise had been robbing her that she had set a trap to make certain and had caught her betrayer redhanded and being in the habit when she made up a game of cards by herself of playing her own and her adversarys hands at once she would first stammer out françoises awkward apologies and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration her eyes blazing her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows françoise must often from the next room have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunts feelings sufficiently had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them halfaloud sometimes however even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt she must see her work staged and so on a sunday with all the doors mysteriously closed she would confide in eulalie her doubts of françoises integrity and her determination to be rid of her and on another day she would confide in françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of eulalie to whom the frontdoor would very soon be closed for good a few days more and disgusted with her latest confidant she would again be as thick as thieves with the traitor while before the next performance the two would once more have changed their parts but the suspicions which eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw which must soon subside for lack of fuel since eulalie was not living with her in the house it was a very different matter when the suspect was françoise of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious while for fear of catching cold were she to leave her bed she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was indeed any foundation for her suspicions and so on by degrees until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt at every hour of the day to discover what was being done what was being concealed from her by françoise she would detect the most furtive movement of françoises features something contradictory in what she was saying some desire which she appeared to be screening and she would shew her that she was unmasked by a single word which made françoise turn pale and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servants heart and the very next sunday a disclosure by eulalie—like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths—proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth but françoise ought to know that said eulalie now that you have given her a carriage

   now that i have given her a carriage gasped my aunt

   oh but i didnt know i only thought so i saw her go by yesterday in her open coach as proud as artaban on her way to roussainville market i supposed that it must be mme octave who had given it to her

   so on by degrees until françoise and my aunt the quarry and the hunter could never cease from trying to forestall each others devices my mother was afraid lest françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt who was doing everything in her power to annoy her however that might be françoise had come more and more to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunts least word and gesture when she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate first for a long time making up her mind how best to begin and when she had uttered her request she would watch my aunt covertly trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it and how she would reply and in this way—whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century and wished to bring himself nearer to the great louis would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning sovereigns of europe and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms—a middleaged lady in a small country town by doing no more than yield wholehearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence could see without ever having given a thought to louis xiv the most trivial occupations of her daily life her morning toilet her luncheon her afternoon nap assume by virtue of their despotic singularity something of the interest that was to be found in what saintsimon used to call the machinery of life at versailles and was able too to persuade herself that her silence a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features would provide françoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror as did the silence the good humour or the arrogance of the king when a courtier or even his greatest nobles had presented a petition to him at the turning of an avenue at versailles

   one sunday when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the curé and from eulalie and had been left alone afterwards to rest the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night and mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time

   i hear that things went wrong again today léonie she said kindly you have had all your friends here at once

   and my greataunt interrupted with too many good things for since her daughters illness she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things but my father had begun to speak

   i should like to take advantage he said of the whole familys being here together to tell you a story so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately i am afraid we are in m legrandins bad books he would hardly say how dye do to me this morning

   i did not wait to hear the end of my fathers story for i had been with him myself after mass when we had passed m legrandin instead i went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner which was of fresh interest to me daily like the news in a paper and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity

   as m legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church walking by the side of a lady the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood whom we knew only by sight my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved without stopping in his walk m legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy and then with an air of surprise as though he had not recognised us and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head in proportion to your dolllike dimensions

   now the lady who was walking with legrandin was a model of virtue known and highly respected there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure and annoyed at being detected and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend

   i should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us he said because among all those people in their sunday clothes there is something about him with his little cutaway coat and his soft neckties so little dressedup so genuinely simple an air of innocence almost which is really attractive

   but the vote of the family council was unanimous that my father had imagined the whole thing or that legrandin at the moment in question had been preoccupied in thinking about something else anyhow my fathers fears were dissipated no later than the following evening as we returned from a long walk we saw near the pontvieux legrandin himself who on account of the holidays was spending a few days more in combray he came up to us with outstretched hand do you know master booklover he asked me this line of paul desjardins

              now are the woods all black but still the sky is blue

   is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this perhaps you have never read paul desjardins read him my boy read him in these days he is converted they tell me into a preaching friar but he used to have the most charming watercolour touch—

              now are the woods all black but still the sky is blue

   may you always see a blue sky overhead my young friend and then even when the time comes which is coming now for me when the woods are all black when night is fast falling you will be able to console yourself as i am doing by looking up to the sky he took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time his eyes fixed on the horizon goodbye friends he suddenly exclaimed and left us

   at the hour when i usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner its preparation would already have begun and françoise a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns as in the fairytales where giants hire themselves out as scullions would be stirring the coals putting the potatoes to steam and at the right moment finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels triumphs of the potters craft which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game moulds for pastry and tiny pannikins for cream and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size i would stop by the table where the kitchenmaid had shelled them to inspect the platoons of peas drawn up in ranks and numbered like little green marbles ready for a game but what fascinated me would be the asparagus tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads finely stippled in mauve and azure through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet still stained a little by the soil of their gardenbed a rainbowloveliness that was not of this world i felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form who through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn these hinted rainbows these blue evening shades that precious quality which i should recognise again when all night long after a dinner at which i had partaken of them they played lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in shakespeares dream at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume

   poor giottos charity as swann had named her charged by françoise with the task of preparing them for the table would have them lying beside her in a basket sitting with a mournful air as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined star by star as in giottos fresco are the flowers banded about the brows or patterning the basket of his virtue at padua and meanwhile françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens such as she alone knew how to roast chickens which had wafted far abroad from combray the sweet savour of her merits and which while she was serving them to us at table would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character the aroma of that cooked flesh which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues

   but the day on which while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with legrandin i went down to the kitchen was one of those days when giottos charity still very weak and ill after her recent confinement had been unable to rise from her bed françoise being without assistance had fallen into arrears when i went in i saw her in the backkitchen which opened on to the courtyard in process of killing a chicken by its desperate and quite natural resistance which françoise beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear accompanied with shrill cries of filthy creature filthy creature it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do next day at dinner when it made its appearance in a skin goldembroidered like a chasuble and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx when it was dead françoise mopped up its streaming blood in which however she did not let her rancour drown for she gave vent to another burst of rage and gazing down at the carcass of her enemy uttered a final filthy creature

   i crept out of the kitchen and upstairs trembling all over i could have prayed then for the instant dismissal of françoise but who would have baked me such hot rolls boiled me such fragrant coffee and even—roasted me such chickens and as it happened everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning for my aunt léonie knew though i was still in ignorance of this that françoise who for her own daughter or for her nephews would have given her life without a murmur shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world in spite of which my aunt still retained her for while conscious of her cruelty she could appreciate her services i began gradually to realise that françoises kindness her compunction the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these backkitchen tragedies just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches were stained by oppression and bloodshed i had taken note of the fact that apart from her own kinsfolk the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself the tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her in a newspaper were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims one night shortly after her confinement the kitchenmaid was seized with the most appalling pains mamma heard her groans and rose and awakened françoise who quite unmoved declared that all the outcry was mere malingering that the girl wanted to play the mistress in the house the doctor who had been afraid of some such attack had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had at the page on which the symptoms were described and had told us to turn up this passage where we would find the measures of first aid to be adopted my mother sent françoise to fetch the book warning her not to let the marker drop out an hour elapsed and françoise had not returned my mother supposing that she had gone back to bed grew vexed and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume i did so and there found françoise who in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated had begun to read the clinical account of these afterpains and was violently sobbing now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar at each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim oh oh holy virgin is it possible that god wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so oh the poor girl

   but when i had called her and she had returned to the bedside of giottos charity her tears at once ceased to flow she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchenmaid so that at the sight of those very sufferings the printed account of which had moved her to tears she had nothing to offer but illtempered mutterings mingled with bitter sarcasm saying when she thought that we had gone out of earshot well she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about she found that pleasant enough i dare say she had better not put on any airs now all the same he must have been a godforsaken young man to go after that dear dear its just as they used to say in my poor mothers country

                    snaps and snails and puppydogs tails
                          and dirty sluts in plenty
                    smell sweeter than roses in young mens noses
                         when the heart is oneandtwenty

   although when her grandson had a slight cold in his head she would bet off at night even if she were ill also instead of going to bed to see whether he had everything that he wanted covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work this same love for her own people and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted in her policy with regard to the other servants in one unvarying maxim which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunts room indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt preferring when she herself was ill to get out of bed and to administer the vichy water in person rather than to concede to the kitchenmaid the right of entry into her mistresss presence there is a species of hymenoptera observed by fabre the burrowing wasp which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty and having made a collection of weevils and spiders proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nervecentre on which their power of locomotion but none of their other vital functions depends so that the paralysed insect beside which her egg is laid will furnish the larva when it is hatched with a tamed and inoffensive quarry incapable either of flight or of resistance but perfectly fresh for the larder in the same way françoise had adopted to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems many years later we discovered that if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchenmaid who had to prepare them such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunts service

   alas we had definitely to alter our opinion of m legrandin on oneof the sundays following our meeting with him on the pontvieux after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken as mass drew to an end and with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world something else invaded the church an atmosphere so far from sacred that mme goupil mme percepied all those in fact who a moment ago when i arrived a little late had been sitting motionless their eyes fixed on their prayerbooks who i might even have thought had not seen me come in had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneelingdesk which was preventing me from getting to my chair began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics as though we were already outside in the square we saw standing on the sunbaked steps of the porch dominating the manycoloured tumult of the market legrandin himself whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him on the previous occasion was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district legrandins face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation he made a profound bow with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its startingpoint a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister mme de cambremer this rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over legrandins hips which i had not supposed to be so fleshy i cannot say why but this undulation of pure matter this wholly carnal fluency with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity an obsequiousness of the basest sort awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew the lady gave him some message for her coachman and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy timid and devout which the introduction had stamped there still lingered on his face carried away in a sort of dream he smiled then he began to hurry back towards the lady he was walking faster than usual and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards right and left in the most absurd fashion altogether he looked so utterly had he abandoned himself to it ignoring all other considerations as though he were the lifeless and wirepulled puppet of his own happiness meanwhile we were coming out through the porch we were passing close beside him he was too well bred to turn his head away but he fixed his eyes which had suddenly changed to those of a seer lost in the profundity of his vision on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us and so had not to acknowledge our presence his face emerged still with an air of innocence from his straight and pliant coat which looked as though conscious of having been led astray in spite of itself and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour and a spotted necktie stirred by the breezes of the square continued to float in front of legrandin like the standard of his proud isolation of his noble independence just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the sainthonoré and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once near the church we met legrandin coming towards us with the same lady whom he was escorting to her carriage he brushed past us and did not interrupt what he was saying to her but gave us out of the corner of his blue eye a little sign which began and ended so to speak inside his eyelids and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady but striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression he made that blue chink which was set apart for us sparkle with all the animation of cordiality which went far beyond mere playfulness and almost touched the borderline of roguery he subtilised the refinements of goodfellowship into a wink of connivance a hint a hidden meaning a secret understanding all the mysteries of complicity in a plot and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection even of a declaration of love lighting up for us and for us alone with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice

   only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same sunday evening come and bear your aged friend company he had said to me like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which i also used to wander many years ago come with the primrose with the canons beard with the goldcup come with the stonecrop whereof are posies made pledges of love in the balzacian flora come with that flower of the resurrection morning the easter daisy come with the snowballs of the guelderrose which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your greataunts garden ere the last snows of lent are melted from its soil come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily apparel fit for solomon and with the manycoloured enamel of the pansies but come above all with the spring breeze still cooled by the last frosts of winter wafting apart for the two butterflies sake that have waited outside all morning the closed portals of the first jerusalem rose

   the question was raised at home whether all things considered i ought still to be sent to dine with m legrandin but my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite

   you admit yourself that he appears at church there quite simply dressed and all that he hardly looks like a man of fashion she added that in any event even if at the worst he had been intentionally rude it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing and indeed my father himself though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which legrandin had adopted may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning it was like every attitude or action which reveals a mans deep and hidden character they bear no relation to what he has previously said and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprits evidence for he will admit nothing we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses and we ask ourselves in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination with the result that such attitudes and these alone are of importance in indicating character are the most apt to leave us in perplexity

   i dined with legrandin on the terrace of his house by moonlight there is a charming quality is there not he said to me in this silence for hearts that are wounded as mine is a novelist whom you will read in time to come claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow and see you this my boy there comes in all lives a time towards which you still have far to go when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence

   i could hear what m legrandin was saying like everything that he said it sounded attractive but i was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom i had seen recently for the first time and thinking now that i knew that legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance i summoned up all my courage and said to him tell me sir do you by any chance know the lady—the ladies of guermantes and i felt glad because in pronouncing the name i had secured a sort of power over it by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things

   but at the sound of the word guermantes i saw in the middle of each of our friends blue eyes a little brown dimple appear as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pinpoint while the rest of his pupils reacting from the shock received and secreted the azure overflow his fringed eyelids darkened and drooped his mouth which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines was the first to recover and smiled while his eyes still seemed full of pain like the eyes of a goodlooking martyr whose body bristles with arrows

   no i do not know them he said but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it he recited it with a separate stress upon each word leaning forward bowing his head with at once the vehemence which a man gives so as to be believed to a highly improbable statement as though the fact that he did not know the guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune and with the emphasis of a man who finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation chooses to proclaim it aloud so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment but is easy agreeable spontaneous that the situation in question in this case the absence of relations with the guermantes family might very well have been not forced upon but actually designed by legrandin himself might arise from some family tradition some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society

   no he resumed explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered no i do not know them i have never wished to know them i have always made a point of preserving complete independence at heart as you know i am a bit of a radical people are always coming to me about it telling me i am mistaken in not going to guermantes that i make myself seem illbred uncivilised an old bear but thats not the sort of reputation that can frighten me its too true in my heart of hearts i care for nothing in the world now but a few churches books—two or three pictures—rather more perhaps and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth such as yours wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough now to distinguish

   i did not understand very clearly why in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know it should be necessary to cling to ones independence nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear but what i did understand was this that legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches moonlight and youth he cared also he cared a very great deal for people who lived in country houses and would be so much afraid when in their company of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered as well among his friends middleclass people the families of solicitors and stockbrokers preferring if the truth must be known that it should be revealed in his absence when he was out of earshot that judgment should go against him if so it must by default in a word he was a snob of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and i so much admired and if i asked him do you know the guermantes family legrandin the talker would reply no i have never cared to know them but unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another legrandin whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast whom he would never consciously exhibit because this other could tell stories about our own legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever and this other legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look that stiffened smile the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words in the thousand arrows by which our own legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened like a saint sebastian of snobbery

   oh how you hurt me no i do not know the guermantes family do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life and since this other this irrepressible dominant despotic legrandin if he lacked our legrandins charming vocabulary shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself by means of what are called reflexes it followed that when legrandin the talker attempted to silence him he would already have spoken and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them

   this was not to say that m legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs he could not from his own knowledge at least be aware that he was one also since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us upon ourselves they react but indirectly through our imagination which substitutes for our actual primary motives other secondary motives less stark and therefore more decent never had legrandins snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such instead it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear in legrandins eyes endowed with all the graces he would be drawn towards the duchess assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind and her other virtues which the vile race of snobs could never understand only his fellowsnobs knew that he was of their number for owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of legrandin and their primary cause

   at home meanwhile we had no longer any illusions as to m legrandin and our relations with him had become much more distant mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him redhanded in the sin which he continued to call the unpardonable sin of snobbery as for my father he found it difficult to take legrandins airs in so light in so detached a spirit and when there was some talk one year of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at balbec with my grandmother he said i must most certainly tell legrandin that you are going to balbec to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister he probably doesnt remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place

   my grandmother who held that when one went to the seaside one ought to be on the beach from morning to night to taste the salt breezes and that one should not know anyone in the place because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged by rights to the seaair begged him on no account to speak to legrandin of our plans for already in her minds eye she could see his sister mme de cambremer alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her but mamma laughed her fears to scorn for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening and that legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister and as it happened there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of balbec for it was legrandin himself who without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts walked into the trap uninvited one evening when we met him strolling on the banks of the vivonne

   there are tints in the clouds this evening violets and blues which are very beautiful are they not my friend he said to my father especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric a cineraria blue which it is surprising to see in the sky and that little pink cloud there has it not just the tint of some flower a carnation or hydrangea nowhere perhaps except on the shores of the english channel where normandy merges into brittany have i been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds down there close to balbec among all those places which are still so uncivilised there is a little bay charmingly quiet where the sunsets of the auge valley those redandgold sunsets which all the same i am very far from despising seem commonplace and insignificant for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flowerbeds will break into blossom in a few moments in the evenings incomparably lovely and often lasting for hours before they fade others shed their leaves at once and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals sulphurous yellow and rosy red in that bay which they call the opal bay the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened like fair andromeda to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast to that funereal shore famed for the number of its wrecks where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea balbec the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil the true armor the sea the lands end the accursed region which anatole france—an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read—has so well depicted beneath its eternal fogs as though it were indeed the land of the cimmerians in the odyssey balbec yes they are building hotels there now superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil which they are powerless to alter how delightful it is down there to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing

   indeed and do you know anyone at balbec inquired my father this young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother and my wife too perhaps

   legrandin taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father was unable to turn aside his gaze and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity—smiling mournfully the while—upon the eyes of his questioner with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face until he seemed to have penetrated my fathers skull as it had been a ball of glass and to be seeing at the moment a long way beyond and behind it a brightly coloured cloud which provided him with a mental alibi and would enable him to establish the theory that just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at balbec he had been thinking of something else and so had not heard the question as a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask why what are you thinking about but my father inquisitive annoyed and cruel repeated have you friends then in that neighbourhood that you know balbec so well

   in a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness vagueness candour and distraction then feeling no doubt that there was nothing left for it now but to answer he said to us i have friends all the world over wherever there are companies of trees stricken but not defeated which have come together to offer a common supplication with pathetic obstinacy to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them

   that is not quite what i meant interrupted my father obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky i asked you in case anything should happen to my motherinlaw and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there at the ends of the earth whether you knew any of the people

   there as elsewhere i know everyone and i know no one replied legrandin who was by no means ready yet to surrender places i know well people very slightly but down there the places themselves seem to me just like people rare and wonderful people of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliffs edge standing there by the roadside where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky still rosy through which a golden moon is climbing while the fishingboats homeward bound creasing the watered silk of the channel hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours or perhaps it is a simple dwellinghouse that stands alone ugly if anything timidseeming but full of romance hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment that land which knows not truth he continued with machiavellian subtlety that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy and is certainly not what i should choose or recommend for my young friend here who is already so much inclined to melancholy for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed believe me he went on with emphasis the waters of that bay—more breton than norman—may exert a sedative influence though even that is of questionable value upon a heart which like mine is no longer unbroken a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate but at your age my boy those waters are contraindicated good night to you neighbours he added moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed and then turning towards us with a physicianly finger raised in warning he resumed the consultation no balbec before you are fifty he called out to me and even then it must depend on the state of the heart

   my father spoke to him of it again as often as we met him and tortured him with questions but it was labour in vain like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative—but an honourable occupation m legrandin had we insisted further would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics and a celestial geography of lower normandy sooner than admit to us that within a mile of balbec his own sister was living in her own house sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain—as from his knowledge of my grandmothers character he really ought to have been certain—that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it

     

   we used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt léonie a visit before dinner in the first weeks of our combray holidays when the days ended early we would still be able to see as we turned into the rue du saintesprit a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the calvary which was mirrored further on in the pond a fiery glow which accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which at that very moment was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me in place of the poetic pleasure i had found in my walk with the sensual pleasures of good feeding warmth and rest but in summer when we came back to the house the sun would not have set and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt léonie its rays sinking until they touched and lay along her windowsill would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall and split and scattered and filtered and then at last would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chestofdrawers illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate slanting shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees but on some days though very rarely the chestofdrawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments there would no longer as we turned into the rue du saintesprit be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of windowpanes the pond beneath the calvary would have lost its fiery glow sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor while a long ribbon of moonlight bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the waters surface would be lying across it from end to end then as we drew near the house we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep and mamma would say to me good heavens there is françoise looking out for us your aunt must be anxious that means we are late

   and without wasting time by stopping to take off our things we would fly upstairs to my aunt léonies room to reassure her to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false that on the contrary nothing had happened to us but that we had gone the guermantes way and good lord when one took that walk my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home

   there françoise my aunt would say didnt i tell you that they must have gone the guermantes way good gracious they must be hungry and your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now after all the hours its been waiting what a time to come in well and so you went the guermantes way

   but leonie i supposed you knew mamma would answer i thought that françoise had seen us go out by the little gate through the kitchengarden

   for there were in the environs of combray two ways which we used to take for our walks and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door according to the way we had chosen the way towards méségliselavineuse which we called also swanns way because to get there one had to pass along the boundary of m swanns estate and the guermantes way of méségliselavineuse to tell the truth i never knew anything more than the way there and the strange people who would come over on sundays to take the air in combray people whom this time neither my aunt nor any of us would know at all and whom we would therefore assume to be people who must have come over from méséglise as for guermantes i was to know it well enough one day but that day had still to come and during the whole of my boyhood if méséglise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon which remained hidden from sight however far one went by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round combray guermantes on the other hand meant no more than the ultimate goal ideal rather than real of the guermantes way a sort of abstract geographical term like the north pole or the equator and so to take the guermantes way in order to get to méséglise or vice versa would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west since my father used always to speak of the méséglise way as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere and of the guermantes way as typical of river scenery i had invested each of them by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities with that cohesion that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing which exhibited the special excellence of the whole while immediately beside them in the first stages of our walk before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other the purely material roads at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre but above all i set between them far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which i used to think of them one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen which separate things irremediably from one another keeping them for ever upon different planes and this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day or in the course of the same walk but the méséglise way one time and the guermantes way another shut them up so to speak far apart and unaware of each others existence in the sealed vessels—between which there could be no communication—of separate afternoons

   when we had decided to go the méséglise way we would start without undue haste and even if the sky were clouded over since the walk was not very long and did not take us too far from home as though we were not going anywhere in particular by the frontdoor of my aunts house which opened on to the rue du saintesprit we would be greeted by the gunsmith we would drop our letters into the box we would tell théodore from françoise as we passed that she had run out of oil or coffee and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of m swanns park before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilactrees come out to welcome strangers out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom which glowed even in the shade with the sunlight in which they had been bathed some of them halfconcealed by the little tiled house called the archers lodge in which swanns keeper lived overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret the nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris who retained in this french garden the pure and vivid colouring of a persian miniature despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads we would pass them by without stopping for my parents had ceased to visit tansonville since swanns marriage and so as not to appear to be looking into his park we would instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields choose another way which led in the same direction but circuitously and brought us out rather too far from home

   one day my grandfather said to my father dont you remember swanns telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in paris we might go along by the park since the ladies are not at home that will make it a little shorter

   we stopped for a moment by the fence lilactime was nearly over some of the trees still thrust aloft in tall purple chandeliers their tiny balls of blossom but in many places among their foliage where only a week before they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured a hollow scum dry and scentless my grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old m swann on the day of his wifes death and he seized the opportunity to tell us once again the story of that walk

   in front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house but to our right the park stretched away into the distance on level ground overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it an ornamental water had been constructed by swanns parents but even in his most artificial creations nature is the material upon which man has to work certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty and will raise their immemorial standards among all the laidout scenery of a park just as they would have done far from any human interference in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position and superimposing itself upon the work of mans hands and so it was that at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake there might be seen in its two tiers woven of trailing forgetmenots below and of periwinkle flowers above the natural delicate blue garland which binds the luminous shadowed brows of waternymphs while the iris its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion stretched out over agrimony and watergrowing kingcups the lilied sceptres tattered glories of yellow and purple of the kingdom of the lake

   the absence of mlle swann which—since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals—made the exploration of tansonville now for the first time permitted me a matter of indifference to myself seemed however to invest the property in my grandfathers and fathers eyes with a fresh and transient charm and like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction i should have liked to see their reckoning proved false to see by a miracle mlle swann appear with her father so close to us that we should not have time to escape and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance and so when i suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water i made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction away from this sign that she might after all be in residence still as swann had told us that he ought not really to go away just then as he had some people staying in the house the line might equally belong to one of these guests not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths somewhere in one of the tall trees making a stage in its height an invisible bird desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter was exploring with a long continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side but it received at once so unanimous an answer so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that one would have said it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly the sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions and even the slumbering water whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface while it dreamed no doubt of some imaginary maelstrom intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament now almost vertical it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight and i had begun to ask myself whether setting aside the longing and the terror that i had of making her acquaintance it was not actually my duty to warn mlle swann that the fish was biting—when i was obliged to run after my father and grandfather who were calling me and were surprised that i had not followed them along the little path climbing up hill towards the open fields into which they had already turned i found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthornblossom the hedge resembled a series of chapels whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars while underneath the sun cast a square of light upon the ground as though it had shone in upon them through a window the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich and as circumscribed in its range as though i had been standing before the ladyaltar and the flowers themselves adorned also held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention fine radiating nerves in the flamboyant style of architecture like those which in church framed the stair to the roodloft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows but here spread out into pools of fleshy white like strawberrybeds in spring how simple and rustic in comparison with these would seem the dogroses which in a few weeks time would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind

   but it was in vain that i lingered before the hawthorns to breathe in to marshal before my mind which knew not what to make of it to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the lightheartedness of youth and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm in an inexhaustible profusion but without letting me delve into it any more deeply like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret i turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength my eyes followed up the slope which outside the hedge rose steeply to the fields a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself infrequent still spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang made my heart beat as does a wayfarers when he perceives upon some lowlying ground an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy and cries out although he has not yet caught sight of it the sea

   and then i returned to my hawthorns and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which one imagines one will be better able to take in when one has looked away for a moment at something else but in vain did i shape my fingers into a frame so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague struggling and failing to free itself to float across and become one with the flowers they themselves offered me no enlightenment and i could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing and then inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know or better still when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra my grandfather called me to him and pointing to the hedge of tansonville said you are fond of hawthorns just look at this pink one isnt it pretty

   and it was indeed a hawthorn but one whose flowers were pink and lovelier even than the white it too was in holiday attire for one of those days which are the only true holidays the holy days of religion because they are not appointed by any capricious accident as secular holidays are appointed upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances which have nothing about them that is essentially festal—but it was attired even more richly than the rest for the flowers which clung to its branches one above another so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess were every one of them in colour and consequently of a superior quality by the aesthetic standards of combray to the plain if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the stores in the square or at camuss where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink and for my own part i set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink when i had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries and these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing or of some exquisite addition to ones costume for a great festival which colours inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints even after the childs mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite and have not been selected by the dressmaker and indeed i had felt at once as i had felt before the white blossom but now still more marvelling that it was in no artificial manner by no device of human construction that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed but that it was nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession by burying the bush in these little rosettes almost too ravishing in colour this rustic pompadour high up on the branches like so many of those tiny rosetrees their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals a thousand buds were swelling and opening paler in colour but each disclosing as it burst as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble its bloodred stain and suggesting even more strongly than the fullblown flowers the special irresistible quality of the hawthorntree which wherever it budded wherever it was about to blossom could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone taking its place in the hedge but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes who are staying at home equipped and ready for the month of mary of which it seemed already to form a part it shone and smiled in its cool rosy garments a catholic bush indeed and altogether delightful

   the hedge allowed us a glimpse inside the park of an alley bordered with jasmine pansies and verbenas among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old spanish leather while on the gravelpath a long wateringpipe painted green coiling across the ground poured where its holes were over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal rainbowcoloured drops suddenly i stood still unable to move as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being a little girl with fair reddish hair who appeared to be returning from a walk and held a trowel in her hand was looking at us raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles her black eyes gleamed and as i did not at that time know and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression since i had not as they say enough power of observation to isolate the sense of their colour for a long time afterwards whenever i thought of her the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure since her complexion was fair so much so that perhaps if her eyes had not been quite so black—which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her—i should not have been as i was especially enamoured of their imagined blue

   i gazed at her at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out petrified and anxious that gaze which would fain reach touch capture bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed and the soul with the body then so frightened was i lest at any moment my grandfather and father catching sight of the girl might tear me away from her by making me run on in front of them with another an unconsciously appealing look whose object was to force her to pay attention to me to see to know me she cast a glance forwards and sideways so as to take stock of my grandfather and father and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision and while they continuing to walk on without noticing her had overtaken and passed me she allowed her eyes to wander over the space that lay between us in my direction without any particular expression without appearing to have seen me but with an intensity a halfhidden smile which i was unable to interpret according to the instruction i had received in the ways of good breeding save as a mark of infinite disgust and her hand at the same time sketched in the air an indelicate gesture for which when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know the little dictionary of manners which i carried in my mind supplied only one meaning namely a deliberate insult

   gilberte come along what are you doing called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white whom i had not seen until that moment while a little way beyond her a gentleman in a suit of linen ducks whom i did not know either stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head the little girls smile abruptly faded and seizing her trowel she made off without turning to look again in my direction with an air of obedience inscrutable and sly

   and so was wafted to my ears the name of gilberte bestowed on me like a talisman which might perhaps enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality whereas a moment earlier she had been only something vaguely seen so it came to me uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green wateringpipe impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed which it set apart and isolated from all other air with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn which opened at the height of my shoulder the quintessence of their familiarity—so exquisitely painful to myself—with her and with all that unknown world of her existence into which i should never penetrate

   for a moment while we moved away and my grandfather murmured poor swann what a life they are leading him fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her charlus—for that was charlus i recognised him at once and the child too at her age to be mixed up in all that the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which gilbertes mother had spoken to her without her replying by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else as not being indeed superior to the whole world calmed my sufferings somewhat revived some hope in me and cooled the ardour of my love but very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to gilbertes level or to draw her down to its own i loved her i was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her to do her some injury to force her to keep some memory of me i knew her to be so beautiful that i should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout i think you are hideous grotesque you are utterly disgusting however i walked away carrying with me then and for ever afterwards as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress the picture of a little girl with reddish hair and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks who held a trowel in her hand and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare and already the charm with which her name like a cloud of incense had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and i had together heard its sound was beginning to conquer to cover to embalm to beautify everything with which it had any association her grandparents whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know the glorious profession of a stockholder even the melancholy neighbourhood of the champselysées where she lived in paris

   léonie said my grandfather on our return i wish we had had you with us this afternoon you would never have known tansonville if i had had the courage i would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much and so my grandfather told her the story of our walk either just to amuse her or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors for in earlier days she had been very fond of tansonville and moreover swanns visits had been the last that she had continued to receive at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world and just as when he called in these later days to inquire for her and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting but that she would be happy to see him another time so this evening she said to my grandfather yes some day when the weather is fine i shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park and in saying this she was quite sincere she would have liked to see swann and tansonville again but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic she would rise and put on her clothes but before she had reached the outer room she would be tired again and would insist on returning to her bed the process which had begun in her—and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us—was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death the chrysalis stage of life which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy who after a certain year cease to make the necessary journey or even to cross the street to see one another cease to correspond and know well that they will communicate no more in this world my aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see swann again that she would never leave her own house any more but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which to our minds ought to have made it more unbearable namely that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily which by making every action every movement tiring to her if not actually painful gave to inaction isolation and silence the blessed strengthening and refreshing charm of repose

   my aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge but at all hours of the day i would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go whether she used not at one time to go often to tansonville trying to make them speak of mile swanns parents and grandparents who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods the name which had for me become almost mythological of swann—when i talked with my family i would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it i dared not pronounce it myself but i would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to gilberte and her family in which she was involved in speaking of which i would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company and i would suddenly force my father by pretending for instance to believe that my grandfathers business had been in our family before his day or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt léonie wished to visit was on common ground to correct my statements to say as though in opposition to me and of his own accord no no the business belonged to swanns father that hedge is part of swanns park and then i would be obliged to pause for breath so stifling was the pressure upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed of that name which at the moment when i heard it seemed to me fuller more portentous than any other name because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which i had secretly uttered it in my mind it caused me a pleasure which i was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort and with no recompense since for them there was no pleasure in the sound and so i would prudently turn the conversation and by a scruple of conscience also all the singular seductions which i had stored up in the sound of that word swann i found again as soon as it was uttered and then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions that they must find themselves sharing my point of view that they perceived in their turn that they condoned that they even embraced my visionary longings and i was as wretched as though i had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts

   that year my family fixed the day of their return to paris rather earlier than usual on the morning of our departure i had had my hair curled to be ready to face the photographer had had a new hat carefully set upon my head and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket a little later my mother after searching everywhere for me found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to tansonville bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns clasping their sharp branches to my bosom and like a princess in a tragedy oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had in curling those ringlets been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead trampling underfoot the curlpapers which i had torn from my head and my new hat with them my mother was not at all moved by my tears but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket i did not however hear her oh my poor little hawthorns i was assuring them through my sobs it is not you that want to make me unhappy to force me to leave you you you have never done me any harm so i shall always love you and drying my eyes i promised them that when i grew up i would never copy the foolish example of other men but that even in paris on fine spring days instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk i would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorntrees in bloom

   once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our méséglise walk they were perpetually crossed as though by invisible streams of traffic by the wind which was to me the tutelary genius of combray every year on the day of our arrival in order to feel that i really was at combray i would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing and setting me running in its wake one always had the wind for companion when one went the méséglise way on that swelling plain which stretched mile beyond mile without any disturbance of its gentle contour i knew that mlle swann used often to go and spend a few days at laon and for all that it was many miles away the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle when on hot afternoons i would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse and finally settling down warm and rustling among the clover and sainfoin at my feet that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together to unite us i would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me without my being able to understand it and i would catch and kiss it as it passed on my left was a village called champieu campus pagani according to the curé on my right i could see across the cornfields the two crocketed rustic spires of saintandrédeschamps themselves as tapering scaly plated honeycombed yellowed and roughened as two ears of wheat

   at regular intervals among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves which can be mistaken for those of no other fruittree the appletrees were exposing their broad petals of white satin or hanging in shy bunches their unopened blushing buds it was while going the méséglise way that i first noticed the circular shadow which appletrees cast upon the sunlit ground and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves and which i would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path

   sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud furtive without display suggesting an actress who does not have to come on for a while and so goes in front in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment but keeps in the background not wishing to attract attention to herself i was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings though these works of art were very different—at least in my earlier years before bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies—from those in which the moon seems fair to me today but in which i should not have recognised her then it might be for instance some novel by saintine some landscape by gleyre in which she is cut out sharply against the sky in the form of a silver sickle some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were at that date my own impressions and which it enraged my grandmothers sisters to see me admire they held that one ought to set before children and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature no doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in ones heart

   it was along the méséglise way at montjouvain a house built on the edge of a large pond and overlooked by a steep shrubgrown hill that m vinteuil lived and so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road after a certain year we never saw her alone but always accompanied by a friend a girl older than herself with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood who in the end installed herself permanently one day at montjouvain people said that poor m vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about and to let his daughter—a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense—bring a woman like that to live under his roof he says that she is a most superior woman with a heart of gold and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained he may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter but m vinteuil assured them that it was and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse bodily passion which has been so unjustly decried compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders dr percepied whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his hearts content the part of doubledealer a part to which he was not otherwise adapted without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kindhearted old curmudgeon could make the curé and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice what dye say to this now it seems that she plays music with her friend mile vinteuil that surprises you does it oh i know nothing nothing at all it was papa vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday after all she has every right to be fond of music that girl i should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child nor vinteuil either it seems and then he plays music too with his daughters friend why gracious heavens it must be a regular musical box that house out there what are you laughing at i say theyve been playing too much music those people i met papa vinteuil the other day by the cemetery it was all he could do to keep on his feet

   anyone who like ourselves had seen m vinteuil about this time avoiding people whom he knew and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them changed in a few months into an old man engulfed in a sea of sorrows incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughters happiness spending whole days beside his wifes grave could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about he knew perhaps he even believed what his neighbours were saying there is probably no one however rigid his virtue who is not liable to find himself by the complexity of circumstances living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence so as to wound him and to make him suffer the odd words the unaccountable attitude one evening of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving but for a man of m vinteuils sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in bohemian circles only for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which nature herself has planted in the soul of a child perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother as she might blend the colours of their eyes and yet however much m vinteuil may have known of his daughters conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less the facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished as it was not they that engendered those beliefs so they are powerless to destroy them they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming one after another without interruption into the bosom of a family will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its god or the capacity of its physician but when m vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world and of their reputation when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours then he was bound to give judgment to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed he saw himself and her in low in the very lowest water inextricably stranded and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up however far beneath him they might hitherto have been that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune

   one day when we were walking with swann in one of the streets of combray m vinteuil turning out of another street found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape and swann with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices finds in anothers shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the selfesteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed conversed at great length with m vinteuil with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms and invited him before leaving us to send his daughter over one day to play at tansonville it was an invitation which two years earlier would have enraged m vinteuil but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting swanns friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it so as to have the wholly platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve

   what a charming man he said to us after swann had gone with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess even though she be ugly and a fool what a charming man what a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage

   and then so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men who cast off while they are talking to anyone the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there my family joined with m vinteuil in deploring swanns marriage invoking principles and conventions which all the more because they invoked them in common with him as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at montjouvain m vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit swann an omission which swann was the first to regret for constantly after meeting m vinteuil he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself one of his relatives swann supposed and on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when m vinteuil should appear with his daughter at tansonville

   since the méséglise way was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round combray and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather it followed that the climate of méséglise shewed an unduly high rainfall and we would never lose sight of the fringe of roussainville wood so that we could at any moment run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves

   often the sun would disappear behind a cloud which impinged on its roundness but whose edge the sun gilded in return the brightness though not the light of day would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended while the little village of roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables with a startling precision of detail a gust of wind blew from its perch a rook which floated away and settled in the distance while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses

   but on other days would begin to fall the rain of which we had had due warning from the little barometerfigure which the spectaclemaker hung out in his doorway its drops like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment would come down out of the sky in close marching order they would never drift apart would make no movement at random in their rapid course but each one keeping in its place would draw after it the drop which was following and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south we would take refuge among the trees and when it seemed that their flight was accomplished a few last drops feebler and slower than the rest would still come down but we would emerge from our shelter for the rain was playing a game now among the branches and even when it was almost dry again underfoot a stray drop or two lingering in the hollow of a leaf would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree

   often too we would hurry for shelter tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs into the porch of saintandrédeschamps how typically french that church was over its door the saints the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of françoise the sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of aristotle and virgil precisely as françoise in her kitchen would break into speech about saint louis as though she herself had known him generally in order to depreciate by contrast with him my grandparents whom she considered less righteous one could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century had of classical and of early christian history ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity were derived not from books but from a tradition at once ancient and direct unbroken oral degraded unrecognisable and alive another combray person whom i could discern also potential and typified in the gothic sculptures of saintandrédeschamps was young théodore the assistant in camuss shop and indeed françoise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary for when my aunt was too ill for françoise to be able unaided to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair rather than let the kitchenmaid come upstairs and perhaps make an impression on my aunt she would send out for théodore and this lad who was regarded and quite rightly in the town as a bad character was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of saintandrédeschamps and particularly in the feelings of respect due in françoise eyes to all poor invalids and above all to her own poor mistress that he had when he bent down to raise my aunts head from her pillow the same air of préraphaélite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the basreliefs wear who throng with tapers in their hands about the deathbed of our lady as though those carved faces of stone naked and grey like trees in winter were like them asleep only storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces reverend and cunning as the face of théodore and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples

   there too not fastened to the wall like the little angels but detached from the porch of more than human stature erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground stood a saint with the full cheeks the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag the narrow forehead short and stubborn nose deepset eyes and strong thickskinned courageous expression of the countrywomen of those parts this similarity which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that i had not looked to find in it was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields come like ourselves for shelter beneath the porch whose presence there—as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone—seemed intended by fate to allow us by confronting it with its type in nature to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art before our eyes in the distance a promised or an accursed land roussainville within whose walls i had never penetrated roussainville was now when the rain had ceased for us still being chastised like a village in the old testament by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants or else had already received the forgiveness of the almighty who had restored to it the light of his sun which fell upon it in rays of uneven length like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar

   sometimes when the weather had completely broken we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors here and there in the distance in a landscape which what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere resembled a seascape rather a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor all night upon the sea but what mattered rain or storm in summer bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial illtemper expressed by the permanent underlying fine weather a very different thing from the fluid and unstable fine weather of winter its very opposite in fact for has it not firmly established in the soil on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness hoisted to keep them flying throughout the season in the village streets on the walls of the houses and in their gardens its silken banners violet and white sitting in the little parlour where i would pass the time until dinner with a book i might hear the water dripping from our chestnuttrees but i would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick crumpled leaves and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there like pledges of summer all through the rainy night to assure me of the fine weathers continuing it might rain as it pleased but tomorrow over the white fence of tansonville there would surge and flow numerous as ever a sea of little heartshaped leaves and without the least anxiety i could watch the poplar in the rue des perchamps praying for mercy bowing in desperation before the storm without the least anxiety i could hear at the far end of the garden the last peals of thunder growling among our lilactrees

   if the weather was bad all morning my family would abandon the idea of a walk and i would remain at home but later on i formed the habit of going out by myself on such days and walking towards méségliselavineuse during that autumn when we had to come to combray to settle the division of my aunt léonies estate for she had died at last leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise—those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her and equally those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary but organic by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced once she had succumbed to it causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors but to that one a grief savage in its violence during the long fortnight of my aunts last illness françoise never went out of her room for an instant never took off her clothes allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave then at last we understood that the sort of terror in which françoise had lived of my aunts harsh words her suspicions and her anger had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred and which was really veneration and love her true mistress whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage her sovereign her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more compared with such a mistress we counted for very little the time had long passed when on our first coming to spend our holidays at combray we had been of equal importance in françoise eyes with my aunt

   during that autumn my parents finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through and discussions with solicitors and farmers that they had little time for walks which as it happened the weather made precarious began to let me go without them along the méséglise way wrapped up in a huge highland plaid which protected me from the rain and which i was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because i felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised françoise whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of ones clothes had nothing whatever to do with ones mourning for the dead and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunts death was wholly unsatisfactory since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her while i at times might be heard humming a tune i am sure that in a book—and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of françoise—such a conception of mourning in the manner of the chanson de roland and of the porch of saintandrédeschamps would have seemed most attractive but the moment that françoise herself approached some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry and i would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that i regretted my aunts death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities but not in the least because she was my aunt that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moments sorrow statements which in a book would have struck me as merely fatuous

   and if françoise then inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement grief and family memories were to plead her inability to rebut my theories saying i dont know how to espress myself—i would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of dr percepied and if she went on all the same she was a geological relation there is always the respect due to your geology i would shrug my shoulders and say it is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language adopting to deliver judgment on françoise the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life

   my walks that autumn were all the more delightful because i used to take them after long hours spent over a book when i was tired of reading after a whole morning in the house i would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out my body which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy was now obliged like a spinningtop wound and let go to spend this in every direction the walls of houses the tansonville hedge the trees of roussainville wood the bushes against which montjouvain leaned its back all must bear the blows of my walkingstick or umbrella must hear my shouts of happiness blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me and which not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet and so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted when i attempt to reckon up all that i owe to the méséglise way all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause i am reminded that it was in that same autumn on one of those walks near the bushy precipice which guarded montjouvain from the rear that i was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression after an hour of rain and wind against which i had put up a brisk fight as i came to the edge of the montjouvain pond and reached a little hut roofed with tiles in which m vinteuils gardener kept his tools the sun shone out again and its golden rays washed clean by the shower blazed once more in the sky on the trees on the wall of the hut and on the still wet tiles of the roof which had a chicken perching upon its ridge the wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall and the chickens downy feathers both of which things let themselves float upon the winds breath to their full extent with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter the tiled roof cast upon the pond whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight a square of pink marble the like of which i had never observed before and seeing upon the water where it reflected the wall a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky i cried aloud in my enthusiasm brandishing my furled umbrella damn damn damn damn but at the same time i felt that i was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment

   and it was at that moment too—thanks to a peasant who went past apparently in a bad enough humour already but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face and who replied without any cordiality to my fine day what good to be out walking—that i learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously by a preestablished order later on i discovered that whenever i had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation the friend to whom i would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed and if i had been thinking with affection of my parents and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that i had already forgotten and would begin to scold me severely just as i flung myself upon them with a kiss

   sometimes to the exhilaration which i derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling so that i could not be clear in my mind to which i should give the casting vote a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasantgirl whom i might clasp in my arms coming abruptly and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts i found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment in the pink reflection of the tiled roof the wild grass in the wall the village of roussainville into which i had long desired to penetrate the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because i thought it was they that had provoked it and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent unknown and propitious breeze but if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature they in their turn enlarged what i might in the womans charm have found too much restricted it seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also and that as for the spirit of those horizons of the village of roussainville of the books which i was reading that year it was her kiss which would make me master of them all and my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination my desire had no longer any bounds moreover—just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature the normal actions of the mind being suspended and our abstract ideas of things set on one side we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be—the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of woman but a necessary and natural product of the soil for at that time everything which was not myself the earth and the creatures upon it seemed to me more precious more important endowed with a more real existence than they appear to fullgrown men and between the earth and its creatures i made no distinction i had a desire for a peasantgirl from méséglise or roussainville for a fishergirl from balbec just as i had a desire for balbec and méséglise the pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine i should have had no faith in it any longer if i had been at liberty to modify its conditions as i chose to meet in paris a fishergirl from balbec or a peasantgirl from méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which i had never seen upon the beach or of a fern which i had never found among the woods would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her but to wander thus among the woods of roussainville without a peasantgirl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure their deephidden beauty that girl whom i never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves was to me herself a plant of local growth only taller than the rest and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung i could believe this all the more readily and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind yielding a pleasure which i could never derive from any but herself since i was still and must for long remain in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same indeed that pleasure does not exist isolated and formulated in the consciousness as the ultimate object with which one seeks a womans company or as the cause of the uneasiness which in anticipation one then feels hardly even does one think of oneself but only how to escape from oneself obscurely awaited immanent and concealed it rouses to such a paroxysm at the moment when at last it makes itself felt those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance in the kiss of her who is by our side that it seems to us more than anything else a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves which we measure by the benefits by the happiness that she showers upon us

   alas it was in vain that i implored the dungeonkeep of roussainville that i begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom i had disclosed my earliest desire when from the top floor of our house at combray from the little room that smelt of orrisroot i had peered out and seen nothing but its tower framed in the square of the halfopened window while with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of selfdestruction faint with emotion i explored across the bounds of my own experience an untrodden path which i believed might lead me to my death even—until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which creeping in through the window tumbled all about my body in vain i called upon it now in vain i compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature i might go alone as far as the porch of saintandrédeschamps never did i find there the girl whom i should inevitably have met had i been with my grandfather and so unable to engage her in conversation i would fix my eyes without limit of time upon the trunk of a distant tree from behind which she must appear and spring towards me my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before night was falling without any hope now would i concentrate my attention as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal upon that sterile soil that stale and outworn land and it was no longer in lightness of heart but with sullen anger that i aimed blows at the trees of roussainville wood from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama when unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman i so greatly desired i was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards combray and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment and if she had appeared would i have dared to speak to her i felt that she would have regarded me as mad for i no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks but were never realized as being shared by others or as having any existence apart from myself they seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective impotent illusory creatures of my temperament they were in no way connected now with nature with the world of real things which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time

   and it is perhaps from another impression which i received at montjouvain some years later an impression which at that time was without meaning that there arose long afterwards my idea of that cruel side of human passion called sadism we shall see in due course that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life it was during a spell of very hot weather my parents who had been obliged to go away for the whole day had told me that i might stay out as late as i pleased and having gone as far as the montjouvain pond where i enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut i had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house just where i had waited for my parents years before one day when they had gone to call on m vinteuil it was almost dark when i awoke and i wished to rise and go away but i saw mile vinteuil or thought at least that i recognised her for i had not seen her often at combray and then only when she was still a child whereas she was now growing into a young woman who probably had just come in standing in front of me and only a few feet away from me in that room in which her father had entertained mine and which she had now made into a little sittingroom for herself the window was partly open the lamp was lighted i could watch her every movement without her being able to see me but had i gone away i must have made a rustling sound among the bushes she would have heard me and might have thought that i had been hiding there in order to spy upon her

   she was in deep mourning for her father had but lately died we had not gone to see her my mother had not cared to go on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence—namely modesty but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart my mother had not forgotten the sad end of m vinteuils life his complete absorption first in having to play both mother and nurserymaid to his daughter and later in the suffering which she had caused him she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old mans face in those terrible last years she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work the poor little pieces we imagined of an old musicmaster a retired village organist which we assumed were of little or no value in themselves though we did not despise them because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter pieces which being mostly not even written down but recorded only in his memory while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper and quite illegible must now remain unknown for ever my mother thought also of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which m vinteuil had been driven that of seeing the girl happily settled with an honest and respectable future when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts old musicmaster she was moved to very real grief and shuddered to think of that other grief so different in its bitterness which mlle vinteuil must now be feeling tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father poor m vinteuil my mother would say he lived for his daughter and now he has died for her without getting his reward will he get it now i wonder and in what form it can only come to him from her

   at the far end of mlle vinteuils sittingroom on the mantelpiece stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph just as long ago m vinteuil had placed beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents and then her friend came in mlle vinteuil greeted her without rising clasping her hands behind her head and drew her body to one side of the sofa as though to make room but no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate she thought that her friend would prefer no doubt to sit down at some distance from her upon a chair she felt that she had been indiscreet her sensitive heart took fright stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa she closed her eyes and began to yawn so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep and that alone which had made her lie down there despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion i could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father presently she rose and came to the window where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding

   leave them open said her friend i am hot

   but its too dreadful people will see us mlle vinteuil answered and then she guessed probably that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words which she seemed indeed to wish to hear spoken but from prudence would let her friend be the first to speak and so although i could not see her face clearly enough i am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful when she hastily went on when i say see us i mean of course see us reading its so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you

   with the instinctive generosity of her nature a courtesy beyond her control she refrained from uttering the studied words which she had felt were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire and perpetually in the depths of her being a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element the old campaigner battered but triumphant would intercede with him and oblige him to retire

   oh yes it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district said her friend with bitter irony and what if they are she went on feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating out of good nature like a lesson prepared beforehand which she knew it would please mlle vinteuil to hear and what if they are all the better that they should see us

   mlle vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet in her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow spontaneously from her lips so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured she reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought but the words which she imagined such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth and what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech while she kept on interrupting herself with youre sure you arent cold you arent too hot you dont want to sit and read by yourself

   your ladyships thoughts seem to be rather warm this evening she concluded doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used on some earlier occasion by her friend

   in the vshaped opening of her crape bodice mlle vinteuil felt the sting of her friends sudden kiss she gave a little scream and ran away and then they began to chase one another about the room scrambling over the furniture their wide sleeves fluttering like wings clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls at last mlle vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend but the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old musicmasters portrait had been arranged mlle vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it and so exclaimed as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time oh theres my fathers picture looking at us i cant think who can have put it there im sure ive told them twenty times that is not the proper place for it

   i remembered the words that m vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music this photograph was of course in common use in their ritual observances was subjected to daily profanation for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response let him stay there he cant trouble us any longer dyou think hed start whining dyou think hed pack you out of the house if he could see you now with the window open the ugly old monkey

   to which mlle vinteuil replied oh please—a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself by a long course of sophistries to keep in close subjection at such moments but rather because it was the bridle which so as to avoid all appearance of egotism she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her it may well have been too that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt but she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus between them inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty in robbing m vinteuil as though they were actually rifling his tomb of the sacred rights of fatherhood her friend took the girls head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for mlle vinteuil as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan

   do you know what i should like to do to that old horror she said taking up the photograph she murmured in mlle vinteuils ear something that i could not distinguish

   oh you would never dare

   not dare to spit on it on that shouted the friend with deliberate brutality

   i heard no more for mlle vinteuil who now seemed weary awkward preoccupied sincere and rather sad came back to the window and drew the shutters close but i knew now what was the reward that m vinteuil in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime on account of his daughter had received from her after his death

   and yet i have since reflected that if m vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene he might still and in spite of everything have continued to believe in his daughters soundness of heart and that he might even in so doing have been not altogether wrong it was true that in all mlle vinteuils actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a sadist it is behind the footlights of a paris theatre and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect it is generally the sadic instinct that is responsible for it it is possible that without being in the least inclined towards sadism a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as mlle vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism so lacking in subtlety the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people and even to herself since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong but appearances apart in mlle vinteuils soul at least in the earlier stages the evil element was probably not unmixed a sadist of her kind is an artist in evil which a wholly wicked person could not be for in that case the evil would not have been external it would have seemed quite natural to her and would not even have been distinguishable from herself and as for virtue respect for the dead filial obedience since she would never have practised the cult of these things she would take no impious delight in their profanation sadists of mlle vinteuils sort are creatures so purely sentimental so virtuous by nature that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad a privilege reserved for the wicked and when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people for themselves and their partners in guilt so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure and i could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when i realised that it was impossible for her to effect it at the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms in thought and speech of the poor old musicmaster indeed his photograph was nothing what she really desecrated what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them was the likeness between her face and his his mothers blue eyes which he had handed down to her like some trinket to be kept in the family those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of mlle vinteuil and herself a phraseology a mentality not designed for vice which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day it was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure that seemed to her attractive it was pleasure rather that seemed evil and as every time that she indulged in it pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as ordinarily had no place in her virtuous mind she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical to identify it with evil perhaps mlle vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances at any rate she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow those smiles those glances all feigned perhaps but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and longsuffering but out of selfindulgence and cruelty she was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which with so unnatural an accomplice a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her fathers memory perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare so abnormal so exotic one which it was so refreshing to visit had she been able to distinguish in herself as in all her fellowmen and women that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which whatever names else be given it is the one true terrible and lasting form of cruelty
                        

   if the méséglise way was so easy it was a very different matter when we took the guermantes way for that meant a long walk and we must make sure first of the weather when we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days when françoise in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the poor crops gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm azure surface groaned aloud and exclaimed you would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts ah they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers and then when the corn is all ripe down it will come rattling all over the place and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea—when my fathers appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession then some one would say at dinner tomorrow if the weather holds we might go the guermantes way and off we would set immediately after luncheon through the little garden gate which dropped us into the rue des perchamps narrow and bent at a sharp angle dotted with grassplots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising a street as quaint as its name from which its odd characteristics and its personality were i felt derived a street for which one might search in vain through the combray of today for the public school now rises upon its site but in my dreams of combray like those architects pupils of violletleduc who fancying that they can detect beneath a renaissance roodloft and an eighteenthcentury altar traces of a norman choir restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century i leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing i pierce through it and restore the rue des perchamps and for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers the pictures which it has preserved—perhaps the last surviving in the world today and soon to follow the rest into oblivion—of what combray looked like in my childhoods days pictures which simply because it was the old combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished are as moving—if i may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me—as those old engravings of the cenacolo or that painting by gentile bellini in which one sees in a state in which they no longer exist the masterpiece of leonardo and the portico of saint marks

   we would pass in the rue de loiseau before the old hostelry of the oiseau flesché into whose great courtyard once upon a time would rumble the coaches of the duchesses de montpensier de guermantes and de montmorency when they had to come down to combray for some litigation with their farmers or to receive homage from them we would come at length to the mall among whose treetops i could distinguish the steeple of sainthilaire and i should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there reading and listening to the bells for it was so charming there and so quiet that when an hour struck you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day but that it relieved the day of its superfluity and that the steeple with the indolent painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do had simply in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight pressed at a given moment the distended surface of the silence

   the great charm of the guermantes way was that we had beside us almost all the time the course of the vivonne we crossed it first ten minutes after leaving the house by a footbridge called the pontvieux and every year when we arrived at combray on easter morning after the sermon if the weather was fine i would run there to see amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever the river flowing past skyblue already between banks still black and bare its only companions a clump of daffodils come out before their time a few primroses the first in flower while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn the pontvieux led to a towpath which at this point would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root at combray where i knew everyone and could always detect the blacksmith or grocers boy through his disguise of a beadles uniform or choristers surplice this fisherman was the only person whom i was never able to identify he must have known my family for he used to raise his hat when we passed and then i would always be just on the point of asking his name when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet or i would frighten the fish we would follow the towpath which ran along the top of a steep bank several feet above the stream the ground on the other side was lower and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railwaystation over these were strewn the remains halfburied in the long grass of the castle of the old counts of combray who during the middle ages had had on this side the course of the vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the lords of guermantes and abbots of martinville nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields hardly visible broken battlements over which in their day the bowmen had hurled down stones the watchmen had gazed out over novepont clairefontaine martinvillelesec bailleaulexempt fiefs all of them of guermantes a ring in which combray was locked but fallen among the grass now levelled with the ground climbed and commanded by boys from the christian brothers school who came there in their playtime or with lessonbooks to be conned emblems of a past that had sunk down and wellnigh vanished under the earth that lay by the waters edge now like an idler taking the air yet giving me strong food for thought making the name of combray connote to me not the little town of today only but an historic city vastly different seizing and holding my imagination by the remote incomprehensible features which it halfconcealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups for the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass standing singly in couples in whole companies yellow as the yolk of eggs and glowing with an added lustre i felt because being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me i would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute unproductive beauty and so it had been from my earliest childhood when from the towpath i had stretched out my arms towards them before even i could pronounce their charming name—a name fit for the prince in some french fairytale colonists perhaps in some far distant century from asia but naturalised now for ever in the village well satisfied with their modest horizon rejoicing in the sunshine and the waters edge faithful to their little glimpse of the railwaystation yet keeping none the less as do some of our old paintings in their plebeian simplicity a poetic scintillation from the golden east

   i would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the vivonne to catch minnows and which filled by the current of the stream in which they themselves also were enclosed at once containers whose transparent sides were like solidified water and contents plunged into a still larger container of liquid flowing crystal suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done standing upon a table laid for dinner by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water in which my hands could not arrest it and the insoluble glass in which my palate could not enjoy it i decided that i would come there again with a line and catch fish i begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket and threw into the vivonne pellets which had the power it seemed to bring about a chemical precipitation for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles which until then it had no doubt been holding in solution invisible but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation

   presently the course of the vivonne became choked with waterplants at first they appeared singly a lily for instance which the current across whose path it had unfortunately grown would never leave at rest for a moment so that like a ferryboat mechanically propelled it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other eternally repeating its double journey thrust towards the bank its stalk would be straightened out lengthened strained almost to breakingpoint until the current again caught it its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its startingpoint since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again i would still find it there on one walk after another always in the same helpless state suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt léonie who present without modification year after year the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off but which they always retain to the end caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange ineluctable fatal daily round such as these was the waterlily and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments repeated indefinitely throughout eternity aroused the curiosity of dante who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves had not virgil striding on ahead obliged him to hasten after him at full speed as i must hasten after my parents

   but farther on the current slackened where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening so that the little ponds into which the vivonne was here diverted were aflower with waterlilies as the banks at this point were thickly wooded the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green although sometimes when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon i have seen in its depths a clear crude blue that was almost violet suggesting a floor of japanese cloisonné here and there on the surface floated blushing like a strawberry the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals

   beyond these the flowers were more frequent but paler less glossy more thickly seeded more tightly folded and disposed by accident in festoons so graceful that i would fancy i saw floating upon the stream as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some watteau festival mossroses in loosened garlands elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily of a neat pink or white like rocketflowers washed clean like porcelain with housewifely care while a little farther again were others pressed close together in a floating gardenbed as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border this skiey border also for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious more moving than their own and both in the afternoon when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent restless and alert and towards evening when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves with the utmost profundity evanescence and mystery—with a quiet suggestion of infinity afternoon or evening it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky

   after leaving this park the vivonne began to flow again more swiftly how often have i watched and longed to imitate when i should be free to live as i chose a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back his head down in the bottom of his boat letting it drift with the current seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace

   we would sit down among the irises at the waters edge in the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length now and then crushed by the burden of idleness a carp would heave up out of the water with an anxious gasp it was time for us to feed before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there eating fruit and bread and chocolate on the grass over which came to our ears horizontal faint but solid still and metallic the sound of the bells of sainthilaire which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse but broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet

   sometimes at the waters edge and embedded in trees we would come upon a house of the kind called pleasure houses isolated and lost seeing nothing of the world save the river which bathed its feet a young woman whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin and who had doubtless come there in the popular phrase to bury herself to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held but had been unable to keep were unknown there stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door she raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard through the trees that lined the bank the voices of passersby of whom before they came in sight she might be certain that never had they known nor would they know the faithless lover that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive one felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved for others where he had never trod and i watched her as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious useless charm

   never in the course of our walks along the guermantes way might we penetrate as far as the source of the vivonne of which i had often thought which had in my mind so abstract so ideal an existence that i had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department and at a given number of miles from combray as i had been on the day when i had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earths surface where according to the ancients opened the jaws of hell nor could we ever reach that other goal to which i longed so much to attain guermantes itself i knew that it was the residence of its proprietors the duc and duchesse de guermantes i knew that they were real personages who did actually exist but whenever i thought about them i pictured them to myself either in tapestry as was the coronation of esther which hung in our church or else in changing rainbow colours as was gilbert the bad in his window where he passed from cabbage green when i was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup to plum blue when i had reached our row of chairs or again altogether impalpable like the image of geneviève de brabant ancestress of the guermantes family which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling—in short always wrapped in the mystery of the merovingian age and bathed as in a sunset in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable antes and if in spite of that they were for me in their capacity as a duke and a duchess real people though of an unfamiliar kind this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended immaterialised so as to encircle and contain that guermantes of which they were duke and duchess all that sunlit guermantes way of our walks the course of the vivonne its waterlilies and its overshadowing trees and an endless series of hot summer afternoons and i knew that they bore not only the titles of duc and duchesse de guermantes but that since the fourteenth century when after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle they had allied themselves by marriage and so became counts of combray the first citizens consequently of the place and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it—comtes de combray possessing combray threading it on their string of names and titles absorbing it in their personalities and illustrating no doubt in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to combray proprietors of the town though not of any particular house there dwelling presumably out of doors in the street between heaven and earth like that gilbert de guermantes of whom i could see in the stained glass of the apse of sainthilaire only the other side in dull black lacquer if i raised my eyes to look for him when i was going to camuss for a packet of salt

   and then it happened that going the guermantes way i passed occasionally by a row of wellwatered little gardens over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom i would stop before them hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience for i seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which i had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors and it was with that storybook land with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses that guermantes changing its form in my mind became identified after i heard dr percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park i used to dream that mme de guermantes taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself invited me there that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side and when evening came holding my hand in her own as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls and would teach me all their names she would make me tell her too all about the poems that i meant to compose and these dreams reminded me that since i wished some day to become a writer it was high time to decide what sort of books i was going to write but as soon as i asked myself the question and tried to discover some subjects to which i could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value my mind would stop like a clock i would see before me vacuity nothing would feel either that i was wholly devoid of talent or that perhaps a malady of the brain was hindering its development sometimes i would depend upon my fathers arranging everything for me he was so powerful in such favour with the people who really counted that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which françoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house alone among all the houses in that part of paris or when he obtained permission from the minister for mme sazerats son who had been ordered to some wateringplace to take his degree two months before the proper time among the candidates whose surnames began with a instead of having to wait his turn as an s if i had fallen seriously ill if i had been captured by brigands convinced that my fathers understanding with the supreme powers was too complete that his letters of introduction to the almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions in which there was no danger actually threatening me i should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health perhaps this want of talent this black cavity which gaped in my mind when i ransacked it for the theme of my future writings was itself no more either than an unsubstantial illusion and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father who would arrange with the government and with providence that i should be the first writer of my day but at other times while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them my actual life instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father and one which he could modify as he chose appeared on the contrary to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit from whose judgments there was no appeal in the heart of which i was bound helpless without friend or ally and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed it was evident to me then that i existed in the same manner as all other men that i must grow old that i must die like them and that among them i was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing and so utterly despondent i renounced literature for ever despite the encouragements that had been given me by bloch this intimate spontaneous feeling this sense of the nullity of my intellect prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me as a wicked man when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience

   one day my mother said you are always talking about mme de guermantes well dr percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill four years ago and so she is coming to combray for his daughters wedding you will be able to see her in church it was from dr percepied as it happened that i had heard most about mme de guermantes and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the princesse de léon

   suddenly during the nuptial mass the beadle by moving to one side enabled me to see sitting in a chapel a lady with fair hair and a large nose piercing blue eyes a billowy scarf of mauve silk glossy and new and brilliant and a little spot at the corner of her nose and because on the surface of her face which was red as though she had been very warm i could make out diluted and barely perceptible details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me because more especially the particular features which i remarked in this lady if i attempted to catalogue them formulated themselves in precisely the same terms—a large nose blue eyes as dr percepied had used when describing in my presence the duchesse de guermantes i said to myself this lady is like the duchesse de guermantes now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of gilbert the bad beneath its flat tombstones yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb rested the bones of the old counts of brabant and i remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the guermantes family whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at combray there was indeed but one woman resembling the portrait of mme de guermantes who on that day the very day on which she was expected to come there could be sitting in that chapel it was she my disappointment was immense it arose from my not having borne in mind when i thought of mme de guermantes that i was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window as living in another century as being of another substance than the rest of the human race never had i taken into account that she might have a red face a mauve scarf like mme sazerat and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom i had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind though it was immediately banished that this lady in her creative principle in the molecules of her physical composition was perhaps not substantially the duchesse de guermantes but that her body in ignorance of the name that people had given it belonged to a certain type of femininity which included also the wives of doctors and tradesmen it is it must be mme de guermantes and no one else were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which i was gazing upon this image which naturally enough bore no resemblance to those that had so often under the same title of mme de guermantes appeared to me in dreams since this one had not been like the others formed arbitrarily by myself but had sprung into sight for the first time only a moment ago here in church an image which was not of the same nature was not colourable at will like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable but which was so real that everything even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy a quivering of her tiny finger indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes whereas we were uncertain till then whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern

   meanwhile i was endeavouring to apply to this image which the prominent nose the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision perhaps because it was they that had first struck it that had made the first impression on its surface before i had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be mme de guermantes to this fresh and unchanging image the idea it is mme de guermantes but i succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image as though they were two discs moving in separate planes with a space between but this mme de guermantes of whom i had so often dreamed now that i could see that she had a real existence independent of myself acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination which paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected began to react and to say within me great and glorious before the days of charlemagne the guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals the duchesse de guermantes descends from geneviève de brabant she does not know nor would she consent to know any of the people who are here today

   and then—oh marvellous independence of the human gaze tied to the human face by a cord so loose so long so elastic that it can stray alone as far as it may choose—while mme de guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors her gaze lingered here and wandered there rose to the capitals of the pillars and even rested upon myself like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave but a ray of sunlight which at the moment when i received its caress appeared conscious of where it fell as for mme de guermantes herself since she remained there motionless sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who in the course of their play are speaking to people whom she does not know it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart

   i felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before i had been able to look long enough upon her reminding myself that for years past i had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired and i kept my eyes fixed on her as though by gazing at her i should be able to carry away and incorporate to store up for later reference in myself the memory of that prominent nose those red cheeks of all those details which struck me as so much precious authentic unparalleled information with regard to her face and now that whenever i brought my mind to bear upon that face—and especially perhaps in my determination that form of the instinct of selfpreservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves not to admit that i had been in any way deceived—i found only beauty there setting her once again since they were one and the same person this lady who sat before me and that duchesse de guermantes whom until then i had been used to conjure into an imagined shape apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight pure and simple of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her i grew indignant when i heard people saying in the congregation round me she is better looking than mme sazerat or than mlle vinteuil as though she had been in any way comparable with them and my gaze resting upon her fair hair her blue eyes the lines of her neck and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women i cried out within myself as i admired this deliberately unfinished sketch how lovely she is what true nobility it is indeed a proud guermantes the descendant of geneviève de brabant that i have before me and the care which i took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that today when i call that marriage ceremony to mind i find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when i inquired whether the lady was indeed mme de guermantes but her i can see her still quite clearly especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy lighted by the intermittent hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day where mme de guermantes found herself in the midst of all those combray people whose names even she did not know but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must in return feel for them a genuine pitying sympathy and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm and then too since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances charged with a definite meaning which one directs in a crowd towards people whom one knows but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control she was anxious not to distress in any way not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed by whom it was everywhere arrested i can see again today above her mauve scarf silky and buoyant the gentle astonishment in her eyes to which she had added without daring to address it to anyone in particular but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves this smile rested upon myself who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes and i remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of gilbert the bad said to myself of course she is thinking about me i fancied that i had found favour in her sight that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church and would perhaps grow pensive again that evening at guermantes on my account and at once i fell in love with her for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt as i supposed mlle swann to have done while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours it is enough also sometimes that she looks on us kindly as mme de guermantes did then while we think of her as almost ours already her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower wholly beyond my reach yet dedicated by her to me and the sun bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the square and into the sacristy shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding along which mme de guermantes smilingly advanced and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet a bloom of light giving it that sort of tenderness of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration which characterises certain pages of lohengrin certain paintings by carpaccio and makes us understand how baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet delicious

   how often after that day in the course of my walks along the guermantes way and with what an intensified melancholy did i reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career and that i must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author the regret that i felt for this while i lingered alone to dream for a little by myself made me suffer so acutely that in order not to feel it my mind of its own accord by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain ceased entirely to think of versemaking of fiction of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting then quite apart from all those literary preoccupations and without definite attachment to anything suddenly a roof a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone the smell of a road would make me stop still to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me and also because they appeared to be concealing beneath what my eyes could see something which they invited me to approach and seize from them but which despite all my efforts i never managed to discover as i felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them i would stand there in front of them motionless gazing breathing endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt and if i had then to hasten after my grandfather to proceed on my way i would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes i would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof the colour of the stone which without my being able to understand why had seemed to me to be teeming ready to open to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings it was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope i had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value and suggesting no abstract truth but at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind and in that way distracted me from the tedium from the sense of my own impotence which i had felt whenever i had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work so urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour—to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them that i was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved as good luck would have it my parents called me i felt that i had not for the moment the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until i reached home and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose and so i concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume quite at ease in my mind since i was taking it home with me protected by its visible and tangible covering beneath which i should find it still alive like the fish which on days when i had been allowed to go out fishing i used to carry back in my basket buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh once in the house again i would begin to think of something else and so my mind would become littered as my room was with the flowers that i had gathered on my walks or the odds and ends that people had given me with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected a roof the sound of a bell the smell of fallen leaves a confused mass of different images under which must have perished long ago the reality of which i used to have some foreboding but which i never had the energy to discover and bring to light once however when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits and so had been very glad to encounter half way home as afternoon darkened into evening dr percepied who drove past us at full speed in his carriage saw and recognised us stopped and made us jump in beside him i received an impression of this sort which i did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough i had been set on the box beside the coachman we were going like the wind because the doctor had still before returning to combray to call at martinvillelesec at the house of a patient at whose door he asked us to wait for him at a bend in the road i experienced suddenly that special pleasure which bore no resemblance to any other when i caught sight of the twin steeples of martinville on which the setting sun was playing while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position and then of a third steeple that of vieuxvicq which although separated from them by a hill and a valley and rising from rather higher ground in the distance appeared none the less to be standing by their side

   in ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires the changes of aspect the sunny warmth of their surfaces i felt that i was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression that something more lay behind that mobility that luminosity something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal

   the steeples appeared so distant and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them that i was astonished when a few minutes later we drew up outside the church of martinville i did not know the reason for the pleasure which i had found in seeing them upon the horizon and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome i wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines moving in the sunshine and for the time being to think of them no more and it is probable that had i done so those two steeples would have vanished for ever in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which i had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me but without ever exploring them more fully i got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the doctor to reappear then it was time to start i climbed up again to my place turning my head to look back once more at my steeples of which a little later i caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road the coachman who seemed little inclined for conversation having barely acknowledged my remarks i was obliged in default of other society to fall back on my own and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples and presently their outlines and their sunlit surface as though they had been a sort of rind were stripped apart a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier framed itself in words in my head and the pleasure with which the first sight of them just now had filled me was so much enhanced that overpowered by a sort of intoxication i could no longer think of anything but them at this point although we had now travelled a long way from martinville i turned my head and caught sight of them again quite black this time for the sun had meanwhile set every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight then they shewed themselves for the last time and so i saw them no more

   without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me i borrowed a pencil and some paper from the doctor and composed in spite of the jolting of the carriage to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm the following little fragment which i have since discovered and now reproduce with only a slight revision here and there
                        

   alone rising from the level of the plain and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country climbed to the sky the twin steeples of martinville presently we saw three springing into position confronting them by a daring volt a third a dilatory steeple that of vieuxvicq was come to join them the minutes passed we were moving rapidly and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us like three birds perched upon the plain motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight then the steeple of vieuxvicq withdrew took its proper distance and the steeples of martinville remained alone gilded by the light of the setting sun which even at that distance i could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides we had been so long in approaching them that i was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when of a sudden the carriage having turned a corner set us down at their feet and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church

   we resumed our course we had left martinville some little time and the village after accompanying us for a few seconds had already disappeared when lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight its steeples and that of vieuxvicq waved once again in token of farewell their sunbathed pinnacles sometimes one would withdraw so that the other two might watch us for a moment still then the road changed direction they veered in the light like three golden pivots and vanished from my gaze but a little later when we were already close to combray the sun having set meanwhile i caught sight of them for the last time far away and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields they made me think too of three maidens in a legend abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall and while we drew away from them at a gallop i could see them timidly seeking their way and after some awkward stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes drawing close to one another slipping one behind another shewing nothing more now against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form charming and resigned and so vanishing in the night
                        

   i never thought again of this page but at the moment when on my corner of the boxseat where the doctors coachman was in the habit of placing in a hamper the fowls which he had bought at martinville market i had finished writing it i found such a sense of happiness felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples and of the mystery which they concealed that as though i myself were a hen and had just laid an egg i began to sing at the top of my voice

   all day long during these walks i had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the duchesse de guermantes in fishing for trout in drifting by myself in a boat on the vivonne and greedy for happiness i asked nothing more from life in such moments than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons but when on our way home i had caught sight of a farm on the left of the road at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together and from which to return to combray we need only turn down an avenue of oaks bordered on one side by a series of orchardcloses each one planted at regular intervals with appletrees which cast upon the ground when they were lighted by the setting sun the japanese stencil of their shadows then sharply my heart would begin to beat i would know that in half an hour we should be at home and that there as was the rule on days when we had taken the guermantes way and dinner was in consequence served later than usual i should be sent to bed as soon as i had swallowed my soup so that my mother kept at table just as though there had been company to dinner would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed the zone of melancholy which i then entered was totally distinct from that other zone in which i had been bounding for joy a moment earlier just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated as though by a line invisibly ruled from a band of green or black you may see a bird flying across the pink it draws near the borderline touches it enters and is lost upon the black the longings by which i had just now been absorbed to go to guermantes to travel to live a life of happiness—i was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure how readily would i have sacrificed them all just to be able to cry all night long in the arms of mamma shuddering with emotion i could not take my agonised eyes from my mothers face which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where i could see myself already lying in imagination and wished only that i were lying dead and this state would persist until the morrow when the rays of morning leaning their bars of light as the gardener might lean his ladder against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums which clambered up it as far as my windowsill i would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden with no thought of the fact that evening must return and with it the hour when i must leave my mother and so it was from the guermantes way that i learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind during certain periods going so far as to divide every day between them each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague contiguous and yet so foreign to one another so devoid of means of communication that i could no longer understand or even picture to myself in one state what i had desired or dreaded or even done in the other

   so the méséglise way and the guermantes way remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune the richest in episodes i mean the life of the mind doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect which have opened new paths before our feet we had for long been preparing for their discovery but that preparation was unconscious and for us those truths date only from the day from the minute when they became apparent the flowers which played then among the grass the water which rippled past in the sunshine the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air and certainly when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passerby by this dreaming child—as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd—that scrap of nature that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which in a little while the dogroses will have banished it a sound of footsteps followed by no echo upon a gravel path a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current and formed only to burst—my exaltation of mind has borne them with it and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years while all around them the onetrodden ways have vanished while those who thronged those ways and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways are dead sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind like a flowering isle of delos and i am unable to say from what place from what time—perhaps quite simply from which of my dreams—it comes but it is preeminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil as firm sites on which i still may build that i regard the méséglise and guermantes ways it is because i used to think of certain things of certain people while i was roaming along them that the things the people which they taught me to know and these alone i still take seriously still give me joy whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me or that reality will take shape in the memory alone the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers the méséglise way with its lilacs its hawthorns its cornflowers its poppies its appletrees the guermantes way with its river full of tadpoles its waterlilies and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which i fain would pass my life in which my only requirements are that i may go out fishing drift idly in a boat see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass and find hidden among the cornfields—as saintandrédeschamps lay hidden—an old church monumental rustic and yellow like a millstone and the cornflowers the hawthorns the appletrees which i may happen when i go walking to encounter in the fields because they are situated at the same depth on the level of my past life at once establish contact with my heart and yet because there is an element of individuality in places when i am seized with a desire to see again the guermantes way it would not be satisfied were i led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair or even fairer than those in the vivonne any more than on my return home in the evening at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which later on in life transfers itself to the passion of love and may even become its inseparable companion i should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own no just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented in that untroubled peace which no mistress in later years has ever been able to give me since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them and never can possess their hearts as i used to receive in her kiss the heart of my mother complete without scruple or reservation unburdened by any liability save to myself was that it should be my mother who came that she should incline towards me that face on which there was beneath her eye something that was it appears a blemish and which i loved as much as all the rest—so what i want to see again is the guermantes way as i knew it with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms pressed so close together at the entrance to the oak avenue those meadows upon whose surface when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake are outlined the leaves of the appletrees that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes at night in my dreams binds me with a power that is almost fantastic of which i can discover no trace when i awake

   no doubt by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time the méséglise and guermantes ways left me exposed in later life to much disillusionment and even to many mistakes for often i have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom and i have been led to believe and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection by what was no more than an inclination to travel but by the same qualities and by their persistence in those of my impressions today to which they can find an attachment the two ways give to those impressions a foundation depth a dimension lacking from the rest they invest them too with a charm a significance which is for me alone when on a summer evening the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion and everyone is complaining of the storm it is along the méséglise way that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy inhaling through the noise of falling rain the odour of invisible and persistent lilactrees

   and so i would often lie until morning dreaming of the old days at combray of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there of other days besides the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste—by what would have been called at combray the perfume—of a cup of tea and by an association of memories of a story which many years after i had left the little place had been told me of a love affair in which swann had been involved before i was born with that accuracy of detail which it is easier often to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome all these memories following one after another were condensed into a single substance but had not so far coalesced that i could not discern between the three strata between my oldest my instinctive memories those others inspired more recently by a taste or perfume and those which were actually the memories of another from whom i had acquired them at second hand—no fissures indeed no geological faults but at least those veins those streaks of colour which in certain rocks in certain marbles point to differences of origin age and formation

   it is true that when morning drew near i would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream i would know in what room i was actually lying would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness and—fixing my orientation by memory alone or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which i placed the curtains and the window—would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture as an architect and an upholsterer might do working upon an original discarded plan of the doors and windows would have replaced the mirrors and set the chestofdrawers on its accustomed site but scarcely had daylight itself—and no longer the gleam from a last dying ember on a brass curtainrod which i had mistaken for daylight—traced across the darkness as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard its first white correcting ray when the window with its curtains would leave the frame of the doorway in which i had erroneously placed it while to make room for it the writingtable which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be would hurry off at full speed thrusting before it the mantelpiece and sweeping aside the wall of the passage the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where a moment earlier my dressingroom had lain and the dwellingplace which i had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which i had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening put to flight by that pale sign traced above my windowcurtains by the uplifted forefinger of dayembed"
