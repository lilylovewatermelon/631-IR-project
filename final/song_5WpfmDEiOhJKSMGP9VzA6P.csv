when you talk about new york
the first thing that comes to your mind is big like
thats the king i dont think theres no other king out there
nobody could take that that that crown from him right there
the legacy of big is something real deep man
go back to a bunch of roots man notorious about family and keepin it tight
that thats one of the best that ever did it
represented what he represented did what he did
youknoimean
he put brooklyn on his back
he represented the hood he represented new york city
respect to my dude man
i love you man
just like you hear man
big forever youknoimean
mafia gang
rest in peace bigyou might also likeembed"
