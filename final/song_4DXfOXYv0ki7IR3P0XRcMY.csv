i softly kiss your neck and slowly whisper
you breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
tshirt for a pillow music up real low creeping through the window
i can feel the bass line in the bed liner and your heart on mine
tryin to jump up out of your chest

chorus
baby youre now on fire girl youre on fire
out in the dark wrapped up in the stars
so right girl im so high
you and me wild and free
way out in the woods no body for miles
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on

verse 2
the moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
theres a feeling in your eyes the shadows cant erase
the cool wind that found us is breezing around us
following my fingers through your hair
the engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
pictures of you and burning them in my head

and im on fire girl youre on fire
out in the dark wrapped up in the stars
so right girl im so high
you and me wild and free
way out in the woods no body for miles
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on

im tuned in to you somethings on your mind aint it
go on and tell me baby dont act like you cant say it
i know your body language you aint gotta translate it
let it talk to me till i cant take it
your lips your hair your smile your touch your kiss your stare
your vibes too much
it lights me up you got me set
im way too gone so baby let your eyes close
say my name and watch me goin up in flames

chorus
girl im on fire girl youre on fire
out in the dark where the wild things are
so right girl im so high
you and me wild and free
way out in the woods parked under the pines
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on
love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
just us and the speakers on11embed"
