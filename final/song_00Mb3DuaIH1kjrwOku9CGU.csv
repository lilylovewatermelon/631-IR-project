he was a boy she was a girl
can i make it any more obvious
he was a punk she did ballet
what more can i say
he wanted her shed never tell
secretly she wanted him as well
but all of her friends stuck up their nose
they had a problem with his baggy clothes

chorus
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasnt good enough for her
she had a pretty face but her head was up in space
she needed to come back down to earth

verse 2
five years from now she sits at home
feedin the baby shes all alone
she turns on tv guess who she sees
skater boy rockin up mtv
she calls up her friends they already know
and theyve all got tickets to see his show
she tags along and stands in the crowd
looks up at the man that she turned down
see avril lavigne liveget tickets as low as 31you might also likechorus
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasnt good enough for her
now hes a superstar slammin on his guitar
does your pretty face see what hes worth
he was a skater boy she said see you later boy
he wasnt good enough for her
now hes a superstar slammin on his guitar
does your pretty face see what hes worth

bridge
sorry girl but you missed out
well tough luck that boys mine now
we are more than just good friends
this is how the story ends
too bad that you couldnt see
i see the man that boy could be
there is more than meets the eye
i see the soul that is inside

breakdown
hes just a boy and im just a girl
can i make it any more obvious
we are in love havent you heard
how we rock each others world
