love was simple at the start
we thought that was all
somehow we got lost
and now what we had before
together we made music
it was like the sweetest song
the melody so strong
we played it all day long

i know
nothing ever stays the same
we all grow
even if our love should change
you should know
that i dont ever want you to leave
dont go
dont go

promise you wont ever go again
now that you love again
now that you love again
say this love will never ever end
its better than its ever been
now that you love again
you might also likenow we took it back
to where we started off and i
i see that youre exactly what i needed in my life
this goes longer
well go stronger till we get it right
gets better everyday
sweeter every night
when we fight
i know you never mean to say the things you say
we go back and forth
and then you walk away
every time you go out the door i cry
say our love will never die

promise you wont ever go again
now that you love again
now that you love again
say this love will never ever end
its better than its ever been
now that you love again

babe im so glad you came back
you know you never know how things turn out so
to prove to you im being real listen

wanna live
forever with you
together with you
im better with you
ill go
do whatever with you
im livin for you
its what i wanna do
have faith
that i am the one
the one that you want
weve already begun
this love
is something we made
i wont throw away
i want you to stay
promise you wont ever go again
now that you love again
now that you love again
say this love will never ever end
its better than its ever been
now that you love againembed"
