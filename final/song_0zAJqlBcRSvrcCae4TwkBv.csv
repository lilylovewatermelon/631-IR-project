pain
come alive
i try to breathe
shade my eyes
follow the damned
i have lost the way again

verse 2
stay
trust in life
carried beneath
dead arise
sorrow avenged
i will face the weak within

chorus
so ill stay unforgiven
and ill keep love together
and ill be yours forever
ill sleep close to heaven

verse 3
hate
lost inside
i dare to dream
faithless lies
caught in the web
i will face the weak within

so ill stay unforgiven
and ill keep love together
and ill be yours forever
ill sleep close to heaven

ill sleep close to heaven
