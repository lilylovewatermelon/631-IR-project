well tonight out on the streets im gonna follow you
and tell you all about a scene that you would kill for
youre gonna love whats burning right in front of you
but you wont see it by the light of the sun
come out tigerlily youre caressing me
ill take you up ill turn you on ill take your apathy
i wouldnt lie to you blossom wont you let it go
im gonna give you what you want and dont you know

chorus elly jackson
that you
i know you better than this
i could be here when you call
ill make you top of the list
and in the crush of the dark
ill be your light in the mist
i can see you burning with desire for a kiss
psychobabble all upon your lips

verse 2 elly jackson
well they can sell it all they want but you cannot agree
i dont like the taste of damn morality
youll find your bread and your butter where you fake it
and put your face in the gutter of a snake pit
but our communication is telepathy
what you give is what you get out of us naturally
and we can wait till the shadow grows long
and turn the page of the story that has long since found a home

i know you better than this
i could be here when you call
ill make you top of the list
and in the crush of the dark
ill be your light in the mist
i can see you burning with desire for a kiss
psychobabble all upon your lips

bridge kit jackson
have you ever felt like youre being followed
or watched the ones that held your stare
turned around to see whos behind you
to find theres no one there
lurking in the dark
cause someone breathes you night and day
theres a friend who wants so much more
and if they cant have you theyll never let you walk away

outro elly jackson
and in the crush of the dark
ill be your light in the mist
i can see you burning with desire for a kiss
psychobabble all upon your lips
and in the crush of the dark
ill be your light in the mist
i can see you burning with desire for a kiss
psychobabble all upon your lips3embed"
