here it comes
in and out and around
feeling bare almost there
here it comes
this is the best part
this is the best part
getting weak
but im doing fine
how are you how are you
everything and nothing
twirling around in my head
all at once all at once

outro
where am i going

can you take me with yousee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
