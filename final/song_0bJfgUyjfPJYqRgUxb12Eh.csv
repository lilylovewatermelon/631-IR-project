well hello world
hope youre listening
forgive me if i’m young
for speaking out of turn
there’s someone ive been missing
i think that they could be
the better half of me
they’re in the wrong place
tryin to make it right
but i’m tired of justifying

chorus
so i say to you
come home come home
cause ive been waiting for you
for so long for so long
and right now theres a war between the vanities
but all i see is you and me
and the fight for you is all ive ever known
so come home
ooh

verse 2
i get lost in the beauty
of everything i see
the world aint half as bad
as they paint it to be
if all the sons all the daughters
stopped to take it in
well hopefully the hate subsides
and the love can begin
it might start now yeah
well maybe i’m just dreaming out loud
see onerepublic liveget tickets as low as 150you might also likechorus
well until then
come home come home
cause ive been waiting for you
for so long for so long
and right now theres a war between the vanities
but all i see is you and me
and the fight for you is all ive ever known ever known
so come home
ooh

bridge
everything i can’t be
is everything you should be
and that’s why i need you here
everything i can’t be
is everything you should be
and that’s why i need you here

chorus
so hear this now
come home come home
cause ive been waiting for you
for so long for so long
and right now theres a war between the vanities
but all i see is you and me
and the fight for you is all ive ever known ever known
so come home come home
