hot boy off the north with the tats on his face
run run run find a place where you safe
far from grace
in my maze where i play
pray on your faith when they claim that they saved
laugh in your face
trying to jump home boy
you might want to refrain
keys to the gate
talking hell little bitch and you aint gonna escape
hold up jump out with the glock cocked
going nonstop aim the red dot
shoot a motherfucker dead where he laying
aint stopping until the gun lock huh
motherfucker out my box
head been knocked by the worst kind
gorilla from the 59
im a psycho check my bloodline

verse 2 southside shorty
all of these bitches afraid of me
and all of these fuckboys they hate on me
so just to sum it up
basically i really couldnt give less of a fuck
im from the era of terror
the product of financial pressure
social conformity religious error
mention the devil theyll fuck off forever
the new millennium brought nothing better
i wanna see blood stains on the grill of the mustang mustang
couple pills just to numb the pain pain
six roads one way
flames arise burned my eyes
im late for judgement daysee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like21embed"
