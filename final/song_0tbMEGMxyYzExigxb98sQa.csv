not every cowboy rides a broken black mustang
sometimes its a twotank twotone shortbed chevrolet
not every cowboy drinks whiskey like its water
some will be a man shake your daddys hand and do right by his daughter
my love aint a heartbreak country song

chorus
girl i bet your mama warned you bout guys like me
and this outlaw in my blood aint a wildcard up my sleeve
cause i aint a silhouette stetson
heading out west in a red sunset and taking your heart with me
so let me show you that not every cowboy leaves

verse 2
not every cowboy leaves laredo boots on the porch
in case he changes his mind in the middle of the night
slips out the door
and not every cowboy is a tumbleweed that dont tumble back
fills your eyes with tears and your head with questions that youll never get to ask

chorus
girl i bet your mama warned you bout guys like me
and this outlaw in my blood aint a wildcard up my sleeve
cause i aint a silhouette stetson
heading out west in a red sunset and taking your heart with me
so let me show you that not every cowboy leaves

chorus
