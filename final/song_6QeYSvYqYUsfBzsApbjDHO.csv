boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window

verse 1 tv girl
my girl liddy used to always smoke
cigarettes when she couldnt sleep
shed disappear for an hour and a half
and when shed come back shed brush her teeth
but i could still smell it on her raggedy tee
and i could taste it on her lips when we kissed
poor little liddy used to always quit
but she never really quit
shed just say she did

chorus frankie cosmos
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh

verse 2 tv girl
my girl liddy used to always smoke
cigarettes when she couldnt sleep
i wonder what she did when she got done
i guess shed just flick them out in the street
poor little liddy she wishes it was dark
but its never really dark in la
the light from the billboard always shines
but it changed twelve times since you went away
you might also likechorus frankie cosmos
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh
boy now who smokes cigarettes out that window oohooh

outro victor jory
youll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them therell be no answer
rather melodramatic arent you
youll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them therell be no answer
you mind if i smoke
youll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them therell be no answer
oohooh
i always smoke with the theatre
youll find moonlit nights strangely empty because when you call my name through them therell be no answer
oohooh
somehow it enhances the performance12embed"
