wit hot shit bubble me up til i rock
come put me on the block
in a new form and new sound
for ja rule and im feeling like im too strong
i move on down to dc va
and i even did as far as california

verse 3 ja rule
niggas from the east
christ from the gun to the mics
im living my life
running through hell with no ice
its a sin
but id sell my lost soul to win
go to bed and die
then id wake up breathing again
cause im all in
even though shit aint right
i wake up sweatin my life every night
help me is it the devil that going to get me
or is it god dont feel like being bothered with me
so hard to hit me this life a sacrifice
if i grow blind through the dark my kids gonna see the light
if i die young its cause a nigga too high strung
got scary love for gun wit too much weed in my lungs
and still niggas screaming ja the one the chosen
the gods only begotten son its my life
chorus ja rule
niggas if you hustle and stick em
its your life
bitches if you fuckin and striping

its alright
niggas if you hustle and stick em
