if i had a perfect day
i would have it start this way
open up the fridge and have a tall boy yeah
then id meet up with my friends
head out to the game again
we dont even really care who wins wins 1 2 3

chorus
now excitement seems to grow
when were hanging with the bros
when were chilling and we pound a case of strohs
now the game is cool to see
you can high 5 on tv
count the riot on the one two three
operation is in sight
and the field is open wide
when you break it then you know youre still alive
if the cops dont make you pay
and you make your getaway
then you know that its one fine day

verse 2
on that day before were through
we could torch a car or two
then have ourselves another tall boy yeah
water hoses and batons
thats the real game thats on
i dont really give a shit who wins wins 1 2 3

i believe its my godgiven right
to destroy everything in my sight
â€™cause it never gets dull it never gets old
the only thing it gets is more bold
drinkin fightin going to the game
in our world its a way to stay sane
if youre asking me to have it my way
id say thats one fine day

and the field is open wide
when you break it then you know youre still alive
if the cops dont make you pay
and you make your getaway
then you know that its one fine day
then you know that its one fine day now
