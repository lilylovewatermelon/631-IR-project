were never done with killing time
can i kill it with you
till the veins run red and blue
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

prechorus
you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
were hollow like the bottles that we drain
you drape your wrists over the steering wheel
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow but were brave

chorus
and i like you
i love these roads where the houses dont change
and i like you
where we can talk like theres something to say
and i like you
im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
and i like you
we move in the tree streets
id like it if you stayed
you might also likeverse 2
now were wearing long sleeves
and the heating comes on
you buy me orange juice
were getting good at this
dreams of clean teeth
i can tell that youre tired
but you keep the car on
while youre waiting out front

prechorus
you pick me up and take me home again
head out the window again
were hollow like the bottles that we drain
you drape your wrists over the steering wheel
pulses can drive from here
we might be hollow but were brave

chorus
and i like you
i love these roads where the houses dont change
and i like you
where we can talk like theres something to say
and i like you
im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
and i like you
we move in the tree streets
id like it if you stayed
bridge
were never done with killing time
can i kill it with you
till the veins run red and blue
we come around here all the time
got a lot to not do
let me kill it with you

chorus
and i like you
i love these roads where the houses dont change
and i like you
where we can talk like theres something to say
and i like you
im glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
and i like you
we move in the tree streets
id like it if you stayed

outro
and i like you
and i like you
and i like you
