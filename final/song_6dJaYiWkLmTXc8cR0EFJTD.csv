youve got a lot of nerve
ive got a little time
so try to make it hurt
its nothing that i havent heard a thousand times

chorus
and youve got your little girlfriends
so here we go again
see i dont ever care to know the parts of you you never show
you think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
so go go away
take your things leave today
finally get what you deserve
oh you have got a lot of nerve

verse 2
youve got your little campaign
a dirty little smile
a snap inside my left brain
its something that i havent heard in quite awhile

chorus
and youve got your little girlfriends
so here we go again
see i dont ever care to know the parts of you you never show
you think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
so go go away
take your things leave today
finally get what you deserve
oh you have got a lot of nerve
you might also likebridge
the careful careful lies you tell
and the campaign that your body sells
is the careful carriage ride to hell
enjoy yourself

chorus
and i dont ever care to know the parts of you you never show
you think a liar like yourself could go and bother someone else
so go go away
take your things leave today
finally get what you deserve
oh you have got a lot of nerve

outro
youve got a lot of nerve3embed"
