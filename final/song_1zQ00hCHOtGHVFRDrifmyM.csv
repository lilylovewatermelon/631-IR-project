i lost my heart my home is the ocean
the waves underneath will soon be my home
i will fall asleep ill close my eyes and
dream of days when i wasnt all alone

chorus
all that i know is gone take what is left of me now
all that i know is gone take what is left of me
fall deeper and deeper
the sirens are singing your songs

verse 2
ill miss my breath theres no more left
ill miss the sound of the wind at my back
the depths have a number they call you by name
fall asleep davy jones calls you
so fall asleep fall asleep and dream

chorus
all that i know is gone take what is left of me now
all that i know is gone take what is left of me
fall deeper and deeper
the sirens are singing your songs
all that i know is gone take what is left of me now
all that i know is gone take what is left of me
fall deeper and deeper
the sirens are singing your songsyou might also like11embed"
