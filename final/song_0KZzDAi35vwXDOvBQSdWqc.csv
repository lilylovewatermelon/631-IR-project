verse 3 baby blue
you was there before the deal me and you was like jack and jill
all i wanted was a varsity jacket and a yearbook to remember the years
see you stopped believin in me when i needed you the most
now you want a weddin ring the most i propose is a toast
i was beggin you to stay pleadin with you not to leave
but you left me anyway and all that i could do is grieve
i thought i needed you thought i couldnt be nothin without ya
now im the one youre beggin to because i made it without ya
