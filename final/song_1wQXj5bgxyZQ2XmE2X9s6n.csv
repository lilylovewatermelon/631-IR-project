verse 1
steal my heart and hold my tongue
i feel my time my time has come
let me in unlock the door
ive never felt this way before

refrain
and the wheels just keep on turning
the drummer begins to drum
i dont know which way im going
i dont know which way ive come

verse 2
hold my head inside your hands
i need someone who understands
i need someone someone who hears
for you ive waited all these years

chorus
for you id wait till kingdom come
until my day my day is done
and say youll come and set me free
just say youll wait youll wait for me

chorus
for you id wait till kingdom come
until my days my days are done
