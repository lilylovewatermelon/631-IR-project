the road is kinda rough
but the road up yonder
with the cinders on the side

trails of trouble
and your roads of battle
and your paths of victory
we shall walk

i walked out to the valley
and turned my head up high
seen that silver linin
it was hangin in the sky

trails of troubles
and your roads of battles
in the paths of victory
we shall walk

the mountain was amovin
the hummin of its wheels
told me of the new day
it was coming across the fields

trails of troubles
and roads of battles
they lead paths of victory
we shall walk
see cat power liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likethe gravel road is bumpy
its a hard old road to ride
but the good road is waitin
and boys it aint far off

trails of trouble
and your roads of battle
they lead paths of victory
we shall walkembed"
