verse 1 ti
i left the kids at the crib and the squad in the trap
now im in the twoseater with my broad in my lap
the alpines beatin but im far away from rappin
bumpin prince sade or some marvin gaye perhaps i
put up my blues put on some tailor made slacks
some wing tip shoes whachu know about that
button down cufflinks hair cut no hat
just felt like gettin clean and show i know how to act
at neiman  marcus let my girl blow three or four stacks
gotta forever to cut the food and damn im relaxed
in a real cool mood no beef no gats
but then real close by niggas better know that

chorus jazze pha
i aint hangin with my niggas pullin no triggaz

i aint hangin with my potnaz im out eatin lobster

or either will and jada on vacation for the summer

gotta big sack of some of that shit from california
a bottle of patron and a six pack of corona
dro aroma got the six hot steamin like a sauna
so i let the top back and i bend anotha corner

verse 3 ti
i left the stress in the streets and im a long way from home
put up the vest and the chrome even through with my phone
my potnaz dont wanna be on the shit that im on mayne
livin life and kickin it like a grown man
sittin in the sand drinkin pina coladas
with a double shot of rum just chillin right by the water
no judges no lawyers in a whole nother world
just a bottle and this  dro blowin with my girl

chorus jazze pha
i aint hangin with my niggas pullin no triggaz
ill be back to the trap but for now
