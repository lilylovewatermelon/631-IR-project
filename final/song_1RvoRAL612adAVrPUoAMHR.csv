girl since you left me
been tryin to forget we
ever became what we were
and i poured some whiskey
on places you kissed me
tried to wash off all the hurt
but aint nothin workin
ive lived out the words in
a thousand old sad country songs
but whenever i try to move on

chorus
its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
its like watchin the way that the river rolls
and then tellin it to turn back around
and ive held some strangers told people i hatе you
but i just keep hittin a wall
its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
it just dont do mе no good at all

verse 2
if i was only
heart broke and lonely
id head on back down to the bar
find me a companion
but you left a canyon
cant nobody fill in this heart
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
and girl its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
its like watchin the way that the river rolls
and then tellin it to turn back around
and ive held some strangers told people i hate you
but i just keep hittin a wall
its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
it just dont do me no good at all
no damn good damn good damn good at all

bridge
and baby tell me how you did it
i just gotta know
and tell me whats your secret
and howd you let me go so easy

chorus
cause girl its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
its like watchin the way that the river rolls
and then tellin it to turn back around
oh ive held some strangers told people i hate you
but i just keep hittin a wall
its like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
it just dont do me no good at all
its like tryna to put a bandaid on a bullet hole
it just dont do me no good at all
no damn good damn good damn good at all4embed"
