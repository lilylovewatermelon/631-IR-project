oh

verse 1
are you up there just give me a signal im reaching you now
cause i remember the sound
of your voice but i dont remember what we talked about
it doesnt matter thats a waste of time

prechorus
so take off your rings and lipstick for me

chorus
i swear that i can hear you in the wind
youre singing to me and
dancing in the halls outside again
im always listening

verse 2
send me off into space on this rocket invention
well look at the lights over the atmosphere
eat gold medal ribbon til we die up here
its selfsabotage suffocation and stale taste of blood

chorus
i swear that i can hear you in the wind
youre singing to me and
youre dancing in the halls outside again
and im always listening
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge

ill teach you to love ohoh ohoh
again

chorus
i swear that i can hear you in the wind
youre singing to me and
dancing in the halls outside again
im always listening
im always listening

outro
i swear i swear i swear
