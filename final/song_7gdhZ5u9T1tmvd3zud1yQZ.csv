need you to come my way im goin out my mind
syrup all on my breath ha ayy

verse
need you to come my way im goin out my mind
30mg they blue how many at one time
what you said gotta be true you was all on my mind
wherever i go they go too many at one time
hoes gon do what they do just for a pic in the coupe
used to think they was gang but now im like who is you
hitech all in my fangs what she said can it be true
want me all for yourself but molly want me too
codeine all on my breath im dashin a red light too
she dyin to get that pic but a bitch gon do what they do
and a nigga gon run his mouth im gon count what i earn
and i already knew how much i be just dreamin off percs
made it too easy to trust made it too easy for us
fishbowl all in the summer we was just teasin the opps
i dont even know how to drive made it too easy for law
been a minute since i been home ill give a nigga reasons to plot
