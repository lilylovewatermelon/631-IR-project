dont you worry bout gettin fixed up
when you wake up youre pretty enough
look out your window at the cloud of dust
thats my headlights thats my truck
come on baby dont you keep me waitin
i gotta go ive got a reservation
tailgate for two underneath the stars
kiss on your lips when youre in my arms

prechorus
woah
girl every now and then you get a night like this
woah
this one that we dont wanna miss no

chorus
come on baby let me take you on a night ride
windows down sittin on my side
tick tock now were knockin on midnight
me and you girl runnin outta moonlight
i wanna hold you til the break of dawn
hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
hey baby all we got is all night
come on now were runnin outta moonlight

out of the blue pullin into your drive

chorus
come on baby let me take you on a night ride
windows down sittin on my side

i wanna hold you til the break of dawn
hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
hey baby all we got is all night
come on now were runnin outta moonlight
