torn down full of aching
somehow our youth would take the blame
worn out the way we let it stay

verse 2
taught how to celebrate it
all out id replicate your pain
climb down if only for a taste

verse 3
hallowed but hesitated
shallow but full in all your veins
shadowed by every other weight

verse 4
hollow a doubt can make it
borrowed a love that never came
followed in every other shade

chorus
let it lead your love away
i never strayed
let it bury you away
in all your blame in all your pain
i will carry you always
chorus
let it lead your love away
i never strayed
let it bury you away

fade me away i wont ever be the same
fade me away i wont ever be the samesee novo amor liveget tickets as low as 45you might also like15embed"
