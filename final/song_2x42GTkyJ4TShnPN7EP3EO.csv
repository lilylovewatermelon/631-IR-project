verse 1
you said you hated me
but i keep coming back
treated me ungratefully
but i keep coming back
you didnt appreciate me
but i keep coming back
you said youd never love me
but i keep coming back
people told me to leave you alone
but i keep coming back
crazy messages on my phone
but i keep coming back
oh tell me where i went wrong
to make these feelings so strong
baby here i go again
to make me feel like this
was it the way you walk
to make me feel like this
was it the way you talk
to make me feel like this

was it the way you hug me
to make me feel like this
oh tell me were i went wrong
