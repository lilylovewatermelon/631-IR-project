but every time i tell her that i want more
she closes the door

chorus zayn all
shes not afraid of all the attention
shes not afraid of running wild
how come shes so afraid of falling in love
shes not afraid of scary movies
she likes the way we kiss in the dark
but shes so afraid of fafafalling in love love

verse 2 niall louis
maybe shes just tryna test me
wanna see how hard im gonna work
wanna see if i can really tell how much shes worth what youre worth
