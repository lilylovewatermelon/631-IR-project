verse
damn you fadin em hov how you gave em that
audemar piguet with the alligator strap
sick of yall niggas with ya now and later raps
rap about it now hope you get it later
do a couple shows hope you niggas is savin up
i show you how to do this son
but this particular watch be a one of one
that means none before it none to come
the homie thats rappin be the only one that has it
i show you how to do this son
you aint heard i push the six when the fives is out
you cant fight me in the porsche ill box you out
i show you how to do this son
we dont drive x5s we give em to babymammas
push the big top that shaped like a kansas chicken snack box
i get it crackin when im backin out the garage
a 360 drop ferrar shutdown manhattan
bucket low like fuck it though
nikes on daytime lights on hell yeah im frontin but you love it though
i show you how to do this son
nigga im a check writer youre royalty receivers
yall eatin off per diem on the low like a caesar
pay ya taxes yall niggas hustlin backwards
i cop and crash whips jay is a bastard
i show you how to do this son
how you want it my jeans is 300
these aint diesel nigga these is evisu
top is roc you know the rest
a big bucket of frozen water on my chest
i show you how to do this son
listen man get a crate some crack and some house slippers
a newspaper look out boy and get ya chips up
or get a gun a mask an escape route
some ducktapell make em take you to the house
and ma dont give him nothin unless hes treatin you special
soon hell get desperate and go down and bless you
and when he come up for air with a mouth full of hair
just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there yeah
i show you how to do this hon
look think big fuck gettin your nails done
think cars cribs jewels some shit for your son
dont let em give you hard dick and bubble gum
make him cop the lex bubble 2001 hon
i show you how to do this hon
and if your man got you baggin up it could be worse
just put a little in the baggy put a little in the purseyou might also like1embed"
