i was just waiting for your phone call
when they came along to say
that a rose done chased you clear away

verse 2
you had said i was gamine
but we didnt mean the same thing i think
broke my choux pastry heart
guess lifes no picture post card

chorus 1
one for sorrow
two for joy
sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
i dont wanna lose you
dont even own you
i just wanna stay right here
until never dawns yeah

verse 3
i was just waiting for your answer still
you made your own apologies
i cried so much i had to leave

chorus 2
three for a girl
four for a boy
sometimes you win or sometimes you lose
i dont wanna lose you yeah
dont even own you
i just wanna stay right here
until never dawns yeahsee corinne bailey rae liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like1embed"
