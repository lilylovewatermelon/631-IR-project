you know was a little hard not to stare
so nervous when i drove you home
i know being apartâ€™s a little hard to bare
sent some flowers to your work
in hopes that id have you in my arms again
we kissed that night before i lapsed
still now was something i could never forget
youve got all that i need

looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
with you i know that i am good for something
so lets go give it a try
we got our backs against the ocean
its just us against the world
looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
looking at all or nothing babe its you and i

lets take a chance go far away today
and never look back again
since i said i loved you in las vegas
its never been the same since then
youve got all that i need

looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
with you i know that i am good for something
so lets go give it a try
we got our backs against the ocean
its just us against the world
looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
you might also likethis is it nothing to hide
one more kiss never say goodbye
this is it babe youre all mine

looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
i know that i am good for something
so lets go give it a try
we got our backs against the ocean
its just us against the world

looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
with you i know that i am good for something
so lets go give it a try
we got our backs against the ocean
its just us against the world
looking at all or nothing babe its you and i
looking at all or nothing babe its you and iembed"
