what rhymes with shillin villain
what rhymes with shmillain villain
hes a villain yes he is

verse 1 kurious  doom
set it off adrenaline rush
the boys way beyond a pen and a dutch
stronger than henn a bag of the dust
you need to watch how they acting with us
now time to get it in gear
you can get it in right here
revenge is better than beer
yo doom its been a minute think they getting it clear yeah
when brothers reunite when brothers reunite
make sure we party right make sure we party right
we rock it all night long
even beyond the morning light morning light
its hard to see him in the light
even harder to see him on the mic
a black benz beats being on a bike
and he can talk a gay chick outta being a dyke
like that yall new kurious album
freak freak yall to the beat yall at a store near you go get it

verse 2 doom  posdnuosppain
keep it on click fully auto
i wont stop the rock til pockets thick and gordo
more so a risk of sounding poor bro
no tux who needs tickets to the award show
normally cordial
more or less less is more or no
haaach hock spit out the cockpit
stuck to the window til its solid as a rock hit
yes he is
you might also likeverse 3 mobonix
he grabbed the mic like two money bags
waiting for the getaway to count what he had
thought he was a spaz but dude kept wrecking
the crowd remote control keep em all guessing
funny man gave em nothin like a bummy dare
taught him how to fight wit a mic and the hottest stab
but thats the life of a villain
and you know after that chilling
went places gods graces dont follow
the big joke aint no cola in the coke bottle
writing rhymes til the pen go hollow
and been flow hotter than the sunshines of marrow
its just the villainous scheme
if not real life its still in yo dreams
like that yall like that yall
like that alike that and like that yall

verse 4 slug
villain pushin on the couch cushion
southside minneap never lived out in brooklyn
kept the faith forget the fame
if they sweat the name let it set the lane
held mind cold and hard
had no regard who the chosen are
who you oh no
you played the oboe keep it on the low low
rappers are candy butterscotch
ima let their baby mothers watch
she loves the ock i touch the spot
bitch im the itch that mustve got up her crotch heh

leave some pills for these little villains
hey shorty share the flask
