picture this all down the block
bars are closed at eight oclock
cause dont nobody need to drown no pain
every song on that jukebox
be party time top 40 pop
thered be no blue eyes cryin in the rain
aw now baby wouldnt that be a shame

chorus
girl i know we couldnt work this out
i guess what goes up it must come down
yeah i wish we coulda made it
hey but its okay cause
heartbreak makes the world go round
and round and round

verse 2
whiskeyd be collectin dust
bartenders theyd be outta luck
if couples like us never did break up
if all the cards were aces
nah there wouldnt be no vegas
and we both know that wouldnt be no fun

chorus
girl i know we couldnt work this out
i guess what goes up it must come down
yeah i wish we coulda made it
hey but its okay cause
heartbreak makes the world go round
and round and round
you might also likebridge
so cheers to you and me
for keepin friday neon nights alive and well
this is the way its supposed to be
ah at least thats what im tryna tell myself

chorus
girl i know we couldnt work this out
i guess what goes up it must come down
yeah i wish we coulda made it
hey but its okay cause
heartbreak makes the world go round
so if its goodbye see you later
were doin them a favor
cause heartbreak makes the world go round

outro
mm round and round and round
mm round and roundembed"
