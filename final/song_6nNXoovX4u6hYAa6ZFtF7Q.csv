she puts on her work clothes fishnet pantyhose
shes got a nickname everybody knows at the gentlemens club
she clocks in at midnight even though it never feels right
makes her money one dollar at a time
without the makeup nobody knows her name
and she wears the pain

chorus
black tears rolling down
from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
she reveals and they all cheer
and then she cries black tears

verse 2
jealous of the innocent sometimes she is convinced
the boss man is still a friend she needs
shes tried everything cheap sex and cocaine
anything to hide the pain for a little while
the wrong kind of famous in her mamas eyes
you can tell she knows it when she cries

chorus
black tears rolling down
from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
white lines on the mirror
just wont hide black tears
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likepostchorus
she tries and tries so hard to get away
but everybody is watching

outro
black tears rolling down
from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
if all the pain would just disappear
shed quit crying yeah shed quit crying
