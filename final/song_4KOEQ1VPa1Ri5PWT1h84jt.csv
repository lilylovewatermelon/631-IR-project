just sittin home alone
yeah i was gonna cash it in
about to put down my phone
and i had a message waitin
them boys wont let me sleep
so i told em i would meet em out
and just have one drink

but the drink had me
callin you up talkin all crazy
talkin bout us
and catchin a ride over to your room
and keepin your roommates up past 2
the drink had me
wantin one more
wantin to forget what we broke up for
and doin that make up wake up thing
i just went in there to have one drink
but the drink had me

next morning came too early
heart poundin in my head
and it took me just a second
to rеalize i know this bed
and it aint wherе i belong
but you got my tshirt on
i blame the alcohol
no it aint my fault

callin you up talkin all crazy
talkin bout us
and catchin a ride over to your room
and keepin your roommates up past 2

wantin one more
wantin to forget what we broke up for
and doin that make up wake up thing
i just went in there to have one drink
but the drink had me

it never works out the way i think
i just went in there to have one drink

callin you up talkin all crazy

wantin to forget what we broke up for
and doin that make up wake up thing
i went in there to have one drink
