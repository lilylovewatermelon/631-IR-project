verse 1 stephen marley
hey she loves to party have a good time
she looks so hearty feeling fine
she loves to smoke sometimes shifting coke
shes laughing when there aint no joke hey

pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was

verse 2 damian jr gong marley
cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
and now shes wonderin who else wants to go buy
she dont got no money and wants to get high
story sounds familiar like born to be wild
but she sillier not quite the same but she similiar
a waste of a sarsaparilla
used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
now its broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
work the cold nights red district places
she seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
more male customers than old navy
she love limelight more than john swayze
seen more miles than a rental avis
she dont slow down then some day maybe
she lost then she cant find her way to safety

verse 3 black thought
check it out she keep her head up in space like a satellite
because she got a insatiable appetite
for stayin out late night with all the parasites
plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
five minutes she stay on the move
she done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
all coked up alone she aint even in tuned
and its sad cause she aint really have a reason to use
she was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health studied and enjoyed herself
i dont know what drove her to avoid herself
destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
and now she on the track workin while she wastin away
its safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
whoever got a lil paper to play could get a slice of this

pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
verse 3 damian jr gong marley
for no reason a seasoned spliff was the first thing
one spring season while shes out flirtin
now she season me and dont need rehearsin
esteem get a beatin life is uncertain
ego need feedin now no ones mercy
beneath the demons shes a warm person
when shes not fiendin swearin and cursin
behind the curtain shes really hurtin
and while her people dont even trust her at home
the dealer that bring and cook the rock down
and she without sinnin will spot the first stone
the feelin kicks in shes in the dark zone
old friends walk pass goin bout their own
as if she is someone that they dont know
then the king of kings lift her off the floor
sayin life is a thing when you learn you grow

hook stephen marley background singers
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was

outro damian jr gong marley  stephen marley
she rise and fall like a star her life write off like a car
her face full of all kind of scar always quick fi start a war
she cant keep herself up to par she plays like a broken guitar
she always want take it to far
i doubt she ah go make it too far
she rise and fall like a star her life ride off like a car
her face full of all kind of scar always with fist start a war
she cant keep herself up to par she plays like a broken guitar
she always want take it too far
mi wonder if she make it so far wuy5embed"
