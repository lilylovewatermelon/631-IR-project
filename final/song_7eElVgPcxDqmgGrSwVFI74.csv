night midnight lose my mind
night midnight lose my mind
night midnight lose my mind
when you get to my high when you get to
night midnight

verse 1
oh god im clean out of air
in my lungs its all gone
played it so nonchalant
its time we danced with the truth
move alone with the truth
ooh hey
were sleeping through all the days
im acting like i dont see
every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

prechorus
but my hips have missed your hips
so lets get to know the kicks
will you sway with me
go astray with me
ahha

chorus
were king and queen of the weekend
aint a pill that could touch our rush
but what will we do when were sober
uh when you dream with a fever
bet you wish you could touch our rush
but what will we do when were sober
these are the games of the weekend
we pretend that we just dont care but we care
but what will we do when were sober
uh when you dream with a fever
bet you wish you could touch our rush
but what will we do when were sober

when it get dark

prechorus
but my hips have missed your hips

midnight were fading
till daylight were jaded
we know that its over
in the morning youll be dancing with
all the heartache and the treason
the fantasies of leaving
but we know that when its over
in the morning youll be dancing with us
midnight lose my mind midnight lose my mind
oh dancing with us
but what will we do when were sober
oh youll be dancing with us
can you feel it can you feel it
dancing with us us
but what will we do when were sober
us
