a boy with a coin he found in the weeds
with bullets and pages of trade magazines
close to a car that flipped on the turn
when god left the ground to circle the world

verse 2
a girl with a bird she found in the snow
then flew up her gown and thats how she knows
that god made her eyes for crying at birth
then left the ground to circle the earth

verse 3
a boy with a coin he crammed in his jeans
then making a wish he tossed in the sea
walked to a town that all of us burn
when god left the ground to circle the worldsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like4embed"
