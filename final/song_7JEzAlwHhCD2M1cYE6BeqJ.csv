here she comes walking down the street
maddie klein and her fabulous loving machine
in the place where i used to be
he almost looks like a human being
and here she comes walking down the street
maddie klein sure loves her little loving machine
sometimes he holds her hand too tight
ooh but thats all right

chorus
cause hell never leave
no hell never leave
but will he ever pull her hair like she likes
no but thats all right
maddie klein and her fabulous loving machine

verse 2
there they go walking up the street
shell take him home shut him down and shell go to sleep
and thats just the way that its got to be
she cant get him wet or hell overheat
and who really cares about a little rust
if maddie kleins got herself a little boy she can trust
sometimes she misses the flesh and bone
but they only wanna screw her and leave her alone

but hell never leave
no hell never leave
will he ever smack her ass like she likes
will he ever make her laugh late at night
no but hell never leave
when he gets obsolete
she can always just throw him away
get a new one but thats okay
shell love him the same
as her fabulous loving machine
