drink the water drink it down
this time i know im bound
to spit it back up
i didnt want this
salty substitute just not going to do
i need some air if im going to live through
this experience reminds me of a clock
that just wont tick
i want to wake up
from this concussion
but my dream is just not done
im late again
its just one of those
bad days look outside and
be careful what you ride
you just might find

chorus
that youre out of time
to swim ashore
if i drift long enough
ill be home

verse 2
hes got delusions between his ears
man it takes up too much space
and all that tension between his gears man
hell never ever leave this place
hes got stones instead of bones
and everybody knows
uh man that can make you real real slow
and if heaven was below
hed know just where to go
dive in the ocean
and hed sink like a stone
and hed say
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
its time to swim ashore
if i drift long enough
ill be home

bridge
hold on if you can
youre going to sink faster
than you can imagine so hold
hold on if you can
youre going to sink faster
than you can imagine so hold

chorus
its just time to swim ashore
if i drift long enough
ill be homeembed"
