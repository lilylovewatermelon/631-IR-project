am i free or am i just lost
in a thousand waves deep in the ocean ocean ocean
should i drown myself now
did you crash on me i know you’re over thinking things
but i need this need this need this from you so bad now

prechorus
i’m not giving up i’m not giving in

chorus
drown me out
after all of this pain you won’t see me
drown me now
through the fire and the smoke you can breathe me
drown me out

verse 2
is it me or are you the same as the weather
it makes me uneasy knowing knowing
how unpredictable you can be

prechorus
i’m not giving up i’m not giving in

chorus
drown me out
after all of this pain you won’t see me
drown me now
though the fire and the smoke you can breathe me
drown me out
drown me out
just drown me out
drown me out

am i willing to make it willing to make up my mind
this decision is everything everything
am i willing to fake it willing to fake my whole life
this is decision is everything everything
you know you know this takes the life from me
takes the life from me life from me
you know you know this takes the life from me
takes the life of me life from me

prechorus
i’m not giving up i’m not giving in

chorus
drown me out
after all of this pain you won’t see me
drown me now
though the fire and the smoke you can breathe me
drown me out
drown me out
drown me now
just drown me out1embed"
