verse 1
i fed the clues
of a lost day killed in motion
but i thought of it so
like theres no other way it could have been done
will they size my fit
for a puzzle i wish not to play part in it
a heart stained in hate
a feeling i fear will play circles

chorus
but you you were my favorite
but you you know you were my favorite

verse 2
i severed my ties
to shroud this body under the streets of this city
and wait for the day
when i am summoned to walk across the face
well slowly but clearer now
in visions that play and plague memories
i love them with all heart
as a son should to mother and father
you might also likechorus
but you you were my favorite
but you you know you were my favorite

postchorus
would i walk through the door
shedding the light of all life
with the rise and reform
would i come as before
pray youre not the only one
pray youre not the only

part ii
bridge
if given
mistakes would i take them back
if erasing them could
if erasing them would
but would they be the words that i would say
your face and a door between
ive parted three ways
for you the newo that i loved
loved

prechorus
did you ever really know before
my face shame to break
did you ever really know before
my mind scared to think
did you ever really know before
my name son to these
did you did you did you come clean
in the end from the start
chorus
dear ambellina the prise wishes you
to watch over me ohwoah
dear ambellina the prise wishes you
to watch over me ohwoah

postchorus
i fought the decisions that called and lost
my mark and the relevant piece in this
i will come reformed
in short for the murders of those i court
i bless the hour that holds your fall
i will kill you all

chorus out
i will call you out from shelter i will call you out
burn your wings youll know no better burn your wings
i will call you out from shelter i will call you out
burn your wings and learn their letters burn your wings
i will call you out from shelter
dear ambellina the prise wishes you
burn your wings youll know no better
to watch over me burn your wings
i will call you out from shelter
dear ambellina i will call you out
burn your wings and learn their letters
to watch over me ohwoahoh ohoh ohohembed"
