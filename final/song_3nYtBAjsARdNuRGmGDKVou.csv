yeah the big boss man he likes to crack that whip
i am not nothing but a number on his timecard slip
i give him 40 hours and a piece of my soul
puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole
hell i do not even think he knows my name

chorus
well all week long i am a real nobody
but i just punched out and it is pay check friday
weekends here good god almighty
i am going to get drunk and be somebody
yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
my baby cuts hair at a beauty boutique
just blowing and going till she dead on her feet
they walk right in and sit right down
she gives them what they want and then she spins them around
hey i do not think they even know her name

chorus
how week long shes a real nobody
but i just punched her out and it is pay check friday
weekends here good god almighty
baby lets get drunk and be somebody
yeah yeah yeah

well just average people in an everyday bar
driving from work in our ordinary cars
and i like to come here with the regular joes

chorus

but we just punched her out and it is pay check friday
weekends here good god almighty
people lets get drunk
how week long but youre a real nobody
but we just punched her out and it is pay check friday
weekends here good god almighty
people lets get drunk and be somebody
yeah yeah yeahembed"
