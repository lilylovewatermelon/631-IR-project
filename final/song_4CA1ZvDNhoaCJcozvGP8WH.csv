seven thirtyfive
shes someone else’s wife
i can get on with my life
and that thrills me
she married him today
her daddy gave the bride away
i heard a tear roll down her face
and that kills me

break
cause now i
can see why
shes finally crying

chorus
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly letting go
if i was putting her through her hell
hell i couldnt tell
she couldve given me a sign
couldve opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me

verse 2
yeah maybe i might’ve changed
its hard for me to say
but the storys still the same
its a sad one
and ill always believe
if she ever did cry for me
they were tears that you cant see
you know the bad ones
you might also likebreak
and now i
can see why
shes finally crying

chorus
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly letting go
if i was putting her through her hell
hell i couldnt tell
she couldve given me a sign
couldve opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me

bridge
without a doubt
i know now
how it outta be
now shes gone
and its wrong
and it bothers me
tomorrow ill still be
asking myself

chorus
how was i supposed to know
she was slowly letting go
if i was putting her through her hell
hell i couldnt tell
she couldve given me a sign
couldve opened up my eyes
how was i supposed to see
how was i supposed to see
she never cried in front of me
hell i couldnt tell2embed"
