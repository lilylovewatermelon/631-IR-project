is it worth it can you even hear me
standing with your spotlight on me
not enough to feed the hungry
im tired and i felt it for a while now
in this sea of lonely
the taste of ink is getting old its
four o clock in the fucking morning
each day gets more and more like the last day
still i can see it coming
while im standing in the river drowning
this could be my chance to break out
this could be my chance to say goodbye
at last its finally over
couldnt take this town much longer
being halfdead wasnt what i planned to be
now im ready to be free

chorus
so here i am its in my hands
and ill savor every moment of this
so here i am alive at last
and ill savor every moment of this

verse 2
dont you think im pretty
when im standing top the brightlit city
and ill take your hand and pick you up
and keep you there so you can see it
so long as youre alive and care
i promise i will take you there
well drink and dance the night away
we can drink and dance the night away

so here i am its in my hands
and ill savor every moment of this
so here i am alive at last
and ill savor every moment of this ill savor every moment of this

bridge
as long as youre alive here i am
i promise i will take you there
as long as youre alive here i am
i promise i will take you there

verse 3
dont you think im pretty
when im standing top the brightlit city
and ill take your hand and pick you up

so long as youre alive and care
i promise i will take you there

chorus
so here i am its in my hands
and ill savor every moment of this
so here i am alive at last and ill savor every moment of this
