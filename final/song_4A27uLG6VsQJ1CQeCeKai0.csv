on a lovers lee with a freeway view
sitting on my hood thinkin about you
going over in my mind every kiss and every fire
yeah the fool on the hill is beating down another night
there were days so hard i thought i had to go
i would get in my car and just follow the road
but this is my home and it is who i am
and i know id stay
if i could make this old town new again

chorus
color other than blue again
i would have something to do again
instead of thinking about you again
but the people i know
the places i go
remind me of you
oh somebody come around
and make this old town new

verse 2
there were nights so long i thought the sun burned out
and there were girls so wrong i do not want to talk about
i was burning up the night yeah in an alcohol flame
lighting up my way
trying to make this old town new again
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
color other than blue again
i would have something to do again
instead of thinking about you again
but the people i know
the places i go
remind me of you
oh somebody come around
and make this old town new

outro
love goes wrong but life goes on
and i know what i got to do
i am just hanging around
trying to make this old town newembed"
