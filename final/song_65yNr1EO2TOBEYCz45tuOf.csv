standing here i realize
you are just like me trying to make history
but whos to judge the right from wrong
when our guard is down i think well both agree
that violence breeds violence
but in the end it has to be this way

verse 2
ive carved my own path you followed your wrath
but maybe were both the same
the world has turned and so many have burned
but nobody is to blame
yet staring across this barren wasted land
i feel new life will be born beneath the bloodstained sand
beneath the bloodstained sandyou might also like7embed"
