chocolate brown sugar
sweet epiphany

i waited for your call
but you chose not to call me
i wondered what happened
were you inside a safe space
and too i wondered
were you thinking about me
and if you were why was i feeling so lonely
by the phone alone to the bone
although the night before
you were in my home my body my dome
in a circle of passion we paris italy japan africa rome
we made music we trombone
it was magic the way it happened
pure electricity
i felt so inspired and afraid at the same time
i dont know whether sing or to rhyme
call me

honey molasses
ebony majesty
chocolate brown sugar
sweet epiphany

hi um i was calling i
i last night was i
last night was um i
look just dont just dont be afraid okay
alright i hope youll call me back and
ill talk to you then i

hello hello hello
