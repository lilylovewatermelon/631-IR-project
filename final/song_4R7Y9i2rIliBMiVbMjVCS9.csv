i know the lights are out i know its getting late
but youre still young and were wide awake
ive never seen a sky this damn bright
so dont go home it just aint right

verse 2
i got a good idea i got a wild hair
theres a little spot and we could meet you there
take the only road straight outta town
until you see the fire baby dont slow down

chorus
cause well be up all night keeping up the moon
i just wanna dance baby dance with you
we gonna scream and shout until sunrise
we wont close it down well be up all night

verse 3
baby grab some beers and well grab guitars
tell all your friends and well ride the stars
well gas the fire try to make it last
and well sing it up and you can shake your ass

chorus
cause well be up all night keeping up the moon
i just wanna dance baby dance with you
we gonna scream and shout until sunrise
we wont close it down well be up all night
all right

so baby dance my way and ill pass the wine
wanna kiss your face and stay up all night

chorus
cause well be up all night keeping up the moon
i just wanna dance baby dance with you
we gonna scream and shout until sunrise
we wont close it down well be up all night
