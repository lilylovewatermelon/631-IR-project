verse
i can make you feel it closer baby one more time one more time
i can really feel you closing in i stayed outside stayed outside
i love i love i love no matter how
how much they take how much they take
something tells me we were chosen so we keep on trying keep on trying

chorus
she said im dumb surrounded by strangers
when i hear your voice im in too deep
feeling undone i cant be the only one
i wanna be forever young

bridge
i can makе you feel it closer baby one more timе
part ii
verse
cigarettes cigarettes sling it in the west
ive got nothing in my vest in my vest
intimate intimate sling it in my chest
may it never lay to rest lay to rest lay to rest
we got here just in time
dont get lost in this life
levitate levitate levitate levitate
like an atom separate like an atom separate
elaborate elaborate elaborate
been a long time i could see it on the paint
i could see it on the paint
i could see it on the paint
