how do i feel for thee
your smile brings disease
cause were young willing from the start
when your skin is shed
find a pile of your head
now then ill look so smart

chorus alice glass
stove burn on my hands
show them to my friends
make you participate
eyes roll back around
limbs fall to the ground
seasoned to procreate

verse 2 alice glass
the first to interfere
are culled before the deer
when they wander into the cage
stuff their arms and thighs
then they roll their cardboard eyes
their skin will never age

chorus alice glass
stove burn on my hands
show them to my friends
make you participate
eyes roll back around
limbs fall to the ground
seasoned to procreate

stove burn on my hands
show them to my friends
make you participate
eyes roll back around
limbs fall to the ground
seasoned to procreate
stove burn on my hands
show them to my friends
