you better find your way out
you better learn how to run
you better walk away
and leave the angles for the shills
well ive been thinking for days
about the means and the ways
that i could hate all i touch
i know youre my lady
but i could trickle i could flood
a voice coach taught me to sing
he couldnt teach me to love
all the above

chorus
easytalking borderblocking
transport is arranged

verse 2
praise the grammar police
set me up with your niece
walk to baltimore
and keep the language off the street
well im of several minds
i am the worst of my kind
i wanna cremate the crutch
i know youre my lady
but phone calls could corrupt the morning
i heed the surgeons warning pillars of eights
you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3
i swung my fiery sword
i vent my spleen at the lord
he is abstract and bored
too much milk and honey
well ill waltz through the wilderness
with nothing but a compass and a canteen
setting the scenes

chorus
easywalking borderblocking
transport is arrangedembed"
