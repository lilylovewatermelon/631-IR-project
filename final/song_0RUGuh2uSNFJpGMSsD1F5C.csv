if you ever leave me baby
leave some morphine at my door
cause it would take a whole lot of medication
to realize what we used to have
we dont have it anymore
theres no religion that could save me
no matter how long my knees are on the floor oh
so keep in mind all the sacrifices im makin
to keep you by my side
to keep you from walkin out the door

chorus
cause therell be no sunlight if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies if i lose you baby
just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
if you walk away every day itll rain rain rain

verse 2
ill never be your mothers favorite
your daddy cant even look me in the eye
ooh if i was in their shoes id be doing the same thing
saying there goes my little girl
walking with that troublesome guy
but theyre just afraid of something they cant understand
ooh but little darling watch me change their minds
yeah for you ill try ill try ill try ill try
see bruno mars liveget tickets as low as 135you might also likerefrain
and pick up these broken pieces til im bleedin
if thatll make you mine

chorus
cause therell be no sunlight if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies if i lose you baby
just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
if you walk away every day itll rain rain rain

bridge
oh dont you say dont you say goodbye goodbye
dont you say dont you say goodbye goodbye

refrain
ill pick up these broken pieces til im bleedin
if thatll make it right

chorus
cause therell be no sunlight if i lose you baby
therell be no clear skies if i lose you baby
just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
if you walk away every day itll rain rain rain67embed"
