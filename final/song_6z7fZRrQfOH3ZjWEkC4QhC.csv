oh ohoh
youre so good to me baby baby

verse 1
i wanna lock you up in my closet
where no ones around
i wanna put your hand in my pocket
because youre allowed
i wanna drive you into the corner
and kiss you without a sound
i wanna stay this way forever
ill say it loud

prechorus
now youre in
and you cant get out

chorus
you make me so hot make me wanna drop
youre so ridiculous i can barely stop
i can hardly breathe you make me wanna scream
youre so fabulous youre so good to me baby baby
youre so good to me baby baby

verse 2
i can make you feel all better
just take it in
and i can show you all the places

and i can make you say everything
that you never said
and i will let you do anything
again and again
