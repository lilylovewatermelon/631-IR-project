well
im an eightball shooting double fisted drinking sonofagun
i wear my jeans a little tight
just to watch the little boys come undone

im here for the beer
and the ballbusting band
gonna get a little crazy just because i can

chorus
you know im here for the party
and i aint leaving till they throw me out
gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
you know im here
im here for the party

verse 2
i may not be a ten
but the boys say i clean up good
and if i gave em half a chance for some rowdy romance
you know they would

ive been waiting all week just to have a good time
so bring on them cowboys
and their pick up lines
you might also likerepeat chorus
you know im here for the party
and i aint leaving till they throw me out
gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
you know im here
im here for the party


bridge
dont want no purple hooter shooter
just some jack on the rocks
dont mind me if i start that trashy talk

repeat chorus
you know im here for the party
and i aint leaving till they throw me out
gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
you know im here
im here for the party

you know im here for the party
and i aint leaving till they throw me out
gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
you know im here
im here for the party1embed"
