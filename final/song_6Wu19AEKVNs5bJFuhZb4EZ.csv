they stare at the ground
they radiate

me im mumbling in the kitchen for the sun to pay up
lonely as a ring on a cold coffee cup
im some sick hound
digging for bones
if it werent for second chances wed all be alone

my hands they were strangers lost in the night
theyre waving around in the dusty light
im waiting in the wings while the trees undress
cupping my ear to hear the wind confess
im a ghost in the garden
scaring the crows
if it werent for second chances wed all be alone

im running from nothing no thoughts in my mind
oh my heart was all black
but i saw something shine
thought that part was yours but it might just be mine
i could share it with you if you gave me the time
im all bloody knuckles longing for home
if it werent for second chances wed all be alone
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeim a shot through the dark
im a black sinkhole
if it werent for second chances wed all be alone1embed"
