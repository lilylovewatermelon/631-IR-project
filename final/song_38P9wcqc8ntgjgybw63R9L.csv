she says theres ants in the carpet dirty little monsters
eatin all the morsels pickin up the rubbish
give her effervescence she needs a little sparkle
good morning tv youre looking so healthy

chorus
we all say dont want to be alone
we wear the same clothes cause we feel the same
we kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
end of a century oh its nothing special

verse 2
sex on the tv everybodys at it
the mind gets dirty as you get closer to thirty
he gives her a cuddle theyre glowin in a huddle
goodnight tv youre all made up and youre lookin like me

chorus
we all say dont want to be alone
we wear the same clothes cause we feel the same
we kiss with dry lips when we say goodnight
end of a century oh its nothing special
