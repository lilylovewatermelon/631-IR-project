he stays home from work this time
he never really told his wife
he never really told a lie
but this time he decides that its alright
its alright
no one really knows his mind
and no one knows behind his eyes
the man deserves a medal
but hes never really won a prize before
he goes to lock the door

prechorus
he has fallen in love
he knows its enough
but the world looks down and frowns

chorus
get up johnny boy get up johnny boy
get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground
youre my pride and joy youre my pride and joy
get up johnny boy because we all need you now
we all need you now

verse 2
someone said away you go
and someone said to you goodbye
they deflect the disrespect
when they say that they blame it on the times
they blame it on the times
we all know youre qualified
to fix a chair and love your wife
they all know youre qualified
but they lie when they blame it on the times
oh we blame it on the times

oh he has fallen in love
he knows its enough
but the world looks down and frowns

get up johnny boy because we all need you now
we all need you now
