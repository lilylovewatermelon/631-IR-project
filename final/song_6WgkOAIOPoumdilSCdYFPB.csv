you were the luckiest girl alive
you had your innocence then
conquered the world every time you smiled
now you dont smile so often
i dont see you so much no more
i rarely pray but i just pray that youre well
i know you cry every night
blow it all in the sky
and ima burn one for you

verse 2
you were the luckiest girl alive
and i was to call you my friend
you was who i was who you was
and we loved
you aint got but so many fucks to give
one life to live
so be true to you
they dont know what they say
and they dont know your secrets
and they dont know about when he took your light away
just light it all into flames
and ima burn one for youyou might also like6embed"
