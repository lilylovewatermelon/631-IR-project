i get out on the redneck side every now and then
call up my baby she comes over and the party begins
shes a slick nickel shes right on the money
i wouldnt give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
im her big cat daddy shes my little miss honky tonk
shes got my number knows my favourite songs on the jukebox
goes to getting down like crazy and the whole place rocks
well have a few and get to feeling right
shell be my queen bee ill be her neon knight
im her big cat daddy shes my little miss honky tonk

chorus
oh oh i love her so
stand back give her room
boys and watch her go

verse 2
shes a looker heads turn when she comes through the door
a show stopper when she gets to going out on the floor
we leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
i feel like im a king when im out with her highness
im her big cat daddy shes my little miss honky tonk

chorus
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeoutro
we leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
i feel like im a king when im out with her highness
im her big cat daddy shes my little miss honky tonkembed"
