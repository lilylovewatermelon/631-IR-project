you push me
i dont have the strength to
resist or control you
to take me down
take me down
you hurt me
but do i deserve this
you make me so nervous
calm me down
calm me down

chorus
wake you up
in the middle of the night to say
i will never walk away again
im never gonna leave this bed oh

verse 2
so come here
and never leave this place
perfection of your face
slows me down slows me down
so fall down
i need you to trust me
go easy dont rush me
help me out
why dont you help me out
