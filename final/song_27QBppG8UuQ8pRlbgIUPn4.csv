suffering from something were not sure of
in a world there is no cure for
these lives we live test negative for happiness
flat line no pulse but eyes open
single file like soldiers on a mission
if theres no war outside our heads
why are we losing

chorus
i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening
i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening

verse 2
hang me out to dry im soaking
with the sins of knowing
whats gone wrong
but doing nothing i still run
time again i have found myself stuttering
foundations pulled out from under me
this breath is wasted on them all
will someone answer me

i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening
i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening

bridge
is there a god tonight
up in the sky
or is it empty just like me
a place where we can hide
out from the night
where you are all i see
so blow a kiss goodbye then close your eyes
tell me what you see
a lifetime spent inside this dream of mine
where you are all i see

chorus
i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening
i dont ask for much
truth be told id settle
for a life less frightening
a life less frightening3embed"
