the skys a different kind of blue
wanted it to be you
some things just arent meant to be
its easy to say i still cant see
you with anybody else
theres no amount of wealth
that could ease this poor goodbye
soften the fall from your sky

chorus
its so typical of me
and im sure that youd agree oh
that i can be a little much
i overthink i scared you off
my spiral begins right on cue
i wonder if ill ever find someone new

verse 2
i have to get off instagram
i keep on going back
looking at our memories
i know that you will soon delete
we turn to strangers in a day
now you walk away
every time i catch your eye
when did you become so shy
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
its so typical of me
im sure that youd agree oh
that i can be a little much
i overthink i scared you off
my spiral begins right on cue
this time i swear i wont find someone new
