i got too many hoes i cant fuck em all
dont know how to play but i ball
stacking that money up make it tall
ooh the ice on my neck got me frost
mama aint made no hoe she made a boss
my diamonds they shine when the lights turned off
rocking designer im dripping in sauce
all of my diamonds real so they cost
you know it costs to live like this
i got a bad lil boss bitch
too many diamonds camera glitch
yeah im shining im frostbit
aint got to tell them they know that im rich
i got a sack like i run the blitz
ice cold like i got on mitts
ice cream i look like a lick

verse 1 lil baby
i made a hunnid in two days
neighbour trippin cause i keep the door swangin
i drop a mixtape today they gon be thinking i got me a ghostwriter
amg on the floor like a low rider
having rich arguments my whole problem
running money up i dont see nobody
buying lawyers for bro cause them folks got em
tennis chains on fleek i could wear a new piece every week
me and my diamonds all on pee point
ask about me i dug deep for em
hit the bitch curry threepoint
i cant hit them all so i pikachu
i dont text em i just stick and move
fresh pair of loubs

verse 2 hoodrich pablo juan
forty pointers thats a waffle cone
ice cubes on my neck like my styrofoam
drip dripping like they left the shower on
them aint real them diamonds are rhinestones
im straight i got the iron now
too many hoes bought another phone
i apologize ap honeycomb
shorty walking round with like three hunnid on
baby vanilla my rose gold match the gucci with rose petal
trapper of the year i need a gold medal
you know the water make the pussy get wetter
ooh cant name a nigga that do it better
i got too many hoes like im hugh hefner
different foreign bitches ima put em together
yeah they know im a trendsetter
