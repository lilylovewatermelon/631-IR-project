dont my baby look good in them blue jeans
tight on the top with a belly button ring
a little tattoo somewhere in between
she only shows to me

verse 2
hey were going out dancin shes ready tonight
so damn goodlookin boys it aint even right
and when bartender says for the lady
whats it going to be
i tell him man

prechorus 1
she aint into wine and roses
beer just makes her turn up her nose and
she cant stand the thought of sippin champagne

prechorus 2
no cuervo gold margaritas
just aint enough good burn in tequila she needs
somethin with a little more edge and a little more pain

chorus
