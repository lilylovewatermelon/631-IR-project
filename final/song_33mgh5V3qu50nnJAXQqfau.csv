i cant give you everything you want
but i could give you what you thought you need
a map to keep beneath your seat youll read to me in time ill get you there
but fold it up so we dont find our way back soon nobody knows were here

we can park the van and walk to town
find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find
and talk about the road behind how getting lost is not a waste of time
le bois damour will take us home in the moment we will sing as the forest sleeps

chorus
well its all for the sake of arriving with you
well its all for the sake of arriving with you

verse 2
well i will make the table into a bed
the candle is burning down its time to rest
i cant take back things already gone but i could give you promises for keeps
and i would only take them back if they become your own and you give them to me

chorus
and its all for the sake of arriving with you
well its all for the sake of arriving with you

bridge
we could make this into anything
we could make this into more than words we speak
this could make us into anything
it could make us grow and become what well be
