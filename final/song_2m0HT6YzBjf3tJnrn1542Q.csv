chorus justin timberlake
have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste knock me down

verse 1 jayz
arm leg leg arm head – this is god body
knowledge wisdom freedom understanding we just want our equality
food clothing shelter help a nigga find some peace
happiness for a gangsta aint no love in these streets
conspiracy theorist screaming illuminati
they cant believe this much skill is in the human body
hes 62 how the fuck he fit in a new bugatti
aw fuck it you got me
question religion question it all
question existence until them questions are solved
meanwhile this heretic i be out in marrakesh
morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
yall dwell on devil shit im in a diablo
yellow shit color of jello shit
hello bitch its me again
fresh in my easter clothes feeling like jesus and

have you ever been to heaven

bridge jayz
thats me in the corner thats me in the spotlight
losing my religion losing my religion

verse 2 jayz
getting ghost in the ghost can you see me can you see me
have mercy on a judas angel wings on a ghini
im secular tell the hecklers seckle down
yall religion creates division like my maybach partition
and god is my chauffeur boy they love hova
from the south side of chi to brooklyn where i growed up
i confess god in the flesh
live among the serpents turn arenas into churches
im like michael recycle these are not 16s
these are verses from the bible
tell that preacher hes a preacher im a motherfuckin prophet
smoke a tree of knowledge drink from a gold chalice
you gotta love it i arrive at the pearly gates
i had luggage meaning i had baggage
niggas asking me questions i dont answer to these busters
only god could judge us motherfuckers uh
chorus justin timberlake
have you ever been to heaven
have you ever seen the gates
have you bowed unto your highness
and do you know how heaven taste knock me down

outro justin timberlake
heaven or hell the cards we been dealt
are the cards that we play play play
die for what you believe only one god recedes
when the shots spray spray spray31embed"
