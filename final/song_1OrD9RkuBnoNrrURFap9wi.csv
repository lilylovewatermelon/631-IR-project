i watched you through your window
i was wearing that dumb sweatshirt
i looked like a goon
i was dressed for winter
even though it was the middle of june
i watched you get undressed
i must have turned bright red
cause i couldnt stand to face you
cause i liked what i saw
maybe we should just stay friends

chorus
tell me how you feel about me
do you like or like like me
tell me what you really feel
do you like me
just say you do

verse 2
i climbed up your front porch
and i doorbell ditched you
and i felt so bad
couldnt cop to what i did
so i laughed myself sick
all the way to my car

tell me how you feel about me
do you like or like like me
tell me what you really feel
do you like me
just say you do

chorus
tell me how you feel about me
do you like or like like me
tell me what you really feel
do you like me
just say you do7embed"
