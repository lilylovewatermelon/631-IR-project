wiped the footprints off my dash
tore up those sunfaded photographs
threw em in the wind yall can have it back
im outta here

verse 2
i stuck my middle finger up in the sky
flipped off that yall come back sign
looked in the mirror one last time
and watched it disappear

chorus
it aint nothin but a rearview town
broken hearts and rusted plows
roots ripped right up out of the ground
never thought id ever leave it
it aint nothin what it used to be
population minus me
on the other side of that dust cloud
aint nothin but a rearview town

verse 3
i could tough it out but whats the use
a place that small its hard to do
too much of her to run into
and so much road to somewhere new
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
it aint nothin but a rearview town
broken hearts and rusted plows
roots ripped right up out of the ground
never thought id ever leave it
it aint nothin what it used to be
population minus me
on the other side of that dust cloud
aint nothin but a rearview town

bridge
it aint nothin but yesterday
one less truck rollin down main
aint nothin left to say

chorus
it aint nothin what it used to be
population minus me
on the other side of that dust cloud
aint nothin but a rearview town

outro
aint nothin but a rearview town4embed"
