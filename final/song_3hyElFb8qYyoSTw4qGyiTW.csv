so the holy bible says
marys boy child jesus christ
was born on christmas day

hark now hear the angels sing
new kings born today
and man will live for evermore
because of christmas day

now joseph and his wife mary
came to bethlehem that night
they found no place to bear the child
not a single room was in sight

by and by they found a little nook
in a stable all forlorn
and in a manger cold and dark
marys little boy was born

hark now hear the angels sing
new kings born today
and man will live for evermore
because of christmas day

while shepherds
watched their flocks by night
they saw a bright new shining star
and heard the choir from heaven sing
the music seemed to come from afar
you might also liketrumpets sound and angels sing
listen to what they say
that man will live for evermore
because of christmas dayembed"
