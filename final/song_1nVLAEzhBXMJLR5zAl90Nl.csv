baby why you wanna cry
you really oughta know that i
just have to walk away sometimes
we’re gonna do what lovers do
we’re gonna have a fight or two
but i ain’t ever changin’ my mind

chorus
crazy girl don’t you know that i love you
and i wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
silly woman come here let me hold you
have i told you lately
i love you like crazy girl

verse 2
wouldn’t last a single day
i’d probably just fade away
without you i’d lose my mind
before you ever came along
i was livin’ life all wrong
smartest thing i ever did was make you all mine

chorus
crazy girl don’t you know that i love you
and i wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
silly woman come here let me hold you
have i told you lately
i love you like crazy girl
like crazy girl
