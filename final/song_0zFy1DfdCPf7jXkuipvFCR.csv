remember the summer time we were swinging
on the front porch out in the rain
and it was sunday you were all dressed up again
we made out under the window pane

chorus
and i can still see your dad
running after me with a shovel in his hand
i dont remember much after that
la la la la la la la la la ohoh
la la la la la la la la ohoh

verse 2
remember on christmas eve you were crying
i guess you didnt really like the gifts
porno dvds and see through underwear
should have saved all that for your sis

chorus
and i can still see your dad
running after me with a shovel in his hand
i dont remember much after that
la la la la la la la la la ohoh
la la la la la la la la ohoh

so i guess ill just run away run away run away
hes starting to catch up
run away run away
i think i might throw up
run away run away

chorus
and i can still see your dad
running after me with a shovel in his hand
and i can still see your dad
running after me with a shovel in his hand
i dont remember much after that
