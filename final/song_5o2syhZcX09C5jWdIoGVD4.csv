so here i stare
at an empty bottle full of confidence
fuzzy faded with the poison in my head
its an empty glass philosophy
i cant help it i cant stop
im a zombie with no notion of regret
grab a bucket and a mop cause im a mess
full of sexual ferocity
i cant help it i cant stop it

prehook
im living fast until im dead
its in my head and singing

chorus
im on a permanent vacation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care no
and i dont owe an explanation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care no

postchorus
forever stuck in our youth
forever stuck in our youth

my liver hates my guts
because im stuck living in a daze
bottom shelf tequila coursing through my veins
getting greedy get it in my veins
i cant help it i cant stop
and so i drink
my cells away until i meant more than i think
ive got to know im a believer so i sing
a song about my body rebel ways
i cant help it i cant stop

prechorus
were young were dumb and having fun
were young were dumb we set it off
were young were dumb and having fun
dont make me tell you twice

chorus
because im on a permanent vacation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care no
and i dont owe an explanation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care no
postchorus
forever stuck in our youth
forever stuck in our youth

i do what i do what i do and now
prechorus
were young were dumb
and having fun were young
were dumb just turn it up
were young were dumb and having fun
and well be forever stuck in youth
forever stuck in our youth

chorus
im on a permanent vacation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care no
and i dont owe an explanation
were young were young
were dumb and we dont care

postchorus
forever stuck in our youth
