i gotta grind wont stop hustle wont quit

i just go get it stay about my business
im living just to kill it stacking millions to the ceiling

verse 1
every day above ground all i wanna do is ball
put my money over bitches put my hustle over all
louis down to the drawers louis vuitton kicks
got a mad hatter swagger bitch i’m stupid dumb sick
with a group of young bitches and theyre stupid dumb thick
i’m the marathon man all i do is run shit
a sophisticated convict superficial still official
multimillion dollar shit money is the object
hot shit bitch i got a sauna on my arm
six figure with no diamond richard mille and vacheron
they just talk about they got it
i’m the upper echelon though
bitch i‘m bout that action you could go on with that convo
i have done more than you dream bout
got your dream bitch and your dream house
on lean passing them beans out
