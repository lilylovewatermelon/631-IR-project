lay your head down just for now
space fills your mind and you dream a while
the sun floods your room as you drown drown drown drown
your lungs full of breathing your true love believe

chorus
one more time to say i love you always
and keeping faith and letting love find a way

verse 2
move let the stars suck you in
hold tight the nights air and breathe again and breathe in
let go and be burnt by the moon moon moon moon
your hands full of feeling your true love believe

chorus
one more time to say i love you always
and keeping faith and letting love find a way
one more time to say i love you always
and keeping faith and letting love find a way

could you love me to death death death death
i love you to death i love you to death
could you love me could you love me
