shes wearing dresses on the borderline look again
awaking senses that were lost in time make amends
this liberation is the one theyll love for ages
hey man ive seen it coming yeah

just cut those tresses make you look so fine youre a ten
put on that shirt and youll look so divine drown in men
this generation wont forgive those signs of aging
hey man ive seen it coming yeah

ive got my ticket for the next makeover
ive got my ticket for a stolen ride

the crucifixion of the love weve known for ages
