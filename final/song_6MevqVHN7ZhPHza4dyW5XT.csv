youve got the best of both worlds
youre the kind of girl who can take down a man
and lift him back up again
you are strong but youre needy
humble but youre greedy
and based on your body language
and shoddy cursive ive been reading
your style is quite selective
though your mind is rather reckless
well i guess it just suggests
that this is just what happiness is

chorus
hey what a beautiful mess this is
its like picking up trash in dresses

verse 2
well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
kind of turn themselves into knives
and dont mind my nerve you could call it fiction
but i like being submerged in your contradictions dear
cause here we are here we are

verse 3
although you are biased i love your advice
your comebacks ‒ theyre quick
and probably have to do with your insecurities
theres no shame in being crazy
depending on how you take these
words im paraphrasing this relationship were staging

hey what a beautiful mess this is
its like picking up trash in dresses

verse 4
well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
kind of turn themselves into blades
and kind and courteous is a life ive heard
but its nice to say that we played in the dirt
cause here here we are here we are
here we are
here we are
here we are
here we are
here we are
here we are
here we are

were still here
what a beautiful mess this is
its like taking a guess when the only answer is yes

verse 5
through timeless words and priceless pictures
well fly like birds not of this earth
and tides ‒ they turn ‒ and hearts disfigure
but thats no concern when were wounded together

outro
and we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
but its nice today oh the wait was so worth it3embed"
