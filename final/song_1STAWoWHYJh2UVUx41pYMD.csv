just because im losin
doesnt mean im lost
doesnt mean ill stop
doesnt mean im across

verse 2
just because im hurtin
doesnt mean im hurt
doesnt mean i didnt get what i deserved
no better and no worse

chorus
i just got lost
every river that i tried to cross
every door i ever tried was locked
oh and im just waitin til the shine wears off

verse 3
you might be a big fish
in a little pond
doesnt mean youve won
cause along may come a bigger one

chorus
and youll be lost
every river that you tried to cross
every gun you ever held went off
oh and im just waitin til the firin stopped
oh and im just waitin til the shine wears off
