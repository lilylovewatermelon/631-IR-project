would have given up my life for you
guess its true what they say about love its blind
girl you lied straight to my face looking in my eyes
and i believed you cause i loved you more than life
and all you had to do
was apologize

chorus
you didnt say youre sorry
i dont understand
you dont care that you hurt me
and now im half the man
that i used to be when it was you and me
you didnt love me enough
my heart may never mend
and youll never get to love me again
no no no no no no

verse 2
sadness has me at the end of the line
helpless watched you break this heart of mine
and loneliness only wants you back here with me
common sense knows that youre not good enough for me
and all you had to do
was apologize and mean it

wish like hell i could go back in time

forgiveness says that i should give you one more try
but its too late its over now
