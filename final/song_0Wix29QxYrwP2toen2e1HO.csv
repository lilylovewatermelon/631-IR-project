patiently listenin
youre keepin your distance but
i was still hoping that we could be friends
but if thats too much then ill ask no more than
this which weve buried
yes i had one once but i guess shes married
and yes i have a photograph somewhere
dont ask ill tell
if you really wanna know that bad

isnt she beautiful

chorus 1
were all pretty when we die
prim and pale in black and white white oh
go and put on your perfume
smile away the afternoon noon

verse 2
well your brother got married to a faithless harness
traded his drums for angels voices
ah ah ah
shotgun wedding on the porch
on the fifth of may
and everybody sayin yeah theyll be okay
theyre so great
theyre so nice together
youre the happy couple may you die together

may you prosper till you die
prim and pale in black and white white oh
may we dance until it rains
may we drink to hide our shame shame oh
