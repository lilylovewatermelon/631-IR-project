theres no hate
theres no love
only dark skies that hang above
i call your name as i walk alone
send a signal to guide me home

prechorus
light the night up youre my dark star
and now youre falling away

chorus
but i found in you what was lost in me
in a world so cold and empty
i could lie awake just to watch you breathe
in the dead of night you went dark on me

verse 2
youre the cause
the antidote
the sinking ship that i could not let go
you led my way then disappeared
how could you just walk away and leave me here

prechorus
light the night up youre my dark star
and now youre falling away
you might also likechorus
but i found in you what was lost in me
in a world so cold and empty
i could lie awake just to watch you breathe
in the dead of night you went dark on me

bridge
blinded i cant do this on my own
you are all ive got to guide me home

chorus
i could lie awake just to watch you breathe
in the dead of night you went dark on me
dark on me dark on me
dark on me dark on me
dark on me
i could lie awake just to watch you breathe
in the dead of night you went dark on me
