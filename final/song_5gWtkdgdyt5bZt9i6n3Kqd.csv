my friends dont walk they run
skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
poppin poppin balloons with guns
getting  high off helium
we paint white roses red
each shade from a different persons head
this dream dream is a killer
getting drunk with the blue caterpillar

prechorus
im peeling the skin off my face
cause i really hate being safe
the normals they make me afraid
the crazies they make me feel sane

chorus
im nuts baby im mad
the craziest friend that youve ever had
you think im psycho you think im gone
tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
over the bend entirely bonkers
you like me best when im off my rocker
tell you a secret im not alarmed
so what if im crazy the best people are
all the best people are crazy
all the best people are

prechorus
im peeling the skin off my face
cause i really hate being safe
the normals they make me afraid
the crazies they make me feel sane

chorus
im nuts baby im mad
the craziest friend that youve ever had
you think im psycho you think im gone
tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
over the bend entirely bonkers
