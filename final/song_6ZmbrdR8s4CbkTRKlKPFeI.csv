hate your goddamn motherfuckin shittyass band
hate the way youve got my back while youre holding out your hand
hate the way you pussies talk shit hiding on the web
just the fact you think you know me makes me fucked up in the head
hate your nails hate your hair hate the fact i even care
hate the way you said you loved me but you fuckin werent there
hate your friends hate your folks its a stupid fuckin hoax
hate the way i tried to change when the whole thing was a joke

chorus
i hate you thats an understatement
i hate you for who you are
i hate you and all you stand for
i dont care anymore
i gave you a hundred chances
you gave me a hundred ways to hate

verse 2
hate your face hate your lies hate the blank look in your eyes
hate your needs hate your wants hate the way you love to taunt
hate your voice makes me cringe every time i hear you speak
its uncomfortable to know you share the same air as me
hate your lack of common sense and im tired of compromising
take a good look at the end cause its just on the horizon
ive been wrong about a lot of shit this i know is true
theres a hundred fuckin things that i hate about you
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likechorus
i hate you thats an understatement
i hate you for who you are
i hate you and all you stand for
i dont care anymore
i gave you a hundred chances
you gave me a hundred ways to hate

outro
i hate you a hundred ways
i dont care a hundred ways to hate
i gave you a million chances
you gave me a hundred ways to hate
a hundred ways
a hundred ways to hate5embed"
