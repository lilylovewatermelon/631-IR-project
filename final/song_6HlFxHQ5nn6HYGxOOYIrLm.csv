thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
pushing all the mercy down down down
i wanna see you try to take a swing at me
come on gonna put you on the ground ground ground

why are you trying to make fun of me
you think its funny what the fuck you think its doing to me
you take your turn lashing out at me
i want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

chorus
all of my hate cannot be bound
i will not be drowned
by your thoughtless scheming
so you can try to tear me down
beat me to the ground
i will see you screaming

verse 2
thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
im above you smiling at you drown drown drown

and ill pull the trigger and youre down down down

why are you trying to make fun of me
