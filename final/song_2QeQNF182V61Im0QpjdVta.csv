intro ti
nine light years away just outside of the kepler solar system
we find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
with a story of a young rebel against the system
refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
he chose the mood of fuck this shit
at that moment the one known as jacques turned to scott
chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
in the middle of their metamorphosis not quite through with their journey
aint made it to wherever the fuck they gon be in life
but wherever it is its better than here so fuck you and fuck this

chorus travis scott
no monogamy ménage with me
pornography surrounding me
you get high with me you come down with me
thats all i need in my fantasy
all these flashing lights— lights— lights—
give you some of me you want all of me
and get high with me and come down with me
yeah thats all i need in my fantasy

bridge travis scott
you remind me of my ex crazy love
we designed our love around the drugs

ima rub a dub tryna get a nut

and get high with me and come down with me
yeah thats all i need in my fantasy

segue ti
the story of the bastard was never told
the soul of a bastard was never sold
will he survive or will he fold up
living like a bronco lifestyle wild and untamed
sits at the top a long list of no named
misfits cant wait to get a chance to say fuck you
to the ones who said fuck you
til you doing yo thing codeine and cocaine cartels
who leads the charge of this young mob
la flame he hears in his head the world is yours yours yours
part ii

chorus travis scott
