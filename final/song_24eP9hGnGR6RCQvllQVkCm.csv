take pictures out of all the frames
pack up your love with all your things
see if it helps give it a week
i bet no one else gets you like me

prechorus nick jonas
cause i know you think you’re better off without me now
sayin all you need is space
but baby we can work this out

chorus nick jonas  joe jonas
but dont throw it away this time just take a little time to think
don’t throw it away its fine just dont forget to think of me
dont throw it away your mind is messin with your head again
instead of walkin away we should give it a break til we know what to say
dont throw it away

verse 2 nick jonas
don’t save the words ’til its too late
i know it hurts and that’s okay
if its too much to open up then give it time
i see it in your eyes so lets sleep on it tonight

prechorus nick jonas
cause i know you think you’re better off without me now
sayin all you need is space
but baby we can work this out
