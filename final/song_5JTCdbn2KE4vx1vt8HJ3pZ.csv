to the teller down at the bank
youre just another checking account
to the plumber that came today
youre just another house
at the airport ticket counter
youre just another fare
at the beauty shop at the mall
well youre just another head of hair

chorus
well thats alright thats ok
if you dont feel important honey
all ive got to say is
to the world
you may be just another girl
but to me
baby you are the world

verse 2
to the waiter at the restaurant
youre just another tip
to the guy at the ice cream shop
youre just another dip
when you cant get reservations
cause you dont have the clout
or you didnt get an invitation
cause somebody left you out

thats alright thats ok
if you dont feel important honey
all ive got to say is
to the world
you may be just another girl
but to me
baby you are the world


verse 3
you think youre one of millions but youre one in a million to me
when you wonder if you matter baby look into my eyes
and tell me cant you see youre everything to me

chorus
thats alright thats ok
if you dont feel important honey
all ive got to say is
to the world
you may be just another girl
but to me
baby you are the world

chorus
thats alright thats ok
if you dont feel important honey
all ive got to say is
to the world
you may be just another girl
but to me
baby you are the worldembed"
