irocconthebeat

you made this shit pharaoh

verse 1 lil durk
how she acting funny i bought her her titties
nigga she be fuckin aint none of my business
upping my quota thats a part of my fendi
dont matter where im at bitch im known for the trenches
we the first niggas put drums in the city
we robbed the niggas put drugs in the city
fuck where you from cause i know that you with it
check on his ass ima handle my business
trust you enough to fuck you more than once
and you gotta be a killer just to hang with us
if you talkin bout murders theres no hangin up
run up on em bow aint no onеonone
i got the money so who im runnin from
i got a lawyеr that cost a honey bun
before i buy pussy ill buy a hundred guns
judge told me nigga died with my gun
2010 reese said ralph lauren
died close feel like he died in my arms
reinstated they denied my bond
a nigga play with smurk he not that smart
sucked it twice and im still not hard
niggas cry out loud when they gettin shot
that nigga word dont stand on my block
fuck what you heard im the man of my block

verse 2 lil baby

im really down ima show how im get down
hard on the bitch man i shouldve been pimpin

im really laughin these lil niggas temptin me
i get offended when niggas say tap in
i bought lil bro nem celine just to trap in
i got more clothes in my closet than saks fifth
i watched jb make a deuce do a backflip
i know you really dont know you just act hip
i done took off for real now how that feel
bro aint never gon change i know thats real
just run outta here straight to the backfield
i sleep good every night now im happy
how you go where you go im a trapper for real
how you know what you know i adapted for real
we too rich with the feds we put shit in the mail
my lifestyle expensive this shit high as hell
lil bro tryna score so i gave him a layup
i gotta go somewhere no i cant lay up
bitch stop playin you better not tell
chorus lil durk
