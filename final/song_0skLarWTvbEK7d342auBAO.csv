i hopelessly helplessly wonder why
everything has changed round me
id tell it to your face but you lost your face along the way
and id say it on the phone if i thought you were alone
why do things have to change

prechorus
you dont need my pictures on your wall
you say you need no one
and you dont need my secret midnight call
i guess you need no one

chorus
is anybody waiting at home for you
because its time that will tell
if its heaven if its hell or if its
anybody waiting at home for you
because its time that will tell this tale

verse 2
youre in and out up and down
wonder if youre lost or found
but i got my hands on you
are you strong enough to tow the line
are you gonna make me yours or do i make you mine
im in and out im up and down
wonder if im lost or found but i need your hands on me now

you dont need my pictures on your wall
you say you need no one
and you dont need my secret midnight call
i guess you need no one

chorus
is anybody waiting at home for you
because its time that will tell
if its heaven if its hell or if its
anybody waiting at home for you
because its time that will tell this tale
