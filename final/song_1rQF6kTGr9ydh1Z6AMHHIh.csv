theres a rehab for every kind
lay your head down baby
tell me whats on your mind
youve got so many heartaches
take em one at a time
imagine each ones a man
takes a number stands in a line
if you draw the line baby
i will walk the walk
but i may sow some seeds baby
and i may pick a lock
my door is always open
if you find you wanna talk
and when youre good and ready
we can go as deep as you want

so just ask just ask
baby just ask
ill do anything for you
all you gotta do is ask
so just ask just ask
baby baby just ask
ill do anything for you
all you gotta do is ask

well now when all the streets and all the heads are turning
you will know you will know what you hold you will know
you will know

the sunlight is a villain
when it takes away the night
youre about the same baby
when you tell me that youre all right
youve made off with my body
and youre poisoning my mind
but i know i have your love babe
and you know that you always have mine

so just ask just ask
baby just ask
ill do anything for you
all you gotta do is ask
so just ask just ask
baby baby just ask
ill do anything for you
all youve got to do is askembed"
