i am waiting on a mountaintop
for the moment that the sky will strike
my apologies are forever lost
soon to ashes in a flash of light
miles away from me hope is fading soon
gone forever its a waste of time
my intentions like a sweeter room
only bring to me a fading light

chorus
locked up forever inside
i look to the stars and ask why
oh if they could just teach my dark heart to feel
all ive saved‚ oh why
thrown away oh

verse 2
i am waning like a single bloom
lost forever in the storm of life
my intentions like a sweeter room
only bring to me a fading light

chorus
locked up forever inside
i look to the stars and ask why
oh if they could just show these wounds how to heal
here i am‚ oh why
my last stand‚ oh why
and i know
for all the rising and falling theres nothing to show

throw me down throw me down
throw me down its been raining
throw me down and now i will pay
throw me down woe is come to me
throw me down i am the lightning rod
throw me down i am waiting
throw me down on a mountaintop
throw me down oh above me
throw me down he will strike me

chorus
locked up forever inside
i look to the stars and ask why
oh if they could just teach my dark heart to feel
all i am‚ oh why
my last stand‚ oh why
and i know
for all the rising and falling theres nothing to show1embed"
