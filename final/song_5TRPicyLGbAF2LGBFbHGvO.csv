flashing lights

verse 1 kanye west
she dont believe in shootin stars
but she believe in shoes and cars
wood floors in the new apartment
couture from the stores departments
you more like love to start shit
im more of the trips to florida
ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
straight from a page of your favorite author
and the weather so breezy
man why cant life always be this easy
she in the mirror dancin so sleazy
i get a call like where are you yeezy
and try to hit you with the olwuwopte
til i got flashed by the paparazzi
damn these niggas got me
i hate these niggas more than the nazis
chorus dwele  connie mitchell
as i recall i know you love to show off
but i never thought that you would take it this far
but what do i know
flashing lights
what do i know know
flashing lights

i know its been a while sweetheart
we hardly talk i was doin my thing
i know i was foul baby
abay lately youve been all on my brain
and if somebody wouldve told me a month ago
frontin though yo i wouldnt wanna know
if somebody wouldve told me a year ago
itll go get this difficult
feelin like katrina with no fema
like martin with no gina
like a flight with no visa
first class with the seat back i still see ya
in my past you on the other side of the glass
of my memorys museum
im just sayin hey mona lisa
come home you know you cant roam without caesar

chorus dwele  connie mitchell
as i recall i know you love to show off
but i never thought that you would take it this far
but what do i know
flashing lights
what do i know know
flashing lights
as you recall you know i love to show off
but you never thought that i would take it this far
but what do you know
flashing lights
what do you know know
