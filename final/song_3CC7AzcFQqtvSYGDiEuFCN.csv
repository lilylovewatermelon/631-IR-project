she wore a dress with cherries on it
going somewhere where shed be wanted
in a town this small all they do is talk

no wedding ring chipped fingernail polish
she always wished that she could go to college
but some dreams fade
they just slip away

she started to show a few months ago
and she had to go
thats how she wound up

chorus
on the backseat of a greyhound bus
head hung down with the windows up
staring at the rest of her life
she never thought this would be the place
where she would find her saving grace
but she fell in love
she fell in love
on the backseat of a greyhound bus

verse 2
the moon was full
the stars were smiling
god has a funny sense of timing
the baby came on the interstate
see sara evans liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likesomewhere between jackson and memphis
she finally found what she had been missing
she cried and laughed while the red lights flashed

sweet baby girl
she looked into the face of a new
the face of a brand new world

chorus x2
on the backseat of a greyhound bus
heart so full that it could bust
staring at the rest of her life
she never thought this would be the place
where she would find her saving grace
but she fell in love
she fell in love
on the backseat of a greyhound bus

sweet baby girl
she found a brand new world

on the backseat of a greyhound bus
heart so full that it could bust
staring at the rest of her life
she never thought this would be the place
where she would find her saving grace
but she fell in love
she fell in love
on the backseat of a greyhound bus
outro
she wore a dress with cherries on it
going somewhere where shed be wantedembed"
