city sidewalks
busy sidewalks
dressed in holiday style
in the air theres a feeling of christmas

children laughing
people passing
meeting smile after smile
and on every street corner you hear

chorus
silver bells silver bells silver bells silver bells
its christmas time in the city
ringaling ringaling hear them ring
soon it will be christmas day

verse 2
strings of street lights
even stop lights
blink a bright red and green
as the shoppers rush home with their treasures

hear the snow crunch
see the kids bunch
this is santas big scene
and above all this bustle you hear
