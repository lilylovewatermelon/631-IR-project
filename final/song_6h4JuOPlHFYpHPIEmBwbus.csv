mmmmurda

verse 1 lil durk
i told my daughter she dont understand who her daddy is
ill tell you somethin dont run your mouth but i bet he did
landlord came to pick the rent up but i aint let him in
its not being embarrassed im too addicted to this medicine
hundredthousand on my take it back tell him dont threat again
pray to the high power hope the judge give me a severance
young niggas turnt up with the check look like a settlement
its only me and a different couple rappеrs who aint checkin in yeah
you will nevеr see my name in paperwork never never
and this a street nigga on my case but he a teller teller
and i had a deep talk with my dawgs and that shit feelin better
4tf his shit be big whenever we get together
i felt like a lil boy round this bitch had to get my shit together
i told my bitch that shit is a goal when you shit together
aint talkin lean switch his beam shit my kit together
some of this shit be temporary but loyalty this shit forever oh
every time your dawg die they forget about his mama nem oh
i done left his ass around some cash and he aint pocket shit oh

how you say your ass a boss but you dont provide niggas oh
and i really love my brothers even though i clash with em yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

the second time aint nothin like the first you gotta make it count
every day im tryna break this curse i gotta make it out
we aint had no other way to go we had to take a route
soon as they come in we tryna get em out
one day we gon run into you nigga better watch your mouth
really dont be demons i dont believe it that shit all for clout
i can make my people nem come see you for a small amount
im hot as a fever you know we the ones they talking bout yeah

verse 2 lil baby
steady tryna get it uplifting my city
asked the da can we fix this i need durk to get acquitted
bad bitch with me suck me til im finished
we both got a lot to lose so she wont never tell my business
nobody hang with me i aint tryna have no codefendants
you dont know how it feel where everywhere you live you get evicted
rubber band money the day i signed my deal i lost half a ticket
i wasnt even rappin yet i moved my mama out the trenches
twentyone to twentytwo im talkin fresh up out of prison
i wont give a damn if i did it then you can
gambling won a hundred grand and started with two bands
im one of them ones to sell a truck load with a few plays
im one of them ones who wear the same clothes for a few days when im grindin
otf and 4pf you know this shit get slime
i wont get on one knee ill pay one mill for a diamond though
you know where to find me i aint hidin ho
chorus lil baby
the second time aint nothin like the first you gotta make it count
every day im tryna break this curse i gotta make it out
we aint had no other way to go we had to take a route
soon as they come in we tryna get em out
one day we gon run into you nigga better watch your mouth
really dont be demons i dont believe it that shit all for clout
i can make my people nem come see you for a small amount
im hot as a fever you know we the ones they talking bout yeah1embed"
