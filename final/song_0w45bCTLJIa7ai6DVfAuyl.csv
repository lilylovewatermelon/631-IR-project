everyones feelin pretty
its hotter than july
tho the worlds full of problems
they couldnt touch us
even if they tried

from the park i hear rhythms
marleys hot on the box
tonite therell be a party
on the corner at the end of the block

chorus
didnt know you
would be jammin it
til the break of dawn
see nobody ever told me
that you would be jammin it
til the break of dawn
well be jammin it
jammin it jammin it
jam on

verse 2
they want us to join the fighting
but our answer today
is to let all our worries
like the breeze through our fingers slip away

third worlds right on the one
nows the time for celebration
cause weve only just begun

chorus
didnt know that you
would be jammin until the break of dawn
