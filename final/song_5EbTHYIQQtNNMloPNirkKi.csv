news drug abuse to the future and the hypocrites cry
who dies next
and i tell you a story from the underground nothing funny about
get down to get hyped
kill me and no ones gonna miss me
feel the heat of the highway
to the car to the key of reality forward

verse 1ab hanin elias  carl crack
more and more and more and theres no way back
bored i am yes i can
you may not count in the new world order
and now its time to die cause i can see the sun
the end is near im feeling high
how fast can i run

prechorus carl crack
risin risin to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
one two three and four

chorus carl crack  hanin elias

verse 2a carl crack  hanin elias
tomorrow tomorrow always tomorrow
there is no future in the western dreamin
we feel it we must beat em
its too late to create a new world
alternative living it must be given a chance
water the problems solution
no solution if you cant use it

verse 2b hanin elias
and then i heard the siren of the police
my blood went up to 90 degrees
you cant see white cats in the snow
oh human being how low can you go

prechorus carl crack
risin risin to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
