yeah

verse 1
she was made to blow you away
she dont care what any man say
well you can watch her strut but keep your mouth shut
or its ruination day

chorus
well now shes long
along gone
oh now shes long
yeah now shes long gone like moses through the corn

verse 2
well her eyes theyre rubies and pearls
and shes not made like those other girls
well her lashes flap and they smack men back
like springs bouncing off of her curls

chorus
oh now shes long
along gone
nananana now shes long
along gone like moses through the corn
oh rock onyou might also like1embed"
