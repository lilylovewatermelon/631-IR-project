well i dont feel better when im fucking around
and i dont write better when im stuck in the ground
so dont teach me a lesson cause ive already learned
yeah the sun will be shining and my children will burn

hook
oh the heart beats in its cage

verse 2
i dont want what you want i dont feel what you feel
see im stuck in a city but i belong in a field
yeah we got left left left left left left left
now its three in the morning and youre eating alone

hook
oh the heart beats in its cage

bridge
all our friends theyre laughing at us
all of those you loved you mistrust
help me im just not quite myself
look around theres no one else left

verse 3
i went to the concert and i fought through the crowd
guess i got too excited when i thought you were around
oh he gets left left left left left left left
and im sorry you were thinking i would steal your fire
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likehook
oh the heart beats in its cage
yes the heart beats in its cage

and the heart beats in its cage14embed"
