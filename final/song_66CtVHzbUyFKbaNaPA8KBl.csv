looking for something ive never seen
alone and im inbetween
the place that im from and the place that im in
a city ive never been
i found a friend or should i say foe
said theres a few things you should know
we dont want you to see we come and we go
here today gone tomorrow

chorus
were only taking turns
holding this world
its how its always been
when youre older you will understand

verse 2
if i say who i know it just goes to show
you need me less than i need you
take it from me we dont give sympathy
you can trust me trust nobody
but i said you and me we dont have honesty
the things we dont wanna speak
ill try to get out but i never will
traffic is perfectly still

were only taking turns
holding this world
its how its always been
when youre older you will understand

bridge
and then again maybe you dont
and then again maybe you wont

outro
when youre older you might understand
