you make me feel that im out to get to you

what you going to do when the evening comes
just give in to me let me sail on your cloud

my hearts on fire
full of desire
gotta make it better
cmon try harder

hearts on sober
let me take you higher
this burning desire
will make you surrender

tone it down i dont want to go straight
but now is the time and our love is here to stay

so we had to do what you done to me
wont get no relief if i dont have you

my hearts on fire
full of desire
gotta make it better
cmon try harder
you might also likehearts on sober
let me take you higher
this burning desire
will make you surrender

my hearts on fire full of desire
gotta make it better cmon try harder

my hearts on fire
full of desire
gotta make it better
cmon try harder

hearts on sober
let me take you higher
this burning desire
will make you surrender

my hearts on fire
full of desire
gotta make it better
cmon try harder

my heart is on fire

hearts on sober
let me take you higher
this burning desire
will make you surrenderembed"
