im your biggest fan but i guess thats just not good enough
is it cause i wear my hair weird or because i like to play diablo
dont act like you dont know what im talking bout
cause i really dont wanna have to spell it out
the next time you call me
im gon sit and stare at the screen
waiting for the call to end

chorus 1
you stuck me in the friend zone
thats that bullshit
im gonna play diablo either way
you can come or you could go

verse 2
because id rather play mortal kombat anyway hey
im all about my johnny cage
if youre not bringing bottles i suggest you start to walk away
bitch dont kill my vibe
i can tell youve kinda got uncomfortable
so let me break it down for you
dont call me dont text me after 2 am
unless you plan on giving me some
because i got enough friends
see thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus 2
i would throw you in the garbage
cause you play too many games
im better off by myself
loving yous bad for my health

outro
no one wants to be in the friend zone
friend zone
