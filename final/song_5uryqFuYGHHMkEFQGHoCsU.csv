for her first number miss roxie hart would like to sing a song of love and devotion dedicated to her dear husband amos

roxie
sometimes im right
sometimes im wrong
but he doesnt care
hell string along
he loves me so
that funny honey of mine

sometimes im down
sometimes im up
but he follows round
like some droopyeyed pup
he loves me so
that funny honey of mine

he aint no sheik
thats no great physique
and lord knows he aint got the smarts
but look at that soul
i tell you that whole
is a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts
and if you knew him like me
i know youd agree
you might also likewhat if the world
slandered my name
why hed be right there
taking the blame
he loves me so
and it all suits me fine
that funny sunny
honey hubby of mine

roxie

roxie amos spoken
if they string me up boy im down at the garage workin my butt off 14 hours a day
well ill know who brought the twine and shes out there munchin on bonbons
and trampin around like some goddamn floozy
thought she could pull the wool over my eyes huh
that scummy crummy i wasnt born yesterday i tell ya there are some things
dummy hubby of mine a man just cant take and this time she pushed me too far
that little chiseler
boy what a sap i was2embed"
