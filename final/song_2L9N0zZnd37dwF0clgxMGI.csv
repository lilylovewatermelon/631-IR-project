ceilings plaster
cant you just make it move faster
lovely to be sitting here with you
youre kinda cute but its raining harder
my shoes are now full of water
lovely to be rained on with you
its kinda cute but its so short

chorus
then youre driving me home
and i dont wanna leave
but i have to go
you kiss me in your car
and it feels like the start of a movie ive seen before
before

verse 2
bed sheets no clothes
touch me like nobody else does
lovely to just lay here with you
youre kinda cute and i would say all of this
but i dont wanna ruin the moment
lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

chorus
but its over
then youre driving me home
and it kinda comes out as i get up to go
you kiss me in your car
and it feels like the start of a movie ive seen before
you might also likeoutro
but its not real
and you dont exist
and i cant recall the last time i was kissed
it hits me in the car
and it feels like the end of a movie ive seen before
