its hard to remember how it felt before
now ive found the love of my life
passes things get more comfortable
everything is going right

chorus
and after all the obstacles
its good to see you now with someone else
and its such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
after all that weve been through
i know were cool
i know were cool

verse 2
and we used to think it was impossible
now you call me by my new last name
memories seem like so long ago
time always kills the pain

chorus
remember harbor boulevard
the dreaming days where the mess was made
look how all the kids have grown
we have changed but were still the same
after all that weve been through
i know were cool
i know were cool
yeah i know were cool

chorus
and ill be happy for you
if you can be happy for me

so far from where weve been

i know were cool
