i’m talking bout roots
i cant hate where im from
cause where im from made me
i came from the bottom of the slums
but now i got me me
that’s because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots

verse 1
hey i can’t be mad at what got me ahead
i dont regret my ghetto struggle due to my success
it aint that beautiful to write on overcoming stress
top ramen noodle soup thank pappy for the fact i was fed
look at me now but all before hey mr skid row
the dirty south ain’t just a name the way i’ve been poor
the projects brown and white i call it gizmo
went from a gremlin to them cars in jiggas video
can’t find a meal to a mil only god know it
no record deal to a deal i work hard for it
can i live too i’m living like my momma told it
before you reap it gotta sew it

chorus
i’m talking bout roots
i cant hate where im from
cause where im from made me
i came from the bottom of the slums
but now i got me me
that’s because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots
see flo rida liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 2
hey still on my kunta kinte
somebody had to bleed just for me to get away
my sister had to leave i respect her staying safe
oh yeah i had to grieve but i’m stronger to this day
pain i cant ignore it you might say im ignorant
i’m mistaking for courage victory so gorgeous
make it through two bush i can make it through any forest
hunger gave me the wish but the bottom is so important
37 ave and 187 street
miami carol city now i’m part of a legacy
i’m thankful for the hood what is love without jealousy
there’s only five letters really help me

chorus
i’m talking bout roots
i cant hate where im from
cause where im from made me
i came from the bottom of the slums
but now i got me me
that’s because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots yeah yeah yeah
i’m talking bout roots

verse 3
hey i know the seeds been planted
it’s damaging my soul but my dreams been granted
that triple life towards much deeper than earths planet
what could i want more than redoing i never panic
gets no lower than the ground beneath your feet
a man will stand for nothing if he falls for defeat
a boulder in the hand better than all in the street
if you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease
roots before the branches roots before the mansions
roots before your paper crazier than marilyn manson
roots with your grandparents roots under your canvas
roots whether you black white or spanish
chorus
i’m talking bout roots
i cant hate where im from
cause where im from made me
i came from the bottom of the slums
but now i got me me
that’s because of my roots yeah yeah yeah yeah
