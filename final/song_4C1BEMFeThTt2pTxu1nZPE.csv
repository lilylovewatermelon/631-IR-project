was happiness a fad
or was it in the lost and found again behind the issues
it might not be so bad
were all addicted to our tragedy i guess its what it had to be

chorus
with nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
matter of in fact its harder still when youre around
nothin on my back i cant help but drown
switch

verse 2
i might as well belong to both of you
and the mess you always seem to drag me through
that night forever always haunting me
but i guess it is what its supposed to be
but spare your thoughts of sympathy

chorus
nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
matter of in fact its harder still when youre around
nothin on my back i cant help but drown

bridge
with nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
with nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
with nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
with nothing on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found

chorus
with nothin on my back its still enough to bring me down
my minds about to crack cause what i thought could not be found
matter of in fact its harder still when youre around
with nothin on my back i cant help but drown3embed"
