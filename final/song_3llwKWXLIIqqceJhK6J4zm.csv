you fought me once but not again
let me feel your heavy hand
i will clean your fuckin mess
and leave no trace of evidence
chorus
i am losing you again
let me out and let me in
cause youre not alone here not at all
let me belong here break my fall

verse 2
shelter me from this again
dedicated to the end
help me break my conscience in
to free us from our innocence

chorus
i am losing you again
let me out and let me in
cause youre not alone here not at all
let me belong here break my fall
