on a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
by a freeway i confess i was lost in the pages
of a book full of death reading how well die alone
and if were good well lay to rest anywhere we want to go

chorus
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
ill wait for you there like a stone
ill wait for you there alone

verse 2
and on my deathbed i will pray to the gods and the angels
like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
to a place i recall i was there so long ago
the sky was bruised the wine was bled and there you led me on

chorus
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
ill wait for you there like a stone
ill wait for you there alone alone

guitar solo

and on i read until the day was gone
and i sat in regret of all the things ive done
for all that ive blessed and all that ive wronged
in dreams until my death i will wander on

chorus
in your house i long to be
room by room patiently
ill wait for you there like a stone
ill wait for you there alone alone75embed"
