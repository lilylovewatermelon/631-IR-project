a mechanical sacrificial calf for you

i held in my hands
the beating heart of a robot

just for you

both halves are the better half
like a joke trying to make another joke laugh hahah
stasis is what you bought
like a rickshaw getting pulled around
by another rickshaw rickshaw
in the past talking present tense
gonna break it gonna wreck it
gonna try to make it all make sense
stasis is what you got
like a rickshaw getting pulled around
by another rickshaw

steam engenius you see
steam engenius enough
to bring my own damn doom

well deep inside and everybody knew it was them
it was all on them

things rang of stories greek
i didnt want it you gave me deity

verse 4
i was thought up by man to think better than them
then revered admired and then destroyed or something by them
youd think that my demise was thought up by them
oh even though that was my own damn plan

what a waste of words
what a waste of strength
well i spoke in binary you broke your thought
you meant for it

the beating heart of a robot
he lost his car just there crying out waiting for you in the parking lot

like a rickshaw getting pulled around
by another rickshaw6embed"
