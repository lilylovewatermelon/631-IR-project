hey
hey
hey

verse 1
it’s 8 am
this hell i’m in
seems i’ve crossed the line again
for being nothing more than who i am
so break my bones
and throw your stones
we all know that life ain’t fair
but there is more of us
we’re everywhere

prechorus
we don’t have to take this
back against the wall
we don’t have to take this
we can end it all

chorus
all you’ll ever be
is a faded memory of a bully
make another joke
while they hang another rope
so lonely
push him to the dirt
‘til the words don’t hurt
can you hear me can you hear me
no ones gonna cry
on the very day you die
you’re a bully

hey

verse 2
think it through
you can’t undo
whenever i see black and blue
i feel the past
i share the bruise

with everyone
who’s come and gone
my head is clear
my voice is strong
now i’m right here to right the wrong

prechorus
we don’t have to take this
back against the wall
we don’t have to take this
we can end it all

chorus
all you’ll ever be
is a faded memory of a bully
make another joke
while they hang another rope
so lonely
push him to the dirt
‘til the words don’t hurt
can you hear me can you hear me
no ones gonna cry
on the very day you die
you’re a bully

it’s 8 am
the hell i’m in
your voice is strong
now right the wrong

chorus
all you’ll ever be
is a faded memory of a bully
all youll ever be all youll ever be
make another joke
while they hang another rope
so lonely so lonely
push him to the dirt
‘til the words don’t hurt
can you hear me can you hear me
no ones gonna cry
on the very day you die
you’re a bully no ones gonna cry on the very day you die

all you’ll ever be
we dont have to take this back against the wall
is a faded memory of a bully
we dont have to take this we could end it all
make another joke
we dont have to take this back against the wall
while they hang another rope
so lonely
we dont have to take this we could end it all
push him to the dirt
we dont have to take this back against the wall
‘til the words don’t hurt
can you hear me
we dont have to take this we could end it all
no ones gonna cry
we dont have to take this back against the wall
on the very day you die
you’re a bully
we dont have to take this we could end it all
