picking up the pieces of a life youve broken
stitching it together with the seems wide open

chorus
you keep crying crying crying
till you cannot see at all
you keep crying crying crying
til you cannot breath at all
what do you do when your alone
what do you do when no ones home
what do you do when your alone
out of control
now on your own

verse
never waking up
the alarm is broken
running in a dream and its like slow motion

bridge
alone  alone 

is there anyone out there
is there anyone out
all i need are the details
just to find a way out
you might also likeis there anyone out there
is there anyone out
all i need are the details
and a map of your mouth

chorus
you cant break away
what you cannot change
you cant break away
you cant break away
you cant break away
what you cannot change
you cant break away
you cant break awayembed"
