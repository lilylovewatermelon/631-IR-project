i keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
i was wasting her time waiting on dreams that just werent coming true
and this old highway seems to understand
leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
i got the window rolled down i got the radio up
im doing all that i can to get my mind off us

chorus
what i need to do is turn this car around
drive as fast as i can til i see the lights of our hometown
and run to her take her in my arms
make her see how sorry i am well that shouldnt be so hard
but i drive on and on and on

verse 2
eightyseven more miles gets me into baton rogue
theres a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that i can do
or maybe head up north to knoxville tennessee
i know my baby sister has got a couch where i can sleep
now the suns going down on my broken heart
lord i got to get back before i get too far

chorus
what i need to do is turn this car around
drive as fast as i can til i see the lights of our hometown
and run to her take her in my arms
make her see how sorry i am well that shouldnt be so hard
but i drive on
yes i drive on and on and on
