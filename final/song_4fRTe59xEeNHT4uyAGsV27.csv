verse 1 kanye west
how we stop the black panthers
ronald reagan cooked up an answer
you hear that what gil scott was hearin
when our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
crack raised the murder rate in dc and maryland
we invested in that its like we got merrill lynched
and we been hangin from the same tree ever since
sometimes i feel the music is the only medicine
so we cook it cut it measure it bag it
sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
thats that good shit we aint sure man
put the cd on your tongue—yeah thats pure man

verse 2 kanye west
from the place where the fathers gone
the mothers is hardly home
and the maricons lock us up in the audy home
how the mexicans say we just tryin to party holmes
they wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
who gave saddam anthrax
george bush got the answers
back in the hood its a different type of chemical
arm  hammer baking soda raised they whole quota
right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
dreams of being hova
went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
to bein the president—look theres hope man
this that inspiration for the moes and the folks man
shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
this the type of music that you make when you round that

outro malik yusef
our father give us this day our daily bread
before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
see i done did all this ol bullshit
and to atone i throw a lil somethinsomethin on the pulpit
we took that shit measured it and then cooked that shit
and what we gave back was crack music
and now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
so our mamas aint got to be they cooks and nannies
and we gon repo everything they ever took from granny
now the former slaves trade hooks for grammys
this dark diction has become americas addiction
those who aint even black use it
we gon keep baggin up this here crack music30embed"
