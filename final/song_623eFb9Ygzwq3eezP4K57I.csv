lately ive been thinking everyone around me is insane
march in single file cause theyre thinking that its the only way
but im never gonna fall in line
never gonna live like im color blind
living in between all the black and white oh
lately ive been thinking that theres something wrong inside my brain

chorus 1
i just feel so strange
strange
im out of mind most of the time
i just feel so strange
strange
the harder i try i dont recognize
i just feel so

verse 2
sometimes i cant tell between the highs when im lost in the low
everything is backwards when im staring at the people below
im standing outside like a renegade
when everybodys here in this masquerade
their eyes cut through like a razor blade oh
sometimes i cant tell that they are better with the devil they know

chorus 2
maybe im just strange
strange
im out of mind most of the time
i just feel so strange
strange
the harder i try i dont recognize
i just feel so
am i the only one alone
im losing grip on everything i used to know
strange
strange
im out of mind most of the time
i just feel so

i keep on running but i cant escape

cause i feel this way
cause i feel this way
am i the only one that feels this way
i keep on running but i cant escape
am i the only one that feels this way
cause i feel this way
cause i feel this way

chorus 2
i just feel so strange
