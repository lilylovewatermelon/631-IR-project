out in the country past the city limits sign
well theres a honky tonk near the county line
the joint starts jumpin every night when the sun goes down
they got whiskey women music and smoke
its where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin boogie

verse 2
ive got a good job i work hard for my money
when its quittin time i hit the door runnin
i fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
i go flyin down that highway to that hideaway
stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin boogie

chorus
yeah heel toe dosido come on baby lets go boot scootin
oh cadillac blackjack baby meet me outback were gonna boogie
oh get down turn around go to town boot scootin boogie

verse 3
the bartender asks me says son whatll it be
i want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin at me
the dance floors hoppin and its hotter than the fourth of july
i see outlaws inlaws crooks  straights all out makin it shake
doin the boot scootin boogie
