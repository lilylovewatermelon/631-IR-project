who lost their hope
a long a long time ago
i know someday that you will find it somehow
oh yea yea yea
because youre not too old
to accomplish goals
and all the answers are within your soul
its up to you you gotta figure it out
uhhuh

prechorus
whether you want love or money
good fortune or fame
you want a brand new car
you want the world to change
you better take some action right now oh yes
because theres nothing in the world that you cant get
so dont fill your life with confusion and regret
you better take some chances right now

chorus
well you can gain the world
but for the price of your soul
yes i know well i know yes i know
you can gain the world for the price of your soul
but i hope you take the road less traveled
and i hope you find the courage to grow
well i hope you find the courage to grow
see rebelution liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likeso now youre 45
and you realize
just what you wanna do with your life
just took some time for you to figure it out
cause everyone one of us
has a purpose here
sometimes its hidden underneath your fear
just takes some time for the truth to come out

prechorus
