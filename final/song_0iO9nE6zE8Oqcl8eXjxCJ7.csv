verse 3 taboo
someday youre wondering
if youre really gonna make it aw yeah
and sometimes you wanna know
is there anyone to save you aw yeah
i know youve been down before
like underneath the ground under the ground

to turn it all around turn it around
just know your time will come
go give it all you got give it all you got
dont stop believing
so give it all you got give it all you
