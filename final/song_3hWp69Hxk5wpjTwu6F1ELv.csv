the smell of coffee hits me as i open up my eyes
a southern angel wearing nothing but an apron and a smile
i say thank you sweet lord jesus
tell the truth dont know how i got so lucky

verse 2
all them boys from back in high school wonder how im still alive
hooked by a bull dove off a blue lake bridge
and wrecked my pickup twice
then she picked this here country boy out of all them other guys
and boys thats lucky

chorus
well i got a couple buddies playing football in the pros
and i know this guy who owns a whole dang beach in mexico
theres some with good looks some with brains
some rolling in the dough but yall trust me
id rather be lucky

verse 3
now you can win a powerball with a million in the pot
then go on in with ace and king and hit a straight flush on the flop
you can sit here on the creek bank fishin with a girl this hot
man thats plain lucky

ya my old college roommate is some big software ceo
my cousin benches 405 and flies his jet to rome

some rolling in the dough but yall trust me
id rather be lucky

bridge
well my babys one in a million fellas and i tell you thats the truth
so while youre out searching for one thats sweet and smart and sexy too
ill be home sipping a cold one for you
heres to hoping you get lucky

chorus
cause they sing about the girl that ive got on the radio
shes a cross between a cover of an outdoor life and vogue
theres folks who think they got it all folks rolling in the dough

id rather be lucky
id rather be lucky than good any day of the week girlembed"
