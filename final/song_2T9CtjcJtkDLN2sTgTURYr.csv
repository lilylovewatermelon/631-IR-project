out of the mainstream
out on your only
alone to find yourself somehow
so im a bit surprised to see you lately
beside a brand new baby
well if it makes you happy now

i guess thats great
i guess youre not mine
brand new baby beside you now
oh yeah i guess thats great
you dont see me cryin
and theres nobody to slow you down
oh yeah

if youre feeling sorry try to contain it
you dont need to save me
dont waste your pity anyhow
and you might like to believe im devastated
to see you with your lovin baby
well if it makes you happy now

i guess thats great
i guess youre not mine
brand new baby beside you now
oh yeah i guess thats great
you dont see me cryin
and theres nobody to slow you down
oh yeah
you might also likeseen you with your brand new baby
sure it phases me just to hear you laughing
makes me just a little crazy
but i guess its a great thing
if it makes you happy now now

oh i guess thats great
i guess youre not mine
brand new baby beside you now
oh yeah i guess thats great
you dont see me cryin
and theres nobody to slow you down
oh yeah

seen you with your brand new baby
sure it phases me just to hear you laughing
makes me just a little crazy
but i guess its a great thing
if it makes you happy nowembed"
