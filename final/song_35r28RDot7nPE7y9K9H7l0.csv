verse 1
and ive been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
i cant even leave my bedroom so i keep it pouring
and i aint seen the light of day since well thats not important its been long
and i was feeling whitney me and my homies sip the houston
cars and clothes thought i was winnin you knew i was losing
you told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and im done

chorus
to each their own and find peace in knowin
aint always broken but heres to hopin
show no emotion against your coding
just act as hard as you can
you dont need a friend
boy youre the man

and ive been looking for someone that i can buy my drugs from
it seems like every plug ran east to utah became mormons
drought comes around feels like i have no one to depend on
sober ugh
i had eighty beers on tuesday night i had nothing to do then
i put on a little dwight and sang a happy tune
and lit a cigarette stepped out the door had an appearance
drank more

chorus
to each their own and find peace in knowin
aint always broken but heres to hopin
show no emotion against your coding
just act as hard as you can
you dont need a friend
boy youre the man
