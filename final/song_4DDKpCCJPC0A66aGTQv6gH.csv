i was sitting there in a comfortable chair
and that was all that i needed
then my friend offered me a drink for us to share
and that was all that i needed
well then i felt at ease but then im not too hard to please
i guess you couldnt call me greedy
then i was shocked to look up and see rita hayworth there
in a place so seedy
she walked into the bar with her long red curly hair
and that was all that i needed
and i said to my friend good god were lucky men
just to even see her

chorus
take take take
take take take
take take take

verse 2
and i could not resist i just had to get close to her
and that was all that i needed
i walked and loomed around her table for a while
and that was all that i needed
then i said i hate to bug you maam but can i have your autograph
and that was all that i needed
she pressed her lips against a white piece of paper
and that was all that i needed
then i saw what she wrote my heart is in my mouth
and that was all that i needed
then she handed it to me and i think that she could see
that that was all that i needed
i started to walk away but then i remembered
hey i forgot to get a picture
so i asked her one more time could i have another favor
that was all that i needed
she was kind and posed with me then i knew my friend would see
my celebrity meeting

take take take
take take take
take take take

verse 3
she turned and said to me i need to go to sleep
and it seemed so mean
its almost as if she could not appreciate
how cool i was being
she said goodnight and walked away and i didnt know what to say
i just couldnt believe it
well its just not fair i want to get a piece of hair
that was all that i needed
or maybe a kiss on the cheek i wouldnt wash it for a week
that would be all that i needed
but she didnt even care that i was even there
what a horrible feeling3embed"
