verse 1
i told my man im having a barbecue
so grab some folks and wont you slide right through
he brought this shorty that i used to know
it brought me back to when i was in school
she said usher where have you been
we used to kick it every now and then
remember when i used to call your phone
and tell you come on cause my mamas gone
how about them times i had to throw a rock at your window
to let you know
to come downstairs and open the door
and after that baby it was on fa sho

verse 2
now shes asking me to take her
on a tour of my house so we can catch up
for all the time lost since i blew up
and became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
break the beat down let me tell you what im talking about
if youre not careful itll turn you out
its that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
even though you cant the memory will make you want some more
she used to understand me touch me hold me
taught me how to be a man
she used to kiss me all them things she used to show me
damn i wish that i could do it again

prechorus 2

cause i’m thinking ‘bout how good you used to feel
but i got a girl now and yo she’s right upstairs

verse 3
never had somebody thats so bad
somebody with a whole lot of body
attitude thatll make you wanna leave the one you with
cause you know how good it is
not a prissy little missy baby talk that slang
i used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thing
she was a friend of the fam hot without the glam not
when i be tripping she didnt really give a damn stop
its what i need to do cause i know what this is leading to
if i keep on thinking about that back and im gonna be right back in it
cause yo
