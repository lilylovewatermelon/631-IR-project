cant breathe cant think
been through enough
my friends on the streets stopped so abrupt
whats wrong they demand tell us whats up
no need one look and they all shut up
see its written all over anyone could see
no matter how my daily attitude seems
and im tired of missin what i can replace
so im tired of the world knowin your mistakes
and the tears keep rolling down my face

chorus
rolling down my face
rolling down my face
tears keep rolling down my face
rolling down my face ohoh
tears keep rolling down my face
rolling down my face
they keep rolling rolling rolling rolling
they keep rolling rolling rolling rolling ayy
they keep rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling rolling

verse  2
please take this phone i dont wanna talk
cause my makeups constantly runnin off
my bodys so quick to follow suit
cause i run from every memory of you
and every attempt to just to let it go
just keeps a knot caught in my throat
but its one thing i figured out
the last thing that i want is you around
but the tears keep rolling down

hey oh
you see its better to love and lost
than never love before
but i dont wanna hear no more

a thousand times i close my eyes i close my eyes
wishing i could turn back
the hands of time
i tried to tell myself i never loved you
i lied lied lied
but the tears keep rolling down
