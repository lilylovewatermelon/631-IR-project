extra abstract

i want to explore my practice as a hiphop artist and how my experiences in my life and education inform my practice as an arts facilitator in an ebd primary school i am guided by my experiences as an artist and art student as well as the tension i have experienced between my own cultural definition of self my education and my upbringing

the aspects of hiphop culture that have always engaged me are those of social conscience participation experimentation and multiculturalism it is a set of sensibilities and values shaped through my experience of hiphop that guide my facilitation

the concept of ‘edutainment’ runs throughout my work with ebd children the young people i work with have all experienced ‘failure’ and are often resistant to exposing themselves to seemingly risky experiences

although some of the content is directly hiphop based this is not so for much of my work this is rather informed by hiphop sensibility

my aim is to offer creative experiences that are fun educational and stimulate a desire to learn and take creative risks in my students

introduction the message – discovering hiphop

in 1984 at my gran’s house i came across a mysterious 12” single it had no picture just a record label logo depicting two dancers and a palm tree repeat printed on the black sleeve along with the word calypso which i assumed was a type of drink more intriguing was the name of the artist printed on the centre disc – grandmaster flash and the furious five the understated appearance the exotic dancers the crazy names and the title the message drew me in instantly i put the needle to the groove and listened intently to a young angry man telling stories about a life i had only seen in clips from movies as i was leaving the room for bed or before they were turned over due to their inappropriate content the first two verses talked of gangsters alleyways drunken women fags and cars being taken by the police this was a world i did not know but i understood enough to picture a world that i imagined would make me as angry as this man sounded then the third verse started in about the 5th minute of the track i sat and listened barely breathing to the storyteller narrating a tale of a young man not wanting to go to school joining a gang getting caught by the police thrown into jail where he was ‘used and abused and served like hell till one day he was found hung – dead in a cell’1 damn this was the most frightening and exciting story i had ever heard on a record it made me actually shiver i couldn’t listen to the whole musical outro as i needed to reload the vinyl and listen again this was different special and real it was a tragic alarm to the listener about the dangers of a world i was yet to be exposed to it was a lesson a poem a speech a warning this was the summer when melle mel spoke to me and opened my senses to an art form that was still in its infancy when grandmaster flash forced rhythm into my soul and sparked a curiosity for a culture that would mature as i did that would not go away that would become bigger and more potent than any of the furious five could ever have realised and all i knew was i wanted to be a part of it

part1 the breaks

my first five years of life were spent living in a nottingham council house with my mother and grand parents until my mum married and we moved to the house opposite at aged seven came the move to london during this time my mum’s relationship with my first stepdad deteriorated there were arguments fights and tears where there had been fun trips and quality time i learnt that the streets were not only for playing in but escaping the rows at home and i began to learn unlike my parents not to notice the colour of people’s skin i learnt what it feels like to be an outsider amongst locals whose parents were from all around the world i learnt that being different was more normal for more people than being the same i was an outsider a foreigner an other just a couple of hours along a big road from where i had previously been the norm the majority – standard i learnt to make friends despite these issues and i learnt that fitting in would involve me learning more from my peers than my parents i learnt to improvise to adapt to change and perform and in amongst all of this i discovered a music that seemed to be made by people who had learnt the same

in the summer holiday before i started secondary school and after leaving my first step dad my mum was in love again enjoying the honeymoon period at the start of what would become a tumultuous and dysfunctional relationship with a much older man a man who after some months i would openly refuse to ever call dad i spent most of my summer at a local summer playgroup run by three young black youth workers i was exposed to a british assimilation of new york hiphop culture through the film breakdance and the fashions attitudes and language of the trio that ran the scheme i met other kids that were far more literate and immersed in the culture that i was so spellbound by and i gained an acceptance and nurturing that was missing at home during this same time

part2 old school
my anger never followed me to school i was glad to be away from home and enjoyed the person i was away from my family i wasn’t particularly interested in learning but i was enthusiastic about my social education and the freedom to be that school offered my school however was in decline i was sent home because of broken boilers and staff shortages and i used these same excuses when i bunked off with friends after a term and several letters home requesting meetings regarding my behaviour my mum took me out and moved me to another school the pattern was repeating i was again a stranger outsider other i was quick to adapt and after losing a few fights i began to make friends during this time i was taught by an english teacher mr anderson he was unlike all the other teachers i had been taught by he was white and quite old but he was knowledgeable about black youth culture and in particular music he wrote reviews for music magazines and was married to a soul singer he wore sharp soulboy suits and a black brimmed hat in class he was strict and reluctant to conform to the newly implemented national curriculum he was vocal about his disappointment at some of his colleagues stagnant approaches to teaching and learning and would often push the boundaries of the curriculum introducing us to the concepts of semiotics eurocentricity and representation we would study american blues lyrics the politics of image and record sleeve designs alongside the canonical texts that were demanded by the exam boards he taught all of these areas with an equal passion and demanded full and personal investment from his students i found his teaching inspiring and frightening as i was pushed to find my own voice and creative identity i particularly admired how he was able and more willing to build relationships with the most dysfunctional members of the class easier than with the front of class dogooders who usually got the majority of attention and praise by relating to them through his knowledge of their culture and interests i was envious of this skill and was keen to emulate it i feel that this time influences my practice more than any other

during this time the art room became a place where i could express my anger with my family and the wider world in general and formed much of the content of my alevel towards the end of my course i applied for an art foundation my art teacher told me i would probably fail my alevel because i wasn’t prepared to do the type of art the examining body expected apparently a triptych of foetuses being loaded into a handgun wasn’t their cup of tea i told her i didn’t care but was still quite upset with the u grade i received based on a portfolio of this exact same work i was given an unconditional offer to westminster university i felt this justified my artistic decisions and in time became proud of my alevel failing but thought there should be some system in place to avoid this happening

part3 hiphop – don’t stop

during my foundation course i rekindled my passion for hiphop as i made friends with bboys and graffiti artists who i found myself studying with i devoured the learning on this course and for the first time education was about more than getting out of the house i wanted to be an artist i loved the experimentation choice freedom and creativity although i never really produced anything i thought was very good during this time i loved the processes i was able to experiment with and i enjoyed the style and approach and i was a dedicated learner

at the end of the year i applied to colleges to study video production i wanted to leave london and get away from my family life the college i went to was situated in ashington a small exmining community with high unemployment drug abuse and teenage pregnancy i was again an outsider a minority i spent my first grant cheque on turntables and vinyl and set about becoming a hiphop dj i used my london background as credentials and blagged a gig at a small bar in newcastle at a night run by a fine art student from newcastle university

looking back on these times i realise that hiphop and education have always been linked for me it was my choice to stay in education that allowed me the opportunity to develop myself as a hip hop artist it had opened me up to a world of learning and music and paved the path for some of my strongest friendships to blossom and grow conversely hiphop had given my learning a focus i became interested in documentary and society and my hiphop focus and sense of style that was shaped by hiphop gave my work its potency and drive artists such as public enemy nwa krs one gangstarr and black flag taught me the power of creative expression and social activism through music i was nurturing a desire that i had to work in film but was also devoted to developing my djing and rhyming and discovering more about hiphop and its potential as a cultural force and vehicle for expressing the views of those who didn’t always have a forum for doing so

part4 the next level

after graduating from my hnd i hit the yellow pages and landed a job in a leading commercial film studio after two years of working 90 hour weeks for little above minimum wage my girlfriend’s mother offered to help to pay for me to return to university to turn my hnd into a degree and found me a job in a secondary school as an lsa to pay the rent while i studied in order to ease my break into film making i applied for a media arts and video production degree at thames valley university as it meant i could go straight to year 2 due to my hnd during this course i studied aspects of sociology media representation and cultural studies that gripped my interest this course gave me a forum to explore hiphop culture more deeply and also to frame many of the political and social aspects of hiphop that interested me in a historical and theoretical lineage this culminated in my dissertation that explored the complex social upheavals in new york that had unwittingly laid the ground on which hiphop would develop and thrive2 meanwhile i was working in between lectures in school with statemented children who were struggling to succeed i found that i was able to use shared cultural reference points as a way in to building relationships with these young people and the student base as a whole and quickly became a very active member of staff i thrived in this environment and after a short time realised i could stay truer to my social and political beliefs by working in this environment than i ever would by trying to break into the white upper middle class film industry that perpetuated so many of the stereotypes of social inequity and monoculturalism that i was opposed to after graduating i left my job as an lsa to find a teaching position that would allow me to train for qts while i was looking i worked as a freelance arts facilitator for a large company in north greenwich this work saw me working in schools all around london this work gave me great confidence to walk into a classroom and teach who ever i found in front of me i experimented with approaches to behaviour management communication and relationship building i learnt to adapt to the settings and the young people i was responsible for i was able to reinvent myself and my approach regularly as most projects were only one or two days and none were longer than two weeks also i was able to observe and collaborate with a multitude of teachers assistants and arts facilitators later i found a position as an lsa in a special needs primary school i was offered the opportunity to train for qts at vernon house school where i trained as a teacher as well as in a mainstream setting before taking up a permanent position that i still hold

part5 down with ebd

when i tell people that i work in an ebd primary school the same phrase comes back at me – challenging this is always used as a polite way of saying – fuck that rather you than me i totally understand this response as this setting can be a frustrating volatile and often thankless place to make a living let alone a difference my arrival as a teacher in this setting was quite accidental as i have described this was not a vocation or a calling at least not one i was conscious of however i soon found that there was something about the approach that this setting required that i understood this environment requires an approach to teaching and learning that is flexible responsive and multidisciplinary it requires creative problemsolving energy honest enthusiasm and endless patience detailed planning and relentless assessment of targets are no guarantee of success in this context and indeed can be a facilitators undoing instead the key to success in the ebd setting seems to me to be more about building relationships of trust with consistent and reciprocal sharing of the learning experience the rolemodelling of the learner is an important part of my work as is the challenge of making the subject matter of learning and the route to it dynamic relevant and enjoyable

in building relationships i have found that i am able to exploit the shared cultural reference points of hiphop to present myself as a figure from inside of the children’s world of cultural understanding or cultural insider this avoids the dilemma that malcolm ross discusses in his book the creative arts where he describes the practice of teachers using popcultural references and products as a basis for learning without a great knowledge of or admiration for the culture as he states

in desperation some teachers turn to contemporary pop to teenage culture itself only to find that their pupils are not interested in acquiring discriminated responses or making critical appraisals the pop scene is their scene and we are somehow trespassers and we make ourselves rather ridiculous into the bargain when they sense we do not really respond with any conviction to their music their scene3

part6 where it’s at
i have often struggled to define my professional identity i see many roles within what i do concurrently employing my skills as a teacher artist mentor counsellor and performer in order to build strong relationships centred on learning and sharing knowledge although some of the creative interventions i initiate with young people are directly related to hiphop graffiti art rap etc much of my work is indirectly influenced by the cultural priorities of hiphop that have been a defining influence on my person as a hiphop artist i feel a resonance with hiphop dancer and choreographer rennie harris when he states

everything that i do to me it’s hiphop and going into this space it’s not me going into someone’s space it’s me going in making hiphop4

in my approach to planning learning interventions i find great similarity with the approach i would use in composing a piece of hiphop music in the same way that i take sounds from across time and from many genres and cultures to create sonic collages i also take elements from different subject areas of the curriculum and outside of it to compliment what must be taught with what i think my audience will find more interesting the key to the success of these learning experiences is my understanding of my audience and the energy and persuasiveness with which i perform this is again parallel to a successful hiphop production and when the selection and construction of the samples is right and the performance is tight the audience will want to dance move or learn with you when all this is in place as eisa davis states

we have what rapper krsone calls “edutainment” there is ritual call and response and an amped young audience of many colors that want to be in their seats5

part7 edutainment

my point is that do not concentrate
on what i state create or debate
i might be great and you might admire
but what i say is to take you much higher6

in 1990 south bronx rapper krs one knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everybody and producer dnice released boogie down production’s fourth album entitled edutainment7 this album was the crystallisation of themes that had been developing over their first three albums tired of hearing violent braggadocios lyrics it was krs who set about creating a form of hiphop music that was credible entertaining socially conscious and educational

this is a concept that i have adapted in my approach to teaching and learning where edutainment usually refers to entertainment that is embellished with educational content i look at the converse aspect of educational material and experiences that are also entertaining stimulating and fun in the context of an ebd primary school this is an approach that i have found not only useful and successful but necessary in order to elicit any engagement with learning working with young people who have a history of failing in school it is important that i don’t replicate the experiences they have had in a mainstream setting with little else than a high staffing ratio it is necessary that with many of my students that i assist them to rebuild their relationships with the concept of school and learning in order to do that it is important that i model the role of a teacher and learner that is less removed from their sphere of cultural understanding than many they have experienced before the shared cultural space of hiphop allows me to listen and respond with a shared language and with shared cultural reference points through processled arts practice i try to create a setting where these children can succeed i aim to let the children’s own ideas lead the direction of projects and as such i am often unable to know the outcome of a process before it has ‘come out’

part8 reflection eternal

all of this rhetoric of ‘entertainment’ is not to say that we do not engage in hard thinking in my classroom but echoing guy claxton it is instead framed and presented in a manner that allows space for enough playful reverie8 for the experience to be not only accessible and achievable but also desirable often the learning in my classroom is almost disguised as play and it is only in the reflection and discussion of the experience that the learning that my students have engaged in is unveiled often it is a true surprise for the students to see that what they thought was just a fun game or activity was actually a curriculumlinked ageappropriate learning experience as different students often want to explore different aspect using different approaches and favoured learning styles it is necessary that my approach to managing learning is multidisciplinary this is something that as a hiphop artist i am comfortable with as adam mansbach says the hiphop artist has

not just the impulse to think interdisciplinarily but the instinct to do so9

as such the reflection process that is critically important in any teaching and learning relationship is in my particular setting a vital part of reaffirming what has been taught and learnt and gauging the students desires for how to carry on this relationship often i have found that this process of discussing ‘what we have done’ is an affirming selfesteem building and rewarding exercise for my students as well as a vital tool in planning future interventions for me and the staff i work with reflecting on my own teaching and learning is also of particular importance due to the responsive way in which i find my planned interventions developing and changing as they are happening often it is the case that during a lesson or project students often have ideas for how they would like the project to develop or change and often the content of a particular intervention changes dramatically throughout its course in these circumstances it is critical that i am both able to learn with my students as well as being able to improvise my performance as a leader and teacher even when i know as little as my students about the possible outcomes of exploring a tangential path to that which was planned this has a parallel with the hiphop practice of freestyling freestyling is the hiphop vocal tradition of performing improvised rap that is unwritten unrehearsed and yet still technically proficient and responsive to the context and audience for the performance
over time this process of playful learning and honest reflection have helped to create relationships between me and my students that are dynamic progressive and transforming for both them and myself where their development and growth as young learners is parallel to my own development and growth as a facilitator with honesty and trust as the key to the building and managing of these relationships with my very fragile and fearful audience the path is not always smooth the activities not always successful and learning not always retained however after 5 years of teaching in this setting i have been unable to observe or devise an approach or strategy that is guaranteed to work in all situations i assume this is the same of any process that involves engaging human beings but possibly more pointed in a situation that involves the engagement of young disillusioned young people with a history of failure an aversion to risktaking and disharmonious and often abusive living environments in this setting standardising relativist assessment techniques are an unreliable way to gauge academic creative or social development more reliable are the testimonies of participants in their reflections on activities their levels of participation and their engagement with and enjoyment of interventions that are grounded in experiential learning during the most successful of these interventions my student’s depth of involvement displays what csikszentmihalyi describes as flow this is described as when learners are fully immersed and concentrated on a task or activity characterised partly by a loss of the feeling of selfconsciousness and distorted sense of time10 i have witnessed this with my students and have seen evidence of it in comments they have made both during tasks and in reflection and in circumstances where students have engaged and participated deeply in activities that they have previously resisted and subverted

hiphop music and the surrounding cultural forms were born out of an oppressive systematic exclusion of peoples from mainstream society through the destruction of communities and the forced integration of marginalised social groups from these roots the culture has grown to outstretch even the most optimistic predictions for the culture the resonance between the climate from which hiphop emerged and the ebd setting in which i work are stark and obvious my school community comes from all over london from dysfunctional and marginalised backgrounds with a history of failing and being failed by a society that promises protection and equal opportunity

the hiphop stance in my approach to teaching and learning breaks down some of the barriers to learning that my students have faced in mainstream settings and aids the construction of meaningful trusting relationships that can begin to rebuild their confidence in themselves and those who want to help them in this way the effects of hiphop in education are far wider reaching than the inclusion of rap lyrics in a literacy poetry module or graffiti being welcomed into the art classroom as eisa davis says

the hiphop stance is not a lifestyle it’s a thinking style11

it is a thinking style that has throughout its existence in the world been concerned with documenting society and giving voice to societies marginalised peoples through collective participatory creative practice – what better educator for our disenfranchised youth than this
