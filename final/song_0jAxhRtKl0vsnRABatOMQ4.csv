when you know youre lonely youre not the one and only
who will cry

when your heart is broken thats the time to cry
when you know shes left you youll know that she has left you
so you can cry

happiness is what i long for
loneliness is why i cry
for you have made my heart a slave
and now its up to you

when somebody leaves you thats the time to cry
when you know shes left you youll know that she has left you
so you can crysee paul anka liveget tickets as low as 73you might also likeembed"
