let it all out get it all out
rip it out remove it
dont be alarmed when the wound begins to bleed
cause were so scared to find out what this lifes all about
so scared were gonna lose it
not knowing all along
thats exactly what we need

prechorus 1
and today i will trust you with a confidence
of a man whos never known defeat
but tomorrow upon hearing what i did
i will stare at you in disbelief
oh inconsistent me
crying out for consistency

chorus
and you said i know that this will hurt
but if i dont break your heart then things will just get worse
if the burden seems too much to bear
remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there

verse 2
and ill let it be known at times i have shown
signs of all my weakness
but somewhere in me
there is strength
and you promise me that you believe
in time i will defeat this
cause somewhere in me
there is strength
you might also likeprechorus 2
and today i will trust you with the confidence
of a man whos never known defeat
and ill try my best to just forget
that that man isnt me

chorus
and you said i know that this will hurt
but if i dont break your heart then things will just get worse
if the burden seems too much to bear
remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there
you said i know that this will hurt i know this will hurt
but if i dont break your heart then things will just get worse
things will get much worse
when the burden seems too much to bear
seems too much to bear
remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there

outro
reach out to me
make my heart brand new
every beat will be for you
for you
and i know you know
you touched my life
when you touched my heavy heart
and made it lightembed"
