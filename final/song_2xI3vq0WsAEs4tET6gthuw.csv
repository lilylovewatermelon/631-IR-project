i might be better off without you
theres too many people all around you
all these vultures that surround you
they dont know a thing about you

cause you make me feel gorgeous
ooh youre so gorgeous
cause you make me feel gorgeous

verse 2
nobody understands you
you aint nothing they can handle
every man you put your hands on
you make him feel so god damn handsome

prechorus
feel ooh so pretty whenever youre around
ooh so pretty
feel ten feet off the ground

chorus
youre so gorgeous
cause you make me feel gorgeous
ooh youre so gorgeous
cause you make me feel gorgeous
