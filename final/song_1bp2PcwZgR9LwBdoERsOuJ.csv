well tonight im up in chillicothe
downwind from the paper mill
i’m out here spittin on the sidewalk
taking in the factory smells
head and nose she tends to smokin out the window
in the air that gas pipe leak
i wonder if she’s cringing at the same time
thinking pretty thoughts of me

verse 2
i was up for hours this morning
pulling traps before i said goodbye
i plan to tan myself a fox hide
and hang it on my darling bride
cause they tell me that its gonna be a big one
and the snow is settin in
and i dont want her cold while i aint at home
the way that i have been

chorus
spending my nights in a bar room lord
turnin them songs into twobyfours
dreaming bout the day that i’m sitting by the fire
huddled with my honey in the country squire
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 3
well tomorrow we hit the country music highway
on our way to circleville
we’re off to do some weekend warring
while we sing and drink our fill
and when i aint out playing on my sixstring
with the nickels i acquire
i’m trying to fix her up a castle
its called the country squire

verse 4
its a 24footlong vessel
that measures eight feet wide
its a 53yearold camper
it’s made to pull behind
and ive gutted to the studs and the rafters
and im building back piece by piece
im trying to fix her up a temple
my lady of the estill springs

chorus
spending my nights in a bar room lord
turnin them songs into twobyfours
dreaming bout the day that ill sit by the fire
huddled with my honey in our country squire
verse 5
one day i aim to have myself a family
and a cabin on the hill
and i might have to come off of the highway
to help with the family bills
but when the kids have got a little older
on the day that i retire
ill take her somewhere warm for the winter
pulling our country squire

chorus
spending my nights in a bar room lord
turnin them songs into twobyfours
dreaming bout the day that ill sit by the fire
huddled with my honey in our country squire
dreaming bout the day that ill sit by the fire
huddled with my honey in our country squireembed"
