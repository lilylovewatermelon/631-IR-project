she was sixteen and six feet tall
in a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zoo
she stumbled started to slip and fall
teetertottered on the top of patent leather shoes
i happened to catch her and said
maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you
maybe for you now

verse 2
but not as shaky as i must have seemed
talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
and on the phone i could not compete
my dumbluck fake competence was getting weak
for a sec i thought i sounded sweet
but sure enough in a gruff faint voice
i heard myself speak

chorus
i could stay a while
but sooner or later ill break your smile
and i can tell a joke
but one of these days im bound to choke
and we could share a kiss
but i feel like i cant go through with this
and i bet we could build a home
but i know the right thing for me to do
is to leave you alone
leave you alone now

im beginning to like you
so you probably wont get what im going to do
im walking away from you
it probably dont make much sense to you
but im trying to save you
from all of the things that ill probably say or do
ill probably do

chorus
i could stay a while
but sooner or later ill break your smile
and i can tell a joke
but one of these days im bound to choke
and we might share a kiss
but i feel like i cant go through with this
and i bet we could build a home
but i know the right thing for me to do
is to leave you alone
leave you alone now

verse 4
youll probably call me a fool
and say im doing exactly what a coward would do
and im beginning to like you
its a shame what a lame way to live
but what can i do
i hope you appreciate what i do
outro
im a martyr for my love for you
a martyr for my love for you now
a martyr for my love for you
a martyr for my love for you5embed"
