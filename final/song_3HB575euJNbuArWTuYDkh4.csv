verse 1
how many niggas did they time and came home on some silent shit
i never froze with that pistol i was poppin shit
hit that interrogation room on some quiet shit
just get me to a cell with my niggas so we can politic
and when i hit the county i was tripping on the rock
they took the tv i dont care just dont fuck with that clock
and when i hit the prison yard i met a lot of plugs
they saw my paper work and i got a lot of love

i treat my niggas like we came out the same pussy
i hold my own wait aint looking for no time reduction
only thing i told them bitches was my lawyer number
