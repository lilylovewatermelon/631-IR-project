man have you ever really wondered
like why are we here what the meanin to all of this

chorus sleepy brown
sometimes life can keep you down
with your face all in the dirt hallelujah
now if you feel that left behind
need to get up and go to church hallelujah
oohoohoohooh hallelujah
oohoohoohooh hallelujah

verse 1 big boi
big slide into the mode time to drop a load
my life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
my bank account is frozen i
dont think that i can get out this hole
feel like the figure four leglock
like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
i cant move i cant eat i cant even breathe
cant even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
no trees no ps to ease the stress of everyday living
but homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
the unforgiven or the unwilling live a life of sinning
and expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning but
you might also likerefrain
what about repentance what about detention
what about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
what about repentance what about committing
the same sin over and over again and again and uh

interlude
why are we here huh huh huh
please tell me what are we here for ow

verse 2 big boi
life is nothing but a dream so peaceful and serene
unless youre being evil then you on the devils team
wide receive what you want to believe
but soon youll have to sow those bad seeds
please any man can ask to get a pass
or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
talk to the coach or break out the huddle
whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
because he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
as you survey the syllables and sentences the question
that im merely trying to pose is as simply as me saying

refrain
what about repentance what about detention
what about you eating dinner in the devils kitchen
what about repentance what about committing
the same sin over and over again and again and uh
chorus sleepy brown
sometimes life can keep you down
with your face all in the dirt
now if you feel that left behind
need to get up and go to church
oohoohoohooh
oohoohoohooh church

interlude
why are we here huh huh huh
please tell me what are we here for ow

outro
