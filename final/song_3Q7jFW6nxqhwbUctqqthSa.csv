verse 1
im here to collect your hearts
its the only reason that i sing
i dont believe a word you say
but i cant stop listening
this is the story of how they met
her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
and when she touched him he turned ruby red
a story that theyll never forget never forget

prechorus
and all the boys are smoking menthols girls are getting back rubs
i will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
my old aches become new again
my old friends become exes again

chorus
woah where did the party go
were ending it on the phone
im not gonna go home alone

i know i expect too much
and not enough all at once
you know i only wanted fun
and you got me all fucked up on love
i looked for your name on the ouija board
and your naked magic oh dear lord
you and me are the difference between real love
and the love on tv love on tv

prechorus
and all the boys are smoking menthols girls are getting back rubs
i will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
my old aches become new again
my old friends become exes again yeah

bridge
we were the kids who screamed we werent the same in sweaty rooms
now were doomed to organizing walkin closets like tombs
silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life
so lets fade away together one dream at a time
