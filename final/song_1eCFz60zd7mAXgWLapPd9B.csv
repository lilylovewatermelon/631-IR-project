dont think twice
were still in formation
testing the current
already im sailing its all so sudden
catching a flight
you think were moving too fast im
intoxicated
we can move in slow motion if thats what you want babe

prechorus
i dont want to come on too strong
but im moving to your rhythm

chorus
with every move with every move you make babe
im tumbling

verse 2
in your own time
would you show me something please babe
dont wanna wait in vain
youre the missing piece i i been longing for
dont deny oh no
the temperatures rising inside
the cracks are showing
show me all your colors i may not deserve you

i dont want to come on too strong
but im moving to your rhythm

chorus
with every move with every move you make babe
