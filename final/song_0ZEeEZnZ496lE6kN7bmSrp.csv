so clever
whatever
im done with these endeavors
alone i walk the winding way
here i stay
its over
no longer
i feel it growing stronger
i live to die another day
until i fade away
chorus
why give up
why give in
its not enough
it never is
so i will go on until the end
weve become desolate
its not enough
it never is
but i will go on until the end

verse 2
surround me
its easy
to fall apart completely
i feel you creeping up again
in my head
its over
no longer
i feel it growing colder
i knew this day would come to end
so let this life begin

ive lost my way
ive lost my way
but i will go on until the end

living is
hard enough
without you fucking up

chorus
why give up
why give in

it never is

weve become desolate
its not enough
it never is
but i will go on until the end

ive lost my way

but i will go on until the end14embed"
