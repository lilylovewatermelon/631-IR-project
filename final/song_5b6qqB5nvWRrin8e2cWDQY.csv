feel this storm go through my sail
follow someone elses trail
camera a camera b
in your home on your tv
hook me up look in my eyes
dilate do i surprise you
watch me blush blink sink

kill the engine stop the car
cut the lights and there you are
stars so small
youre the king of them all
stand tall rack focus
now you crawl back broken
now the stars so vast
heat wind storm break my mast
