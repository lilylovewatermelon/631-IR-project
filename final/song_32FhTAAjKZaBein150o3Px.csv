i said i wanted thin mints and you said you knew a guy
you showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless
we bonded over black eyed peas and complicated exes

prechorus
fell so deeply into it
it was all so innocent

chorus
now im a homewrecker im a slut
i got death threats fillin up semitrucks
tell me who i am guess i dont have a choice
all because i liked
im the hot topic on your tongue
im a rebound gettin round stealin from the young
tell me who i am guess i dont have a choice
all because i liked a boy

postchorus
ah mmm

verse 2
im not catastrophizing everythings derailing
was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing
its not internet illusion just two kids going through it
you said im too late to be your first love but ill always be your favorite

it was all so innocent
dating boys with exes

all because i liked a boy
