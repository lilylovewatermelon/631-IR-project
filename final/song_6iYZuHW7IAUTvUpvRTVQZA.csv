back of the boat was painted wrecking ball
there was country music playing
but he dont like it at all
and red fire popping on the raineddown wood
there was whiskey bottle spilling
and a lake thats made of salt

look out back well theres a note on the door
saying everybody listen well be the next omaha

chorus
now if you find yourself falling apart
then im sure i could stand on
the great salt lake

chorus
falling apart
and im sure i could stand on
the great salt lake

verse 2
your old man was but a wishing machine
its time that you could spend
now hes getting old
when billy lorett had found a watering hole
its a place to lay south or the heads of coyote
you might also likechorus
now if you find yourself falling apart
well im sure
i could stand on
the great salt lake

bridge
follow me home
we want more
follow me home
we all want more
if ever beat down
we know who we are
they know we all want more ohoh
if ever beat down
we know who we are
they know we all want more
ohoh oh ohoh3embed"
