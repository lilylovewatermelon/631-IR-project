i want to see you work out for me work out for me

chorus
ayy weve got a good thing
don’t know if i’ma see you again
but is that a good thing
cause girl i can’t be your man no maam
i know whats on your brain
you probably hoped it never would end
like “is it the real thing
or is it just a onenight stand”
well then

bridge
let me see you get high then go low
now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
i’m here for one night how far will you go
i wanna see you work out for me work out for me
high then go low
now girl wont you drop that thing down to the floor
i’m here for one night how far will you go
i wanna see you work out for me work out for me

verse 1
she like them boys with the big ol chains
ridin around town in a big ol range
i knew her when i rocked big ol jeans
now the little nigga doin big ol thangs
would you look at that i came back for her
just to give it to ya like you asked for it
man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
rebounds so i caught her off the backboard
i told her “baby girl come here
know i run the town even when i aint from there”
and i brag hardly but just to show up at this party
i made what yo nigga make in one year
thats unfair but so is life take a chance roll the dice
money can’t buy you love cause it’s overpriced
don’t overthink just hope its right
i’m only here for the night

verse 2
carolina blue kicks fresh on the scene
hottest nigga on the block
damn girl youre mean

some niggas save hoes i’m not that heroic
could you be my escort
cause just like them two door fords
damn they don’t make em like you no more
cole world real cole world
them boys cool—me i’m on fire
know whats on my mind
tryna see whats on yours tonight tonight tonight
move slow cause you wanna live fast
up late so youll probably skip class
life is a test so before the night pass get right get right
