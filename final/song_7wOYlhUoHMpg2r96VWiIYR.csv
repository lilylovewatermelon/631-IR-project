deep inside these burning buildings
voices die to be heard
years we spent teaching a lesson
we ourselves had never learned
and if strength is born from heartbreak
then mountains i could move
and if walls could speak id pray
that they would tell me what to do

chorus
if you see me please just walk on by walk on by
forget my name and ill forget it too simple lives
failed attempts at living simple lives simple lives
are what keep me coming back to you

verse 2
no signs of life here save the embers the occasional flame
wed know the way but cant remember conception to the grave
shout confessions from the greatest heights where no one can hear
all my fears my insecurities are falling like tears

chorus
if you see me please just walk on by walk on by
forget my name and ill forget it too simple lives
failed attempts at living simple lives simple lives
are what keep me coming back to you

the drones all slave away theyre working overtime
they serve a faceless queen they never question why
disciples of a god that neither lives nor breathes
i wont come back
but we have bills to pay yeah we have mouths to feed
i wont come back
i wont come back

chorus
if you see me please just walk on by walk on by
forget my name and ill forget it too simple lives
failed attempts at living simple lives simple lives
are what keep me coming back to you

outro
im coming back to you6embed"
