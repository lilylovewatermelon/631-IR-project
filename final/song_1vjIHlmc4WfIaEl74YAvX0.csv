all that i did was walk over start off by shakin your hands
thats how it went
i had a smile on my face and i sat up straight
oh yeah yeah
i wanted to know you i wanted to show you

chorus
you dont know me dont ignore me
you dont want me there you just shut me out
you dont know me dont ignore me
if you had your way youd just shut me up
make me go away
that im so unwanted

verse 2
no i just dont understand why you wont talk to me
it hurts that im so unwanted for nothing
dont talk words against me
i wanted to know you i wanted to show you

chorus
you dont know me dont ignore me
you dont want me there you just shut me out
you dont know me dont ignore me
if you had your way youd just shut me up
make me go away
make me go away
