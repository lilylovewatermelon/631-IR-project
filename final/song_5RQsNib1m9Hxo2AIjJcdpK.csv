that no one but me can find
some choctaw built it in the hillside
stone by stone in a simpler time
its a holy place my daddy showed me
back before this land was mine
on the blue side of the mountain
where the sun dont ever shine

so deep and dark like a hurtin down in my heart
maybe someday theyll show me some kind of sign
on the blue side of the mountain
where the sun dont ever shine

im goin back to a world of shadow
gotta find some peace for i lose my mind
on the blue side of the mountain
where the sun dont ever shine

so deep and dark like a hurtin down in my heart
maybe someday theyll show me some kind of sign
on the blue side of the mountain
where the sun dont ever shine

where the sun dont ever shinesee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
