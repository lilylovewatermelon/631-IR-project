looking up from underneath
fractured moonlight on the sea
reflections still look the same to me
as before i went under
and its peaceful in the deep
cathedral where you cannot breathe
no need to pray no need to speak
now i am under all

prechorus
and its breaking over me
a thousand miles down to the sea bed
found the place to rest my head
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go

chorus
and the arms of the ocean are carrying me
and all this devotion was rushing out of me
and the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
but the arms of the ocean delivered me

verse 2
though the pressures hard to take
its the only way i can escape
it seems a heavy choice to make
and now i am under oh

and its breaking over me
a thousand miles down to the seabed
found the place to rest my head
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go

chorus
and the arms of the ocean are carrying me
and all this devotion was rushing out of me
and the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
but the arms of the ocean delivered me

bridge
and its over and im going under
but im not giving up im just giving in
im slipping underneath
so so cold and so sweet
and the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold
and all this devotion i never knew at all
and the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
and the arms of the ocean delivered me

outro
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go
delivered me
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go delivered me
never let me go never let me go
never let me go never let me go delivered me
never let me go never let me go
and its over and im going under
but im not giving up im just giving in
im slipping underneath
so cold and so sweet42embed"
