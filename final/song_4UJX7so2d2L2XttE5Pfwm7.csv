theres a place that ive found as far as i can see
this place lies within the depths of my dreams
in a garden surrounded by fire and trees
through the smoke a silhouette i can barely see
theres a man with an axe standing in the rain
looked me straight in my eye— this is what he had to say

prechorus
never fall asleep— you wont wake up
destroy the guillotine before he does

chorus
i walk with shadows you have to find a better way
i walk with shadows the questions i will never say
hiding from the gallows they keep me safe and sound
so i walk in shadows the ways of burning down this house

postchorus
end transmission the satellites are down
i need an earthquake to shake this pity off the ground

verse 2
just dont trust these liars at the door you have to find a better way
kill the ones that have these answers for the questions i will never say

never fall asleep— you wont wake up
destroy the guillotine before he does

chorus
i walk with shadows you have to find a better way

i need an earthquake to shake this pity off the ground

all the vibrant colors i see
and the shades that fill the grey
pain the pain pain the pain
pain the pain pain the pain

pain the pain pain the pain
pain the pain pain the pain

chorus
i walk with shadows you have to find a better way
i walk with shadows the questions i will never say
hiding from the gallows they keep me safe and sound
so i walk in shadows the ways of burning down this house9embed"
