run around outside
monster
“daddy are you alright”

blam blam blam
shots rang out in the middle of the night
no creature left unstirred
gone gone gone
not too long was this rocker’s delight
a song no american heard

what was it heard
it was a monster
blue lips and pink tongue
monster aah
i want her but now she’s gone

breakdance contest late at night
boys against the girls
egg roll poppin’ it’s a fight
somewhere in sweden

monster
run around like that
monster
ha ha ha ha ha ha
you might also likeboom like a broom
swept the doom and gloom
so we could write this tribute to
ska ska ska

others ripped them off
but not the way i do
what would you do

i’d do it no way
despite the stupid things i might do
i want you to know
that i could never go and leave you
but you left me

monster
breakdance contest late at night
boys against the girls
egg roll poppin’ it’s a fight
somewhere in sweden

why’d you leave me
why’d you leave me
before i ever met you
why’d you leave me
why’d you leave me
before i ever met youembed"
