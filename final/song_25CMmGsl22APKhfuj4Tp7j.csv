and its been awhile
since i could hold my head up high
and its been awhile
since i first saw you
and its been awhile
since i could stand on my own two feet again
and its been awhile
since i could call you

chorus
and everything i cant remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that are rendered
ive stretched myself beyond my means

verse 2
and its been awhile
since i could say that i wasnt addicted
and its been awhile
since i can say i love myself as well
and its been awhile
since ive gone and fucked things up just like i always do
and its been awhile
but all that shit seems to disappear when im with you
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
and everything i cant remember
as fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that ive rendered
ive gone and fucked things up again again

bridge
why must i feel this way
just make this go away
just one more peaceful day

verse 3
and its been awhile
since i could look at myself straight
and its been awhile since i said im sorry
and its been awhile
since ive seen the way the candles light your face
and its been awhile
but i can still remember just the way you taste

chorus
and everything i cant remember
as fucked up as it all may seem to be i know its me
i cannot blame this on my father
he did the best he could for me
outro
and its been awhile
since i could hold my head up high
and its been awhile
since i said im sorry29embed"
