doubt doubt doubt
it kills everything that you love oh
now now now
i’m losing myself on the run

prechorus
and i flew to california
thought i could leave
every piece of you right here
yeah i flew to california
still wide awake
oh the sun burned it on clear

chorus
how i still love you
i still love you
but sometimes you have to go
trade your heart for bones
to know you need to come back home
come back home
