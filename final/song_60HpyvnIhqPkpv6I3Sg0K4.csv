my dearest ive missed you very very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come ive been turning it over and over in my mind lately ive read your letter through at least four times and will probably read it more times before im through ive been sitting here looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute ive wanted that picture more than anything else i know of except of course you yourself i keep thinking of you darling keep wishing i could be home with you i want to leave in the worse possible way so i can come home to see you but things dont look so good in that subject this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone i guess ive never been so lonesome in my life as i am right now im completely lost without you darling i never realized i could miss any one person so much i just hope it wont be too much longer until im able to be with you again and live a sane and normal life2embed"
