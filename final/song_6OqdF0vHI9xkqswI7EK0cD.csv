verse 1
you better take it from me
that boy is like a disease
youre running youre trying youre trying to hide
and youre wondering why you cant get free
hes like a curse hes like a drug
youll get addicted to his love
you wanna get out but hes holding you down
cause you cant live without one more touch

chorus
hes a a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water but hes candycoated misery
hes the devil in disguise a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont wanna fight
you better run for your life

and you wanna believe but you wont be deceived
if you listen to me and take my advice

chorus
hes a a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water but hes candycoated misery
hes the devil in disguise a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont wanna fight

dont let him mess with your mind
hell tell you anything you wanna hear
hell break your heart its just a matter of time
but just remember
chorus
hes a a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
he looks like a cool drink of water but hes candycoated misery
hes the devil in disguise a snake with blue eyes
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you dont wanna fight
