put your lighter in the air and lead me back home
when its all said and done ill follow the echoes
i hear you night after night calling out my name ooh
and i find myself running to meet you

prechorus
i didnt want to escape
from the bricks that i laid down

chorus
you are the only one
the only one that sees me
trusts me and believes me
you are the only one
the only one that knows me
and in the dark you show me
yeah its perfectly reckless
damn you leave me defenseless
so break in

postchorus

until its just your voice in my head
and when the lights come on
