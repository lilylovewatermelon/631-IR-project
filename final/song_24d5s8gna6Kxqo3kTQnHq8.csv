when i was young i was wide eyed and unafraid
small world such big faith
i knew that you could do anything
when i was young
before the tears came down
before the pain brought doubt
just knowing you was enough for me

prechorus
it was simple it was honest
help me remember
what ive forgotten

chorus
i want to run to you
like a child to his father
when it all was new
and my heart was full of wonder
give me a childlike faith
a joy that takes me back to my first love
just like when i was young

verse 2
when i was young
i believed that you were always there
and you heard every single prayer
there was more trust and less worry

i want to run to you
like a child to his father
when it all was new
and my heart was full of wonder
give me a childlike faith
a joy that takes me back to my first love
just like when i was young

bridge
years go by so fast
but you never change
your love still brings me back

chorus
i want to run to you
i want to run to you
like a child to his father
when it all was new
and my heart was full of wonder
give me a childlike faith
a joy that takes me back to my first love
just like when i was young
when i was youngembed"
