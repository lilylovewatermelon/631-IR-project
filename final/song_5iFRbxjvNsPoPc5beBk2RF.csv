read a book about that years ago
he was actually an actor incomprehensible
i dont wanna meet your dad dont wanna hump your sister
dont wanna do it to your best friend either
i dont want you messin around and givin me a blister
and leave me illin for the penicillin
when you walk out i dont wanna feel left out
cuz sooner or later its just over over
i dont wanna get inside your mind or your pants
i dont wanna waste my time with love an romance
i want my next exgirlfriend my next exgirlfriend
i dont want the fairy tale an i dont want the girl from hell
dont wanna be your biggest mistake
you can be my next exgirlfriend my next exgirlfriend
i dont wanna learn to dance dont wanna rent the limo
i know your thinking im a weirdo
i just want the bragging rights i wanna let the world know
an convince my friends im not a homo
if you walk out i dont wanna feel left out
cuz sooner or later its just over over
i dont wanna get inside your mind or your pants
i dont wanna waste my time with love an romance
i want my next ex girlfriend my next exgirlfriend
i dont want the fairy tale an i dont want the girl from hell
dont wanna be your biggest mistake
you can be my next exgirlfriend my next exgirlfriend
tell everyone im good in the sack
but all your friends were givin you fag
and you just couldnt put up with that
so no youre never taking me back
i dont wanna get inside your mind or your pants
i dont wanna waste my time with love an romance
i want my next exgirlfriend my next exgirlfriend
i dont want the fairy tale an i dont want the girl from hell
an i dont want to spend the time an i dont need no valentine
