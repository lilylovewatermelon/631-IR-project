crack fucked up the world
and i wonder if they realized the damage
i mean they come from an era
who made a lot of money off that shit
and i wonder if it fucked with they conscience
it fucked with me being out there i couldnt stand it
i couldnt stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
and thats where the money came from

verse 1 tyler the creator
shits getting warmer on that corner
gotta watch out for them 50 foreigners
your mothers a goner
i warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
you got a daughter shits getting harder
the only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
you cant afford to get caught up but you in too deep
and the seashore aint saw ya
you got a mother she dont support you
but you bought her a new house cause you love her
growing up you barely had a roof
now you got a coupe and it doesnt have a roof
i guess youre accustomed what youre used to
so you bought two nigga
they coming for you nigga
niggas be hating im doing them bitches
like susan and karen be doing your pockets
and running the man and hes losing his fucking mind
and its all an illusion
who was alludin all of this potent
i am the reason your family is using and shooting up
its my fault
you can blame me motherfucker
for killing your aunties and uncles
the hustle and hunger
all i wanted was a cheeseburger
and a little chain tucked
didnt realize this game fucked up some lives
oh hows mine
my conscience eats it up all the time but other than that im fine
i got a little money in my pocket
