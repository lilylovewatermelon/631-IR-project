tales of sharpers tricks upon simpletons do not quite fall within the scope of the present series of papers but there is one in the arabian nightsnot found however in our common english version of that fascinating storybookwhich deserves a place among noodlestories since it is so diverting is not very generally known and is probably the original of the early italian novel of the monk transformed which is ascribed to michele colombo

a rustic simpleton was walking homeward dragging his ass after him by the halter which a brace of sharpers observing one said to his fellow come with me and i will take the ass from that man he then quietly advanced to the ass unloosed it from the halter and gave the animal to his companion who went off with it after which he put the halter over his own head and allowed

p82

the rustic to drag him for some little distance until he with the ass was fairly out of sight when he suddenly stopped and the man having tugged at the halter several times without effect looked round and amazed to see a human being in place of his beast exclaimed who art thou the sharper answered i was thy ass but hear my story for it is wonderful i had a good and pious mother and one day i came home intoxicated grieved to see me in such a state she gently reproved me but i instead of being penetrated with remorse beat her with a stick whereupon she prayed to allah and in answer to her supplication lo i was transformed into an ass in that shape i have continued until this day when my mother as it appears has interceded for my restoration to human form as before the simpleton believing every word of this strange story raised his eyes to heaven saying of a truth there is no power but from allah but pray forgive me for having used thee as i have done the sharper readily granted his forgiveness and went off to rejoin his companion and dispose of the ass while the simpleton returned home and showing his wife the bridle told her of the marvellous transformation which had occurred his wife in hopes of propitiating heaven gave

p83

alms and offered up many prayers to avert evil from them on account of their having used a human being as an ass at length the simpleton having remained idle at home for some time went one day to the market to purchase another ass and on entering the place where all the animals were fastened he saw with astonishment his old ass offered for sale putting his mouth to its ear he whispered woe to thee unlucky doubtless thou hast again been intoxicated but by allah i will never buy thee

another noodlestory of a different class in the arabian nights may be here cited in full from sir rf burtons translation of that delightful work privately printed for the subscribers and it will serve moreover as a fair specimen of the admirable manner in which that ripe scholar has represented in english the quaint style of his original

quoth one of the learned i passed once by a school wherein a schoolmaster was teaching children so i entered finding him a goodlooking man and a welldressed when he rose to me and made me sit with him then i examined him in the koran and in syntax and prosody and lexicography and behold he was perfect in all required of him and i said to him allah strengthen

p84

thy purpose thou art indeed versed in all that is requisite thereafter i frequented him a while discovering daily some new excellence in him and quoth i to myself this is indeed a wonder in any dominie for the wise are agreed upon a lack of wit in childrens teachers1 then i separated myself from him and sought him and visited him only every few days till coming to see him one day as of wont i found the school shut and made inquiry of his neighbours who replied some one is dead in his house so i said in my mind it behoveth me to pay him a visit of condolence and going to his house knocked at the door when a slavegirl came out to me and asked what dost thou want and i answered i want thy master she replied he is sitting alone mourning and i rejoined tell him that his friend soandso seeketh to console him she went in and told him and he said admit him so she brought me in to him and i found him seated alone and his head bound with

1 this notion that schoolmasters lack wit however absurd seems to have been entertained from ancient times and to be still prevalent in the east the socalled jests of hierokles are all at the expense of pedants and the turkish typical noodle is khoja ie teacher nasruddín some of whose witless devices shall be cited presently

p85
mourning fillets so i said to him allah requite thee amply this is a path all must perforce tread and it behoveth thee to take patience adding but who is dead unto thee he answered one who was dearest of the folk to me and best beloved perhaps thy father no thy brother no one of thy kindred no then asked i what relation was the dead to thee and he answered my lover quoth i to myself this is the first proof to swear by of his lack of wit so i said to him assuredly there be others than she and fairer and he made answer i never saw her that i might judge whether or no there be others fairer than she quoth i to myself this is another proof positive then i said to him and how couldst thou fall in love with one thou hast never seen he replied know that i was sitting one day at the window when lo there passed by a man singing the following distich

umm amr thy boons allah repay
give back my heart bet where it may

the schoolmaster continued when i heard the man humming these words as he passed along the street i said to myself except this umm amrú were without equal in the world the poets had not celebrated her in ode and

p86

canzon so i fell in love with her but two days after the same man passed singing the following couplet

ass and umm amr went their way
nor she nor ass returned for aye

thereupon i knew that she was dead and mourned for her this was three days ago and i have been mourning ever since so i left him and fared forth having assured myself of the weakness of the gerundgrinders wit1

here surely was the very father of folly but what shall we say of judges and magistrates being sometimes represented as equally witless thus we are told among the cases decided by a turkish kází that two men came before him one of whom complained that the other had almost bit his ear off the accused denied this and declared that the fellow had bit his own ear after pondering the matter for some time the judge told them to come again two hours later then he went into his private room

p87

and attempted to bring his ear and his mouth together but all he did was to fall backwards and break his head wrapping a cloth round his head he returned to court and the two men coming in again presently he thus decided the question no man can bite his own ear but in trying to do so he may fall down and break his head

a sinhalese story which is also well known in various forms in india furnishes a still more remarkable example of forensic sagacity it is thus related by the able editor of the orientalist vol i p 191
one night some thieves broke into the house of a rich man and carried away all his valuables the man complained to the justice of the peace who had the robbers captured and when brought before him inquired of them whether they had anything to say in their defence sir said they we are not to blame in this matter the robbery was entirely due to the mason who built the house for the walls were so badly made and gave way so easily that we were quite unable to resist the temptation of breaking in orders were then given to bring the mason to the courthouse on his arrival he was informed of the charge brought against him ah said he the fault is not mine but that of the coolie who made mortar

p88

badly when the coolie was brought he laid the blame on the potter who he said had sold him a cracked chattie in which he could not carry sufficient water to mix the mortar properly then the potter was brought before the judge and he explained that the blame should not be laid upon him but upon a very pretty woman who in a beautiful dress was passing at the time he was making the chattie and had so riveted his attention that he forgot all about the work when the woman appeared she protested that the fault was not hers for she would not have been in that neighbourhood at all had the goldsmith sent home her earrings at the proper time the charge she argued should properly be brought against him the goldsmith was brought and as he was unable to offer any reasonable excuse he was condemned to be hanged those in the court however begged the judge to spare the goldsmiths life for said they he is very sick and illfavoured and would not make at all a pretty spectacle but said the judge somebody must be hanged then they drew the attention of the court to the fact that there was a fat moorman in a shop opposite who was a much fitter subject for an execution and asked that he might be hanged in the goldsmiths stead the learned judge considering that this

p89

arrangement would be very satisfactory gave judgment accordingly

if some of the lastcited stories are not precisely gothamite drolleries though all are droll enough in their way there can be no doubt whatever that we have a sinhalese brother to the men of gotham in the following a villager in ceylon whose calf had got its head into a pot and could not get it out again sent for a friend celebrated for his wisdom to release the poor animal the sagacious friend taking in the situation at a glance cut off the calfs head broke the pot and then delivered the head to the owner of the calf saying what will you do when i am dead and goneand we have another gothamite in the kashmiri who bought as much rice as he thought would suffice for a years food and finding he had only enough for eleven months concluded it was better to fast the other month right off which he did accordingly but he died just before the month was completed leaving eleven months rice in his house

the typical noodle of the turks the khoja nasruddín is said to have been a subject of the independent prince of karaman at

p90

whose capital konya he resided and he is represented as a contemporary of tímúr tamerlane in the middle of the fourteenth century the pleasantries which are ascribed to him are for the most part common to all countries but some are probably of genuine turkish origin to cite a few specimens the khojas wife said to him one day make me a present of a kerchief of red yemen silk to put on my head the khoja stretched out his arms and said like that is that large enough on her replying in the affirmative he ran off to the bazaar with his arms still stretched out and meeting a man on the road he bawled to him look where you are going o man or you will cause me to lose my measure

another day the khojas wife washed his caftan and spread it upon a tree in the garden of the house that night the khoja goes out and thinks he sees in the moonlight a man motionless upon a tree in the garden give me my bow and arrows said he to his wife and having received them he shot the caftan piercing it through and through and then returned into the house next morning when he discovered that it was his own caftan he had shot at he exclaimed by allah had i happened to be in it i should have killed myself

p91

the ettrick shepherds wellknown story of the two highlanders and the wild boar has its exact parallel in the turkish jestbook as follows one day the khoja went with his friend sheragh ahmed to the den of a wolf in order to take the cubs said the khoja to ahmed do you go in and i will watch without and ahmed went in to take the cubs in the absence of the old wolf but she came back presently and had got halfway into her den when the khoja seized hold of her tail the wolf in her struggles cast up a great dust into the eyes of ahmed who called out to the khoja hallo what does all this dust mean the khoja replied if the wolfs tail breaks you will soon know what the dust means

several of the jests closely resemble joe millers told of irishmen such as this it happened one night after the khoja and a guest had lain down to sleep that the taper went out o khoja effendi said the guest the taper is gone out but there is a taper at your right side pray bring it and let us light it quoth the khoja you must surely be a fool to think that i should know my right hand in the dark and this a thief having stolen a piece of salted cheese from the khoja he ran immediately and seated himself on the border of a fountain said the people to him
p92

o khoja what have you come here to look for in such a hurry the khoja replied the thief will certainly come here to drink as soon as he has eaten my salted cheese i always do so myself

and here is one of the gothamite class one evening the khoja went to the well to draw water and seeing the moon reflected in the water he exclaimed the moon has fallen into the well i must pull it out so he let down the rope and hook and the hook became fastened to a stone whereupon he exerted all his strength and the rope broke and he fell upon his back looking into the sky he saw the moon and cried out joyfully praise be to allah i am sorely bruised but the moon has got into its place again

there is a wellworn jest of an irishman who being observed by a friend to look exceedingly blank and perplexed was asked what ailed him he replied that he had had a dream was it a good or a bad dream faith said he it was a little of both but ill tell ye i dreamt that i was with the pope who was the finest gentleman in the whole district and after we had conversed a while his holiness axed me would i drink thinks i to myself would a duck swim so seeing the whisky and the lemons and the

p93

sugar on the sideboard i said i didnt mind if i took a drop of punch cold or hot says his holiness hot your holiness says i so on that he steps down to the kitchen for the boiling water but bedad before he came back i woke straight up and now its distressing me that i didnt take it cold

we have somewhat of a parallel to this in a turkish jest the khoja dreamt that some one gave him nine pieces of money but he was not content and said make it ten then he awoke and found his hands empty instantly closing his eyes again and holding out his hand he said i repent give me the nine pieces1

but the chinese relate the very counterpart of our irishmans story a confirmed drunkard dreamt that he had been presented with a cup of excellent wine and set it by the fire to warm2 that he should better enjoy the flavour of it but just as he was about to drink off the delicious draught he awoke

1 the khoja however was not such a fool as we might conclude from the foregoing examples of his sayings and doings for being asked one day what musical instrument he liked best he answered i am very fond of the music of plates and saucepans

2 in china wine is almost invariably taken hot according to davis in his work on the chinese

p94

fool that i am he cried why was i not content to drink it cold1

the chinese seem to have as keen a sense of humour as any other people they tell a story for instance of a lady who had been recently married and on the third day saw her husband returning home so she slipped quiatly behind him and gave him a hearty kiss the husband was annoyed and said she offended all propriety pardon pardon said she i did not know it was you thus the excuse may sometimes be worse than the offence there is exquisite humour in the following noodlestory two brothers were tilling the ground together the elder having prepared dinner called his brother who replied in a loud voice wait till i have hidden my spade and i shall at once be with you when he joined his elder brother the latter mildly reproached him saying when one hides anything one should keep silence or at least should not cry aloud about it for it lays one open to be robbed dinner over

p95

the younger went back to the field and looked for his spade but could not find it so he ran to his brother and whispered mysteriously in his ear my spade is stolenthe passion for collecting antique relics is thus ridiculed a man who was fond of old curiosities though he knew not the true from the false expended all his wealth in purchasing mere imitations of the lightningstick of tchewkoung a glazed cup of the time of the emperor cheun and the mat of confucius and being reduced to beggary he carried these spurious relics about with him and said to the people in the streets sirs i pray you give me some coins struck by taïkoung

indian fiction abounds in stories of simpletons and probably the oldest extant drolleries of the gothamite type are found in the játakas or buddhist birthstories assuredly they were own brothers to our mad men of gotham the indian villagers who being pestered by mosquitoes when at work in the forest bravely resolved according to jútaka 44 to take their bows and arrows and other weapons and make war upon the troublesome insects until they had shot dead or cut in pieces every one but in trying to shoot the mosquitoes they only shot struck and injured

p96

one another and nothing more foolish is recorded of the schildburgers than somadeva relates in his kathá sarit ságara of the simpletons who cut down the palmtrees being required to furnish the king with a certain quantity of dates and perceiving that it was very easy to gather the dates of a palm which had fallen down of itself they set to work and cut down all the datepalms in their village and having gathered from them their whole crop of dates they raised them up and planted them again thinking they would grow in illustration of the apothegm that fools who attend only to the words of an order and do not understand the meaning cause much detriment is the story of the servants who kept the rain off the trunks the camel of a merchant gave way under its load on a journey he said to his servants i will go and buy another camel to carry the half of this camels load and you must remain here and take particular care that if it clouds over the rain does not wet the leather of these trunks which are full of clothes with these words the merchant left the servants by the side of the camel and went off and suddenly a cloud came up and began to discharge rain then the fools said our master told us to take care that the rain did not touch the leather of the trunks and after they had

p97

made this sage reflection they dragged the clothes out of the trunks and wrapped them round the leather the consequence was that the rain spoiled the clothes then the merchant returned and in a rage said to his servants you rascals talk of water why the whole stock of clothes is spoiled by the rain and they answered him you told us to keep the rain off the leather of the trunks what fault have we committed he answered i told you that if the leather got wet the clothes would be spoiled i told you so in order to save the clothes not the leather

the story of the servant who looked after the door is a farther illustration of the same maxim a merchant said to his foolish servant take care of the door of my shop i am going home for a short time after his master was gone the fool took the shopdoor on his shoulder and went off to see an actor perform as he was returning his master met him and gave him a scolding and he answered i have taken care of this door as you told me

this jest had found its way into europe three centuries ago it is related of giufa the typical sicilian booby and probably came to england from italy this is how it is told in the sacke full of newes a jestbook

p98

originally printed in the sixteenth century in the countrey dwelt a gentlewoman who had a french man dwelling with her and he did ever use to go to church with her and upon a time he and his mistresse were going to church and she bad him pull the doore after him and follow her to the church and so he took the doore betweene his armes and lifted it from the hooks and followed his mistresse with it but when she looked behinde her and saw him bring the doore upon his back why thou foolish knave qd she what wilt thou do with the door marry mistresse qd he you bad me pull the doore after me why fool qd she i did command thee that thou shouldest make fast the doore after thee and not bring it upon thy back after me but after this there was much good sport and laughing at his simplicity and foolishnesse therein

in the capacity of a merchant the simpleton does very wonderful things and plumes himself on his sagacity as we have already seen in the case of the arab and his cow and here are a brace of similar stories a foolish man once went to the island of katáha to trade and among his wares was a quantity of fragrant aloeswood after he had sold his other goods he could not find any one to take the aloeswood off his hands for the people

p99

who live there are not acquainted with that article of commerce then seeing people buying charcoal from the woodmen he burnt his stock of aloeswood and reduced it to charcoal he sold it for the price which charcoal usually fetched and returning home boasted of his cleverness and became the laughingstock of everybodyanother blockhead went to the market to sell cotton but no one would buy it from him because it was not properly cleaned in the meanwhile he saw in the bazaar a goldsmith selling gold which he had purified by heating it and he saw it taken by a customer seeing that he threw his cotton into the fire in order to purify it and it was all burned to ashes

there must be few who have not heard of the irishman who was hired by a yarmouth maltster to help in loading a ship as the vessel was about to sail the irishman cried out from the quay captain i lost your shovel overboard but i cut a big notch on the railfence round the stern just where it went down so you will find it when you come backa similar story is told of an indian simpleton he was sailing in a ship when he let a silver cup fall from his hand into the water having taken notes of the spot by observing the eddies and other signs in the

p100

water he said to himself i will bring it up from the bottom when i return as he was recrossing the sea he saw the eddies and other signs and thinking he recognised the spot he plunged into the water again and again to recover his cup but he only got well laughed at for his pains

we have an amusing commentary on the maxim that distress is sure to come from being in the company of fools in the following from the canarese storybook entitled kathá manjari a foolish fellow travelled with a shopkeeper when it became dark the fool lay down in the road to sleep but the shopkeeper took shelter in a hollow tree presently some thieves came along the road and one struck his feet against the fools legs upon which he exclaimed to his companions what is this is it a piece of wood the fool was angry and said go away go away is there a knot well tied containing five annas in the loins of a plank in your house the thieves then seized him and took away his annas as they were moving off they asked if the money was good or bad to which the noodle replied ha ha is it of my money you speak in that way and want to know whether it is good or bad lookthere is a shopkeeper in that tree pointing with his fingershow it to him then the thieves

p101

went up to the shopkeeper and robbed him of two hundred pagodas

in our next story of the villagers who ate the buffalo is exemplified the fact that fools in the conceit of their folly while they deny what need not be denied reveal what it is their interest to suppress in order to get themselves believed some villagers took a buffalo belonging to a certain man and killed it in an enclosure outside the village under a banyan tree and dividing the flesh ate it up the owner of the buffalo went and complained to the king and he had the villagers who had eaten the animal brought before him the proprietor of the buffalo said before the king in their presence these men took my buffalo under a banyan tree near the tank and killed and ate it before my eyes whereupon an old fool among the villagers said there is no tank or banyan tree in our village he says what is not true where did we kill his buffalo or eat it when the man heard this he replied what are there not a banyan tree and a tank on the east side of the village moreover you ate my buffalo on the eighth day of the lunar month the old fool then said there is no east side or eighth day in our village on hearing this the king laughed and said to encourage the fool you are a truthful person you never say anything false

p102

so tell me the truth did you eat that buffalo or did you not the old fool answered i was born three years after my father died and he taught me skill in speaking so i never say what is untrue my king it is true that we ate his buffalo but all the rest that he alleges is false when the king heard this he and his courtiers could not restrain their laughter but he restored the price of the buffalo to the man and fined the villagers

but sometimes even kings have been arrant noodles and their credulity quite as amusing or amazingas that of their subjects once on a time there was a king who had a handsome daughter and he summoned his physicians and said to them make some preparation of salutary drugs which will cause my daughter to grow up quickly so that she may be married to a good husband the physicians wishing to get a living out of this royal fool replied there is a medicine which will do this but it can only be procured in a distant country and while we are sending for it we must shut up your daughter in concealment for this is the treatment laid down in such cases the king having consented they placed his daughter in concealment for several years pretending that they were engaged in procuring the medicine and when she was grown up they presented her to the king say

p103

ing that she had been made to grow by the preparation so the king was highly pleased and gave them much wealth

between an indian rájá and an indian dhobie or washerman there is the greatest possible difference socially but individually when both are noodlesthere may be sometimes very little to choose indeed of the two all things considered the difference if any is perhaps in favour of the humble cleanser of bodyclothes a favourite story in various parts of india near akin to that last cited is of a poor washerman and his young ass this simpleton one day passing a school kept by a mullah or muhammedan doctor of laws heard him scolding his pupils exclaiming that they were still asses although he had done so much to make them men the washerman thought that here was a rare chance for he happened to have the foal of the ass that carried his bundles of clothes which since he had no child he should get the learned mullah to change into a boy thus thinking he goes next day to the mullah and asks him to admit his foal into his school in order that it should be changed into the human form and nature the preceptor seeing the poor fellows simplicity answered that the task was very laborious

p104

and he must have a fee of a hundred rupis so the washerman went home and soon returned leading his foal which with the money he handed over to the teacher who told him to come again on such a day and hour when he should find that the change he desired had been effected but the washerman was so impatient that he went to the teacher several times before the day appointed and was informed that the foal was beginning to learn manners that its ears were already become very much shorter and in short that it was making satisfactory progress

it happened when the day came on which he was to receive his young ass transformed into a fine welleducated boy the simpleton was kept busy with his customers clothes but on the day following he found time to go to the teacher who told him it was most unfortunate he had not come at the appointed hour since the youth had quitted the school yesterday refusing to submit any longer to authority but the teacher had just learned that he had been made kází or judge in cawnpore at first the washerman was disposed to be angry but reflecting that after all the business was better even than he anticipated he thanked the preceptor for all his care and trouble and returned home

p105

having informed his wife of his good luck they resolved to visit their quondam young foal and get him to make them some allowance out of his now ample means so shutting up their house they travelled to cawnpore which they reached in safety being directed to the kázís court the washerman leaving his wife outside entered and discovered the kází seated in great dignity and before him were the pleaders litigants and officers of the court he had brought a bridle in one hand and a wisp of hay in the other but being unable on account of the crowd to approach the kází he got tired of waiting so holding up the bridle and the hay he cried out khoor khoor khoor as he used to do in calling his donkeys thinking this would induce the kází to come to him but instead of this he was seized by the kázís order and locked up for creating a disturbance

when the business of the court was over the kází pitying the supposed madman sent for him to learn the reason of his strange behaviour and in answer to his inquiries the simpleton said you dont seem to know me sir nor recognise this bridle which has been in your mouth so often you appear to forget that you are the foal of one of my asses that i got changed into a man for the

p106

fee of a hundred rupis by a learned mullah who transforms asses into educated men you forget what you were and i suppose will be as little submissive to me as you were to the mullah when you ran away from him all present were convulsed with laughter such a case was never heard of before but the kází seeing how the mullah had taken advantage of the poor fellows simplicity gave him a present of a hundred rupis besides sufficient for the expenses of his journey home and so dismissed him

a party of rogues once found as great a blockhead in a rich indian herdsman to whom they said we have asked the daughter of a wealthy inhabitant of the town in marriage for you and her father has promised to give her he was much pleased to hear this and gave them an ample reward for their trouble after a few days they came again and told him that his marriage had taken place again he gave them rich presents for their good news some more days having passed they said to him a son has been born to you at which he was in ecstacies and gave them all his remaining wealth but the next day when he began to lament saying i am longing to see my son the people laughed at him on account of his

p107

having been cheated by the rogues as if he had acquired the stupidity of cattle from having so much to do with them

it is not generally known that the incident which forms the subject of the droll scotch song the barring of the door which also occurs in the nights of straparola is of eastern origin in an arabian tale a blockhead having married his pretty cousin gave the customary feast to their relations and friends when the festivities were over he conducted his guests to the door and from absence of mind neglected to shut it before returning to his wife dear cousin said his wife to him when they were alone go and shut the street door it would be strange indeed he replied if i did such a thing am i just made a bridegroom clothed in silk wearing a shawl and a dagger set with diamonds and am i to go and shut the door why my dear you are crazy go and shut it yourself oh indeed exclaimed the wife am i young robed in a dress with lace and precious stonesam i to go and shut the street door no indeed it is you who are become crazy and not i come let us make a bargain she continued and let the first who speaks go and fasten the door agreed said the husband and immediately he became mute and the wife too

p108

was silent while they both sat down dressed as they were in their nuptial attire looking at each other and seated on opposite sofas thus they remained for two hours some thieves happened to pass by and seeing the door open entered and laid hold of whatever came to their hands the silent couple heard footsteps in the house but opened not their mouths the thieves came into the room and saw them seated motionless and apparently indifferent to all that might take place they continued their pillage therefore collecting together everything valuable and even dragging away the carpets from beneath them they laid hands on the noodle and his wife taking from their persons every article of jewellery while they in fear of losing the wager said not a word having thus cleared the house the thieves departed quietly but the pair continued to sit uttering not a syllable towards morning a police officer came past on his tour of inspection and seeing the door open walked in after searching all the rooms and finding no person he entered their apartment and inquired the meaning of what he saw neither of them would condescend to reply the officer became angry and ordered their heads to be cut off the executioners sword was about to perform its office when the wife cried out

p109

sir he is my husband do not kill him oh oh exclaimed the husband overjoyed and clapping his hands you have lost the wager go and shut the door he then explained the whole affair to the police officer who shrugged his shoulders and went away1

a party of noodles are substituted for the husband and wife in a turkish version of the tale in the history of the forty vazirs some bangeaters2 while out walking found a sequin they said let us go to a cook and buy food and eat so they went and entered a cooks shop and said master give us a sequins worth of food the cook prepared all kinds of food and loaded a porter with it and the bangeaters

1 in another arabian version the man desires his wife to moisten some stale bread she has set before him for supper and she refuses after an altercation it is agreed that the one who speaks first shall get up and moisten the bread a neighbour comes in and to his surprise finds the couple dumb he kisses the wife but the man says nothing he gives the man a blow but still he says nothing he has the man taken before the kází but even yet he says nothing the kází orders him to be hanged and he is led off to execution when the wife rushes up and cries out oh save my poor husband you wretch says the man go home and moisten the bread

took him without the city where there was a ruined tomb which they entered and sat down in and the porter deposited the food and went away the bangeaters began to partake of the food when suddenly one of them said the door is open do one of you shut it else some other bangeaters will come in and annoy us even though they be friends they will do the deeds of foes one of them replied go thou and shut the door and they fell aquarrelling at length one said come let us agree that whichever of us speaks or laughs shall rise and fasten the door they all agreed to this proposal and left the food and sat quite still suddenly a great number of dogs came in not one of the bangeaters stirred or spoke for if one spoke he would have to rise and shut the door so they spoke not the dogs made an end of the food and ate it all up just then another dog leapt in from without but no food remained now one of the bangeaters had partaken of everything and some of the food remained about his mouth and on his beard that newly come dog licked up the particles of food that were on the bangeaters breast and while he was licking up those about his mouth he took his lip for a piece of meat and bit it the bangeater did not stir for he said within himself they will tell me to

p111

shut the door but to ease his soul he cried ough inwardly cursing the dog when the other bangeaters heard him make that noise they said rise fasten the door he replied after loss attention now that the food is gone and my lip is wounded what is the use of shutting that door and crying woe alas they each went in a different direction1

a similar story is known in kashmir five friends chanced to meet and all having leisure they decided to go to the bazaar and purchase a sheeps head and have a great feast in the house of one of the party each of whom subscribed four annas the head was bought but while they were returning to the house it was remembered that there was not any butter on this one of the five proposed that the first of them that should break silence by speaking should go for the butter now it was no light matter to have to retrace ones steps back to the buttershop as the way was long and the day was very hot so they all five kept strict silence pots were cleaned the fire was prepared and the head laid thereon now and then one would cough and another would groan but never a tongue uttered a word though the fire was

fast going out and the head was getting burnt owing to there being no fat or butter wherewith to grease the pot thus matters were when a policeman passed by and attracted by the smell of cooking looked in at the window and saw these five men perfectly silent and sitting around a burnt sheeps head not knowing the arrangement he supposed that these men were either mad or were thieves and so he inquired how they came there and how they obtained the head not a word was uttered in reply why are you squatting there in that stupid fashion shouted the policeman still no reply then the policeman full of rage that these wretched men should thus mock at his authority took them all off straight to the police inspectors office on arrival the inspector asked them the reason of their strange behaviour but he also got no reply this rather tried the patience and temper of the man of authority who was generally feared and flattered and bribed so he ordered one of the five to be immediately flogged the poor fool bore it bravely and uttered never a sound but when the blows repeatedly fell on the same wounded parts he could endure no longer and cried out oh oh why do you beat me enough enough is it not enough that the sheeps head has been spoiled

his four associates now cried out go to the bazaar and fetch the butter1

there is quite as droll a version current among the people of ceylon to the following effect a gentleman once had in his employment twentyfive idiots in the old times it was customary with sinhalese high families not to allow their servants to eat from plates but every day they were supplied with plantain leaves from which they took their food after eating they were accustomed to shape the leaf into the form of a cup and drink out of it now in this gentlemans house the duty of providing the leaves devolved upon the twentyfive idiots who were scarcely fit for any other work one day when they had gone into the garden to cut the leaves they spoke among themselves and said why should we every one of us trouble ourselves to fetch plantain leaves when one only could very easily do it let us therefore lie down on the ground and sleep

1 knowles dictionary of kashmírí proverbs and sayings pp 1978 the article bought by the five men is called a hír which mr knowles says is the head of any animal used for food and a sheeps head were surely fitting food for such noodles mr knowles makes it appear that the whole affair of keeping silence was a mere jest but we have before seen that it is decidedly meant for a noodlestory

like dead men and let him who first utters a sound or opens his eyes undertake the work it was no sooner said than done the men lay in a heap like so many logs at breakfasttime that day the hungry servants went to the kitchen for their rice only to be disappointed no leaves were forthcoming on which to distribute the food and a complaint was made to the master that the twentyfive idiots had not returned to the house since they went out in the morning search was at once made and they were found fast asleep in the garden after vainly endeavouring to rouse them the master concluded that they were dead and ordered his servants to dig a deep hole and bury them a grave was then dug and the idiots were one by one thrown into it but still there was no noise or motion on their part at length when they were all put into the grave and were being covered up a tool employed by one of the servants hit sharply by accident against the leg of one of the idiots who then involuntarily moaned thereupon all the others exclaimed you were the first to utter a sound therefore from henceforth you must take upon yourself the duty of providing the plantain leaves1 it has already been remarked that a literary

italian version of the silent couple is found in the nights of straparola but there are other variants orally current among the common people in different parts of italy this is one from venice there were once a husband and a wife the former said one day to the latter let us have some fritters she replied what shall we do for a fryingpan go and borrow one from my godmother you go and get it it is only a little way off go yourself and i will take it back when we are done with it so she went and borrowed the pan and when she returned said to her husband here is the pan but you must carry it back so they cooked the fritters and after they had eaten the husband said now let us go to work both of us and the one who speaks first shall carry back the pan then she began to spin and he to draw his threadfor he was a shoemakerand all the time keeping silence except that when he drew his thread he said leulerò leulerò and she spinning answered picicì picicì piciciò and they said not another word now there happened to pass that way a soldier with a horse and he asked a woman if there was any shoemaker in that street she said there was one near by and took him to the house the soldier asked the shoemaker to come

p116

and cut his horse a girth and he would pay him the latter made no answer but leulerò leulerò and his wife picicì picicì piciciò then the soldier said come and cut my horse a girth or i will cut your head off the shoemaker only answered leulerò leulerò and his wife picicì picicì piciciò then the soldier began to grow angry and seized his sword and said to the shoemaker either come and cut my horse a girth or i will cut your head off but to no purpose the shoemaker did not wish to be the first one to speak and only replied leulerò leulerò and his wife picicì picicì piciciò then the soldier got mad in good earnest seized the shoemakers head and was going to cut it off when his wife saw that she cried out ah dont for mercys sake good exclaimed her husband good now you go and carry the pan back to my godmother and i will go and cut the horses girth

in a sicilian version the man and wife fry some fish and then set about their respective workshoemaking and spinningand the one who finishes first the piece of work begun is to eat the fish while they are singing and whistling at their work a friend comes along who knocks at the door but receives no answer then he enters and speaks to

p117

them but still no reply finally in anger he sits down at the table and eats up all the fish himself1

thus it will be observed the droll incident which forms the subject of the old scotch song of the barring of the door is of worldwide celebrity

gothamite stories appear to have been familiar throughout europe during the later middle ages if we may judge from a chapter of the gesta romanorum in which the monkish compiler has curiously moralised the actions of three noodles

we read in the lives of the fathers that an angel showed to a certain holy man three men labouring under a triple fatuity the first made a faggot of wood and because it was too heavy for him to carry he added to it more wood hoping by such means to make it light the second drew water with great labour from a very deep well with a sieve which he incessantly filled the third carried a beam in his chariot and wishing to enter his house whereof the gate was so narrow and low that it would not admit him he violently whipped his horse until they both fell together into a deep well

having shown this to the holy man the angel said what think you of these three men that they are fools answered he understand however returned the angel that they represent the sinners of this world the first describes that kind of men who from day to day do add new sins to the old because they cannot bear the weight of those which they already have the second man represents those who do good but do it sinfully and therefore it is of no benefit and the third person is he who would enter the kingdom of heaven with all his world of vanities but is cast down into hell

and now a few more indian and other stories of the gothamite class to conclude the present section in málava there were two brahman brothers and the wealth inherited from their father was left jointly between them and while they were dividing that wealth they quarrelled about one having too little and the other having too much and they made a teacher learned in the vedas arbitrator and he said to them you must divide everything your father left into two halves so that you may not quarrel about the inequality of the division when the two fools heard this they divided every single

thing into two equal partshouse beds in fact all their property including their cattle henry stephens henri estienne in the introduction to his apology for herodotus1 relates some very amusing noodlestories such as of him who burning his shins before the fire and not having wit enough to go back from it sent for masons to remove the chimney of the fool who ate the doctors prescription because he was told to take it of another wittol who having seen one spit upon iron to try whether it was hot did likewise with his porridge and best of all he tells of a fellow who was hit on the back with a stone as he rode upon his mule and cursed the animal for kicking him this last exquisite jest has its analogue in that of the irishman who was riding on an ass one fine day when the beast by kicking at the flies that annoyed him got one of its hind feet

the poet ovid alludes to the story of ino persuading the women of the country to roast the wheat before it was sown which may have come to india through the greeks since we are told in the kathá sarit ságara of a foolish villager who one day roasted some sesame seeds and finding them nice to eat he sowed a large quantity of roasted seeds hoping that similar ones would come up the story also occurs in coelhos contes portuguezes and is probably of buddhistic origin and an analogous story is told of an irishman who gave his hens hot water in order that they should lay boiled eggsembed"
