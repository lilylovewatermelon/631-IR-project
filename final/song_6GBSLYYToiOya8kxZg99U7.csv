and welcome me back to town
come out on your porch or  step into your parlour
and ill tell you how it all went down
out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
and a good saloon in every single town

and i remembered something you once told me
and ill be damned if it did not come true
twenty thousand roads i went down down down
and they all led me straight back home to you
cause i headed west to grow up with the country
across those prairies with the waves of grain
and i saw my devil and i saw my deep blue sea
and i thought about a calico bonnet from cheyenne to tennessee

we flew straight across that river bridge last night half past two
the switchman wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
and now i know just what i have to do

and the man on the radio wont leave me alone
he wants to take my money for something that ive never been shown
and i saw my devil and i saw my deep blue see
and i thought about a calico bonnet from cheyenne to tennessee
you might also likethe news i could bring i met up with the king
on his head an amphetamine crown
he talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
and lighted out for some desert town
out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
and a good saloon in every single town

and i remembered something you once told me
and ill be damned if it did not come true
twenty thousand roads i went down down down
and they all led me straight back home to you
twenty thousand roads i went down down down
and they all led me straight back home to you3embed"
