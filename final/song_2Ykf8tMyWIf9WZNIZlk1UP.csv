incompatible it don’t matter though
cause someone’s bound to hear my cry
speak out if you do you’re not easy to find

verse 2
is it possible mr lovable
is already in my life
right in front of me
or maybe you’re in disguise

chorus
who doesn’t long for someone to hold
who knows how to love you without being told
somebody tell me why i’m on my own
if there’s a soulmate for everyone
oh yeah yeah

verse 3
here we are again circles never end
how do i find the perfect fit
there’s enough for everyone
but i’m still waiting in line

chorus
who doesn’t long for someone to hold
who knows how to love you without being told
somebody tell me why i’m on my own
if there’s a soulmate for everyone
if there’s a soulmate for everyone

most relationships seem so transitory
they’re all good but not the permanent one

chorus
who doesn’t long for someone to hold
who knows how to love you without being told
oh somebody tell me why i’m on my own
if there’s a soulmate for everyone
who doesn’t long for someone to hold
who knows how to love you without being told
somebody tell me why i’m on my own
if there’s a soulmate for everyone
if there’s a soulmate for everyone3embed"
