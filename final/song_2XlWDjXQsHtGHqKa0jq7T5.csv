feeling like a loser feeling like a bum
sitting on the outside observing the fun
dont get on my bad side i can work a gun
hop into the backseat baby ill show you some fun

prechorus
these people are weird in here
and theyre giving me the fear
just because you know my name
doesnt mean you know my game
i look myself in the face
and whisper im in the wrong place
is there more to lose than gain
if i go on my own again

chorus
on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside

verse 2
people are connecting dont know what to say
im good at protecting what they wanna take
spilt the milk at breakfast hit me doublehard
and i grinned at you softly cause im a fucking wild card
see marina liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus
these people are weird in here
and theyre giving me the fear
just because you know my name
doesnt mean you know my game
i look myself in the face
and whisper im in the wrong place
is there more to lose than gain
if i go on my own again

chorus
on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside again again

bridge
outside
all i know is i cannot pretend
so im sitting on the outside again
inside

chorus
on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside again
on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside the outsider on my own again
inside
outro
inside again
inside again
inside again
inside again14embed"
