verse 2 young buck
walk it and talk it spit it how i live it nigga
came from the country dirty south get it nigga
feds try and question me they run up in my hotel
they said there was a shootin but they found no shells
new york city hell they throwin niggas under jails
i got love for them and i aint even from there
now bust a shot for them boys on the block
i can feel your pain nigga im still in the game nigga
theres somethin bout the sound of a trey pound
that make me pull up hop out and make a nigga lay down
see every time we round you hear some shots go off
and niggas get they chains snatched when they tryin to show off
shootouts in broad day we do it the mob way
and come to find out these niggas softer than sade
ima keep livin my life with a pistol in my palm
and a wrist full of ice you can call me a don motherfucker

i got a handgun habit nigga front ill let you have it
when the shots go off cops sayin 50 back at it
im allergic to the feathers on these birdass niggas
front and ill put your brains on that curb fast nigga woo
i aint a marksman one spark and i spray shit
nuff rounds from that hk i dont play bitch
move like im militant back on that gorilla shit
moody disrespectful unruly but niggas cant move me
i squeeze til i run out of ammo if its a problem its handled
i have your people pourin our liquor and lightin candles
you fuck around i blow your brains on my new york times
run home turn to the sports section and read your mind
its crystal clear you should feel when that gat bust
first theres crime scene tape then you end up in that black hearse
we dont go to funerals but well go to your wake fam
view your body all banged up you made a mistake man
