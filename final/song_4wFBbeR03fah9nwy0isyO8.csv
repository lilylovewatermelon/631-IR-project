4wFBbeR03fah9nwy0isyO8,The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!,Sufjan Stevens,1pOl0KEC1iQnA6F0XxV4To,"76 contributorsthe predatory wasp of the palisades is out to get us lyricsthinking outrageously i write in cursive
i hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
i see my own breath on the face of the door

oh i am not quite sleeping
oh i am fast in bed
there on the wall in the bedroom creeping
i see a wasp with her wings outstretched
north of savanna we swim in the palisades
i come out wearing my brothers red hat
there on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
he runs washing his face in his hands
oh how i meant to tease him
oh how i meant no harm
touching his back with my hand i kiss him
i see the wasp on the length of my arm
oh great sights upon this state hallelu
wonders bright and rivers lake hallelu
we were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait
backing  simultaneous to above
trail of tears and horseshoe lake hallelu
you might also likewe were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait
backing  simultaneous to above
trusting things beyond mistake hallelu

horn breakdown

we were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait

we were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait
backing  simultaneous to above
lamb of god we sound the horn hallelu

we were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait
backing  simultaneous to above
unto us your ghost is born hallelu
i cant explain the state that im in
the state of my heart he was my best friend
into the car from the back seat
oh admiration in falling asleep
all of my powers day after day
i can tell you we swaggered and swayed
deep in the tower the prairies below
i can tell youâ€” the telling gets old
terrible sting and terrible storm
i can tell you the day we were born
backing  simultaneous to above
oh great sights upon this state hallelu

my friend is gone he ran away
i can tell you i love him each day
backing  simultaneous to above
wonders bright and rivers lake hallelu

though we have sparred wrestled and raged
i can tell you i love him each day
backing  simultaneous to above
trail of tears and horseshoe lake hallelu

terrible sting terrible storm
i can tell you
backing  simultaneous to final stanza
we were in love we were in love
palisades palisades
i can wait i can wait
backing  simultaneous to final stanza
trusting things beyond mistake hallelu12embed"
