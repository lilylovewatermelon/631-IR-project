i got to thinking about all the stuff we worry about and i realized that
all that a man really needs
is a horse you can catch when you need him
a dog thatll come when you call
a good friend who owns an arena
and a trailer thats legal to haul
a woman wholl share my frustrations
when the cow markets falling apart
a pair of good spurs a saddle that fits
and a oneton ford pickup that starts
everything else is windowdressing

verse 1
im out here chasin these rainbows that i need to find
i go and lord knows it kills me to leave her behind
she drew a low card when she gave me her heart
and sometimes its hard to believe
that sweet little angel went and got herself tangled
in the arms of a cowboy like me

chorus
well i know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights
smoky bars and guitars dont make for no fairytale life
and every time i head home i think ill find her gone
but shes still there and still wants to be
in the arms of a cowboy like me
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeverse 2
shes worn a hole in the carpet between the bed and the phone
she worries about me when i leave til im back home
cause theres downtime for killin
theres whiskey and theres women
thats just right for fillin a need
oh but shes in no danger
theres no room for a stranger
in the arms of a cowboy like me

chorus
i know she deserves more than a drifter that lives for the lights
smoky bars and guitars dont make for no fairytale life
every time i head home i think ill find her gone
but shes still there and still wants to be
in the arms of a cowboy like me

outro
yeah every time i head home i think ill find her gone
but shes still there and still wants to be
in the arms of a cowboy like me
in the arms of a cowboy like me
a cowboy like meembed"
