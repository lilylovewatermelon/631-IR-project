i still got your number and i wonder
what youre doing tonight
i heard you were hurting but he wasnt worth it
well i couldve told you he wasnt right

prechorus
well some buddies of mine
they said you had a big fight in town
you ran off crying
at least thats whats going around

chorus
know how those rumors fly
sometimes theyre all a lie
burn up before they hit the ground
but right now theyre going round
i dont wanna move in too soon
i know your heartbreak is brand new
if i never wouldve let you down
this probably wouldnt be going round

postchorus
round and round and round and round
probably wouldnt be going round

but i wanna try again

prechorus
