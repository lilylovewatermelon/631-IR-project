i was raised in pocahontas illinois
everybody thought of me as one of the boys
cause id run with a crowd that was tough

at fifteen
i was tending big os bar
id sing til 200 am for a halffull tip jar
spent my youth singing truth
paying dues

chorus
im the biggest thing
that ever came from my hometown
and ill be damned if im gonna let em down
if its the last thing i do
before they lay me in the ground
you know im gonna make pocahontas proud

verse 2
i knocked on every door on music row
but they looked down at me
and said girl go back home
you aint got what we need in this town

but they couldnt whup the fighting side of me
you know where i come from
we dont give up easily
overnight
took all my life to be found
you might also likeim the biggest thing
that ever came from my hometown
and ill be damned if im gonna let em down
if its the last thing i do
before they lay me in the ground
you know im gonna make pocahontas proud

bridge
at twentyseven
i had baby grace
i was born again when i saw her sweet face
and i knew she was the greatest thing id ever do

chorus
im the biggest thing
that ever came from my hometown
and ill be damned if im gonna let em down
if its the last thing i do
before they lay me in the ground

im the biggest thing
that ever came from my hometown
and ill be damned if im gonna let em down

if its the last thing i do
before they lay me in the ground
you know im gonna make pocahontas proud
i was raised in pocahontas illinois
pocahontas proud
you know im gonna make pocahontas proud
pocahontas proudembed"
