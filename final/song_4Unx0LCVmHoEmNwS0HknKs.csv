the system they set for enslavement
in present pervades
a corporate monarch of bastards
weve all been betrayed
its time that we question its time that we changed
the next generation fully disengaged
unconscious society serving as slaves
the fear justifying the wars they have waged

chorus
and now were just evading
this conversation must be had
and are we just maintaining
this constitution of despair in disrepair

verse 2
the system they set for enslavement
in present pervades
a corporate monarch of bastards
weve all been betrayed
media fraught with the duplicity
controlled by machines of oligarchy
a corporate reign in the land of the free
applauding the death of our democracy
