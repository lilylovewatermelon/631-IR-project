my friends are so depressed
i feel the question of your loneliness
confide cause ill be on your side
you know i will you know i will

verse 2
exgirlfriend called me up
alone and desperate on the prison phone
they want to give her seven years
for being sad

chorus
i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you dont know yourself

verse 3
my friends are so distressed
and standing on the brink of emptiness
no words i know of to express
this emptiness

chorus
i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you dont know yourself

bridge
imagine me
taught by tragedy
release is peace

verse 4
i heard a little girl
and what she said was something beautiful
to give your love no matter what
was what she said

chorus
i love all of you
hurt by the cold
so hard and lonely too
when you dont know yourself8embed"
