theres a room in a hotel in new york city
that shares our fate and deserves our pity
i dont want to remember it all
the promises i made if you just hold on
hold on hold on hold on hold on

verse 1
i just need enough of you to dull the pain
just to get me through the night till were twins again
til were stripped down to our skeletons again
til were saints just swimming in our sins again
and theres a jet black crow droning on and on and on
up above our heads droning on and on and on
keep making trouble til you find what you love
i need a new partner in crime and you you shrug that

chorus
theres a room in a hotel in new york city
that shares our fate and deserves our pity
i dont want to remember it all
the promises i made if you just hold on
hold on hold on hold on hold on

verse 2
a birth and a death on the same day
and honey i only appeared so i can fade away
i wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
and i can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
and theres a jet black crow droning on and on and on
up above our heads droning on and on and on
hit it never quit it i have been through the wreck
but i can string enough to show my face in the light again
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
theres a room in a hotel in new york city
that shares our fate and deserves our pity
i dont want to remember it all
the promises i made if you just hold on
hold on hold on hold on hold on
