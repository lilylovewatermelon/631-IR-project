you been picking my voice to dance to
you say my money no good in here
even though i didnt ask you
and its the most youve worked
even though i probably dont deserve this girl
but you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
baby its ok
i got show money baby
i wanna show you how i blow money baby
i wanna show you how i throw money baby
im a kid so its hard for me to hold money baby
cause im a star dont get it twisted
got some trappers in my car
what kind of caps i got the brownest of them all
somebody pop em before we pop em all before we pop em all

hook
saying this aint nothing but its all i need
and the peak aint reached but the peak is all i feel
and it feels so good
it feels so good
it feels so good
it feels so good

i aint scared of the fall
i aint scared of the fall
i aint scared of the fall
i aint scared of the fall
ive felt the ground before
ive felt the ground before
ive felt the ground before
ive felt the ground before
cuz i aint scared of the fall

mama i understand why youre mad
and it hurts to accept what i am
and how i live
and what i do
but ive been good since thursday
yes ive been good since thursday

so you can watch my love vanish
in a girl with no talent
but to make mula vanish
call her friend for my friend
and friends names lexus
i let my niggas test it
her morals worth a cent
and best believe i already spent it
my blunt full of bc
my cup full of texas
flown on that ovo jet yeah i said it
i was born to be reckless
was forced to make records
so you aint gotta ask whos next whos next

hook
saying this aint nothing but its all i need
and the peak aint reached but the peak is all i feel
and it feels so good
it feels so good
it feels so good
it feels so good
i aint scared of the fall
i aint scared of the fall
i aint scared of the fall
ive felt the ground before
ive felt the ground before
ive felt the ground before

bridge
the fall
and i aint scared of the fall
