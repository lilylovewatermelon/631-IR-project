wake up bloodshot eye
struggle to memorize
the way it felt between your thighs
pleasure that made you cry
it feels so good to be bad
not worth the aftermath after that after that
try to get you back

prechorus
i still dont have a reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder if i ever gave a fuck about you

chorus
give me somethin to believe in
cause i dont believe in you anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try
yeah so this is goodbye

verse 2
god damn my spinnin head
decisions that made my bed
now i must lay in it
and deal with things ive left unsaid
i want to dive into you
forget what youre goin through
i get behind make your move
forget about the truth
