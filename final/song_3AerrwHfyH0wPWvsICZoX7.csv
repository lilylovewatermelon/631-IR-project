verse 1 kxllswxtch
cant get a motherfuckin grip im slipping
i do not wanna coexist you pipsqueaks
i push his face into my fist you best be
heavy artillery equipped to test me
just want revenge i cant let go
of whats been done to me i cant let go
of whats been done so
i let all this hate build up inside me

verse 2 lil darkie
i dont think he wanna die the politician in a suit
i dont think he wanna die the policeman thats why he shoot
in an alley getting high off something scheduled one or two
i dont think you wanna die so why you saying that you do
legalized suicide flip the script
and im surprised youre alive the pictures kicking
its fucked that you and i share oxygen
i will survive the public is not my friend
uh you need a passport to leave the country
if i say too much they will hunt me
pop pop pop goes the rifle
with uncle sam do not trifle
with time has died the true rebel spirit
there is no one left
only cowards nope no one left
we dont get a ff
chorus kxllswxtch kxllswxtch  lil darkie

i dont think he wanna die die die die
i dont think he wanna die die die die
i dont think he wanna die die die die
