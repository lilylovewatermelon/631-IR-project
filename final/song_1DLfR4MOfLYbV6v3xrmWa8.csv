mr vice president
mr madison
senator burr
what is this

jefferson
we have the check stubs from separate accounts

madison
almost a thousand dollars paid in different amounts

burr
to a mr james reynolds way back in
seventeen ninetyone

hamilton
is that what you have are you done
madison
you are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

jefferson
though virtue is not a word i’d apply to this situation

madison
to seek financial gain to stray from your sacred mission
you might also likejefferson
and the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation

burr
an immigrant embezzling our government funds

jeffersonmadison
i can almost see the headline your career is done

burr
i hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

burrjeffersonmadison
ya best gwan run back where ya come from

hamilton
ha you don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess

jeffersonmadisonburr
confess

hamilton
you have nothing i don’t have to tell you anything at all
unless

jeffersonmadisonburr
unless
hamilton
if i can prove that i never broke the law
do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw

burr
no one else was in the room where it happened

hamilton
is that a yes

jeffersonmadisonburr
um yes
burr
“dear sir i hope this letter finds you in good health
and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
in the pockets of people like me down on their luck
you see that was my wife who you decided to”

jefferson
whaaaat
hamilton
she courted me
escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
that’s when reynolds extorted me
for a sordid fee
i paid him quarterly
i may have mortally wounded my prospects
but my papers are orderly
as you can see i kept a record of every check in my checkered history
check it again against your list and see consistency
i never spent a cent that wasn’t mine
you sent the dogs after my scent that’s fine
yes i have reasons for shame
but i have not committed treason and sullied my good name
as you can see i have done nothing to provoke legal action
are my answers to your satisfaction
jefferson
my god

madison
gentlemen let’s go

hamilton
so

jefferson and madison
the people wont know what we know

hamilton
burr
how do i know you won’t use this against me
the next time we go toe to toe

burr
alexander rumors only grow
and we both know what we know13embed"
