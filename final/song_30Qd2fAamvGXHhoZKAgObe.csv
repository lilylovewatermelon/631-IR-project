well my trailer looks like a liquor store
or maybe one that just got robbed
well ive got every bottle you can think of honey
from crown to enchanted rock
and i aint keith whitley and i aint george jones
but i damn sure could be the next
and my girlfriend of two months left me last night
i cant remember what i said
well goddamn

prechorus
they say people are creatures of habit
i got more habits than i need
well i dip drink and smoke
and i dabble in the coke and i took up smoking weed
and i dont care if i get cancer some disease and die today
because thats just about my only ticket out of boomtown usa

chorus
oh and out here it gets lonesome and out here it aint no fun
living in the desert and this unpredicted weather
and the forecast is probably more sun
i may get loaded or go to bed
but ill still be tired the next day
cause there aint no rest for the wicked out here
in boomtown usa
oh yeah
you might also likeverse
well i think that i might go crazy
yeah i think i might go insane
but im keeping it together and i tell myself
im never working in this place again
then i see the zeros that the paystub shows
and im back to work the next day
cause they pay me too good for the suffering i do
out in boomtown usa

chorus
oh yeah out here it gets lonesome and out here it aint no fun
living in the desert and this unpredicted weather
and the forecast is probably more sun
i may get fucked up or go to bed
but ill still be tired the next day
cause there aint no rest for the wicked out here
in boomtown usa
no there aint no rest for the wicked out here in boomtownembed"
