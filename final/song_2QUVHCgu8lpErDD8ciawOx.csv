will this graveyard be the dance floor
for these corpses
will they be the first to fall
and dance the night away

why do we do this to ourselves
were buying every word they sell

starving loved ones
carry our guns
take a look at what weve become
hungry nations
standing in the ashes of
our enemies remains

why do we do this to ourselves
were buying every word they sell
why do we do this to ourselves
were buying every word
that they sell

so we dance the night away
so we dance the night away
so we dance the night away
so we dance the night away
the night away

why do we do this to ourselves
were buying every word
that they sellembed"
