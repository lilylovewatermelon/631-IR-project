singing old songs
what if i waste my life up
and all my problems
its so stupid
theyre not even problems
it was supposed to snow
and it did for a minute
but theres no distraction now
or we could spend these years up
on the phone
but is that much better
it was supposed to snow
but it didnt
so theres no excuses nowyou might also likeembed"
