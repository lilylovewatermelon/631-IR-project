the eyes around me are so cold
with every chance they steal my soul
so walk with me talk with me
hold my hand im stumbling
in consequence here is me alive

prechorus
can you fix whats made to be broken
i cant fix whats made to be

chorus
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve
im not hiding no
it only hurts to breathe
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve
i know its blinding no
it only hurts to breathe

verse 2
standing now im alone
i need answers tell me everything you know
so heavy is the night
exhausted
whispers tend to crucify my mind
im fighting but im blind

can you fix whats made to be broken
i cant fix whats made to be

chorus
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve
im not hiding no
it only hurts to breathe
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve

i shout out
can you hear me
mistakes have cost me years
do they cost you
are you like me
tell me please

chorus
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve
im not hiding no
it only hurts to breathe
my heart is tattooed on my sleeve
i know its blinding no
it only hurts it only hurts
it only hurts to breatheembed"
