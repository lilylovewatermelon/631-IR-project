another head hangs lowly
child is slowly taken
and the violence causes silence
who are we mistaken

prechorus
but you see its not me its not my family
in your head in your head they are fighting
with their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their drones
in your head in your head they are crying

chorus
whats in your head in your head
zombie zombie zombieieie
whats in your head in your head
zombie zombie zombieieieie oh

verse 2
another mothers breaking
heart is taking over
when the violence causes silence
we must be mistaken

prechorus
its the same old theme in 2018
in your head in your head theyre still fighting
with their tanks and their bombs and their guns and their drones
in your head in your head they are dying
