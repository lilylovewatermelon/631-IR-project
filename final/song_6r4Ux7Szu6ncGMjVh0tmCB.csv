of an ice bath
no warmth no life without
its too much
my arms my legs are wood
unconscious trees
with roots deep in the ground
well all be out
an ocean ringed with tile
i know thats not your style
but it certainly will be mine
if i cant get this right
so please please please release me
oh please please please release me
oh please please please release me
oh please please please release me
can you hear my faintest breath is it amplified
the number that ive become will put you inside
ive got a message that i must relay
no i cant delay it one more day its not going well
it is desperate can you relate
can you please please relate im not holding up
i am trapped
im stuck here on this bathroom floor
and i dont have much more hope or pride
no air no food but im sure that im still alive

i will never need you more
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
i will never need you more
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
i will never need you more
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
oh please please please release me
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
oh please please please release me
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
oh please please please release me
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
oh please please please release me
just open up your eyes you dead ones all ashes on the floor
oh please please please release me10embed"
