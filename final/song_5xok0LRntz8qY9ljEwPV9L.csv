lately when i look into your eyes
i see indefinite trouble
darlin’ as much as i’d love to try
i cant help but feel so far from you
yet i’m in the terminal
this probably looks so typical
i probably should be going home
but you make me want to stay
and i love your visual
so let’s just keep it digital
but baby can you break me off before i fly away yeah oh

and what im lookin’ for it isn’t at the gate
