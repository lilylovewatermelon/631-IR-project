ive waited a hundred years
but id wait a million more for you
nothing prepared me for
what the privilege of being yours would do

verse 2
if i had only felt the warmth within your touch
if i had only seen how you smile when you blush
or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
well i would have known
what i was living for all along
what ive been living for

chorus
your love is my turning page
where only the sweetest words remain
every kiss is a cursive line
every touch is a redefining phrase

verse 3
i surrender who ive been for who you are
for nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
if i had only felt how it feels to be yours
well i would have known
what ive been living for all along
what ive been living for

though were tethered to the story we must tell
when i saw you well i knew wed tell it well
with a whisper we will tame the vicious seas
like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees18embed"
