hips sway and lips lie
like clockwork shes in control
of all the right guys and im still waiting
fitted hats and a car alarm
in hightops with her favorite song
shes showing off the way she walks its on

chorus
take me show me woahoh woahoh
the corners of your empty room
the trouble we could get into just
fake it for me woahoh woahoh
disregard the footsteps and well never tell a soul

postchorus
tonight im finding a way
to make the things that you say
just a little less obvious

verse 2
i walk a fine line
between the right and the real
they watch me closely
but talk is cheap here
like a weightless currency
your words dont mean shit to me
im always cashing out
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
take me show me woahoh woahoh
the corners of your empty room
the trouble we could get into just
fake it for me woahoh woahoh
disregard the footsteps
and well never tell a soul

postchorus
tonight im finding a way
to make the things that you say
just a little less obvious i confess
tonight im dressed up in gold
youve got me fucked up and sold
you talk like youre famous
youre shameless

outro
tonight im finding a way
to make the things that you say
just a little less obvious i confess
tonight im dressed up in gold
youve got me fucked up and sold
you talk like youre famous
youre shameless
tonight im finding a way
to make the things that you say
just a little less obvious i confess
tonight im dressed up in gold
youve got me fucked up and sold
you talk like youre famous
youre shameless1embed"
