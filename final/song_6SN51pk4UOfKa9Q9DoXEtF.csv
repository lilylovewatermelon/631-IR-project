people moving out
people moving in
why because of the color of their skin
run run run but you just cant hide

an eye for an eye
tooth for a tooth
vote for me and ill set you free
rap on brother rap on

well the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
and it seems nobodys interested in learning but the teacher
segregation determination demonstration integration aggravation humiliation
obligation to our nation

ball of confusion
thats what the world is today hey

the sales of pills are at an all time high
young folks walk with their heads in the sky
the cities aflame in the summertime
and oh the beat goes on

evolution revolution gun control sound of soulshooting rockets to the moon
kids growing up too soon
politicians say more taxes will solve everything
and the band played on
see the temptations liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeso round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows

oh great googamooga
cant you hear me talking to you
just a ball of confusion
thats what the world is today hey

fear in the air tension everywhere
unemployment rising fast
the beatles new records a gas
and the only safe place to live
is on an indian reservation
the band played on

eve of destruction tax deduction
city inspectors bill collectors mod clothes in demand
population out of hand suicide too many bills
hippies moving to the hills
people all over the world are shouting end the war
and the band played on

great googamooga
cant you hear me talking to you
just a ball of confusionembed"
