verse 1
why do all my friends now want to be your lovers
your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
and now like maniacs they scratch your back
even when it doesnt itch

prechorus
i want to figure it all
i want to figure it all out
i want to save you from
save you from all thats vain
save you from the things that cause us pain

chorus
cause its an animal city
its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to bite you
its an animal city its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to rip you right off

they believe you now have everything you wanted
and once you have become a star youve got no right to bitch
but someday when you fail theyll put you on sale
and buy you by the inch

prechorus
but youre the real deal
and real is your middle name
you know sometimes i feel
i gotta earn every breath you take baby
never mind the rules we break

chorus
cause its an animal city
its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to bite you
its an animal city its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to rip you right off

bridge
with you i feel safe
theres nothing to fear from us
away from the fangs the fangs of the world
i may be a coward but you are brave
and nothing seems so dangerous
chorus
cause its an animal city
its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to bite you
its an animal city its a cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to rip you right off
cannibal world
cannibal world
cannibal world
cannibal world
so be obedient dont argue
some are ready to rip you right off2embed"
