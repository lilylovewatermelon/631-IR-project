please please
believe in all night

refrain
cause i really dont wanna be here alone
too many people i dont see no more
too many feelings i dont feel no more
cause i really dont wanna be here alone
too many people i dont need no more
so many doubts that i stop keeping score

verse 1
remember when you told me that i aint lonely
you used to hold me
you always was the one to make up reasons quick
and i would be the one to believe in it

prechorus 1
facetime me just to pass time
but i still rewind what you said last night
you said that you would always have some reasoning
how come you only did that on the weekend then

chorus
dont take this personally
i just cant be the person you need
what we got aint working for me
and all it ever did was change the person in me
dont take this personally
i just cant be the person you need
what we got aint working for me
all it ever did was change the person in me
