who do you think you are
barging in on me and my guitar
little girl hey
the door is that way
you better go you know the fire is out anyway
take your powder
take your candle
your sweet whisper
i just cant handle
well take your hair in the moonlight
your brown eyes goodbye goodnight

i should tell you
i should tell you
i should no

another time
another place
our temperature would climb
thered be a long embrace
wed do another dance itd be another play
looking for romance come back another day
another day

mimi
the heart may freeze
or it can burn
the pain will ease
if i can learn
there is no future
there is no past
i live this moment as my last
you might also liketheres only us
theres only this
forget regret
or life is yours to miss
no other road
no other way
no day but today

roger
excuse me if im off track
but if youre so wise
then tell me why do you need smack
take your needle
take your fancy prayer
don’t forget get the moonlight out of your hair
long ago you might’ve lit up my heart
but the fires dead and aint never ever gonna start

another time
another place
the words would only rhyme
wed be in outer space
itd be another song
wed sing another way
you wanna prove me wrong
come back another day
another day
mimi
theres only yes
only tonight
we must let go
to know whats right
no other course
no other way
no day but today

allroger
i cant control control your temper
my destiny she doesn’t see
i trust my soul who says that theres a soul
my only goal
is just to be just let me be
theres only now who do you think you are
theres only here
give into love barging in on me
or live in fear and my guitar
no other past little girl hey
no other way the door is that way

no day but today the fires out anyway
no day but today take your powder
take your candle
no day but today
take your brown eyes your pretty smile your silhouette
no day but today
another time another place another rhyme a warm embrace
no day but today
another dance another way another chance another day
no day but today1embed"
