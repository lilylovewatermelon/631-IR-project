little notes that i write
contemplate suicide
every day is a lie
should i live or should i die

chorus
the rats inside destroy my mind
number the days to bide my time
the rats inside destroy my mind
endure the pain ill give you mine

verse 2
broken down left to rot
im alone and they forgot
they want to hurt i want to heal
is this a dream or is it real

chorus
the rats inside destroy my mind
number the days to bide my time
the rats inside destroy my mind
endure the pain ill give you mine
