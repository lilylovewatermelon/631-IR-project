verse 1
shit movin fast remember it was movin slow
as a yungin i been jumped up off that porch
dont need no lecture you just need what you know
half of ticket in deposits the day i came home
yungin on the block with a pole tryna get some dough
seen ogs die shit he aint tryna go
a couple of niggas tried him he aint ever let it go
revenge on them niggas shit i could say bout four
man i feel like i been doin this shit too long
since i was seven i been rappin steady tryna blow
they done slept on me and criticised me talkin down
now for to see me bitch you gotta go pay for the show

chorus
since a yungin i been gettin it on my own
you gotta get it nigga thats what i was told
i aint quittin and i put that on my soul
im dedicated thats on everything i know
im dedicated baby thats on all i know
im hardbody and i promise i wont fold
like a pirate im just searchin for some gold
ima get it thats on everything i know

you cant play around and be serious
ill do whatever it takes just to get it
i aint never listen to the critics
i put my mind to it now and i did it
i dont do no drugs when im in your city i swear im high off the feeling
book me for a show when i walk in the building you know i turn up to the ceiling
they think that i act like a star
they think im stuck up i be chillin
thank the lord that im far its so many people didnt
down fairfax peelin
they really think that i got millions
i aint even make a killing
i know they wish that they can kill me
i know that they wish that they can kill me

chorus
since a yungin i been gettin it on my own
you gotta get it nigga thats what i was told
i aint quittin and i put that on my soul
im dedicated thats on everything i know
im dedicated baby thats on all i know
im hardbody and i promise i wont fold
like a pirate im just searchin for some gold
ima get it thats on everything i know4embed"
