lately ive been tradin a good sermon and some prayin
for a stranger in my bed and a night that needs explainin
opened more bottles than i ever have my bible
this dirt road communion sure wont lead me to revival
between the black label and the letters in red
i felt what livin is and what its like to live dead

chorus
i’ve taken a ride in the devils cadillac
i’ve been so high i thought i wasnt comin back
and just when i think im too far gone
ringin in my heads the 23rd psalm
ive seen the light ive seen the darkness
only god knows where my heart is
ive got my strength and lord knows ive got my weakness
oh im lost somewhere between jack daniels and jesus

verse 2
its my fault that i aint called my mama in a month of sundays
shell smell the whiskey through that phone i cant stand to hear or heart break
and next week ill see my brother casey for the first time
since it all went down and i blacked his eye the night after our daddy died

chorus
i’ve taken a ride in the devils cadillac
i’ve been so high i thought i wasnt comin back
and just when i think im too far gone
ringin in my heads the 23rd psalm
ive seen the light ive seen the darkness
only god knows where my heart is
ive got my strength and lord knows ive got my weakness
oh im lost somewhere between jack daniels and jesus
see chase rice liveget tickets as low as 109you might also likebridge
i aint afraid to admit ive hit rock bottom
you wanna see a lifetime full of sins
just look at me ive got em

chorus
i’ve taken a ride in the devils cadillac
i’ve been so high i thought i wasnt comin back
and just when i think im too far gone
ringin in my heads the 23rd psalm
ive seen the light ive seen the darkness
only god knows where my heart is
ive got my strength and lord knows ive got my weakness
oh im lost somewhere between jack daniels and jesus2embed"
