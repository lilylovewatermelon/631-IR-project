verse 1
shut your eyes and think of somewhere
somewhere cold and caked in snow
by the fire we break the quiet
learn to wear each other well

chorus
and when the worrying starts to hurt
and the world feels like graves of dirt
just close your eyes until
you can imagine this place yeah our secret space at will

verse 2
shut your eyes ill spin the big chair
and youll feel dizzy light and free
and falling gently on the cushion
you can come and sing to me

chorus
and when the worrying starts to hurt
and the world feels like graves of dirt
just close your eyes until
you can imagine this place yeah our secret space at will
