just another sundown just another bar stool
just another place where a fool can find another fool
just another slow dance with just another she aint you
just another chance of feeling better than i really do

chorus
there was a time you told me youd love me forever
but baby didnt forever get here fast

verse 2
just another midnight just another cigarette
waiting on the its going to be alright that hasnt got here yet

chorus
yeah there was a time you told me youd love me forever
but baby didnt forever get here fast

break
just another closing time
just another shot before
just another long ride home that dont feel like home anymore
