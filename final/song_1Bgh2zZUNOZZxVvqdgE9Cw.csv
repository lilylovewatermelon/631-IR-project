and i cant hide it
and this is not going stop
and i cant fight it
im gonna fall into the dirt
an unstable head and nothing that works
i looked and i cant find
what its gonna take
i can not rewind
all my fucking mistakes
my lines about to snap
and no one called it
how will you react
to a psychotic
i guess my nuts
and bolt are loose
if you dont believe me
i can show you the proof
i looked and i cant and i canâ€™t find
all my fucking mistakesyou might also likeembed"
