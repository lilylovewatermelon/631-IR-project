i was sittin on my doorstep
i hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
but i knew i had to do it
and he wouldnt understand
so hard to see myself without him
i felt a piece of my heart break
but when youre standin at a crossroad
theres a choice you gotta make

chorus
i guess its gonna have to hurt
i guess im gonna have to cry
and let go of some things ive loved to get to the other side
i guess its gonna break me down
like falling when youre trying to fly
its sad but sometimes movin on with the rest of your life
starts with goodbye

verse 2
i know theres a blue horizon
somewhere up ahead just waiting for me waiting for me
getting there means leavin things behind
sometimes lifes so bittersweet

chorus
i guess its gonna have to hurt
i guess im gonna have to cry
and let go of some things ive loved to get to the other side
i guess its gonna break me down
like falling when youre trying to fly
its sad but sometimes movin on with the rest of your life
starts with goodbye
