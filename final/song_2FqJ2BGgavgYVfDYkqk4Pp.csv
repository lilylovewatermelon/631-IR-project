the way i talk i guess i got it from my pops
product of some kneelin down
in a town where the doors dont lock
and theres a million other people like me
from a scene a little more podunk than pop
i didnt choose being born in the sticks
and ill be damned if i sound like something i aint
for some folks a backroad gets old
but for me it just cant

chorus
cause im from a small town southern drawl crowd
were sippin clear drinkin beer on a friday night
every country girl got on her cutoffs
shakin her hips take a trip buddy tell me im a liar
still circle up big trucks around a fire
still kickin up some dust behind the tires
call it cliché but hey just take it from me
its still goin down out in the country

verse 2
somewhere now someones out there
sippin on some hundred proof
every day a babys born with some baby blues
a good ol boys got on his faded boots
workin a nine to five
im just another southern hell raiser
aint breakin ground
makin sound for them dropitdown tailgaters
but yall thats all i know to say
so if you think im full of it aint done it check the resume

shakin her hips take a trip buddy tell me im a liar
still circle up big trucks around a fire
still kickin up some dust behind the tires
call it cliché but hey just take it from me
its still goin down out in the country
