i wish that heaven had visiting hours
so i could just show up and bring the news
that shes gettin older and i wish that youd met her
the things that shell learn from me i got them all from you

chorus
can i just stay a while and well put all the world to rights
the little ones will grow and ill still drink your favourite wine
and soon theyre going to close but ill see you another day
so much has changed since youve been away

verse 2
i wish that heaven had visiting hours
so i could just swing by and ask your advice
what would you do in my situation
i havent a clue how id even raise them
what would you do cause you always do whats right

chorus
can we just talk a while until my worries disappear
id tell you that im scared of turnin out a failure
youd say remember that the answers in the love that we create
so much has changed since youve been away

verse 3
i wish that heaven had visiting hours
and i would ask them if i could take you home
but i know what theyd say that its for the best
so i will live life the way you taught me
and make it on my own
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
and i will close the door but i will open up my heart
and everyone i love will know exactly who you are
cause this is not goodbye it is just til we meet again
so much has changed since youve been away21embed"
