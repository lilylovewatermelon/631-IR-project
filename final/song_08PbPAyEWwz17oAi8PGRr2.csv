there wasnt anything i didnt love about you
youd do some stupid things and id laugh at those too
and we went together like the summer in june
but whod have known that itd rain so soon
thought id be the only one thatd make you smile
thought id be the only one thatd really know how
but you showed me different and i know better now
i gotta get you out my system somehow
i replay it over and over again
you were my girl now we aint even friends
you couldve been my all or nothing all or nothing
now to me youre nothing
girl youre nothing now youre nothing
put you on a pedestal girl i held you so high
was never too good at finding the words to describe
just how i felt for you but you know that i tried
but somehow we went and changed inside
you damn near were my everything youre still on my mind
but id rather be here all alone and im doing just fine
gotta take it back to the days before we met
and live our lives as strangers again
i replay it over and over again
you were my girl now we aint even friends
you couldve been my all or nothing all or nothing
now to me youre nothing
girl youre nothing now youre nothing
i replay it over and over again
you were my girl now we aint even friends
you couldve been my all or nothing all or nothing
now to me youre nothing
girl youre nothing now youre nothing
december days my summer turned to winter
when you went away i cant help but wonder
was he worth my pain
you should know better and i shouldve too
and i cried and you cried and we tried to make it work
almost died while we tried is that what our love was worth
if i could do it again i would be a better man
now im living with just memories
i replay it over and over again
you were my girl now we aint even friends
you couldve been my all or nothing all or nothing
now to me youre nothing
girl youre nothing now youre nothing
i replay it over and over again
you were my girl now we aint even friends
you couldve been my all or nothing all or nothing
now to me youre nothing
girl youre nothing now youre nothingsee jay sean liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likeembed"
