shes got cooties cooties
if i were her id be depressed
longtailed sharpnailed fuzzy legs laying eggs

in science class shes like a walking showandtell
her pet skunk ran away cause it couldnt take the smell

shes got cooties cooties
nobody wants to sit by her
shes got cooties cooties
she dont need a coat cause shes got fur
