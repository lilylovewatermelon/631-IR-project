whats it gonna take to slow us down
to let the silence spin us around
whats it gonna take to drop this town
weve been spinning at the speed of sound
stepping out of those convenience stores
what could we we want but more more more
from the third world to the corporate core
we are the symphony of modern humanity yeah

verse 2
i dont know what theyre gonna think of next
genetic engineers of the most high tech
a couple new ways to fall into debt
im a nervous wreck but ill bet that that tv set
tells us what we wanted to hear
but none of these sound bites are comin in clear
from the third world to the corporate ear
we are the symphony of modern humanity yeah
