i just opened up my eyes
and let the world come climbing in
its all better now things are going to work somehow
if i just sleep another hour
tried to reach you at your moms
hey baby why youre trying to keep away for so long
i stopped feeling good somehow i just knew i would
i guess ill sleep another hour

prechorus
feels like im wasting my time
hanging on this same old line
got to get you off of my mind
theres nothing left for me to find

chorus
and all the more i want all the more i need
all the while you want something more
all the more i want all the more i need
all the while you want something more

verse 2
thought ive found words to say
just to get you feeling fine over heals my way
but it dont matter how i lost the word and nerve and now
theres nothing more for me to say
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeprechorus
feels like im wasting my time
hanging on this same old line
nothing left for me to find

chorus
and all the more i want all the more i need
all the while you want something more
all the more i want all the more i need
all the while you want something more

verse 3
theres nothing left for me to say
im wanting what i need this way
and when im feeling low i know
i need to stop

chorus
someday youll see
that all the more you want all the more youll need me
all the while ill be on to something more
and all the more you want all the more youll need me
all the while i want something more

outro
i want something more
i want something more than thisembed"
