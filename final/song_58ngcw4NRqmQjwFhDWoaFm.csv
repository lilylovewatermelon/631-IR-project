verse 1 lil wayne
ymcmb bitches call me tunechi li
i be with niggas that shoot police
i keep that iron you can get creased
and if she say she didnt fuck—bitch youre lying through your teeth
they say it cost to be the boss
the ones in jail wish they were free
niggas call me hic because im high as you can see
niggas say they paid they dues well im checking your receipt
might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
grab the owl out the tree and ask that bitch who but me
got your bitch bent over nigga—hands to her feet
tell that pig and that cow ill go ham if its beef
cause all my niggas well rounded
dont fuck with none of these square niggas
mask on ghostface killah draw down and erase niggas
