baby last night was hands down
one of the best nights mm that ive had no doubt
between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the marvin gaye
then we danced in the dark under september stars in the pourin rain

prechorus
and i know that i cant ever tell you enough
that all i need in this life is your crazy love

chorus
if i never get to see the northern lights
or if i never get to see the eiffel tower at night
oh if all i got is your hand in my hand
baby i could die a happy man

postchorus
a happy man baby mm

verse 2
baby that red dress brings me to my knees
oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe

its too good to be true nothin better than you in my wildest dreams

prechorus
and i know that i cant ever tell you enough
that all i need in this life is your crazy love

we could stay at home listen to the radio
and dance around the fireplace
