hey you know me im on the block with it

and now the dots around the world are now connectin on me

cant believe it took a konvict to shake this town

need street credibility who you go get
i give you that credibility for the right check
keep your future on the shelf quiets where its best kept
dont want them upfront shooters bringin red light
