why why do you go wasting your time on me
you’re so beautiful now
there’s so much that’s left for you now
oh yeah babe
and why why do you go flashing those eyes at me
you know that im eager to please
i’ve always been eager to please
oh yeah babe

prechorus
but ive i’ve got a lot to say
and im scared that you’re gonna slip away
and you you’ve got this wideeyed gaze
and a smile that youll carry through your days

chorus
oh why
oh why
it’s the easiest way
to know you’re alive
and the beauty you heard
i see her talking with her hands
well i don’t think she knows
how she changed all my plans

nobody’s perfect at all
well sometimes it makes you feel small
oh yeah babe
