started off with a simple twist of fate
boyfriend gonna come catch my fade
mama said come in its gettin late
tell that woman she gots to wait
find somethin worth fightin for
if you aint gonna get them drawers
if you lose gonna catch a case
did you go too far baby anyway
just stories bout things i do
show you girl it was all for you
had hoes in the hotel room
never knew we would make that news
im too good with social cues
left out fore i had a chance to choose
me or him or where your dad been
thats somethin my pride cannot lose
too much on the way i feel
trick myself to believe its real
trick too much for the sex and feel
when i get a mil ima spend it all on real
ima spend it all on feels yeah
