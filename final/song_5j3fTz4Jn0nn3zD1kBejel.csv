we hit that liquor store
by the county line
whipped out a fake id
i got from a friend of mine
we made our getaway
due south to the gulf shore sand
you were looking like a woman child
i was feeling like a full grown man

chorus
we had a bottle of silver
and a bottle of sapphire
an indian blanket
and a beachfront bonfire
we watched the moon
ship wreck on the water
i dont remember a night much hotter

verse 2
you were lying on the hood of my car
and i was strumming on that old guitar
and we were looking for the northern stars
and midnight played like a drive in scene
you were doing liz taylor
i was doing james dean
and i loved you as much as i could at 18
with sand in your hair and sand in my jeans
it was so right all night
and the sunset looked like an airbrushed tshirt
sewed on the street in panama city
i grabbed the camera and snapped off the picture
you said love aint it a pitty
someday this moment will fade away
replaced by a photograph
like the way we remember the words to a joke
and forgot how hard it made us laugh
