im a preacher sweating in the pew
for the salvation im bringing you
im a salesman im selling you hooks and plans
and myself making demands

chorus
when im home alone i just dance by myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off im alright in bed but im better with a pen
the kid was alright but it went to his head

verse 2
i am gods gift but why would he bless me with
such wit without a conscience equipped
im addicted to the way i feel when i think of you whoa
theres too much green to feel blue

chorus
when i’m home alone i just can’t stop myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off im alright in bed but im better with a pen
the kid was alright but it went to his head

when im home alone i just cant stop myself
and you pull my head so close volume goes with the truth
signing off im alright in bed but im better with a pen
im alright in bed but im better with a pen
im alright in bed but im better with a pen
the kid was alright but it went to his head9embed"
