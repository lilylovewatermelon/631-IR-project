i built my life like my bike on a rigid frame
nothing bends it only breaks into
pieces and pieces
i waited for a hope to arrive but it never came
leaving me with only pain inside
im going off the deep end

verse 2
i built my life on a rigid frame
so nothing bends it only breaks into
pieces and pieces
i waited for a hope to arrive but it never came
leaving me with only pain inside
im going off the deep end

chorus 1
holding on is harder than it seems
when youre reaching for so much more
seems so much easier to just give in
when youre reaching for so much more

verse 3
another wasted saturday so here i stay
where nothing seems to ever change anyway hey
all this hype about life being great
wheres the love for me these days
im going off the deep end
