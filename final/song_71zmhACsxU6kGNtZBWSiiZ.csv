these atoms are liars
they do not realize and we cant blame them
art as a means of escape
they dont see the downside
and thats what takes them
out on the floor
one stretches out its hands
into the small of a back
and as they circle the room and as they circle the room
room room room
and as they circle the floor one just wants it more
well they dont want anymore

chorus
you can sleep in these hollows and rivers
exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
jesus christ oh jesus christ why is love so lonely
why is love so lonely

verse 2
all water on earth
evaporates into steam
and erupts from the ground
does anyone else feel guilty
like i did it all mmmmyself
one feels a lack of love and theres no limit
to the explosive power of this bomb
how do we reconcile our deaths
wed better figure it out before long

we will sleep in these rivers
exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
jesus christ jesus christ why is love so lonely
why is love so lonely
well you can sleep in these hollows and rivers
exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
jesus christ jesus christ why is love so lonely
why is love so lonely6embed"
