verse 1 dj paul
this for all the playa haters who be talkin that shit
the three 6 show no love we quick to murder a trick
you could be a friend or foe kinda down or not
im rollin with that fool crunchy and we got them glocks
backed up by the 45 and a 38
you wanna take this clique to war fool itll be a mistake
chris bring the mossberg with the slugs and shit
we got some graves for ya body already dug and shit
infamous grab the cali with a 100 rounds
koopsta load the tec and blow them bastards down
juice with the two 9s like the nigga name shae
on the move we shoot em up so slow they feel the pain
i thought you knew that im from memphis where the shit is so thick
when at the club we get so buck we try to tear up some shit
gangsta boo the gangsta bitch with the 357
our main goal in life is a opposite heaven

verse 2 lord infamous
deadly
we should begin to come closer to killa dimensions
niggas getting lynchins from the triple 6 antichristians
may i mention the slizzugs that i blaze scarecrows unmerciful
bullets are bombin the  enemy nigga see death is unreversable
hardness is your fantasy death is not fictional you bitches
fuck around and find yo wannabe gangsta ass with the mortician
executioner style buck in yo head while ya beg on yo knees uh
plenty of bustas been put in the morgue and they chilly down in the cold freezers
teflon penetratin and the penalty is deadly punishment
then me and my triple 6 we go and blow an ounce of blue hair trick
i could give a fuck less bitch im glad that you dead and gone
three 6 mafia sign our names on niggas fuckin tombstones
memphis is the fuckin city where lord infamous loves to bail
and just like i said before bitch come with me to hell
everybody in this house you niggas know whats up
lemme see can all you mothafuckas tear this club up
