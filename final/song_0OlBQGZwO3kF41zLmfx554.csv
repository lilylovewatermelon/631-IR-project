in whispers i plant promises
by forget me nots and lay
lilles in my bed beside me beside me
you denied me
but uh still i remember you

verse 1 sebastian rogers
laundered linen sheets
touch me their coldness
and thoughts i cant repeat
shock me with their boldness
why did my mind and body believe
that you would never leave them
now theres parts of me that blame
or well they force me to deceive them
so come back and relieve them

chorus sebastian rogers marsha
who would steal you
i still feel you
now youre gone
these are lies
theyre not real
this is more than i can feel
this is wrong
this is wrong now youre gone
this is wrong
