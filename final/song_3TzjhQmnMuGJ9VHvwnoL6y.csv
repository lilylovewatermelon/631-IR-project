can you take away every single day
that we have given to another false prophet
can you give us all a reason not to fall
before you take away another broken promise
show your pretty face hide the bitter taste
youre still the rapist of an entire nation
you wanna be the man you gotta be a man
but you are nothing but a sad insinuation

prechorus
oh how can we ever live this down
how can we ever live this down

verse 2
keep your fingers crossed the truth is at a loss
big decision for an ordinary coward
the only problem is your fuckin rhetoric
were more in danger than before you took power
now its just a game god youll never change
youd sell us out if you could only find a buyer
you dont give a shit as long as idiots
are in your corner you could set us all on fire

prechorus
oh how can we ever live this down
how can we ever live this down
you might also likechorus
you never wanted to be
they only wanted a parody
you want the world to be free
what the hell is free about it

verse 3
now weve reached the end just get it over with
but this is building to an adamant conclusion
come whatever may theres gonna be a day
when we have figured out a plausible solution
everything youve done is killing everyone
a little smile on a homicidal bastard
you wanna be a man you better have a plan
another failure is a guaranteed disaster

prechorus
oh how can we ever live this down
how can we ever live this down

chorus 1
you never wanted to be
they only wanted a parody
you want the world to be free
you only wanted the world
chorus 2
you never wanted to be
they only wanted a parody
you want the world to be free
but what the fuck is free about it
what the fuck is free about it
what the fuck is free about it2embed"
