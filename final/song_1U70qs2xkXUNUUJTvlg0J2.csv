lord of the sad and lonely
yeah

verse 1
wont you tell me who is the supreme leader
still underused like im not a human heater
move and groove make a bitch linger
want more than the dick gold on the ring finger
not the one to play dumb see im from cleveland bitch
up in the hills still keep it way triller than most
wanna relax someone tell me how that feels
i say that now until i go and pop this pill
i say out loud you wanna let me cop a feel
now i dont pray out loud but i know that my god heals
bounce with me if you dont give a fuck simply
fed up wont let up on the overtime
the more i work the more they wanna sweat mine
i can feel those lames they love to speak my name
sometimes dream of breakin niggas whole faces
in front of the precinct aint scared of catchin cases
sky might fall but i aint worried at all
got me some xannies and a couple adderall
plus these racks i go distribute at the mall
in the spirit of god with some gandalf balls yahm
lord of the sad and lonely
and the ones that feel like shit on the daily
dont let these phony niggas and hoes
be the ones that bring you low
let it be from the fatigue from making the pussy bleed
all of the things ive seen and survived
make a nigga feel way more than just alive
you know my name you know my face
all hail king wzrd in your motherfucking space
you love it

verse 2
now i can show you how to make it no domingo dean
in a way in which the universe has never seen
i feel attention when im struttin in my prada boots
checkin my fresh if you want i can style you
so unearthly my profession is to wow you
nigga how you not better than me listen i swear to je
i feel like baby back in 99
in the sls stuntin and its all mine
shittin on these niggas sippin on some swiss kriss
i got some jewelry on it sittin on my slit wrists
my label fucking up my flow see im getting pissed
work too damn hard fam for the shenanigans
dont hang around bums and thats how i win fe fi fo fum
haters how do my cum taste no more fun no jokes no smiles
just a grin that suggest im the best
living like i got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
so many kids live their life through my rhymes
see im in love with you all til the end
when shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
so smoke some tree for your nigga
aint nobody got my bounce know my kushy ounce
walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth
the cud life you know what we about
