girl i get tired of sleeping alone in my bed
i really need you now
ive been trying to get back the days that we had
but see i dont know how
theres no way to conceive the right plans in my head
i just cant hold them down
all my hopes they stay curled in between these four walls
and i cant shake them out

chorus
its 6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no
6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no

postchorus
im tryna keep up tryna move on
beyond this pain before i break

verse 2
see its hard to confess but i miss all the time we spent
i cant explain
cause when i start up the nerve to reach out to you baby
it just floats away
you might also likestill i dream of the days when we were on the same page
i really want them now
all my hopes they stay curled in between these four walls
and i cant shake them out

chorus
its 6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no
6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no

postchorus
im tryna keep up tryna move on
beyond this pain before i break

chorus
its 6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no
6 in the morning im still awake
my sleepless heart is torn up babe
a love songs on the radio
but these words i hear theyre not for me no
outro
not for me
theyre not for me no
not for me
theyre not for me no
not for me
theyre not for me no
not for me
theyre not for me no2embed"
