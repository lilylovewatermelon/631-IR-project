you used to say you wanted someone to know you inside out
and as i look back on things well congratulations baby
somebody knows you now
all of this time you told me you wished that you could figure yourself out
you say youre still a mystery but no not really not to me
yeah somebody knows you now

verse 2
i got a hundred bucks that says right now your hairs up in a clip
your socks dont quite match and youre biting your lip
i can finish your thoughts oh pick the right restaurants
even order for you fore you sit down
yeah somebody knows you now
so no matter where your lifes path leads
remember me somehow
and feel a little warm inside
knowing that somewhere tonight
somebody knows you now

outro
well baby all your mystery
like you and me is history
cause somebody knows you nowsee brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeembed"
