no im not the man i used to be lately
see you met me at an interesting time
and if my past is any sign of your future
you should be warned before i let you inside

chorus
hold on to whatever you find baby
hold on to whatever will get you through
hold on to whatever you find baby
i dont trust myself with lovin you

verse 2
i will beg my way into your garden
and then ill break my way out when it rains
just to get back to the place where i started
so i can want you back all over again
i dont really understand

chorus
hold on to whatever you find baby
hold on to whatever will get you through
hold on to whatever you find baby
i dont trust myself with lovin you

who do you love me or the thought of me

chorus
hold on to whatever you find baby
hold on to whatever will get you through
hold on to whatever you find baby
