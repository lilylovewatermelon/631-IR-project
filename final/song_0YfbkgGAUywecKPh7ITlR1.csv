she was a flower for the taking
her beauty cut just like a knife
he was a banker from macon
he swore hed love her all a his life
he bought her a mansion on the mountain
with a formal garden and a lot a land
but paradise became her prison
that georgia banker was a jealous man

chorus
every time hed talk about her
you could see the fire in his eyes
hed say i would walk through hell on sunday
to keep my rose in paradise

verse 2
he hired a man to tend the garden
and keep an eye on her while he was gone
some say they ran away together
some say that gardener left alone
now the banker is an old man
that mansions crumbling down
he sits all day and he stares at the garden
not a trace of her was ever found

outro
now theres a rose out in the garden
its beauty cuts just like a knife
they say that it even grows in the winter time
and blooms in the dead of the nightembed"
