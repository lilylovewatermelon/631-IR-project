the carbonation in my drink
the bubbles rise while my heart sinks
and all i tend to do is think of you
was it easier to pack your bags
and book that flight to paris as
the plane began to move that afternoon

verse 2
and when all the trains have pulled away
from local stations in decay
its i who waits its you whos late again
and did you think of me when you made love
to him was it the same as us
or was it different it must have been

outro
and all the pretty dames
theyll hug and kiss you all the same
and when they go theyre gone theyre not running late
oh all all the pretty dames
and the kids that you hold in your arms
with promises to protect them from harm
but they grow and they go and youre all alone
all the kids all the kids that you hold
and its a shame that it ends this way
with nothing left to say
so just sit on your hands while i walk away
its a shame its a shame its a shame
when my hands begin to shake
when bitterness is all i taste
and my car wont stop cause i cut the brakes
i hold on to a hope in my fate
ohoh ahah heyhey
may you return to love one day
well i hope and i pray you get what you gave
ohoh ahah heyheyyou might also like5embed"
