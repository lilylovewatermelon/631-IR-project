as you promised me that i was more than all the miles combined
you mustve had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
kept on drivin straight and left our future to the right
now i am stuck between my anger and the blame that i cant face
and memories are somethin even smoking weed does not replace
and i am terrified of weather cause i see you when it rains
doc told me to travel but theres covid on the planes

chorus
and i love vermont but its the season of the sticks
and i saw your mom she forgot that i existed
and its half my fault but i just like to play the victim
ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for christmas
and ill dream each night of some version of you
that i might not have but i did not lose
now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes
and im split in half but thatll have to do

verse 2
so i thought that if i piled something good on all my bad
that i could cancel out the darkness i inherited from dad
no i am no longer funny cause i miss the way you laugh
you once called me forever now you still cant call me back

and i love vermont but its the season of the sticks
and i saw your mom she forgot that i existed
and its half my fault but i just like to play the victim
ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for christmas
and ill dream each night of some version of you
that i might not have but i did not lose
now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes
and im split in half but thatll have to do

bridge
oh thatll have to do
my other half was you
i hope this pains just passin through
but i doubt it

chorus
and i love vermont but its the season of the sticks
and i saw your mom she forgot that i existed
and its half my fault but i just like to play the victim
ill drink alcohol til my friends come home for christmas
and ill dream each night of some version of you
that i might not have but i did not lose
now youre tire tracks and one pair of shoes
and im split in half but thatll have to do
