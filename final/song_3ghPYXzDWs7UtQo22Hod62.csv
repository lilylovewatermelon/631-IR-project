love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on me

verse 1
met him on a thursday sunny afternoon
cumulus clouds 84 degrees
he was brown deep
said he wanted to talk about my mission
listen to my past lives word
took me on long walks to places where butterflies rest easy
talked about moses and mumia
reparations blue colors memories of shelltopped adidas
he was fresh like summer peaches
sweet on my mind like block parties and penny candy
us was nice and warm no jacket no umbrella just warm
at night we would watch the stars
and he would physically give me each and every one
i felt like cayenne pepper red hot spicy
i felt dizzy and so near heaven and miles between my thighs
better than love we made delicious
he me had had me he
he had me tongue tied
i could hear his rhythm in my thoughts
i was his sharp his horn section
his boom and his bip
and he was my love

love rain down on me on me down on me

verse 2
the rain was fallin and and slowly and sweetly
and stinging my eyes
and i could not see that he became my voodoo priest
and i was his faithful concubine
wide open wide loose like bowels after collard greens
the mistake was made
love slipped from my lips
dripped down my chin and landed in his lap
and us became new
now me nonclairvoyant and in love
made the coochie easy and the obvious invisible
the rain was falling
and i couldnt see the season changing
and the vibe slipping off its axis
our beautiful melody became wildly staccato
the rain was falling and i could not see
that i was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized
and left to drown in his sunny afternoon
cumulus clouds 84 degrees melody

hook
love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on me
verse 3
wide open wide loose
the mistake was made
love slipped from my lips
dripped down my chin
and landed in his lap
and us became new
me not clairvoyant and in love
made me the fool
you were never true
if you didnt want me
ah you should have let me know
all you did was make a mockery of something so
incredible beautiful
i honestly did love you
so

hook
love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on me
love rain down on me on me down on meembed"
