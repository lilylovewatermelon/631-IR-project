heres the weight of the world on my shoulders
and there’s the weight of the world on my shoulders
and my subtle doubts
yeahyeah yeahyeah say yeah

verse 1
cause all alone i pierce the chain
and on and on the sting remains
and dying eyes consume me now
cause the voice inside screams out loud

prechorus
i am focused on what i am after
the key to the next open chapter

chorus
’cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

verse 2
cause every days a new deception
so pick your scene and take direction
and on and on i search to connect
but i dont wear a mask and i have no regrets

cause i am focused on what i am after
the key to the next open chapter

chorus
cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

bridge
i cant escape the pain i cant control the rage
sometimes i think that i’ma go insane
i’m not against whats right i’m not for whats wrong
just making my way and im gone
and theres the weight of the world on my shoulders

chorus
’cause i found a way
to steal the sun from the sky
long live that day
that i decided to fly from the inside

outro
that i decided to fly from the inside
that i decided to fly from the inside
yeahyeahyeah yeahyeahembed"
