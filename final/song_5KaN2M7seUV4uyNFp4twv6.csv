wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
when you go what you leave is a work of art
on my chest on my heart

she went out to the haze in the morning grace
she went out and got lost in a tall hedge maze
whered you go whered you go whyd you leave this place
on my heart on my face

and my love is yours but your loves not mine
so ill go but we know ill see you down the line
and well hate what weve lost but well love what we find
and im feeling fine weve made it to the coastline

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

past all the signs of the slow decline
live like your love wasnt meant for mine
now youve gone now youve gone to a different life
to a lonely side

wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
wake up to the sound of your fleeting heart
when you go what you leave is a work of art
on my chest on my heart
see the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeand my love is yours but your loves not mine
so ill go but we know ill see you down the line
and well hate what weve lost but well love what we find
and oh im feeling fine weve made it to the coastline

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh10embed"
