walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
me and mary making our way into the night
you can hear the cries from the carnival rides
the pinball bells ski ball slides
watching the summer sun fall out of sight
theres a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
making its way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

chorus
and in the morning im leaving making my way back to cleveland
so tonight i hope that i will do just fine
and i dont see how you could ever be anything but mine

verse 2
theres a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
and i got just enough cash to get us in
and as we are dancing marys wrapping her arms around me
and i can feel the sting of summer on my skin
in the midst of the music i tell her i love her
we both laugh cause we know it isnt true
but mary theres a summer drawing to an end tonight
and theres so much that i long to do to you
