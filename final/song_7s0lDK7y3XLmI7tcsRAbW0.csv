verse 1
bbbe careful making wishes in the dark dark
cant be sure when theyve hit their mark
and besides in the meanmeantime im just
dreaming of tearing you apart
im in the deep details with the devil
you know the world can never get me on my level
i just gotta get you out the cage im a young lovers rage
gonna need a spark to ignite

well all the writers keep writing what they write
somewhere another pretty vein just died died
ive got the scars from tomorrow and i wish you could see
that youre the antidote to everything except for me
through a constellation of tears on your lashes
burn everything you love then burn the ashes
in the end everything collides my childhood
spat back out the monster that you see
