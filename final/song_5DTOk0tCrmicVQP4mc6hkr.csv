yeah uh

verse 1
all the younguns in my hood popping percs now
gettin high to get by its gettin worse now
you gotta tell em put them guns and them percs down
them new jails got ten yards in em and thats your first down uh
and i aint come here to preach
i just had to say somethin cause im the one with the reach
youngin gotta quarter ounce he tryna turn into meech
aint had no daddy hes had to learn from the streets
i used to be a honor roll student damn
then i turned to a beast
the first time i seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
he had on air max 93s but was slumped in the street
his mama cryin that did somethin to me oh lord
the shit im doin for my hood i wont get an award
i used to sell reggie damn how i get to the forbes
i take a shot if i miss im gettin them boards
aint quittin no more like give me some more
we wearing old navy it felt like christian dior
was dead broke but rich in soul was we really that poor
was we really that dumb cause we carry a gun
and every nigga in my neighborhood carryin one
cause we had nightmares of our mamas gotta bury her son
im speakin to you as a prophet as rare as they come uh
gunshots sound like music hangin out the buick
why you wanna be a shooter
mama told me not to do it but i did it
now im locked up in a prison
callin mama like i shouldnt have did it
watch my dream shatter in an instant
im on a visit posin for the picture
like im going for my prom or somethin
like i aint facing time or somethin
ridin for these niggas like that shit aint hurt my mom or somethin
only one gon get me commissary or even buy me somethin
when it all fall down
i cant call yall now
even if i hit your phone
that wont get me home
seen so many different times these niggas did me wrong
shit thats the reason that i did this song

shit we was kids used to play on the step
a couple years later we flirtin with the angel of death
i was 11 years old i got my hands on the tec
when i first touched it that shit gave me a rush
my homies dying im like maybe we next
that just made me a threat
knowin the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
made me a man shit i was five when god gave me my test
go to court with a court appointed and he wont say he objects
now its you against the state and you aint got no cake
jail overpopulated they aint got no space
i know a youngun that got murked aint get to drive no wraith
but he in the hearse on the way to church i know his mom gon faint
when she smell like embalment fluid cologne all on her baby
pastor said he sendin you home she goin crazy
when they drop that casket all in the ground who gon save me
how could you blame me when im tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twentyfive
when i stop fearin for my life when i decide to change my mind and stop totin
tryna smoke the pain away they lock us up for smoking
put em on probation lock em up if you aint perfect
victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
they closin all the schools and all the prisons gettin open

outro
yeah
see comin from where i come from
we had to beat the streets
beat the system beat racism beat poverty
and now we made it through all that we at the championship9embed"
