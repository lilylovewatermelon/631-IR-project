my ex be fans of me
when it all got real you ran on me
two months ago couldnt stand lil me
now she wanna be a part of my fantasy
feels so real but how can it be
now everywhere i go cameras be

verse
im in the low end randomly
but the west side where my family be
ayy keep that energy
it all going towards you healing me
i aint worried about no enemies
cause my brothers crazy like brandys be
ayy tell em quit playing with me
four in the twenty ounce drowning me
im posed to be out of town again
but all my bitches keep flyin in
ayy my priorities
all fucked up she adore me
she wanna be where that water be
with the lambo trucks and the florida seats
ayy bitch got bored of me
cause i nod off all on the florida beach
so high gotta look for the keys
but she like porsche when she go the speed
ayy none of that ho in me
ask any nigga that knowing me
i was through l town shakin a bag thats when i had p lord with me
ayy she wont let go of me
taking pics of the tats and the foreign seats
ayy act accordingly
cause her boyfriend watch my story creep
