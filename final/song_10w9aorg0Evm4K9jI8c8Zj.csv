flip it to the other side thats the bside
eastside till i rest in peace
never leave keep a fat blunt
blaze it when i breeze by
young y gotta get it fuck a peace sign
but you livin in a dream you could keep sleepin
shorty just put on them shorts with the cheeks peekin
im in the shade duckin heat
you actin like you somethin in the streets
but you really off the heat geekin
no speed limit  with the trees twistin
the scenes bigger than it is we just see different
i travel somewhere overseas for the right fee
spike lee i do the right thing scene switchin
cut the b roll i be placin bets like a c note
nigga talk shit but what do he know
powder on my nose like pacino
sour d to smoke you comin up short like devito

the nightcrawler in the prowler with ya white 
i might call her out
drivin round with my sights on her
i been around since the 
i been a hound since my starter said the charlotte hornets
we callin corners the marijuana hit the best in the mornin
so we smoke it every day its just to celebrate
i proved myself the courage to go against the current
and now i flourish so why
why they lookin so nervous
they call me fast cause my patience thin
roll up some grass maybe take the singe
what state we in
another day another dollar
motivated to win im motivated to win
and once the  thats when the payments begin
nikes on slick fade with a grin
side bitch yous a 8 i upgrade to a 10
i upgrade to a 10
i upgrade to a 10you might also likeembed"
