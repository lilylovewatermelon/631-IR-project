im living proof
of what the mercy of god can do
if you knew me then youd believe me now
he turned my whole life upside down
he took the old and he made it new
thats just what the mercy of god can do

chorus chris brown

and the power of his blood
im so glad that my freedom
wasnt based on what ive done

and the power of the blood
so much power in the blood oh mm

oh to be six feet beneath the earth
