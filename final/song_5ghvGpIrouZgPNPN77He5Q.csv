but i had no courage
now were saying goodbye
dont want to miss you tonight oh

tell me its not over now
i can change your mind somehow

i i give it all
i trip and fall for you
and i hope you wouldnt mind
just one more try for something new
i need you i need you

dont be shocked if i cry
youve changed me inside
i turned my back on you
you were the only reason i pulled through
i pulled through

tell me its not over now
i can change your mind somehow
my head feels so heavy
my heart is so empty

i i give it all
i trip and fall
i trip and fall
i trip and fall
i i give it all
i trip and fall for you oh
and i hope you wouldnt mind hope you wouldnt mind
just one more try just one more try
for something new
