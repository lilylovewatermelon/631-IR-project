verse 1
wanna get psycho
run you little bitch
i want your power glowing juicy flowing red hot
meaning of life
its not enough to have a little taste
i want the whole damn thing

youre one twisted little fuck
and now you wanna get psycho with me

i can feel the blood flowing through my veins
spilling on my soul
and now the hungers getting bigger
come a little closer now pretentious whore
and pull my trigger
free the violence that is building in me
i say now end of the ride murdersuicide
is how ive been feeling lately

come a little closer now pretentious whore
im reeling with the feeling that i
cant ignore
come a little closer now pretentious whore
im reeling with the feeling that i
cant ignore

come a little closer now pretentious whore
im reeling with the feeling that i
cant ignore
and the need to get psycho
is not a question to me
