rolling on his back like an ocelot
crawling on his stomach you make the lids stick together
nothing really bugs me out
nothing really bugs me

verse 2
tightening the slack on the millimeter tape
trudging through your stomach i make the walls split forever
nothing really bugs me out
nothing really bugs me

bridge
yeah bugs me out
anymore anymore anymore anymore
i didnt know id had enough
now were on the same page
now were on the same page

verse 3
circling the gap like you dont know what you hold
drying out my knuckles you tucked it between the folds
nothing really bugs me out
nothing really bugs me

verse 4
recycling the cans at the center by the boxcars
weve been carving little symbols in the bark
nothing really bugs me out
nothing really bugs me out
