ill never take part in the growing population
or waste my time with further education
forget what we know its just a big show
what they want to control
so jaded frustrated its all so complicated
fashion no passion surrounds me

chorus
all i know is ive heard this all before realitys a bore
you ask me to believe in something fake
well i cant bring myself to do what you want me to
this is who we are and nothings going to change
nothings going to change

verse 2
i cant take part in the businessman illusion
ill take my chance in the real world confusion
dont blame us who do we trust
when theyre so dishonest
no patience this nations obsessed with exploitation
lying denying surrounds me

chorus
all i know is ive heard this all before realitys a bore
you ask me to believe in something fake
well i cant bring myself to do what you want me to
this is who we are and nothings going to change
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likebridge
dont think you can ignore us
dont tell me that were to blame
dont pick our future for us
or act like were the same

chorus
all i know is ive heard this all before realitys a bore
you ask me to believe in something fake
well i cant bring myself to do what you want me to
this is who we are and nothings going to change

outro
thanks for nothing
ive heard this all before
thanks for nothing
realitys a bore
thanks for nothing
ill never be the same
thanks for nothing
and nothings gonna change1embed"
