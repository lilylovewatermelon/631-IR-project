verse 1 drake
never thoughts of suicide im too alive
but i still treat it like its do or die
even though dying isnt in the plans
but neither was making it and here i am
in the presidential do you like your new room
always presidential and tonights no blue moon
since i saw aaliyahs precious life go too soon
she deserve the credit for how im about to get it
thats why i got a new dumb thing movin through the street
got a new condo move it to the beach
heard nicki just bought a brand new crib
goddamn man shes beauty and the beast lord
seem like yesterday that i was upandcoming
still so young that i aint had enough of nothing
the fam here the drink here the girls here
well fuck lets get it then
