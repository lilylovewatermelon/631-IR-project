chorus
talk slick he a dead man
shots from the fn sprayin
these days they dont give a fuck
theyll shoot where the kids playin
judge tryna give em life so them gang signs turn to prayer hands
i come from a dark place ill never be there again
double gs on everything gucci my headband
keep smokin these dead niggas i feel like redman
pourin lean up out my cup runnin through these bucks for my dead friends
capalot bought guns for the hood heard thats what the feds sayin

verse 1
my life a movie ever since birth its been lights camera action
i did a lot of shit in these streets but only got booked for trappin
im from chicago where its normal to hear 40s clappin
all you hear is them shots let off that door slam and them tires scratchin
rollie on my wrist gotta get more rich i want that brand new patek
i ball like ai this shit effortless dont give a fuck bout practice
where im from we all on that car
if he drive too fast we gon let him have it
opposition wanna kill me and ill be damned if i let it happen
and the day i leave this earth ima die with legend status
ima reunite with my demons we gon be in heaven cappin
hundred k on vvs just to show im blessed from rappin
i keep this glizzy tucked if they plan on necklace snatchin

verse 2
my shoes from germany like james harden euro step on the scene
double gs new margiela alexander mcqueen
and you know that bag on me its at least fifty bands in them jeans
pockets fat and my jewelry dancing
diamonds flooded like new orleans
lavish life now i live like a king
i got on now im blessing my team
told my brother i got your back
show my niggas what loyalty means
but this shit wasnt as easy as it seems
my homie died at 16
i remember i was up all night
kept seeing death in my dreams
i was posted on sed with them fiends
hot and em got the tec with the stream
laser tag we was playin with them beams
young nigga tryna kill everything
touch his soul in this four nickel ring
its a whole lot of shots flying in your facetime when that smith  wesson ring ayy
