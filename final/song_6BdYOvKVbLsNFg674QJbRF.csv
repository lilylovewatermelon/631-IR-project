theres an intruder
in my house
he cut my phone line 911 emer
cant dial out shit
i scream for police
but i doubt
theyre gonna hear me gun cock
when i shout
gunshot

verse 1
a couple of cocktailsll send me to jail
theres a couple of cops hot on my trail but this time
when i get pulled over theres a doberman pinscher
and a pit bull in the seat these pigsll get bit foolin with me
quit foolin with me bitch youre gonna see
no pistol in the seat why it always
gotta be an issue when youre me in which youre gonna see
in the long run ima be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limotinted glass
flashin that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
last night when them assholes ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what im posed to fight with bare palms
yeah right they comin with bombs im comin with flare guns

we as americans we as americans
us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
look at how shit has been we better check ourselves
livin up in these streets through worse and through better health
survivin by any means we as americans
us as a citizen we are samaritans
what do we get us in we better check ourselves
look at how shit has been take a look where you live
this is america and we are americans

verse 2
i make beaucoup bucks wearin beaucoup vests
drama hangin over my head like a voodoo hex
i coulda been next to fly over the cuckoos nest
with youknowwho with an s tattooed to my chest
but ive finessed it now i got the industry pissy
ever since me and dre split it fiftyfifty on 50
its funny we got a buzz spreadin quicker
than makin paper airplanes out of a twenty
fuck money i dont rap for dead presidents
id rather see the president daed
its never been said but i set precedents
in the standards and they cant stand it
my name shoulda been bastard the shit shoulda been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp i shoulda been blasted
i shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
but im too swift and fast for that im past it
im too old to go and cruise gratiot — fuck that shit
i done seen how fast this rap shit
can turn into some pappap shit that quick snap click
but this time they got the fuckin automatic
aint no one gon test this man — clack click gunshot
chorus
we as americans us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves livin up in these streets
through worse and through better health survivin by any means
we as americans us as a citizen
we are samaritans what do we get us in
we better check ourselves look at how shit has been
take a look where you live this is america and we are americans

verse 3
shht i got a secret if you can keep it between us
i tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my long johns under my sean johns
one runin with the long arm of the law im long gone
ima do five years — no less than that no questions asked
so it might be a good idea that i stop right here
and quit while im ahead already in the red
already got a steady infrared meant for my head
a target on my back bigger problems than that
bin laden on my ass he probably gon send a task
i aint gon even ask they aint gon let me pack
they aint gon give me my semi but i got my weed back

chorus
we as americans us as a citizen
gotta protect ourselves look at how shit has been
we better check ourselves livin up in these streets
through worse and through better health survivin by any means
we as americans us as a citizen
we are samaritans what do we get us in
we better check ourselves look at how shit has been
take a look where you live this is america and we are americans57embed"
