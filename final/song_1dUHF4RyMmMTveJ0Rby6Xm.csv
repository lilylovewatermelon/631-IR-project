ayo blast that shit maxx
blast that shit back if you blastin

verse 1
uberx to hidden hills
give me somethin i can feel
if they come to hidden hills
then i know they know the deal
we just right there up the road
you could hit it with a stone
i be out here on my own
im just tryna set the tone
ive been kicked when i was down
none of that shit matter now
niggas think they run the town
til we run em out of town
and they gotta relocate
gotta dip from where they stay
everything will be okay
man just stay up out my way

chorus
skid around ends with the bros and im kitted to the toes
if i touch studio then we got one
i be tryna laugh with the bros bout the opps that we know
but they cant take a joke cause its not one
think its cause we live by the code reputation to uphold
makin me the one they gotta take the spot from
i be tryna laugh with the bros but they cant take a joke

verse 2
back and forth to italy
my comment section killin me
i swear i get so passionate
yall do not know the half of it
i grew up with the reps up boys we crashin it and splashin in
and when i say they crashin it i do not mean a accident
im– im still in the studio at 645
and my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
and i gotta own the things i rap about just for my pride
you know when it comes to pride i cant put that shit aside
ive been kicked when i was down
none of that shit matter now
they be throwin in the towel
i do yellowtail at tao
they be watchin what they say
especially when its to my face
everything will be okay
man just stay up out my way

chorus
skid around ends with the bros and im kitted to the toes
if i touch studio then we got one
i be tryna laugh with the bros bout the opps that we know
but they cant take a joke cause its not one
think its cause we live by the code reputation to uphold
makin me the one they gotta take the spot from
i be tryna laugh with the bros but they cant take a joke35embed"
