sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
i feel you everywhere i go
i see your smile i see your face
i hear you laughing in the rain
i still cant believe youre gone

chorus
it aint fair you died too young
like the story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that ive been through
just knowing noone could take your place
an sometimes i wonder
whod you be today

verse 2
would you see the world would you chase your dreams
settle down with a family
i wonder what would you name your babies
some days the skys so blue
i feel like i can talk to you
an i know it might sound crazy
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
it aint fair you died too young
like the story that had just begun
but death tore the pages all away
god knows how i miss you
all the hell that ive been through
just knowing noone could take your place
an sometimes i wonder
whod you be today

break
today today today
today today today

outro
sunny days seem to hurt the most
i wear the pain like a heavy coat
the only thing that gives me hope
is i know ill see you again someday
