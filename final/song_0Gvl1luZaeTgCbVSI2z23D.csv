hol up

verse
my dad built houses my mom painted pictures
they both gave it up once i came into the picture
me im like them just a fiftyfifty mixture
my mom rode horses she wish i had a sister
i prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush
but i build things up and my imagery is lush
i used to play soccer but i never had the touch
basketball too but i aint love it that much
much of my times spent lookin for a rush
tryna find something to afford me that feeling
i fall in love with girls cause they physically appealing
a couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceiling
ive smokеd a few blunts cookies and runtz
gotten high еnough to know it isnt what i want
met the celebrities seen through the fronts
dated one girl and ive seen two at once
i aint upset to be inside for some months
and get back in touch with the person that i was
know ive given too much of my time to the chase
tryna get in touch with a person that i lust
so this the perfect time to hang it up
used to sleep until noon now at nine im waking up
more time that im inside then the less i want to talk
i dont wanna facetime i aint tryna say whats up
careful with the ways that my time is taken up
bunch of geeks tryna take the shine away from us
reaching for critiques and they tryna say i suck
got me reminiscin back to a time i gave a—
but my skins gotten thick since then
and my high school crush has done the same thing
so when this blows over and im back home
ima tell her that im really done playin games
seven figures in my bank statements
seven fellas that im that stayin on the same page with
we been shootin for the stars and our aims dangerous
hasnt been a single thing that the gang cant get
my main thing shall remain nameless
know they ask about her often but i aint sayin shit
theres a level of discretion that im maintaining
she dont understand it but she aint famous
we gon see whos still around once the game changes
shes a businesswoman but i got her playing favorites
you aint rooting for me then i gotta make changes
ex girls watchin with a lot of fake pages a lot of fake pages
my og showed me what a plain jane is and a bust down is
now i got a hankering to spend a few thousand
ky used to take me up to icebox when hed get his jewelry cleaned
they would ask if they could help me and i say im just browsing
woyne worked at enterprise rentals discounted
ville to the a and back we was putting miles in
always wondered to myself if i could really be the leader
of a group of brownskinned boys when im not brownskinned
certain things they grew up on that they get but i dont get
differences in how we raised make me feel like i dont fit
not to mention the distance between our parents houses
shared some money with em so they know i care about em
im tryna do it right and figure what a fair amount is
but i fantasize bout a day that we all swimming in it
no contracts and we independent
stay close never start a convo with its been a minute
cause it never will be end of sentence
nemo thats my right hand guides me through my indecisions
vodka in my left hand takes away my inhibitions
way too gone but im waking up in mint condition
ready for whatever got the troops with me in positionyou might also like2embed"
