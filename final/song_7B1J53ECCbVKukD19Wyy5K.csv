you tellin me you leavin cause its hard
guess i should sit here while the devil dance on my soul
fire burnin in my lungs cant get the words off my tongue
youre mine i can trust you and i know that i know
who is them to compete with me
they aint turn the world up like us i know i know
it was only my niggas that put me on
they aint give us one thing and that i know

verse
you stuck might as well say you mine
just one look i see the whole world in your eyes
combination on my heart no one could get inside
all the wrong ones want me еxcept her
should i run if i
pleasе dont try to catch up this time
i need someone to hold me keep me safe in this world
the moonshine i can see it bloom in your eyes
dont try to hide if you cry i see your tears fallin on the floor
me am i sorry
if you leave please call me
please dont leave me all alone
dont desert me take the money
youll be fine without me
than without you i just cant hold on
while my feelings drift with the wind
i have no friends
you the only know how im is
they throwing bombs and i dont have no shield
it seem like you aint come around all year
modification engines im dependent
done winning im turnt for the year
changin my denim linen got me feelin like im the richest one here yeah
im the party pull up get it started
got your friend all in my ear yeah
half a ticket richard mille
bentley jumpin off the lear

you tellin me you leavin cause its hard
guess i should sit here while the devil dance on my soul
fire burnin in my lungs cant get the words off my tongue
youre mine i can trust you and i know that i know
who is them to compete with me
they aint turn the world up like us i know i know
it was only my niggas that put me on
they aint give us one thing and that i know3embed"
