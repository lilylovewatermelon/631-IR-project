there was a shot in the dark
i was caught by surprise
there was a hole in my heart
there were tears in your eyes
and there was nothing to say
cause you made up your mind
and so i guess what you meant
when you left was goodbye

prechorus
so if youre going to go
and leave me in a lonely gray
i wont let it show
until you finally flown away

chorus
you got to know that you tear me up
when you say you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you tear me up when you say
you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you were the one and it was enough
to be the one you were dreaming of
you were the one and we called it love
and now you take it all away take it all awayayayayay

i felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
and as i tried to digest the words i couldnt believe
im left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe

prechorus
so if youre going to go
and leave me in a lonely gray
i wont let it show
until you finally flown away

chorus
you got to know that you tear me up
when you say you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you tear me up when you say
you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you were the one and it was enough it was enough
to be the one you were dreaming of dreaming of
you were the one and we called it love
and now you take it all away take it all awayayayayay

outro
you take it all away
you take it all away
you take it all away
chorus
you got to know that you tear me up
when you say you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you tear me up when you say
you want to take it all away take it all awayayayayay
you were the one and it was enough it was enough
to be the one you were dreaming of dreaming of
you were the one and we called it love
and now you take it all away take it all awayayayayay4embed"
