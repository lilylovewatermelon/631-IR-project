come here girl give me a kiss yeah

verse 1
valentines day done came early
and whatever you want girl you deserve it
cause you warmer than the summer time so i hold you through the winter time
and the love inside your eyes could turn a cloudy day to sunshine

prechorus
i make a move then you make a move
im wanting your love with nothing to lose
im in the mood if you in the mood
to go in the room and do what we do
its going down
i want your body in my arms right now

chorus

when you got that red lipstick on
baby kiss me til your lipstick gone
