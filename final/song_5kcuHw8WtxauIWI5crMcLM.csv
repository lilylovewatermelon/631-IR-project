we were never in the park
talkin on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark
ignoring tornado warnings
he didnt hold me in his arms
we didnt stumble over the pages of our relationship arc
ignoring tornado warnings

prechorus
dont understand how quickly we get
right back in our rhythm without missing a step
and logically the last thing i should have on my mind
but i want you there sometimes

chorus
i guess maybe thats why im lying to my therapist
i keep saying things like i never saw him and we never kissed
now i think somehow in my mind
if i could convince him if he doesnt see it then maybe it doesnt exist
i think hes onto me every time i say im over that son of a bitch
im lying to my therapist

verse 2
i deserve an hour in a week to focus on my thoughts
not so obsessed with yours i cant hear myself speak
i deserve my own consideration but sometimes i wish i kept
some of my feelings in the basement so id still have some left
