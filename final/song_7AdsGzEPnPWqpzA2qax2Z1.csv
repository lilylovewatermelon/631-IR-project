basically im complicated
i have a hard time taking the easy way
i wouldnt call it schizophrenia
but ill be at least two people today
if thats okay

chorus
and i could go on and on and on
but who cares

verse 2
its deep how you can be so shallow
and im afraid cause i have no fear
and i didnt believe in magic
until i watched you disappear
i wish you were here

chorus
and i could go on and on and on
but who cares

verse 3
you see everybody is somebody
but nobody wants to be themselves
ooh and if i ever wanted to understand me
id have to talk to someone else
cause every little bit helps

and i could go on and on and on
but who cares

verse 4
it feels like a surreal life
but its still nice
wish i could live twice
and i still might
if these wounds heal right
i see a little light
even though its still night
it feels like a surreal life
but its still nice
wish i could live twice
and i still might
if these wounds heal right
i see a little light
even though its still night
