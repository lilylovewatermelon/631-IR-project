i know it dont seem difficult to hit you up
but you not passionate about half the shit that you into
and i aint havin it
and we both know that i dont mean to offend you
im just focused today
and i dont know why its difficult to admit that i miss you
and i dont know why we argue and i just hope that you listen
and if i hurt you im sorry the music makes me dismissive
when im awake im just drifting im not complaining
its just to say that i stay pretty busy lately
and i could be misbehaving i just hang with my niggas
im fuckin famous if you forgot im faithful
despite all whats in my face and my pocket
and this is painfully honest
and when i say it i vomit on cloudy days when im salty
i play the hate to the logic
state to state for the profit it aint a stain on me nigga
my momma raised me a prophet i play for dollar incentive
and where im walking its studded and halfretarded i stumble
to where she park when she visit i grab the bottle and chug it
i see the car in the distance i know the dark isnt coming
for the moment if i could hold it
you see see it seems that

chorus earl sweatshirt
all my dreams got dimmer when i stopped smoking pot
nightmares got more vivid when i stopped smoking pot
and loving you is a little different i dont like you a lot
you see it seems like um
you might also likeverse 2 frank ocean
im coming back i gotta handle business
vanish to my sleeper seat left you at terminal three
ill meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks a fortnight
when you parade my homecoming dont cry
you know i cant live in any place i visit
to live and die in la
i got my fleetwood mac i could get high every day
but id be sleepy ocd and paranoid so
give me bali beach no molly please palm no marijuana trees
your hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
when im playing surfboarder put whiskey in that salt water
i emptied every canteen
just to wear that straightedge varsity you thinks cool
they called me soft in high school thank god im jagged
forgot you dont like it rough i mean he called me a faggot
i was just calling his bluff
i mean how anal am i gon be when im aiming my gun
and whys his mug all bloody that was a threeonone
standing ovation at staples i got my grammys and gold
polka dots on my brit im not supposed to be stunting
its all melodic this song
i catch this vibe in my sleep but im just jetlagged is all
and restless

chorus frank ocean
all my dreams got more vivid when i stopped smoking pot
nightmares got more vivid when i stopped smoking pot
loving yous a little different i dont like you a lot
i meanâ€¦ fuck
outro both frank ocean earl sweatshirt
i dont know what were about
what good is west coast weather if youre bipolar
if ima need this sweater id rather be where its cold
where it snows i see how it goes
i put the flowers in bowls i know theyre coming in droves
youll only miss when it goes
yeah i think thats it
when it goes167embed"
