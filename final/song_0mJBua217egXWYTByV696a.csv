if my heart dont beat
and the sun dont shine
theyll get theirs
youll get yours
and ill get mine

it used to be that everything was easy
now its lost and nobody believes me

am i losing heart
have i frozen it oh yeah
am i pushing too hard
have i started to forget

im alright
am i made of steel
am i locked up tight
im human
but im wide awake
and afraid to fight

it used to take nothing to amaze me
but now im older and it doesnt even phase me

am i losing heart
have i frozen it oh yeah
am i pushing too hard
have i started to forget
