i know
caught up in the middle
i cry just a little
when i think of letting go
oh no
gave up on the riddle
i cry just a little
when i think of letting go

verse 1 flo rida
i know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one rida
eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
cant let go i got fans in okinawa
my heart to japan quake losers and survivors
norway no you didnt get my flowers
no way to say it better but the killer was a coward
face just showered the minute in a hour
heard about the news whole day went sour
bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon head
put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
give em my regards or regardless i get arrested
aint worried about the killers just the young and restless
getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
dui never said i was driving reckless
you and i know that jealously is not impressive
oh no i cant stop i was destined

verse 2 flo rida
champagne buckets still got two tears in it
and i put that on my tattoo of jimi hendrix
get the pressed leather outfit all in it
cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
clean next get a call just a lil visit
sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
reality stressed when youre blessed just kill critics
bugatti never meant im rich just godfearing
look at me steering got the bossing staring
got a good feeling mr mike caren
tell his billie jeans im on another planet
thank eclass big chuck or lee prince perries
buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
tryna live tryna figure how your sister vanish
no cheers i know you wouldnt panic

bridge flo rida
when i need a healing i just look up to the ceiling
i see the sun coming down i know its all better now
when i need a healing i just look up to the ceiling
i see the sun coming down i know its all better now
when i need a healing i just look up to the ceiling
i see the sun coming down i know its all better now
when i need a healing i just look up to the ceiling
i see the sun coming down i know its all better now
