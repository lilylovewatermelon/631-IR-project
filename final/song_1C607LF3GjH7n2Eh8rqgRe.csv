woo

verse 1
i said oh my oh no not i
i was just busy watching everyone go by
outside the shite bar in your old red car
me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar
i said oh christ and i told you twice
its just not easy going through all these things thrice
whats this i once heard you drive a bluebird
you got no money for the petrol thats what i heard

chorus
and its alright shell be sucking fingers all night
wearing those shoes oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
and though shes alright everybody says shes uptight
sick in the head but first in the bed
so easy to be fridays nightmare
woo

verse 2
i said oh no oh please just go
you got no eyelids and sweet ella loves me so
she got my number though i cant stand her
i cant help digging her i hope i guess i wonder
and though its clear you want me dear
it would be easier if i was never here
you got the money and i got the reason
ill stick around with you for just another season
you might also likechorus
and its alright shell be sucking fingers all night
wearing those shoes oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
and though shes alright everybody says shes uptight
sick in the head but first in the bed
so easy to be fridays nightmare

bridge
and shes just gettin along
so dont tell me shes yours oh please tell me im wrong again
its all in a day
so what can you say
just sleep in your shoes
with the window box blues and its time you choose oh yeah

verse 3
she said oh my oh no not i
i was just busy watching everyone go by
whats this i once heard you drive a bluebird
you got no money for the petrol thats what i heard

chorus
and its alright shell be sucking fingers all night
wearing those shoes oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
and oh shes alright everybody says shes uptight
sick in the head but first in the bed
so easy to be fridays wonder2embed"
