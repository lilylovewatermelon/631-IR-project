there was a boy
a very strange enchanted boy
they said he wandered very far very far
over land and sea
a little shy and sad of eye
but very wise was he

instrumental break

verse 2
and then one day
a lucky day he passed my way
then we spoke of many things
fools and kings
then he said to me
the greatest thing youll ever learn
is to love and be loved in return
