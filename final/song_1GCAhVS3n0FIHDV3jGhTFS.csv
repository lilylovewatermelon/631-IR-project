we walk through the doorway heard you calling from the hall
to find you in the bedroom not breathing at all
i drug your body to the cellar where we lay
the wax it melts away i kiss your face

prechorus
now we are starting to love you more
your bodys on the canvas i painted on the floor

chorus
now you wait
like the drug like the change in the pain it goes on
for so long
and oh
how it hurts in the worst way now that youre gone
its so wrong its so wrong

verse 2
if i could take you somewhere id take you to the darkest place
scatter you in art forms admire the whore
beauty in different ways your hands on picture frames
your eyes in the glass wear your face as a mask

prechorus
now they are starting to love you more
a gallery of your beauty no charge at the door
you might also likechorus
as you wait
like the drug like the change in the pain it goes on
for so long
and oh
how it hurts in the worst way now that youre gone
its so wrong its so wrong

verse 3
and down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
i lost control your face is pale your bodys cold
and down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
i lost control your face is pale your bodys cold
your face is pale your bodys cold

chorus
now you wait
like the drug like the change in the pain it goes on
for so long
and oh
how it hurts in the worst way now that youre gone
its so wrong its so wrong

outro
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong
its so wrong6embed"
