yeah
somebody um
somebody hit me today and they were like
nah just make sure you know
you tell me what to do when i get there you know
june youre a genius
i said i respect it no problem
i got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
know what im sayin
yeah my hands always open for real

verse
ayy
thirtythree years i gave that to the game
thirtythree mil ill save that for the rain
five hundred weeks ill fill the charts with my pain
five hundred mil and ill fall back in the 6ix
finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
michael jackson shit but the palace is not for kids
still women sayin its childish the way we live
brought a few ws to the 6ix
baby mama fluke but i love her for who she is
baby wayne and tez responsible for this shit
half the time i question my consciousness in this shit
other times i question if compliments are legit
fulltime im out here confident as a bitch
tryna make good on the promises that i give
tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
register the business in my brothers name
thirtyfive hunnid in her pocket that should cover things
certified lover man trappin out the motherland
always move right so my watch is on the other hand
she can try and play it down now but she was a fan
people wanna know whats in my pockets they dont understand
my assistant always findin percocet and rubber bands
know my mom might not want to hear how i discover plans
word to sandra graham no one love you like your mother can
i watched michael rubin win a million off a couple hands
i decide what to see next like its on demand
i decide what to be next like im switchin plans
ima tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
i will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 god prayin hands like im a religious man
but im just a sicker man wicked man
look we can argue back and forth but whos the richer man
isnt that what matters in this world that we livin in
bang those dividends snakes stay slitherin
how you plan to make it to the top by just fittin in
how you plan to take a niggas spot by just givin in
how you gon treat this shit like you gon get to live again
how you gettin hype off one hit do that shit again
how you got a manager you mad at after you got the win
bet you got some niggas thatll love you til the bitter end
bet you got somebody thats just smarter than your other friends
give em a percentage see what happens to your blessings then
you just need to stay close to your people that was there when others couldve been
there when others shouldve been
got a nigga starin at the game like damn coach put him in
but you never listen so you niggas goin wood again
got us in the crib talkin bout what niggas coulda been shoulda been
and i got your girl on the second floor beggin me to put it in
and its not because all of the money that you wouldnt spend
and its not because i set it up to try and get revenge
its because you niggas insecure you aint made men
its because even though you hate on me we stay friends
its because you niggas never learn when to say when
