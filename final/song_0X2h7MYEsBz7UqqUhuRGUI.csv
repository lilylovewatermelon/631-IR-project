ive been smoking and i aint coming down
no my feet wont touch the ground and i cant help it
i seen hopeless i rather be lost and never found
aint no tellin where im heading now and i accept it

chorus
mama smoke like willie in the back of a mobile home
on the road again papa lives like a rollin stone
i just plant my seed sit back and watch em grow
take all my problems i roll em up and smoke

verse 2
i like the whiskey tequila when its cold
i can feel it in my soul when i tie one off
my doctor tells me if i wanna grow great and old
ima have to let these vices go but i dont know

chorus
mama smoke like willie in the back of a mobile home
on the road again papa lives like a rollin stone
i just plant my seed sit back and watch em grow
take all my problems i roll em up and smoke

bridge
theres a single wide trailer mama sittin at the table
watching basic cable with the cigarette lit
all the hell that we been raising
and the trails that we been blazing
to be this lucky that dont make no sense

mama smoke like willie in the back of a mobile home
on the road again papa lives like a rollin stone
i just plant my seed sit back and watch em grow
take all my problems i roll em up and smokeembed"
