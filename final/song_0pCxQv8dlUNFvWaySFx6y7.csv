you got a way of makin me feel insane
like i cant trust my own brain
unless its screaming your name
id have it no other way
id have it no other way
and maybe thats why i stay
how many times can we pick up the same fight
can we keep screaming all night
and make up until its light
thats when i say that youre right
and feel your body on mine
oh maybe thats why i stay

chorus
i could be somewhere chillin on the beach
i could be with someone makin me happy
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love
i could put my phone down just pick up my keys
i could let you go and we could let it be
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love

verse 2
keep comin back guess you could say im attached
last time we called it a wrap i came beggin and all that
youre like a habit its bad
i got a habit its bad
oh no im not even mad
you might also likechorus
i could be somewhere chillin on the beach
i could be with someone makin me happy
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love
i could put my phone down just pick up my keys
i could let you go and we could let it be
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love

bridge
its the way you keep me up all night
its the way you make me lose my mind
every time im sayin one more night
its the way you know im yours
its the way you know im yours for life

chorus
cause i could be somewhere chillin on the beach
i could be with someone makin me happy
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love
i could put my phone down just pick up my keys
i could let you go and we could let it be
but that would be too easy love
and i dont want no easy love16embed"
