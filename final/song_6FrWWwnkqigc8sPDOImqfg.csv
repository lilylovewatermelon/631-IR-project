six months passed since we both said goodbye
never thought that id run into you here tonight
and i cant ever think your smiles the same as it was
back when i saw you every day
i probably shouldnt say it
what im about to say

chorus
we could make a comeback if you come back
we were on top of the world people wanted what we had
we could have it again dont you know that
we could make a comeback if you come back

verse 2
you havent stopped me yet so i guess ill keep going on
oh and i havent even deleted your number from my phone
ive been wanting to call you every single day
but i couldnt think how to rephrase everything
so just tell me babe
if you feel the same way

chorus
we could make a comeback if you come back
we were on top of the world
people wanted what we had
we could have it again dont you know that
we could make a comeback if you come back
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likebridge
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back

chorus
we could make a comeback if you just come back
we could make a comeback if you come back
we were on top of the world people wanted what we had
we could have it again dont you know that
we could make a comeback if you come back

bridge
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
come back
