verse 1
well i walk into the room
passing out hundred dollar bills
and it kills and it thrills like the horns on my silverado grill
and i buy the bar a double round of  crown
and everybodys getting down
an this town aint never gonna be the same

chorus
cause i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy

well i dont give a dang about nothing
im singing and blingblinging
while the girls are drinking
long necks down
and i wouldnt trade ol leroy
or my chevrolet for your escalade
or your freak parade
im the only john wayne left in this town
you might also likeand i saddle up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy 7659194


spoken
im a thouroughbred
thats what she said
in the back of my truck bed
as i was gettin buzzed on suds
out on some back country road
we where flying high
fine as wine having ourselves a big and rich time
and i was going just about as far as shed let me go

but her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
had me begging for salvation
all night long
so i took her out giggin frogs
introduced her to my old bird dog
and sang her every wilie nelson song i could think of
and we made love
and i saddled up my horse
and i ride into the city
i make a lot of noise
cause the girls
they are so pretty
riding up and down broadway
on my old stud leroy
and the girls say
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy


what what
save a horse ride a cowboy
everybody says
save a horse ride a cowboy2embed"
