leggo ok
bitch i’m me american gangster
weezy f baby born in a manger
trouble is my friend i ain’t foreign to danger
clip full of wings turn you boys into angels
shoot you in your halo shoot you like halo
new orleans ahole frio fuego
all about my bread like bagels they know
i’m raw like quaaludes
bal like gay hoes
weed so strong it’s like i twist tornadoes
spit like nines fourfifths and threeeight0s
niggas want problems well i am problematic
it’s back to picking cotton cause you niggas cotton candy
i’m a eastside damu
deep water shamu

pussy in the bedroom
pass that bitch down like an heirloom
tunechi

verse 3 lil wayne
married to the money you welcome to the reception
and she came with problems fuck it that’s my stepsons
sleeping in the maybach wake me when the jet come
and i keep the toast turn your ass to bread crumbs uh
based on a true story
i got a million flows they ain’t even two stories
sleeping on the edge i hope i don’t toss and turn
shoot down the early bird and that’s how i get the worm
yeah real nigga university alumni
just checked my watch and that bitch said sometimes
she say when i’m in her it feel like i’m soulsearching
and they say money talks well it’s my spokesperson uh
grab a star from the sunroof
i fuck her in her dreams and make her come true
yeah young money and the power
send my bs at you like a motherfucking flower
