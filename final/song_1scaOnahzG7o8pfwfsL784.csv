ive been runnin around in circles
pretending to be myself
why would somebody do this on purpose
when they could do something else
drowning out the morning birds
with the same three songs over and over
i wish i wrote it but i didnt so i learn the words
hum along til the feelings gone forever

chorus
took a tour to see the stars
but they werent out tonight
so i wished hard on a chinese satellite
i want to believe
instead i look at the sky and i feel nothing
you know i hate to be alone
i want to be wrong

verse 2
you were screamin at the evangelicals
they were screamin right back from what i remember
when you said i will never be your vegetable
because i think when youre gone its forever
but you know id stand on the corner
embarrassed with a picket sign
if it meant i would see you when i die
you might also likechorus
sometimes when i cant sleep
its just a matter of time before im hearing things
swore i could feel you through the walls
but thats impossible
i want to believe i want to believe
that if i go outside ill see a tractor beam
coming to take me to where im from
i want to go home25embed"
