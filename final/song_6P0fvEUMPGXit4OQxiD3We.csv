i left you over by the wishin well
wandering wondering if these trees could tell

prechorus
summertime
ill make you mine

chorus
cause i need
healin for a hollow wound
with room for two

verse 2
if the gardens your daylight
then ill work the field
fielding the ripeness of this stubborn will

prechorus
summertime
ill make you mine

chorus
cause i need
healin for a hollow wound
with room for two
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likebridge
i will sing as your canary bird
take my soul and bury it in the earth
i will sing as your canary bird
oh yes i will
yes i will
