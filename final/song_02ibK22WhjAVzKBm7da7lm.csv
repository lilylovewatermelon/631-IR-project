to save us all from satans power
when we were gone astray
oh tidings of comfort and joy

when we were gone astray

verse 1
in bethlehem in israel
this blessed babe was born
and laid within a manger
upon this blessed morn
the which his mother mary
did nothing take in scorn
o tidings of comfort and joy
comfort and joy
o tidings of comfort and joy

let nothing you affright
this day is born a saviour
of a pure virgin bright
to free all those who trust in him
from satans power and might
o tidings of comfort and joy

o tidings of comfort and joy

to save us all from satans powr
when we were gone astray
oh tidings of comfort and joy
