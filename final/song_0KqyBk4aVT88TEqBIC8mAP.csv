eight oclock monday night and im waitin
to finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
her name is nona shes a rocker with a nose ring
she wears a two way but im not quite sure what that means

prechorus
and when she walks
all the wind blows and the angels sing
but she doesnt notice me

chorus
cause shes watchin wrestling
creamin over tough guys
listenin to rap metal
turntables in her eyes
its like a bad movie
shes lookin through me
if you were me then youd be
screamin someone shoot me
as i fail miserably
tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want

verse 2
she likes the godsmack and i like agent orange
her cd changers full of singers that are mad at their dad
she says shed like to score some reefer and a forty
shell never know that im the best that shell never have
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus
and when she walks
all the wind blows and the angels sing
shell never notice me

chorus
cause shes watchin wrestling
creamin over tough guys
listenin to rap metal
turntables in her eyes
she likes em with a mustache
racetrack season pass
drivin in a transam
does a mullet make a man
its like a bad movie
shes lookin through me
if you were me then youd be
screamin someone shoot me
as i fail miserably
tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want

bridge
there she goes again
with fishnets on and dreadlocks in her hair
she broke my heart i wanna be sedated
all i wanted was to see her naked
chorus
now im watchin wrestling
tryna be a tough guy
listenin to rap metal
turntables in my eyes
i cant grow a mustache
and i aint got no season pass
all i gots a moped moped moped
its like a bad movie
shes lookin through me
if you were me then youd be
screamin someone shoot me
as i fail miserably
tryna get the girl all the bad guys want

outro
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
there she goes again
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
there she goes again
cause shes the girl all the bad guys want
