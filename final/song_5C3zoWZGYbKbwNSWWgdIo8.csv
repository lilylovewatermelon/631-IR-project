ay i just got a idea
you know
thinking of some things we could do spice things up
for sure

verse 1
if i snuck up in your bedroom touch you while you sleep
would you act surprised as if you didnt know its me
i came to steal your heart girl dont call the police
i only want a part girl really just a piece
if you show me the money then im gon show you the beast
if you give me your honey girl i promise ill be sweet
then im gon sneak out the back so nobody will notice me
then we can run it back girl its your turn to go on me we can

chorus
we can try some role play you can do what i say
i can do what you say you can have it your way
we can try some role play i can do what you say
you can do what i say i can have it my way
we can try some role play you can do what i say
i can do what you say you can have it your way
we can try some role play i can do what you say
you can do what i say i can have it my way

the room is spinning ridiculous my body freezing cold
i cant even remember what i did the night before
i dont know where i am girl but i gotta go
i cant feel my legs somebody help
if you come in and rescue me i dont know what to do
i say i need a remedy you say the cure is you
then you tell me relax and get ready for surgery
baby fix me fast you know its an emergency

chorus
