what you mean switchin up this how im gettin paid still
my lil nigga caught on one now he geeked up off that kill
and if i let you sit behind me i must love you for real
for real for real for real

verse 1
wakin up on my momma couch lookin for a plug just to end the drought
reggie pounds they was on the time i shot you down keep an half an ounce
just a little somethin to smoke with a hoe i was dead broke she couldnt tell though
wearin my nigga shoes and my cousin clothes but that was way before
checks hittin that bitches hittin back
im against myself goin tit for tat
window walk the hoes havin flash backs
baby bottle full not with similac
aint no sense in tryna clear it up
let em feel how they wanna feel
when the grief came though yeah they tryna say we got that brother killed this shit crazy
im trendin now
been workin like its the beginnin now
ill kill you with the truth before i lie
and if you want smoke we blow that fire
how you gangsta but a humble guy
cause im still tryna catch my blessings
big stepper i keep my weapon
i dont remember the last time i left it
look at me they see a threat
look at me they see a check
guess thats how they greet a nigga
learnin from the internet
all them kids baby momma drama
cant judge a book by its cover
how you know me you aint got my number
five years still no fumble
see moneybagg yo liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likechorus
what you mean switchin up this how im gettin paid still
my lil nigga caught on one now he geeked up off that kill
and if i let you sit behind me i must love you for real
fuck it if i let you come around me i must know you for real

verse 2
never doubtin i uppergrade these bitches fuck who got a wave
hope a nigga see the top before the day i see the grave
ballin with the same team or players i could never trade
the ones that went against me regret it they wish they never played
sometimes you be movin too fast with no time to stash
troopers lights flash pulled over with seven hunnid cash
im telling em google me but they just tryna see id
fool saver saved me they didnt even smell that half of p
you aint sacrificed what i did no off days i missed birthdays
i be in my benz whenever im mad or in a hurt phase
forgive me if you met me on them percs them was the worst days
currently im swimmin in codeine im on a surf wave

chorus
what you mean switchin up this how im gettin paid still
my lil nigga caught on one now he geeked up off that kill
and if i let you sit behind me i must love you for real
fuck it if i let you come around me i must know you for real
what you mean switchin up this how im gettin paid still
my lil nigga caught on one now he geeked up off that kill
and if i let you sit behind me i must love you for real
fuck it if i let you come around me i must know you for real
