ayy ayy youre probably staying this for the day
im not no lame though shout out to samsson
youre probably in miami with some niggas in your face i get it

you probably see i brought the suburb out the city girl cant forget it
you probably want your get back cause youre hurt
but you know if you do it then its different then i probably wont forgive you in your heart
but i know you and you gon play it smart
i cant help it that i love you its a flaw

verse
i admit it i just spent like fifty grand on codeine and different bitches
i cant give up on my mans so im sneakin to the trenches
bought a house and truck for mama baby sister know bout bentley
free my brother fuck your honor ayy ayy
even though she aint еven fuck me i got it right back
we aint runnin out of monеy so aint no bounce back
got a sold out show in london a stoney island jacket
rememberin when you was for me i wonder what happened

pour that shit straight out the bottle measurings for bitches
man ayy

heavyweight pockets feather weight glizzy
if she pretty make her a mama
got a star thinkin im—
