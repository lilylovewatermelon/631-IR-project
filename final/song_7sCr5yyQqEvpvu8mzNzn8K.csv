bell dings

hi uh i have an appointment with emily charlton

great human resources certainly has an odd sense of humor

follow me

okay so i was mirandas second assistant…

but her first assistant recently got promoted and so now im the first

oh and youre replacing yourself well i am trying

miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks

we need to find someone who can survive here do you understand

yeah of course whos miranda

oh my god i will pretend you did not just ask me that

shes the editor in chief of runway not to mention a legend

you work a year for her and you can get a job at any magazine you want

a million girls would kill for this job
it sounds like a great opportunity id love to be considered

giggling

andrea runway is a fashion magazine…

so an interest in fashion is crucial

what makes you think im not interested in fashion

cell phone ringing oh my god

no no no

whats wrong

shes on her way tell everyone

shes not supposed to be here until 900

her driver just text messaged and her facialist ruptured a disk

god these people whistles whispers whos that

that i cant even talk about
all right everyone gird your loins

excited chattering did somebody eat an onion bagel

exhales sniffs

bell dings

sorry miranda

bell dings

move it ooh

i dont understand why its so difficult to confirm an appointment

i know im so sorry miranda i actually did confirm last night

details of your incompetence do not interest me

tell simone im not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the brazilian layout

i asked for clean athletic smiling she sent me dirty tired and paunchy

and rsvp yes to the michael kors party

i want the driver to drop me off at 930 and pick me up at 945 sharp

whispers 945 sharp call natalie at glorious foods tell her no for the 40th time

no i dont want dacquoise i want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote

then call my exhusband and remind him the parentteacher conference is at dalton tonight

then call my husband ask him to meet me for dinner at that place i went to with massimo

tell richard i saw the pictures that he sent for that feature on the female paratroopers…

and theyre all so deeply unattractive

is it impossible to find a lovely slender female paratrooper

no am i reaching for the stars here not really

also i need to see all the things that nigel has pulled for gwyneths second cover try

i wonder if shes lost any of that weight yet whos that

nobody um uh…

human resources sent her up about the new assistant job and i was preinterviewing her

but shes hopeless and totally wrong for it

people are panicking so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook

the ru… the runthrough right

yes editors bring in options for the shoot and miranda chooses

she chooses every single thing in every single issue

runthroughs are a huge deal i dont know why you dont know that andrea

woman okay are you ready emily oh hi hi

thats an interesting choice

you do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder

man singing in french continues

so none of the girls here eat anything

not since two became the new four and zero became the new two

well im a six which is the new 14

oh shoot

oh never mind im sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from

cash register clicking okay you think my clothes are hideous

i get it

but you know im not going to be in fashion forever…

so i dont see the point of changing everything about myself just because i have this job

yes thats true

thats really what this multibilliondollar industry is all about anyway isnt it

inner beauty cell phone rings

hello

right come on

mirandas pushed the runthrough up a half an hour mmm

shes always 15 minutes early which means

youre already late come shoot

excuse me

bell dings mr ravitz

nigel

issue going well oh yes our best september ever

great heard miranda killed autumn jackets and pulled up the sedona shoot

whats that costing me

about 300000

must have been some lousy jackets

irv ravitz oh im sorry

this is andy sachs mirandas new assistant

congratulations young lady

a million girls would kill for that job

byebye

hmm chairman of eliasclarke irv ravitz

you know what they saytiny man huge ego

no and ive seen all this before

theyskens is trying to reinvent the drop waist so actually its…

where are all the other dresses we have some right here

stand watch and listen and i think it can be very interesting…

no no i just… its just baffling to me

why is it so impossible to put together a decent runthrough

you people have had hours and hours to prepare its just so confusing to me

where are the advertisers

we have some pieces from banana republic we need more dont we

oh this is… this might be… what do you think of… yeah

well you know me

give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and im on board

but do you think its too much like… like the lacroix from july

i thought that but no not with the right accessories it should work

where are the belts for this dre… why is no one ready

here its a tough call

theyre so different miranda hmm

snorts chuckles

something funny

no no no nothings…

you know its just that both those belts look exactly the same to me

you know im still learning about this stuff and uh…

this… stuff

oh okay i see

you think this has nothing to do with you

you go to your closet…

and you select… i dont know… that lumpy blue sweater for instance…

because youre trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously…

to care about what you put on your back

but what you dont know is that that sweater is not just blue

its not turquoise its not lapis

its actually cerulean

and youre also blithely unaware of the fact…

that in 2002 oscar de la renta did a collection of cerulean gowns

and then i think it was yves saint laurent… wasrt it…

who showed cerulean military jackets

i think we need a jacket here mmm

and then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers

and then it uh filtered down through the department stores…

and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner…

and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner…

where you no doubt fished it out of some clearance bin

however that blue represents millions of dollars…

and countless jobs…

and its sort of comical how you think that youve made a choice…

that exempts you from the fashion industry…

when in fact…

youre wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room…

from a pile of stuff

so then i said no i couldnt see the difference…

between the two absolutely identical belts…

and you should have seen the look she gave me

i thought the flesh was gonna melt off her face

chuckles its not funny

shes not happy unless everyone around her is panicked nauseous or suicidal

and the clackers just worship her

the who they call them clackers

the sound that their stilettos make in the marble lobby

its like clack clack clack clack clack

groans and they all act like theyre curing cancer or something

chuckling the amount of time and energy…

that these people spend on these insignificant minute details and for what

so that tomorrow they can spend another 300000 reshooting something…

that was probably fine to begin with…

to sell people things they dont need

god

im not even hungry anymore what

that is why those girls are so skinny oh no no no

give me that theres like eight dollars ofjarlsberg in there

sighs you know what

i just have to stick it out for a year one year

and then i can do what i came to new york to do

but i cant let miranda get to me i wont

easy there tiger

i um… i thought you would be different

i said to myself go ahead

she hates me nigel

and thats my problem because…

oh wait no its not my problem

i dont know what else i can do because if i do something right its unacknowledged

halston lagerfeld de la renta

and what they did what they created…

was greater than art because you live your life in it

well not you obviously but some people

you think this is just a magazine hmm

this is not just a magazine

this is a shining beacon of hope for…

oh i dont know…

lets say a young boy growing up in rhode island with six brothers…

pretending to go to soccer practice when he was really going to sewing class…

and reading runway under the covers at night with a flashlight

you have no idea how many legends have walked these halls

and whats worse you dont care

because this place where so many people would die to work…

the twins said hello so i said hello back

the wideeyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories

yeah dont worry i know this city like the back of my hand

its my favorite place in the whole world

you know gertrude stein once said…

im christian thompson thats my way thats your way right

i work freelance i have a lot of free time on my hands

you know i never understood…

why everyone was so crazy about paris…

but… it is so beautiful

giggles

mm li cant im sorry

i cant you know nate and i just split up a couple days ago and i cant

ooh ive had too much wine

and my hearing… vision… judgments impaired

no i barely know you im in a strange city

i… am out of excuses

thank god

groans

gasps

yes

oh shoot

door opens

bonjour madame

uh what the hell is this

what does it look likeits a mockup

yeah of

of what american runway will look like when jacqueline follet is the new editor in chief

wh… theyre replacing miranda

yeah and shes bringing me in to run all the editorial content

youre really surprised

jacquelines a lot younger than miranda she has a fresher take on things

not to mention american runways one of the most expensive books in the business

jacqueline does the same thing for a lot less money

and irv… irvs a businessman you know

miranda will be devastated her whole life is about runway he cant do that to her

its done irvs gonna tell miranda after the party forjames

and she has no idea

shes a big girl shell be fine

shi… i have to go

andy

andy its done

baby its done

im not your baby

phone ringing allo

oh oh thank god youre there

sighs excuse me i need to talk to you right away

its aboutjacqueline follet

shit oh shit shit shit shit

yes mr ravitz im so sorry to bother you i was wondering…

have you completely lost your mind

i need to talk to you do not disturb me again

but um its just for one… miranda

horn honks

miranda miranda wait i need to talk to you

irv is making jacqueline follet the editor in chief of runway

christian thompson told me hes gonna work for her

irv is going to tell you today i thought maybe if i told you that you could fix it

do i smell freesias

what no li specifically told them…

if i see freesias anywhere…

i will be very disappointed

for 72 years runway has been more than a magazine

it has been a beacon of elegance and grace

miranda priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon…

setting a standard that inspires people across the globe

ladies and gentlemen i give you miranda priestly

thank you my dear friend

bonjour chuckles

thank you very much for coming today…

to help celebrate our dear friend james holt

but before i talk to you aboutjames…

and his many accomplishments…

i would like first to share some news with you

um as many of you know…

uh recently massimo corteleoni…

has agreed to finance the expansion of thejames holt label…

transforming the work of this visionary artist…

into a global brand which is really an exciting enterprise

runway and james holt share many things in common…

chief among them a commitment to excellence

and so it should come as no surprise that when the time came…

forjames to choose the new president ofjames holt international…

he chose from within the runway family

and its my great happiness today…

to announce to you all that that person…

is my friend and longtime esteemed colleague…

jacqueline follet

thank you merci

and now to the main event…

our celebration ofjames holt

we at runway are very proud to have been…

when the time is right shell pay me back

you sure about that

no

but i hope for the best

i have to

clamoring

you thought i didnt know

ive known what was happening for quite some time

itjust took me a little while to find a suitable alternative forjacqueline

and thatjames holtjob was so absurdly overpaid…

that of course she jumped at it

so i just had to tell irv thatjacqueline was unavailable

the truth is there is no one that can do what i do…

including her

any of the other choices would have found that job impossible…

and the magazine would have suffered

sighs especially because of the list

the list of designers photographers…

editors writers models all of whom were found by me nurtured by me…

and have promised me they will follow me…

whenever and if ever i choose to leave runway

chuckles

so he reconsidered

but i was very very impressed…

by how intently you tried to warn me

i never thought i would say this andrea…

but i really…

i see a great deal of myself in you

you can see beyond what people want and what they need…

and you can choose for yourself

i dont think im like that

l…

i couldnt do what you did to nigel miranda

i couldnt do something like that

mm you already did

to emily

thats not what i…

no that was… that was different i didnt have a choice

oh no you chose you chose to get ahead

you want this life those choices are necessary

but what if this isnt what i want

i mean what if i dont wanna live the way you live

dont be ridiculous andrea everybody wants this

everybody wants to be us

clamoring

woman vocalizing

vocalizing continues

cell phone ringing

vocalizing continues

i have to be at work in 20 minutes
