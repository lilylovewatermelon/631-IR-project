hey i feel like i just blow on up
anytime i could just lose control caught up
in your loving everytime i feel your touch
second thoughts more doubts started building up

youre everything i wanted
before i knew just what i wanted
and hey hey youre killing me on the inside
and youre the only one i want i cant deny

im not sure what to tell you confused
which way do i take your hand or let go
do i take your hand or let it go
i cant take this feeling much more
do i take your hand or let go go
dont know what to do what to say
im not sure what to tell you confused
which way do i go
