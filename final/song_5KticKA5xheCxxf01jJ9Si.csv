i grew up working on a farm way down south
i went to school against my will way down south
i kissed girls and i shot squirrels out behind my house
i learned a lot about this world way down south
i went to church sang a lot of hymns way down south
i learned to work on my pickup truck way down south
i played my guitar under the stars out behind our house
you will always find my heart way down south

chorus
clothes on a clothes line hanging in the sunshine
a garden growing in the ground
country music on the radio talk about a good old sound
people driving pass when im cutting grass
waving at every single one
thats the way its done when you come from way down south
way down south

verse 2
swimming in the creek with all my friends way down south
praying them days would never end way down south
give me a worm and a fishing pole ill pull a fish on out
those memories will never get old way down south

chorus
