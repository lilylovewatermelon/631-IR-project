oh brother i cant
i cant get through
ive been tryin hard to reach you
cause i dont know what to do
oh brother i cant believe its true
im so scared about the future
and i wanna talk to you
oh i wanna talk to you

chorus
you could take a picture of somethin you see
in the future where will i be
you could climb a ladder up to the sun
or write a song nobody had sung
or do somethin thats never been done

verse 2
are you lost or incomplete
do you feel like a puzzle
you cant find your missin piece
tell me how you feel
well i feel like theyre talkin in a language
i dont speak
and theyre talkin it to me

so you take a picture of somethin you see
in the future where will i be
you could climb a ladder up to the sun
or write a song nobody had sung
or do somethin thats never been done
do somethin thats never been done

instrumental break

outro
so you dont know where youre goin
and you wanna talk
and you feel like youre goin
where youve been before
youll tell anyone wholl listen
but you feel ignored
and nothins really makin any sense at all
lets talk lets talk
lets talk lets talk uuh27embed"
