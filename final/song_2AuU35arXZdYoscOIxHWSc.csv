verse 1 eminem
you find me offensive i find you offensive
for finding me offensive hence if
i should draw the line any fences if so to what extents if
any should i go cause its getting expensive
being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
they say i cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
when i go to lengths this far at other peoples expenses
i say youre all just too goddamn sensitive
its censorship and its downright blasphemous
lets end this shit now cause i wont stand for this
and christopher reeves wont sit for this neither
and lets clear this up too i aint got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me i even believe i
had one of those 25cent stickers on my refrigerator
right next to darth vader
and darth mustve put a hex on him for later
i feel like its my fault cause of the way that
i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor
i killed superman i killed super—
man and how ironic
that id be the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic

verse 2 eminem  dr dre
now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course its intercourse and its bisexual sex
which isnt as bad
long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after
performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by todays kids in a more derogatory way
but whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say
lets ask dr dre—dr dre what up
i got a question if i may yeah
is it gay to play puttputt golf with a friend yeah
and watch his buttbutt when he tees off yeah
but up i aint done yet
in football the quarterback yells out huthut
while he reaches in another grown mans ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant—it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in—
his teenytiny little round heinie and he didnt mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i dont need to go into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a females butt
is that gay i just need to clear things up
til then ill just walk around with a manly strut because
chorus eminem
cause i aint got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you
hi my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is rain man
verse 3 eminem  dr dre
you find me offensive i find you offensive—
shit this is the same verse i just did this
when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and
open up a whoopass canister
god damn it dre wheres the goddamn beat yeah
anyway anyway i dont know how else to put it
this is the only thing that im good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic—yup yup dont worry im on it
i got it highfive nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessicas head and walked away pfffffff
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i
grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom i
headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butterjellychickentuna sandwich
and i aint even gotta make no goddamn sense
i just did a whole song and i didnt say shit
chorus eminem
cause i aint got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you
hi my name is

my aim was not to become what i became
with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
