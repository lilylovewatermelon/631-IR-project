a never ending sentence in my head
we lay hollow in the emptiness
im too tired to push you from the bed

prechorus
no more fighting no more fighting
theres no more fighting for us

chorus
fill the void in our bed
the space between is deafening
oh we dont bend were breaking
the space between is deafening
the space between is deafening

verse 2
no ones moving we lack the courage to
we lay in stalemate wishing the other would
but were too tired we let the embers cool

prechorus
no more fighting theres no more fighting
theres no more fighting for us

chorus
fill the void in our bed
the space between is deafening
oh we dont bend were breaking
the space between is deafening
you might also likebridge
no more fighting weve given up now
silence says more than words
imagination cures loneliness
when you become a prisoner

chorus
fill the void in our bed
the space between is deafening
oh we dont bend were breaking
the space between is deafening3embed"
