i backed my chevrolet out the driveway straight to the station
filled it up with gas grabbed a bag of ice a mountain dew and a slim jim
oh and a couple of ice cold beers too
and i swung a little gravel rock burning out that parking lot
found a long dirt road and the perfect river spot
and broke out them beach chairs
and we sat down right there and i pulled out my guitar
and started strumming on it

chorus
i wrote a song bout absolutely nothing
with my toes tapping in the sand
she sang along just me and my baby humming
nothing nothing like just doing
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo

verse 2
well she was skipping rocks grabbed my seat
and i was popping tops and i popped a string
yeah man that sun mustve been a hundred degrees
oh but we had a cold river at our feet
and every now and then a cool cool breeze
we were blowing smoke with our eyes closed
neither one of us was saying a word
nah we werent saying a word we were just atouching toes every now and then
and she gave me a smile
it was beerthirty all day long all day long
see randy houser liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
and i wrote a song bout absolutely nothing
with my toes tapping in the sand
she sang along just me and my baby humming
nothing nothing like just doing
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo

tag
i wrote a song bout absolutely nothing
singin nah nah nah nah nah nah
she sang along just me and my baby humming
nothing nothing like just doing
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo
absolutely nothing whoo hoo hoo
absolutely whoo hoo hoo nothingembed"
