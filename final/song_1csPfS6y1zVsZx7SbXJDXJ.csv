youre cold like the blood that runs through your veins
ive been told
theres a black spot next to your name
you cant seem to erase
shed your skin change your face

chorus
but youre all  the same
youre all the same
shed your skin
find a better body to fit in

verse 2
i lost track of all the times you betrayed
i lost faith in the friendships i have made
drag you down and put you in your place
shed your skin change your face

chorus
shed your skin
find a better body to fit in
shed your skin
find a better body to fit inyou might also like4embed"
