im not scared of you now
or so i say
theres no reason to run
although i may
im not as sure as i seem
this much i know
what does it mean you leave and i follow

chorus
i could try to forget what you do when i let you get
through to me but then you do it over again
i could rage like a fire and youd bring rain i desire
til you get to me on my morningside

verse 2
keep my distance i tried
no use
but no matter the miles
im back to you

chorus
i could try to forget what you do when i let you get
through to me but then you do it over again
i could rage like a fire and youd bring rain i desire
til you get to me on my morningside

let me down you say never
baby blues dont you ever
im used to being one with the misfortune to find
afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
what it looks like here on my morningside
look back dont you dare let me start to do that
i dont care if the things that i have
only make me afraid to lose
i need to let go
need to want to keep letting you know
that we both have a reason to follow
long as we let this lead im barely breathing

chorus
i try to forget what you do to me but then you do it over again
i could rage like a fire and youd bring rain
til you get to me on my morningside
let me down you say never baby blues dont you ever
im used to being one with the misfortune to find
afternoons run for cover and full moons just wonder
what it looks like here on my morningside1embed"
