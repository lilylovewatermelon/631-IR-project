ill never understand  the rules of love
you said to me  true love never dies
 you said to me
now im sleeping with a memory yeah

there is a fire in my soul
burning dont you know
can you hear it on the radio
fire in my soul
out of my control
said you love me then you let me go

oh oh can you hear it on the radio
oh oh can you hear it on the radio

oh its just like a dream  youre mine
when i saw you  the very first time
you looked at me  with those eyes
you said you loved me  i believed your lies
why do you keep me hangin on the line
the love you gave me  its just a waste of time
there is a fire burning up my soul

there is a fire in my soul
burning dont you know
can you hear it on the radio
fire in my soul
out of my control
said you love me then you let me go
oh oh can you hear it on the radio
oh oh can you hear it on the radio

why do you keep me hangin on the line
the love you gave me  its just a waste of time
there is a fire burning up my soulembed"
