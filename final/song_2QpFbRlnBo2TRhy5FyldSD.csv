you and i weve been through a lot together
and i look back and i just uh i appreciate all the times thatthat we had together you know
i remember just goin down in my room and you know dealin tryna deal with some things
and youve always been there for that
always just me and you

verse 1
you and i been best friends ever since i was a young kid
everything we did where has time went
got a lot of years comin up ahead of us and ever since we met
i knew wed get somewhere but the fact is i aint really i aint really know when
i dont really know how either but i can feel the goosebumps my skin writin
ive been waitin for the moment you and i can make it happen
lot of people thinkin we aint gonna make it rappin
i aint got a problem with em though they dont even matter
we aint lookin for the people tryna say that we the baddest
no i never liked that
came a long way never did it for the money
we ever make it big ima give it to the family
lookin back now everything is lookin funny
you and i in the room writin up late when the mood strikes us
we dont care if they do like us
writin songs for the haters we aint even got yet
freestylin somebody turn the mic up
talkin bout things we dont really understand
talkin bout things we dont really comprehend
me and you tryna get it we aint quittin til the end
now im standin on stage tryna give it to the fans yah
see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeinterlude
we took that karaoke machine from my room and uh we put it up to the cd player and played the instrumentals
and man weve come a long way
a long way

verse 2
i made a lot of mistakes youve been there for the whole thing
help me with the drama
rappin in the car outside daily
we don’t care if it’s the winter we don’t care if its the summer
i remember writin raps with the curse words
i just wanna hear it seems like everybody does it
did it for awhile wasnt into all the cussin
tried to find who i was bein everything i wasnt real life yeah
got a lot of anger you know where im at put it all over the pages
and wrote it into raps said that we could be amazin
if i give us a chance now im lookin round like yeah look at where we at
look at where we at now we aint made it yet
but they can hear us in the background comin
some are gonna hate it some are gonna love it
ima put it in his hands and let god do the judgin yeah
remember me and you always had you in the backpack
took you into school writin on you like its nothin a lot of people in the room
see me scribble on a page but they aint got a clue nah they aint got a clue
we at the beginnin
hopin someday you and i can say we made it and we did it
you aint nothin but a notepad to me who you kiddin
im just runnin out of space ill be back in a minute
turn the page homie
interlude

this just started as somethin that was an escape for us you know
and now i look around and there’s a lot of people out there goin through the same things you know weve been through
