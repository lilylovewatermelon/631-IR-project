said your bars be helping my sentence we both got time to kill
youre timeless but ill b home soon
heard you getting busy 2015 but dont forget the old school
you gotta show dudes rules  regulations
like take these beats and black out like segregation
this the occupation taught me to embrace the hatred
so i come baring arms holding two straps like a mental patient
got the mental patients of a rubiks scrambler nigga
dance toe to toe with satan im a life gambler nigga
ballin out now watch me handle you niggas
pop a rapper over hip hops a crossover you can be hit records will break pull out my camera niggas
im talking like i was notorious
so you can call me christopher walken the king
a queens baby queens made me this mellow
found out the keys to life some days i lock myself in the ghetto im guilty
for being filthy with the script like xxx flicks
the trucks moving diesel im driving without a vin
keep some ice cubes to soothe my glass of gin
in the stu all i need is my crew then i begin
i mic checker like the 1st 3 jordans im retro
i never let go the fact i couldnt afford em
the reason that i grind is for my future
the reason i still rhyme is cause producers think im the rappin akuma
im in the building chillin im the super
cause in this rotten apple im still mackin like computers
consuming more liquor than coolers
shorty grabs it lick it and cools it i stab it pound it and wound it
hide the package where her stool is
since a school student i remained the truest
never back down itll just be me give a fuck who you dudes is
and even if im cool with you dont play me like im stupid
i go crazier than you could thats why i remain reclusive
when im around theres cupids heart eyes pop out her pupils
gotta love it when elo comes around with new exclusives
become a nuisance i chuck up the deuces
yall couldnt hang with me if yall had nooses im good
still kick the chair where you stood
choke as i toke tip the tip of my blunt in the trey
drinking my juice in the hood feeling myself as i should
you might also likebeen feeling like a saturday night
all day
we aint even gotta go f with the club
just kick back and chill just kick back and chill
where ever we at
we can do it
we can do that shhh
we can do it
we aint even gotta go f with the club
we can do it
we can do that shhh
we can do it
