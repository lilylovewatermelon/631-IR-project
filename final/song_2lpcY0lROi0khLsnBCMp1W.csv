yeah

verse 1
i live a chemical life
im on a mission to try
you went insane for the day
ill have to shove it away
my only option is gone
smile as they break and they fall
you want a simpler life
you cant erase what was mine

prechorus
you must be out of your mind
this was a simple design
you fuck it up every time
how could you leave me behind

chorus
its all right its all right
cause i know what you want
but youll just have to wait
if i had it to give
i would give it away
im living it up
while im falling from grace
theres no way theres no way
that im running away
