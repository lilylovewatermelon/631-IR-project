in a city of ice there are burning cathedrals
turning the skies into glass
and through echoing futures over buckling sutures
that hold shut the wounds of the past

chorus
so wont you fall for me wont you fall for me
through a fractured existence wont you fall for me
wont you fall for me from reality
to the rhythm of eternity wont you fall for me

verse 2
my insecurities surround me like lions in the den
and i feel like im losing touch with what i am again
slowly i remember why i cannot pretend
that i never think of you in all this screaming silence
oh god i wish you were here

chorus
so wont you fall for me wont you fall for me
through a fractured existence wont you fall for me
wont you fall for me from reality
to the rhythm of eternity wont you fall for me oh god i wish you were here
wont you fall for me wont you fall for me
with my love as your garden wont you fall for me
wont you fall for me from reality
i am yours in the end so wont you fall for mesee sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also like1embed"
