woke up in london yesterday
found myself in the city near piccadilly
dont really know how i got here
i got some pictures on my phone
new names and numbers that i dont know
address to places like abbey road
day turns to night night turns to whatever we want
were young enough to say

chorus
oh this has gotta be the good life
this has gotta be the good life
this could really be a good life good life
say oh got this feeling that you cant fight
like this city is on fire tonight
this could really be a good life
a good good life

verse 2
to my friends in new york i say hello
my friends in la they dont know
where ive been for the past few years or so
paris to china to colorado
sometimes theres airplanes i cant jump out
sometimes theres bullshit that dont work now
we all got our stories but please tell meeee
what theres to complain about

chorus
oh this has gotta be the good life

hopelessly i feel like there might be something that ill miss

cause hopelessly the hope is we have
so much to feel good about

chorus
