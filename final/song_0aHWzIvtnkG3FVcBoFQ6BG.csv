to hear you tell me boys like you you try too hard
to look not quite as desperate im hanging on
but i still know the way to make your makeup run

so and when it all goes to hell will you be able to tell
me sorry with a straight face
and when it all goes to hell will you be able to tell
me sorry with a straight face
