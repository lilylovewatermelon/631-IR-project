traffics all backed up
my brakes are all jacked up
well i wish i had a cold bud light in my hand
its been a months worth of hard work packed into one week
this country boys had about all he could stand
pass a billboard that says jesus is watchin you
hope somebody turns his head cause what im about to do is

chorus
im gonna turn this truck around tonight
go find me a place with beer on ice
get loose and get down with a rowdy crowd
im gonna find me a little sweet young thing
that talks with a little bit of texas twang
find me an ol dance floor and spin her around
well i sure hope that jesus aint watchin now

verse 2
ive had it up to here
my paychecks done cleared
now ive got everything i need to go and have a good time
and when my day is done
you know im gonna go find me a little bit of fun
get hemmed up somewhere with tequila salt and lime
and ive read the good book at least a time or two
ive heard all the words about everything im not supposed to do
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
but im gonna turn this truck around tonight
go find me a place with beer on ice
get loose and get down with a rowdy crowd
im gonna find me a little sweet young thing
that talks with a little bit of texas twang
find me an ol dance floor and spin her around
i sure hope that jesus aint watchin now

chorus
well im gonna turn this truck around tonight
go find me a place with cold beer on ice
get loose and get down with a rowdy crowd
im gonna find me a little sweet young thing
that talks with a little bit of texas twang
find me an ol dance floor and spin her around
yeah tonight i aint gonna quit til i hit the ground
i sure hope that jesus aint watchin now
oh he aint watchin nowembed"
