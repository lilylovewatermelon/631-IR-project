i thought by now id have it figured out
how not to make the easy thing so hard to do
i bet that id be further down this road
if i could read the signs that point me to the truth

verse 2
i never planned on being nothin but a cowboy
but somewhere i picked up this old guitar
girl all i can say is that im sorry
if i get kinda careless with your heart

chorus
all the headlights all the midnights
chasin all that empty still aint got it right
all the crazy all the gypsy
i guess all im sayin is forgive me
if i dont know what im doin
im still learnin to be human

verse 3
so far ive been good at burnin bridges
strike a match and ride right out of town
bless your heart for nevеr tryin to fix me
or quit me or slow me down

all thе headlights all the midnights
chasin all that empty still aint got it right
all the crazy all the gypsy
i guess all im sayin is forgive me
if i dont know what im doin
cause im still learnin to be human

chorus
all the highways playin outlaw
rollin outta nowhere with the brakes off
all the crazy and the whiskey
wakin up and wonderin what hit me
whoa forgive me i really dont know what im doin
cause im still learnin to be human
mm still learnin to be humanembed"
