dallas packed her suitcase
and drove off in the brand new car i bought her
she made leaving me look easy
i wish shed made it look a little harder
i took her out of texas
when she was just a girl
but old tennessee and me
couldnt take texas out of her

chorus
on how i wish dallas was in tennessee
if i could move texas east
then shed be here with me
then nothing else would come between the two of us
if dallas was in tennessee

verse 2
by now shes leaving memphis
and everything we had behind her
lord i hope the gold band on her hand
will serve as a reminder
that true love is a treasure
thats very seldom found
but you cant stay together if theres no common ground

oh how i wish dallas was in tennessee
if i could move texas east
then shed be here with me
then nothing else would come between the two of us
if dallas was in tennessee
oh if dallas was in tennessee

outro
dallas packed her suitcase
and drove off in the brand new car i bought herembed"
