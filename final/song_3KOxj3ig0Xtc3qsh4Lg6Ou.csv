is guitars that tune good and firm feelin women
i dont need my name in the marquee lights
i got my song and i got you with me tonight
maybe its time we got back to the basics of love
lets go to luckenbach texas
with waylon and willie and the boys
this successful life were livin
got us feuding like the hatfields and mccoys
between hank williams pain songs and
newburys train songs and blue eyes cryin in the rain
out in luckenbach texas aint nobody feelin no pain

so baby lets sell your diamond ring
buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
this coat and tie is choking me
in your high society you cry all day
weve been so busy keepin up with the jones
four car garage and were still building on
maybe its time we got back to the basics of love

lets go to luckenbach texas
with waylon and willie and the boys
this successful life were livin got us feudin
like the hatfield and mccoys
between hank williams pain songs and
newberrys train songs and blue eyes cryin in the rain
out in luckenbach texas aint nobody feelin no pain
