growing up i was always mamas angel
never thought id ever fall from grace
i was taught to walk with god and run from trouble
but i ran with a crowd that was bound to change my ways

chorus
yeah i was proud to be in the bad news crowd
the one my mama warned me about
the closest thing to hell shes ever raised
but when i look back on those days
i know id never change a thing
i made mistakes that paved the way for the man i am today
im proud of em all
and i had a ball
bending the rules and breaking the law

verse 2
we were bad about sneaking out and shooting road signs
throwing eggs and rolling every yard in town
yeah my claim to fame was a babe ruth swing on a mailbox
yeahthe police just loved driving me around

chorus
yeah i was proud to be in the bad news crowd
the one my mama warned me about
the closest thing to hell shes ever raised
but when i look back on those days
i know id never change a thing
i made mistakes that paved the way for the man i am today
im proud of em all
and i had a ball
bending the rules and breaking the law

you learn to walk the way you talk
and dui means sol
respect is earned
you live and learn to pray

chorus
yeah i was proud to be in the bad news crowd
the one my mama warned me about
the closest thing to hell shes ever raised
but when i look back on those days
i know id never change a thing
i made mistakes that paved the way for the man i am today
im proud of em all
and i had a ball
bending the rules and breaking the lawembed"
