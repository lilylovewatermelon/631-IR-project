it was lookin like a good day
87 and a clear blue sky
we were strollin down 30a
koozy wrapped around a bud light lime
we were walkin you started talkin
sayin i aint in your longterm plans
i knew we were on the rocks but baby i never thought
you would bury me in the sand

chorus
whyd you have to
break it on a beach drop me like a bobber
now every time i see white sand blue water
im sittin there missin your body
when i oughta be gettin on my party
now i cant drink piña colodas
thats what i always got us
i just wish youda done it somewhere i dont love to be
if you had to break my heart
baby whyd you have to break it on a beach

verse 2
girl i wish your mama taught you
when and where to go to say goodbye
coulda took me to the city
maybe up on a mountain where its cold as ice
but you did it where people visit
when they need a piece of paradise
this has been my place since spring break 08
nah baby it just aint right

whyd you have to
break it on a beach drop me like a bobber
now every time i see white sand blue water
im sittin there missin your body
when i oughta be gettin on my party
now i cant drink piña colodas
thats what i always got us
i just wish youda done it somewhere i dont love to be
if you had to break my heart
baby whyd you have to break it on a beach

bridge
baby whyd you have to
break it on a beach right here in the sand
sun up in the sky cold one in my hand
i know its crazy woah
thought it was a vacation but no

chorus
whyd you have to
break it on a beach drop me like a bobber
now every time i see white sand blue water
im sittin there missin your body
when i oughta be gettin on my party
now i cant drink piña colodas
thats what i always got us
i just wish youda done it somewhere i dont love to be
if you had to break my heart
baby whyd you have to break it on a beach
outro
whyd you have to break it on a beach
white sand a cold beer in my handembed"
