you can see me at the top looking down screaming what now
tell them throw the towel they could never put the squad down
switching back to me im rolling blunts just because the sun out
if i dont let her hit my weed shell sit there an pout
what she want when im on my feet i got her looking up
pull up to the scene she look so good i let you look at her
squad coming up saying wulf you know we fuck wit ya
i say same to you i shake a hand an tell em roll it up
money man shawty but i dont brag that aint my character
you can do the math i failed that class but im still counting up
shout out ms malone she tried to help but i aint give a fuck
i was ditchin school wit ta tryna stack it up
5 dollar reggie blunts seeds in my old house
shout out to lil rari cause i know what he talking bout
i used to do the same i aint ashamed boy ill point it out
now im down in cali smoking better out a gong ounce
wifi kush because the smell reach anotha house
i dont give a fuck about who mad i leave um locked out

switching back to us my whole squad got a blunt now
dont ask me for nothing i tell a hating fool to figure it out
nowadays i see what my grandpa was talking bout
switching back to me im at the table finna play it out
