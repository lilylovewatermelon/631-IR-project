a cold beers got twelve ounces
a good trucks got maybe three hundred thousand
you only get so much until its gone
duracells in a maglite
a needle drop on a fortyfive
are the kinda things that only last so long

prechorus
when the new wears off and they get to gettin old
sooner or later times gonna take its toll

chorus
they say nothing lasts forever
but they aint seen us together
or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
just a tshirt in the kitchen
with no makeup and a million
other things that i could look at my whole life
a love like that makes a man have second thoughts
maybe some things last forever after all

verse 2
the fm station on the outskirts
blue jeans after years of shift work
all fadin out like i always knew they would
the strings on this guitar
the first love lost on a young heart
those things are gonna break after the gettings good
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likeprechorus
cause the new wears off and they get to gettin old
yeah sooner or later times gonna take its toll

chorus
they say nothing lasts forever
but they aint seen us together
or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
just a tshirt in the kitchen
with no makeup and a million
other things that i could look at my whole life
a love like that makes a man have second thoughts
maybe some things last forever after all

guitar solo

chorus
they say nothing lasts forever
but they aint seen us together
or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
and i know therell be that moment
the good lord calls one of us home and
one wont have the other by their side
but heaven knows it that wont last too long
maybe some things last forever after all
