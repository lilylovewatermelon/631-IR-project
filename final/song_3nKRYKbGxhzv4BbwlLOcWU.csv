insidious is blind inception
whats reality with all these questions
feels like i missed my alarm and slept in
slept in
broken legs but i chase perfection
these walls are my blank expression
my mind is a home im trapped in
and its lonely inside this mansion

verse 1 nf
yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
written all over the floors all over the chairs
and you get the uncut version of life when i go downstairs
thats where i write when im in a bad place and need to release
and let out the version of nf you dont wanna see
i put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
you might get a glimpse of how i cope with all this anger in me
physically abused now thats the room that i dont wanna be in
that picture aint blurry at all i just dont wanna see it
and these walls aint blank i just think i dont wanna see em
but why not im in here so i might as well read em
i gotta thank you for this anger that i carry around
wish i could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
matter of fact i think ima burn this room right now
somehow this memory for some reason just wont burn down
you used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
then took me downstairs and beat me till i screamed and i cried
congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
but ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

and its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion

verse 2 nf
yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
see my problem is i dont fix things i just try to repaint
cover em up like it never happened say i wish i could change
are you confused come upstairs and ill show you what i mean
this rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
the moment i walk into its the same moment that i wanna leave
i get sick to my stomach every time i look at these things
but its hard to look past when this is the room where i sleep
i look around one of the worst things i wrote on these walls
was the moment i realized that i was losing my mom
one of the first things i wrote was i wish i woulda called
but i should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
and i regret the fact that i struggled trying to find who i am
and i lie to myself and say i do the best that i can
shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
then get ticked off whenever i see it affecting my plans
and i regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
and at the rate im goin theyll probably still be there when i die
congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
the question is will i ever clean the walls off in time
chorus fleurie

verse 3 nf
so this part of my house no ones been in it for years
i built a safe room and i dont let no one in there
cause if i do theres a chance that they might disappear
and not come back and i admit i am emotionally scared
to let anyone inside so i just leave my doors locked
you might get other doors to open up but this doors not
cause i dont want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
and ill be the only person that i can blame when you desert me
im barricaded inside so stop watchin
im not coming to the door so stop knockin stop knockin
im trapped here god keeps saying im not locked in
i chose this i am lost in my own conscience
i know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
but i didnt build this house because i thought it would solve em
i built it because i thought that it was safer in there
but its not im not the only thing thats livin in here
fear came to my house years ago i let him in
maybe thats the problem cause ive been dealing with this ever since
i thought that he would leave but its obvious he never did
he must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
now im in a position its either sit here and let em win
or put him back outside where he came from but i never can
cause in order to do that id have to open the doors
is that me or the fear talking i dont know anymore
outro nf  fleurie
its lonely
inside inside inside inside
its lonely its lonely
oh yeah its lonely
inside this mansion103embed"
