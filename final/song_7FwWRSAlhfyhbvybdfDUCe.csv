can we just be honest
these are the requirements
if you think you can be my one and only true love
you must promise to love me
and damn it if you fuck me over
i will rip your fuckin face apart

verse 1
step one
you must accept that im a little out my mind
step two
this is a waste if you cant walk me down the finish line
step three
give me passion dont make fun of my fashion
step four
give me more give me more more

prechorus
if you cant handle a heart like mine
dont waste your time with me
if youre not down to bleed no oh
if you cant handle the chokin the bitin
the lovin the smotherin
til you cant handle it no more no more
go home
