a certain kind of light
that never shone on me
i want my life to be lived with you
theres a way everybody say
to do each and every little thing
but what good does it bring
if i aint got you

you dont know what its like
baby you dont know what its like
to love somebody to love somebody
the way i love you

in my pain i see your face again
its burning in my mind
you aint got to be so blind that im alive
im a woman cant you see what i am
i live and breathe for you
but what good does it do if i aint got you
if i aint got yousee bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
