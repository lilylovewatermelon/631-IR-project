is you at two keys or tin roof
turn up with young tiller we just gettin loose
maybe im lowkey feelin you dont be cynical
won’t fuck you over wanna fuck you over and again
the truth is i aint really here to start problems
girl i swear to god them hoes cant never say they got him
know how bad you wanna tell em dont try him
i dont wanna tell em lets surprise em
i dont wanna get into it – why you stressin him
ive been drivin back and forth from louisville to lexington mileage
on the whip got your ass in my grip
college make you wanna strip for them dollars
nah girl i got a job for you swear to god i can do a lot for you
saw you strollin through the campus i had to stop for you
i was scrollin through the gram girl i had to follow you
say whats up with you
outro
you got my soul142embed"
