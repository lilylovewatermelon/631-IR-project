tonight we are victorious
champagne pouring over us
all my friends were glorious
tonight we are victorious
ohohohoh victorious
ohohohohoh
verse 1
double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
skin as cool as steve mcqueen let me be your killer king
it hurts until it stops we will love until its not
im a killing spree in white eyes like broken christmas lights

prechorus
my touch is black and poisonous
and nothing like my punchdrunk kiss
i know you need it do you feel it
drink the water drink the wine

chorus
oh we gotta turn up the crazy
livin like a washedup celebrity
shooting fireworks like its the fourth of july
until we feel alright
until we feel alright

im like a scarf trick its all up the sleeve
i taste like magic waves that swallow quick and deep
throw the bait catch the shark bleed the water red
fifty words for murder and im every one of them

prechorus
my touch is black and poisonous
and nothing like my punchdrunk kiss
i know you need it do you feel it
drink the water drink the wine

chorus
oh we gotta turn up the crazy
livin like a washedup celebrity
shooting fireworks like its the fourth of july

bridge
tonight we are victorious
champagne pouring over us
all my friends were glorious
tonight we are victorious
tonight we are victorious
champagne pouring over us
all my friends were glorious
tonight we are victorious
chorus
oh we gotta turn up the crazy
livin like a washedup celebrity
shooting fireworks like its the fourth of july
until we feel alright
until we feel alright
