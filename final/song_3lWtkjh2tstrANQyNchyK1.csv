look
oh look at what youve done now to me
dead tired and ornery
im leaving today today
thinking of the way i used to spend the time
i can see that i have overpaid
past is passed and rather than regret the old
i can live it back the other way

verse 2
just look
oh look at what youve done now to me
free floating temporally
im leaving today today
i avoid the messiness of misery
playing in dimension number four
i can get away to any time i like
spacetimes any time and many more

chorus
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
but you can make ever wait for you
do what you want to do
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
youll have time enough to spend some time alone

wait
i await for all eternity
withstanding modernity
is where we must stay today
now i know the nature of no urgency
now i know why now is never gone
fleeting in this mode of making memories
keeping up this pace of keeping on

chorus
ooh live the dream in a time machine
youve been waiting forever
but you can make ever wait for you
do what you want to do
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
youll have time enough to spend some time alone
all alone
im alone
im alone
outro
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
ooh live the dream with a time machine
ahahahah
ooh live the dream with a time machine
youve been waiting forever
ooh live the dream with a time machine
ahahahah10embed"
