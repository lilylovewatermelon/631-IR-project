i bought a harvard sweatshirt off the goodwill rack
makes some people wonder if im smart like that
and that guitar layin on the chair is worn out like my boots
makes it look like i can play it better than i do

chorus
but nobody buys it when we walk in
they say there aint no way that shes with him
in a world where nothing is what it seems
aint no one more surprised than me

verse 2
its funny how some strangers like to size me up
this attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
i can tell em ive got pirate blood or ancient royalty
thеres no end to the liеs that i could get em to believe

chorus
but nobody buys it when we walk in
they say there aint no way that shes with him
in a world where nothing is what it seems
aint no one more surprised than me

instrumental break
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
mustve done somethin right
somethin right
in another life

chorus
cause nobody buys it when we walk in
they say there aint no way that she could be with him
in a world where nothing is what it seems
aint no one more surprised than me
oh aint no one more surprised than meembed"
