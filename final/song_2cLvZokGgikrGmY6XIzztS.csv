i doubt that your phone was dying
im supposed to believe that was what you wore
said you were alone i dont buy it
now i cant stay

surrounded by every lie that wont come true
now you wanna take the time now why would you
think youre gonna make it right but how could you
so i cant stay surrounded by surrounded by every lie

you might as well just stop crying
it doesnt mean much to me anymore
a little too late to start trying
im taking this love off of life support
now i cant stay

surrounded by every lie that wont come true
now you wanna take the time now why would you
think youre gonna make it right but how could you
so i cant stay surrounded by surrounded by every lie

surrounded by every lie that wont come true
now you wanna take the time now why would you
think youre gonna make it right but how could you
so i cant stay surrounded by surrounded by every lie
you might also liketrying to undo the love that im tied to
who havent you lied to

with every lie that wont come true
now you wanna take the time now why would you
think youre gonna make it right but how could you
so i cant stay surrounded by surrounded by every lie

every lie that wont come true
now you wanna take the time now why would you
think youre gonna make it right but how could you
so i cant stay surrounded by
