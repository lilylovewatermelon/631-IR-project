nine in the morning the man drops his kids off at school
and hes thinking of you like all of us do
sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
around 132 like he knows what to do

shes the first one that i see and i dont know why
i dont know who she is she she

and not telling his mates not telling his mates
