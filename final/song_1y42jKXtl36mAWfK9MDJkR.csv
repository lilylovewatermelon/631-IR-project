petitioner sony corp manufactures home video tape recorders vtrs and markets them through retail establishments some of which are also petitioners respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves respondents brought an action against petitioners in federal district court alleging that vtr consumers had been recording some of respondents copyrighted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and thereby infringed respondents copyrights and further that petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the vtrs respondents sought money damages an equitable accounting of profits and an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of the vtrs the district court denied respondents all relief holding that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright infringement and that petitioners could not be held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a vtr was considered an infringing use the court of appeals reversed holding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the district court to fashion appropriate relief

held

the sale of the vtrs to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondents copyrights pp 428456

a the protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory and in a case like this in which congress has not plainly marked the course to be followed by the judiciary this court must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a statute that never contemplated such a calculus of interests any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a fair use the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use pp 428434
b kalem co v harper brothers 222 us 55  does not support respondents novel theory that supplying the means to accomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement this case does not fall in the category of those in which it is manifestly just to 464 us 417 418   impose vicarious liability because the contributory infringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright owner here the only contact between petitioners and the users of the vtrs occurred at the moment of sale and there is no precedent for imposing vicarious liability on the theory that petitioners sold the vtrs with constructive knowledge that their customers might use the equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material the sale of copying equipment like the sale of other articles of commerce does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate unobjectionable purposes or indeed is merely capable of substantial noninfringing uses pp 434442
c the record and the district courts findings show 1 that there is a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcast timeshifted by private viewers i e recorded at a time when the vtr owner cannot view the broadcast so that it can be watched at a later time and 2 that there is no likelihood that timeshifting would cause nonminimal harm to the potential market for or the value of respondents copyrighted works the vtrs are therefore capable of substantial noninfringing uses private noncommercial timeshifting in the home satisfies this standard of noninfringing uses both because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing such timeshifting for their programs and because the district courts findings reveal that even the unauthorized home timeshifting of respondents programs is legitimate fair use pp 442456

justice stevens delivered the opinion of the court

petitioners manufacture and sell home video tape recorders respondents own the copyrights on some of the television 464 us 417 420   programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves some members of the general public use video tape recorders sold by petitioners to record some of these broadcasts as well as a large number of other broadcasts the question presented is whether the sale of petitioners copying equipment to the general public violates any of the rights conferred upon respondents by the copyright act

respondents commenced this copyright infringement action against petitioners in the united states district court for the central district of california in 1976 respondents alleged that some individuals had used betamax video tape recorders vtrs to record some of respondents copyrighted works which had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and contended that these individuals had thereby infringed respondents copyrights respondents further maintained that petitioners were liable for the copyright infringement allegedly committed by betamax consumers because of petitioners marketing of the betamax vtrs 1 respondents sought no relief against any betamax consumer instead they sought money damages and an equitable accounting of profits from petitioners as well as an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of betamax vtrs

after a lengthy trial the district court denied respondents all the relief they sought and entered judgment for petitioners 480 f supp 429 1979 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district courts judgment on respondents copyright claim holding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the district court to fashion appropriate relief 659 f2d 963 464 us 417 421   1981 we granted certiorari 457 us 1116 1982 since we had not completed our study of the case last term we ordered reargument 463 us 1226 1983 we now reverse

an explanation of our rejection of respondents unprecedented attempt to impose copyright liability upon the distributors of copying equipment requires a quite detailed recitation of the findings of the district court in summary those findings reveal that the average member of the public uses a vtr principally to record a program he cannot view as it is being televised and then to watch it once at a later time this practice known as timeshifting enlarges the television viewing audience for that reason a significant amount of television programming may be used in this manner without objection from the owners of the copyrights on the programs for the same reason even the two respondents in this case who do assert objections to timeshifting in this litigation were unable to prove that the practice has impaired the commercial value of their copyrights or has created any likelihood of future harm given these findings there is no basis in the copyright act upon which respondents can hold petitioners liable for distributing vtrs to the general public the court of appeals holding that respondents are entitled to enjoin the distribution of vtrs to collect royalties on the sale of such equipment or to obtain other relief if affirmed would enlarge the scope of respondents statutory monopolies to encompass control over an article of commerce that is not the subject of copyright protection such an expansion of the copyright privilege is beyond the limits of the grants authorized by congress

i
the two respondents in this action universal city studios inc and walt disney productions produce and hold the copyrights on a substantial number of motion pictures and other audiovisual works in the current marketplace they can exploit their rights in these works in a number of ways 464 us 417 422   by authorizing theatrical exhibitions by licensing limited showings on cable and network television by selling syndication rights for repeated airings on local television stations and by marketing programs on prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs some works are suitable for exploitation through all of these avenues while the market for other works is more limited

petitioner sony manufactures millions of betamax video tape recorders and markets these devices through numerous retail establishments some of which are also petitioners in this action 2 sonys betamax vtr is a mechanism consisting of three basic components 1 a tuner which receives electromagnetic signals transmitted over the television band of the public airwaves and separates them into audio and visual signals 2 a recorder which records such signals on a magnetic tape and 3 an adapter which converts the audio and visual signals on the tape into a composite signal that can be received by a television set

several capabilities of the machine are noteworthy the separate tuner in the betamax enables it to record a broadcast off one station while the television set is tuned to another channel permitting the viewer for example to watch two simultaneous news broadcasts by watching one live and recording the other for later viewing tapes may be reused and programs that have been recorded may be erased either before or after viewing a timer in the betamax can be used to activate and deactivate the equipment at predetermined 464 us 417 423   times enabling an intended viewer to record programs that are transmitted when he or she is not at home thus a person may watch a program at home in the evening even though it was broadcast while the viewer was at work during the afternoon the betamax is also equipped with a pause button and a fastforward control the pause button when depressed deactivates the recorder until it is released thus enabling a viewer to omit a commercial advertisement from the recording provided of course that the viewer is present when the program is recorded the fastforward control enables the viewer of a previously recorded program to run the tape rapidly when a segment he or she does not desire to see is being played back on the television screen

the respondents and sony both conducted surveys of the way the betamax machine was used by several hundred owners during a sample period in 1978 although there were some differences in the surveys they both showed that the primary use of the machine for most owners was timeshifting  the practice of recording a program to view it once at a later time and thereafter erasing it timeshifting enables viewers to see programs they otherwise would miss because they are not at home are occupied with other tasks or are viewing a program on another station at the time of a broadcast that they desire to watch both surveys also showed however that a substantial number of interviewees had accumulated libraries of tapes 3 sonys survey indicated 464 us 417 424   that over 80 of the interviewees watched at least as much regular television as they had before owning a betamax 4 respondents offered no evidence of decreased television viewing by betamax owners 5

sony introduced considerable evidence describing television programs that could be copied without objection from any copyright holder with special emphasis on sports religious and educational programming for example their survey indicated that 73 of all betamax use is to record sports events and representatives of professional baseball football basketball and hockey testified that they had no objection to the recording of their televised events for home use 6   464 us 417 425

respondents offered opinion evidence concerning the future impact of the unrestricted sale of vtrs on the commercial value of their copyrights the district court found however that they had failed to prove any likelihood of future harm from the use of vtrs for timeshifting 480 f supp at 469

the district courts decision
the lengthy trial of the case in the district court concerned the private home use of vtrs for recording programs broadcast on the public airwaves without charge to the viewer 7 no issue concerning the transfer of tapes to other persons the use of homerecorded tapes for public performances or the copying of programs transmitted on pay or cable television systems was raised see id at 432433 442

the district court concluded that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright infringement it emphasized the fact that the material was broadcast free to the public at large the noncommercial character of the use and the private character of the activity conducted entirely within the home moreover the court found that the purpose of this use served the public interest in increasing access to television programming an interest that is consistent with the first amendment policy of providing the fullest possible access to information through the public airwaves columbia broadcasting system inc v democratic national committee 412 us 94 102  id at 454 8 even when an entire copyrighted work was recorded 464 us 417 426   the district court regarded the copying as fair use because there is no accompanying reduction in the market for plaintiffs original work ibid

as an independent ground of decision the district court also concluded that sony could not be held liable as a contributory infringer even if the home use of a vtr was considered an infringing use the district court noted that sony had no direct involvement with any betamax purchasers who recorded copyrighted works off the air sonys advertising was silent on the subject of possible copyright infringement but its instruction booklet contained the following statement

television programs films videotapes and other materials may be copyrighted unauthorized recording of such material may be contrary to the provisions of the united states copyright laws id at 436
the district court assumed that sony had constructive knowledge of the probability that the betamax machine would be used to record copyrighted programs but found that sony merely sold a product capable of a variety of uses some of them allegedly infringing id at 461 it reasoned
selling a staple article of commerce  e g a typewriter a recorder a camera a photocopying machine  technically contributes to any infringing use subsequently made thereof but this kind of contribution if deemed sufficient as a basis for liability would expand the theory beyond precedent and arguably beyond judicial management
   
   commerce would indeed be hampered if manufacturers of staple items were held liable as contributory infringers whenever they constructively knew that some purchasers on some occasions would use their product 464 us 417 427   for a purpose which a court later deemed as a matter of first impression to be an infringement ibid
finally the district court discussed the respondents prayer for injunctive relief noting that they had asked for an injunction either preventing the future sale of betamax machines or requiring that the machines be rendered incapable of recording copyrighted works off the air the court stated that it had found no case in which the manufacturers distributors retailers and advertisers of the instrument enabling the infringement were sued by the copyright holders and that the request for relief in this case is unique id at 465
it concluded that an injunction was wholly inappropriate because any possible harm to respondents was outweighed by the fact that the betamax could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted material or material whose owners consented to the copying an injunction would deprive the public of the ability to use the betamax for this noninfringing offtheair recording id at 468

the court of appeals decision

the court of appeals reversed the district courts judgment on respondents copyright claim it did not set aside any of the district courts findings of fact rather it concluded as a matter of law that the home use of a vtr was not a fair use because it was not a productive use 9 it therefore held that it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to prove any harm to the potential market for the copyrighted works but then observed that it seemed clear that the cumulative effect of mass reproduction made possible by vtrs would tend to diminish the potential market for respondents works 659 f2d at 974 464 us 417 428

on the issue of contributory infringement the court of appeals first rejected the analogy to staple articles of commerce such as tape recorders or photocopying machines it noted that such machines may have substantial benefit for some purposes and do not even remotely raise copyright problems id at 975 vtrs however are sold for the primary purpose of reproducing television programming and virtually all such programming is copyrighted material ibid the court of appeals concluded therefore that vtrs were not suitable for any substantial noninfringing use even if some copyright owners elect not to enforce their rights

the court of appeals also rejected the district courts reliance on sonys lack of knowledge that home use constituted infringement assuming that the statutory provisions defining the remedies for infringement applied also to the nonstatutory tort of contributory infringement the court stated that a defendants good faith would merely reduce his damages liability but would not excuse the infringing conduct it held that sony was chargeable with knowledge of the homeowners infringing activity because the reproduction of copyrighted materials was either the most conspicuous use or the major use of the betamax product ibid

on the matter of relief the court of appeals concluded that statutory damages may be appropriate and that the district court should reconsider its determination that an injunction would not be an appropriate remedy and referring to the analogous photocopying area suggested that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory license may very well be an acceptable resolution of the relief issue id at 976

article i 8 of the constitution provides
the congress shall have power    to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries 464 us 417 429
the monopoly privileges that congress may authorize are neither unlimited nor primarily designed to provide a special private benefit rather the limited grant is a means by which an important public purpose may be achieved it is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired
the copyright law like the patent statutes makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration in fox film corp v doyal 286 us 123 127  chief justice hughes spoke as follows respecting the copyright monopoly granted by congress the sole interest of the united states and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors it is said that reward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius united states v paramount pictures inc 334 us 131 158 1948
as the text of the constitution makes plain it is congress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors or to inventors in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product because this task involves a difficult balance between the interests of authors and inventors in the control and exploitation of their writings and discoveries on the one hand and societys competing interest in the free flow of ideas information and commerce on the other hand our patent and copyright statutes have been amended repeatedly 10   464 us 417 430
from its beginning the law of copyright has developed in response to significant changes in technology 11 indeed it was the invention of a new form of copying equipment  the printing press  that gave rise to the original need for copyright protection 12 repeatedly as new developments have 464 us 417 431   occurred in this country it has been the congress that has fashioned the new rules that new technology made necessary thus long before the enactment of the copyright act of 1909 35 stat 1075 it was settled that the protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory wheaton v peters 8 pet 591 661662 1834 the remedies for infringement are only those prescribed by congress thompson v hubbard 131 us 123 151 1889

the judiciarys reluctance to expand the protections afforded by the copyright without explicit legislative guidance is a recurring theme see e g teleprompter corp v columbia broadcasting system inc 415 us 394 1974 fortnightly corp v united artists television inc 392 us 390 1968 whitesmith music publishing co v apollo co 209 us 1 1908 williams  wilkins co v united states 203 ct cl 74 487 f2d 1345 1973 affd by an equally divided court 420 us 376 1975 sound policy as well as history supports our consistent deference to congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology

in a case like this in which congress has not plainly marked our course we must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a legislative enactment which never contemplated such a calculus of interests in doing so we are guided by justice stewarts exposition of the correct approach to ambiguities in the law of copyright

the limited scope of the copyright holders statutory monopoly like the limited copyright duration required by the constitution reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest creative work is to be 464 us 417 432   encouraged and rewarded but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature music and the other arts the immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an authors creative labor but the ultimate aim is by this incentive to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good the sole interest of the united states and the primary object in conferring the monopoly this court has said lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors fox film corp v doyal 286 us 123 127  see kendall v winsor 21 how 322 327328 grant v raymond 6 pet 218 241242 when technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous the copyright act must be construed in light of this basic purpose twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us 151 156 1975 footnotes omitted
copyright protection subsists    in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression 17 usc 102a 1982 ed this protection has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work 13 rather the copyright act grants the 464 us 417 433   copyright holder exclusive rights to use and to authorize the use of his work in five qualified ways including reproduction of the copyrighted work in copies 106 14 all reproductions of the work however are not within the exclusive domain of the copyright owner some are in the public domain any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a fair use the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use compare 106 with 107
anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner that is anyone who trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted work in one of the five ways set forth in the statute is an infringer of the copyright 501a conversely anyone who is authorized by the copyright owner to use the copyrighted work in a way specified in the statute or who makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use
the copyright act provides the owner of a copyright with a potent arsenal of remedies against an infringer of his work including an injunction to restrain the infringer from violating 464 us 417 434   his rights the impoundment and destruction of all reproductions of his work made in violation of his rights a recovery of his actual damages and any additional profits realized by the infringer or a recovery of statutory damages and attorneys fees 502505 15
the two respondents in this case do not seek relief against the betamax users who have allegedly infringed their copyrights moreover this is not a class action on behalf of all copyright owners who license their works for television broadcast and respondents have no right to invoke whatever rights other copyright holders may have to bring infringement actions based on betamax copying of their works 16 as was made clear by their own evidence the copying of the respondents programs represents a small portion of the total use of vtrs it is however the taping of respondents own copyrighted programs that provides them with standing to charge sony with contributory infringement to prevail they have the burden of proving that users of the betamax have infringed their copyrights and that sony should be held responsible for that infringement

iii
the copyright act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another in contrast the 464 us 417 435   patent act expressly brands anyone who actively induces infringement of a patent as an infringer 35 usc 271b and further imposes liability on certain individuals labeled contributory infringers 271c the absence of such express language in the copyright statute does not preclude the imposition of liability for copyright infringements on certain parties who have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity 17 for vicarious liability is imposed in virtually all areas of the law and the concept of contributory infringement is merely a species of the broader problem of identifying the circumstances in which it is just to hold one individual accountable for the actions of another

such circumstances were plainly present in kalem co v harper brothers 222 us 55 1911 the copyright decision of this court on which respondents place their principal reliance in kalem the court held that the producer of an unauthorized film dramatization of the copyrighted book ben hur was liable for his sale of the motion picture to jobbers who in turn arranged for the commercial exhibition of the film justice holmes writing for the court explained

the defendant not only expected but invoked by advertisement the use of its films for dramatic reproduction 464 us 417 436   of the story that was the most conspicuous purpose for which they could be used and the one for which especially they were made if the defendant did not contribute to the infringement it is impossible to do so except by taking part in the final act it is liable on principles recognized in every part of the law id at 6263
the use for which the item sold in kalem had been especially made was of course to display the performance that had already been recorded upon it the producer had personally appropriated the copyright owners protected work and as the owner of the tangible medium of expression upon which the protected work was recorded authorized that use by his sale of the film to jobbers but that use of the film was not his to authorize the copyright owner possessed the exclusive right to authorize public performances of his work further the producer personally advertised the unauthorized public performances dispelling any possible doubt as to the use of the film which he had authorized
respondents argue that kalem stands for the proposition that supplying the means to accomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement this argument rests on a gross generalization that cannot withstand scrutiny the producer in kalem did not merely provide the means to accomplish an infringing activity the producer supplied the work itself albeit in a new medium of expression sony in the instant case does not supply betamax consumers with respondents works respondents do sony supplies a piece of equipment that is generally capable of copying the entire range of programs that may be televised those that are uncopyrighted those that are copyrighted but may be copied without objection from the copyright holder and those that the copyright holder would prefer not to have copied the betamax can be used to 464 us 417 437   make authorized or unauthorized uses of copyrighted works but the range of its potential use is much broader than the particular infringing use of the film ben hur involved in kalem kalem does not support respondents novel theory of liability

justice holmes stated that the producer had contributed to the infringement of the copyright and the label contributory infringement has been applied in a number of lower court copyright cases involving an ongoing relationship between the direct infringer and the contributory infringer at the time the infringing conduct occurred in such cases as in other situations in which the imposition of vicarious liability is manifestly just the contributory infringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright owner 18 this case however plainly does not fall 464 us 417 438   in that category the only contact between sony and the users of the betamax that is disclosed by this record occurred at the moment of sale the district court expressly found that no employee of sony sonam or ddbi had either direct involvement with the allegedly infringing activity or direct contact with purchasers of betamax who recorded copyrighted works offtheair 480 f supp at 460 and it further found that there was no evidence that any of the copies made by griffiths or the other individual witnesses in this suit were influenced or encouraged by sonys advertisements ibid 464 us 417 439

if vicarious liability is to be imposed on sony in this case it must rest on the fact that it has sold equipment with constructive knowledge of the fact that its customers may use that equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material there is no precedent in the law of copyright for the imposition of vicarious liability on such a theory the closest analogy is provided by the patent law cases to which it is appropriate to refer because of the historic kinship between patent law and copyright law 19   464 us 417 440

in the patent act both the concept of infringement and the concept of contributory infringement are expressly defined by statute 20 the prohibition against contributory infringement is confined to the knowing sale of a component especially made for use in connection with a particular patent there is no suggestion in the statute that one patentee may object to the sale of a product that might be used in connection with other patents moreover the act expressly provides that the sale of a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use is not contributory infringement 35 usc 271c

when a charge of contributory infringement is predicated entirely on the sale of an article of commerce that is used by the purchaser to infringe a patent the public interest in access to that article of commerce is necessarily implicated a 464 us 417 441   finding of contributory infringement does not of course remove the article from the market altogether it does however give the patentee effective control over the sale of that item indeed a finding of contributory infringement is normally the functional equivalent of holding that the disputed article is within the monopoly granted to the patentee 21

for that reason in contributory infringement cases arising under the patent laws the court has always recognized the critical importance of not allowing the patentee to extend his monopoly beyond the limits of his specific grant these cases deny the patentee any right to control the distribution of unpatented articles unless they are unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use dawson chemical co v rohm  hass co 448 us 176 198 1980 unless a commodity has no use except through practice of the patented method id at 199 the patentee has no right to claim that its distribution constitutes contributory infringement to form the basis for contributory infringement the item must almost be uniquely suited as a component of the patented invention p rosenberg patent law fundamentals 17022 2d ed 1982 a sale of an article which though adapted to an infringing use is also adapted to other and lawful uses is not enough to make the seller a contributory infringer such a rule would block the wheels of commerce henry v a b dick co 224 us 1 48 1912 overruled on other grounds 464 us 417 442   motion picture patents co v universal film mfg co 243 us 502 517 1917

we recognize there are substantial differences between the patent and copyright laws but in both areas the contributory infringement doctrine is grounded on the recognition that adequate protection of a monopoly may require the courts to look beyond actual duplication of a device or publication to the products or activities that make such duplication possible the staple article of commerce doctrine must strike a balance between a copyright holders legitimate demand for effective  not merely symbolic  protection of the statutory monopoly and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce accordingly the sale of copying equipment like the sale of other articles of commerce does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate unobjectionable purposes indeed it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses

iv
the question is thus whether the betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses in order to resolve that question we need not explore all the different potential uses of the machine and determine whether or not they would constitute infringement rather we need only consider whether on the basis of the facts as found by the district court a significant number of them would be noninfringing moreover in order to resolve this case we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant for one potential use of the betamax plainly satisfies this standard however it is understood private noncommercial timeshifting in the home it does so both a because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for their programs and b because the district courts factual findings reveal that even the unauthorized home timeshifting of respondents programs is legitimate fair use 464 us 417 443

a authorized timeshifting

each of the respondents owns a large inventory of valuable copyrights but in the total spectrum of television programming their combined market share is small the exact percentage is not specified but it is well below 10 22 if they were to prevail the outcome of this litigation would have a significant impact on both the producers and the viewers of the remaining 90 of the programming in the nation no doubt many other producers share respondents concern about the possible consequences of unrestricted copying nevertheless the findings of the district court make it clear that timeshifting may enlarge the total viewing audience and that many producers are willing to allow private timeshifting to continue at least for an experimental time period 23

the district court found

even if it were deemed that homeuse recording of copyrighted material constituted infringement the betamax could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted material or material whose owners consented to the copying an injunction would deprive the public of the ability to use the betamax for this noninfringing offtheair recording 464 us 417 444
defendants introduced considerable testimony at trial about the potential for such copying of sports religious educational and other programming this included testimony from representatives of the offices of the commissioners of the national football basketball baseball and hockey leagues and associations the executive director of national religious broadcasters and various educational communications agencies plaintiffs attack the weight of the testimony offered and also contend that an injunction is warranted because infringing uses outweigh noninfringing uses
whatever the future percentage of legal versus illegal homeuse recording might be an injunction which seeks to deprive the public of the very tool or article of commerce capable of some noninfringing use would be an extremely harsh remedy as well as one unprecedented in copyright law 480 f supp at 468
although the district court made these statements in the context of considering the propriety of injunctive relief the statements constitute a finding that the evidence concerning sports religious educational and other programming was sufficient to establish a significant quantity of broadcasting whose copying is now authorized and a significant potential for future authorized copying that finding is amply supported by the record in addition to the religious and sports officials identified explicitly by the district court 24 two items in the record deserve specific mention 464 us 417 445
first is the testimony of john kenaston the station manager of channel 58 an educational station in los angeles affiliated with the public broadcasting service he explained and authenticated the stations published guide to its programs 25 for each program the guide tells whether unlimited home taping is authorized home taping is authorized subject to certain restrictions such as erasure within seven days or home taping is not authorized at all the spring 1978 edition of the guide described 107 programs sixtytwo of those programs or 58 authorize some home taping twentyone of them or almost 20 authorize unrestricted home taping 26

second is the testimony of fred rogers president of the corporation that produces and owns the copyright on mister rogers neighborhood the program is carried by more public television stations than any other program its audience numbers over 3000000 families a day he testified that he had absolutely no objection to home taping for noncommercial use and expressed the opinion that it is a real service to families to be able to record childrens programs and to show them at appropriate times 27   464 us 417 446

if there are millions of owners of vtrs who make copies of televised sports events religious broadcasts and educational programs such as mister rogers neighborhood and if the proprietors of those programs welcome the practice the business of supplying the equipment that makes such copying feasible should not be stifled simply because the equipment is used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions of respondents works the respondents do not represent a class composed of all copyright holders yet a finding of contributory infringement would inevitably frustrate the interests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience that is available only through timeshifting

of course the fact that other copyright holders may welcome the practice of timeshifting does not mean that respondents should be deemed to have granted a license to copy their programs thirdparty conduct would be wholly irrelevant in an action for direct infringement of respondents copyrights but in an action for contributory infringement against the seller of copying equipment the copyright holder may not prevail unless the relief that he seeks affects only his programs or unless he speaks for virtually all copyright holders with an interest in the outcome in this case the record makes it perfectly clear that there are many important producers of national and local television programs who find nothing objectionable about the enlargement in the size of the television audience that results from the practice of timeshifting for private home use 28 the seller of the equipment that expands those producers audiences cannot be a contributory 464 us 417 447   infringer if as is true in this case it has had no direct involvement with any infringing activity

b unauthorized timeshifting

even unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work are not necessarily infringing an unlicensed use of the copyright is not an infringement unless it conflicts with one of the specific exclusive rights conferred by the copyright statute twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us at 154 155 moreover the definition of exclusive rights in 106 of the present act is prefaced by the words subject to sections 107 through 118 those sections describe a variety of uses of copyrighted material that are not infringements of copyright notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 the most pertinent in this case is 107 the legislative endorsement of the doctrine of fair use 29   464 us 417 448

that section identifies various factors 30 that enable a court to apply an equitable rule of reason analysis to particular claims of infringement 31 although not conclusive the first 464 us 417 449   factor requires that the commercial or nonprofit character of an activity be weighed in any fair use decision 32 if the betamax were used to make copies for a commercial or profitmaking purpose such use would presumptively be unfair the contrary presumption is appropriate here however because the district courts findings plainly establish that timeshifting for private home use must be characterized as a noncommercial nonprofit activity moreover when one considers the nature of a televised copyrighted audiovisual work see 17 usc 1072 1982 ed and that timeshifting merely enables a viewer to see such a work which he had been invited to witness in its entirety free of charge the fact 464 us 417 450   that the entire work is reproduced see 1073 does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of fair use 33

this is not however the end of the inquiry because congress has also directed us to consider the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work 1074 the purpose of copyright is to create incentives for creative effort even copying for noncommercial purposes may impair the copyright holders ability to obtain the rewards that congress intended him to have but a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the potential market for or the value of the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to protect the authors incentive to create the prohibition of such noncommercial uses would 464 us 417 451   merely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit 34

thus although every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright noncommercial uses are a different matter a challenge to a noncommercial use of a copyrighted work requires proof either that the particular use is harmful or that if it should become widespread it would adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work actual present harm need not be shown such a requirement would leave the copyright holder with no defense against predictable damage nor is it necessary to show with certainty that future harm will result what is necessary is a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists if the intended use is for commercial gain that likelihood may be presumed but if it is for a noncommercial purpose the likelihood must be demonstrated

in this case respondents failed to carry their burden with regard to home timeshifting the district court described respondents evidence as follows

plaintiffs experts admitted at several points in the trial that the timeshifting without librarying would result in not a great deal of harm plaintiffs greatest concern about timeshifting is with a point of important philosophy that transcends even commercial judgment they fear that with any betamax usage invisible boundaries are passed the copyright owner has lost control over his program 480 f supp at 467 464 us 417 452
later in its opinion the district court observed
most of plaintiffs predictions of harm hinge on speculation about audience viewing patterns and ratings a measurement system which sidney sheinberg mcas president calls a black art because of the significant level of imprecision involved in the calculations id at 469 35
there was no need for the district court to say much about past harm plaintiffs have admitted that no actual harm to their copyrights has occurred to date id at 451
on the question of potential future harm from timeshifting the district court offered a more detailed analysis of the evidence it rejected respondents fear that persons watching the original telecast of a program will not be measured in the live audience and the ratings and revenues will decrease by observing that current measurement technology allows the betamax audience to be reflected id at 466 36 it rejected respondents prediction that live television 464 us 417 453   or movie audiences will decrease as more people watch betamax tapes as an alternative with the observation that there is no factual basis for the underlying assumption ibid 37 it rejected respondents fear that timeshifting will reduce audiences for telecast reruns and concluded instead that given current market practices this should aid plaintiffs rather than harm them ibid 38 and it declared that respondents suggestion that theater or film rental exhibition of a program will suffer because of timeshift recording of that program lacks merit id at 467 39   464 us 417 454

after completing that review the district court restated its overall conclusion several times in several different ways harm from timeshifting is speculative and at best minimal ibid the audience benefits from the timeshifting capability have already been discussed it is not implausible that benefits could also accrue to plaintiffs broadcasters and advertisers as the betamax makes it possible for more persons to view their broadcasts ibid no likelihood of harm was shown at trial and plaintiffs admitted that there had been no actual harm to date id at 468469 testimony at trial suggested that betamax may require adjustments in marketing strategy but it did not establish even a likelihood of harm id at 469 television production by plaintiffs today is more profitable than it has ever been and in five weeks of trial there was no concrete evidence to suggest that the betamax will change the studios financial picture ibid

the district courts conclusions are buttressed by the fact that to the extent timeshifting expands public access to freely broadcast television programs it yields societal benefits in community television of southern california v gottfried 459 us 498 508  n 12 1983 we acknowledged the public interest in making television broadcasting more available concededly that interest is not unlimited but it supports an interpretation of the concept of fair use that requires the copyright holder to demonstrate some likelihood of harm before he may condemn a private act of timeshifting as a violation of federal law

when these factors are all weighed in the equitable rule of reason balance we must conclude that this record amply 464 us 417 455   supports the district courts conclusion that home timeshifting is fair use in light of the findings of the district court regarding the state of the empirical data it is clear that the court of appeals erred in holding that the statute as presently written bars such conduct 40   464 us 417 456

in summary the record and findings of the district court lead us to two conclusions first sony demonstrated a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcasts timeshifted by private viewers and second respondents failed to demonstrate that timeshifting would cause any likelihood of nonminimal harm to the potential market for or the value of their copyrighted works the betamax is therefore capable of substantial noninfringing uses sonys sale of such equipment to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondents copyrights

v
the direction of art i is that congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts when as here the constitution is permissive the sign of how far congress has chosen to go can come only from congress deepsouth packing co v laitram corp 406 us 518 530 1972
one may search the copyright act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible
it may well be that congress will take a fresh look at this new technology just as it so often has examined other innovations in the past but it is not our job to apply laws that have not yet been written applying the copyright statute as it now reads to the facts as they have been developed in this case the judgment of the court of appeals must be reversed

it is so ordered

 footnote 3  as evidence of how a vtr may be used respondents offered the testimony of william griffiths griffiths although named as an individual defendant was a client of plaintiffs law firm the district court summarized his testimony as follows

he owns approximately 100 tapes when griffiths bought his betamax he intended not only to timeshift record playback and then erase but also to build a library of cassettes maintaining a library however proved too expensive and he is now erasing some earlier tapes and reusing them
griffiths copied about 20 minutes of a universal motion picture called never give an inch and two episodes from universal television series 464 us 417 424   entitled baa baa black sheep and holmes and yo yo he would have erased each of these but for the request of plaintiffs counsel that it be kept griffiths also testified that he had copied but already erased universal films called alpha caper erased before anyone saw it and amelia earhart at the time of his deposition griffiths did not intend to keep any universal film in his library

 footnote 4  the district court summarized some of the findings in these surveys as follows

according to plaintiffs survey 754 of the vtr owners use their machines to record for timeshifting purposes half or most of the time defendants survey showed that 96 of the betamax owners had used the machine to record programs they otherwise would have missed

 footnote 8  the court also found that this access is not just a matter of convenience as plaintiffs have suggested access has been limited not simply by inconvenience but by the basic need to work access to the better 464 us 417 426   program has also been limited by the competitive practice of counterprogramming 480 f supp at 454

 footnote 9  without a productive use i e when copyrighted material is reproduced for its intrinsic use the mass copying of the sort involved in this case precludes an application of fair use 659 f2d at 971972

 footnote 10  in its report accompanying the comprehensive revision of the copyright act in 1909 the judiciary committee of the house of representatives explained this balance

the enactment of copyright legislation by congress under the terms of the constitution is not based upon any natural right that the author has in his writings    but upon the ground that the welfare of the public will be 464 us 417 430   served and progress of science and useful arts will be promoted by securing to authors for limited periods the exclusive rights to their writings  
in enacting a copyright law congress must consider    two questions first how much will the legislation stimulate the producer and so benefit the public and second how much will the monopoly granted be detrimental to the public the granting of such exclusive rights under the proper terms and conditions confers a benefit upon the public that outweighs the evils of the temporary monopoly h r rep no 2222 60th cong 2d sess 7 1909
 footnote 11  thus for example the development and marketing of player pianos and perforated rolls of music see whitesmith music publishing co v apollo co 209 us 1 1908 preceded the enactment of the copyright act of 1909 innovations in copying techniques gave rise to the statutory exemption for library copying embodied in 108 of the 1976 revision of the copyright law the development of the technology that made it possible to retransmit television programs by cable or by microwave systems see fortnightly corp v united artists television inc 392 us 390 1968 and teleprompter corp v columbia broadcasting system inc 415 us 394 1974 prompted the enactment of the complex provisions set forth in 17 usc 111d2b and 111d5 1982 ed after years of detailed congressional study see eastern microwave inc v doubleday sports inc 691 f2d 125 129 ca2 1982

by enacting the sound recording amendment of 1971 85 stat 391 congress also provided the solution to the record piracy problems that had been created by the development of the audio tape recorder sony argues that the legislative history of that act see especially h r rep no 92487 p 7 1971 indicates that congress did not intend to prohibit the private home use of either audio or video tape recording equipment in view of our disposition of the contributory infringement issue we express no opinion on that question

 footnote 12  copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the printing press and had its early beginnings in the british censorship laws the fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression on the one hand and with technological improvements in means of dissemination on the other successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property the related interest of the 464 us 417 431   publisher and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas foreword to b kaplan an unhurried view of copyright viiviii 1967

 footnote 17  as the district court correctly observed however the lines between direct infringement contributory infringement and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn     480 f supp at 457458 the lack of clarity in this area may in part be attributable to the fact that an infringer is not merely one who uses a work without authorization by the copyright owner but also one who authorizes the use of a copyrighted work without actual authority from the copyright owner

we note the parties statements that the questions of sonys liability under the doctrines of direct infringement and vicarious liability are not nominally before this court compare brief for respondents 9 n 22 41 n 90 with reply brief for petitioners 1 n 2 we also observe however that reasoned analysis of respondents unprecedented contributory infringement claim necessarily entails consideration of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels and indeed the parties to a large extent rely upon such arguments and authority in support of their respective positions on the issue of contributory infringement

 footnote 21  it seems extraordinary to suggest that the copyright act confers upon all copyright owners collectively much less the two respondents in this case the exclusive right to distribute vtrs simply because they may be used to infringe copyrights that however is the logical implication of their claim the request for an injunction below indicates that respondents seek in effect to declare vtrs contraband their suggestion in this court that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory license would be an acceptable remedy merely indicates that respondents for their part would be willing to license their claimed monopoly interest in vtrs to sony in return for a royalty

 footnote 28  it may be rare for large numbers of copyright owners to authorize duplication of their works without demanding a fee from the copier in the context of public broadcasting however the user of the copyrighted work is not required to pay a fee for access to the underlying work the traditional method by which copyright owners capitalize upon the television medium  commercially sponsored free public broadcast over the public airwaves  is predicated upon the assumption that compensation for 464 us 417 447   the value of displaying the works will be received in the form of advertising revenues

in the context of television programming some producers evidently believe that permitting home viewers to make copies of their works off the air actually enhances the value of their copyrights irrespective of their reasons for authorizing the practice they do so and in significant enough numbers to create a substantial market for a noninfringing use of the sony vtrs no one could dispute the legitimacy of that market if the producers had authorized home taping of their programs in exchange for a license fee paid directly by the home user the legitimacy of that market is not compromised simply because these producers have authorized home taping of their programs without demanding a fee from the home user the copyright law does not require a copyright owner to charge a fee for the use of his works and as this record clearly demonstrates the owner of a copyright may well have economic or noneconomic reasons for permitting certain kinds of copying to occur without receiving direct compensation from the copier it is not the role of the courts to tell copyright holders the best way for them to exploit their copyrights even if respondents competitors were illadvised in authorizing home videotaping that would not change the fact that they have created a substantial market for a paradigmatic noninfringing use of sonys product

 footnote 29  the copyright act of 1909 35 stat 1075 did not have a fair use provision although that acts compendium of exclusive rights to print 464 us 417 448   reprint publish copy and vend the copyrighted work was broad enough to encompass virtually all potential interactions with a copyrighted work the statute was never so construed the courts simply refused to read the statute literally in every situation when congress amended the statute in 1976 it indicated that it intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use not to change narrow or enlarge it in any way h r rep no 941476 p 66 1976

 footnote 30  section 107 provides

notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 the fair use of a copyrighted work including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching including multiple copies for classroom use scholarship or research is not an infringement of copyright in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
1 the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
2 the nature of the copyrighted work
3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and
4 the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work 17 usc 107 1982 ed
 footnote 31  the house report expressly stated that the fair use doctrine is an equitable rule of reason in its explanation of the fair use section

although the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over and over again no real definition of the concept has ever emerged indeed since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason no generally applicable definition is possible and each case raising the question must be decided on its own facts

the statement of the fair use doctrine in section 107 offers some guidance to users in determining when the principles of the doctrine apply however the endless variety of situations and combinations of circumstances that can rise in particular cases precludes the formulation of exact rules in the statute the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use but there is no disposition to freeze the 464 us 417 449   doctrine in the statute especially during a period of rapid technological change beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a casebycase basis h r rep no 941476 supra at 6566
the senate committee similarly eschewed a rigid brightline approach to fair use the senate report endorsed the view that offtheair recording for convenience could be considered fair use under some circumstances although it then made it clear that it did not intend to suggest that offtheair recording for convenience should be deemed fair use under any circumstances imaginable s rep no 94473 pp 6566 1975 the latter qualifying statement is quoted by the dissent post at 481 and if read in isolation would indicate that the committee intended to condemn all offtheair recording for convenience read in context however it is quite clear that that was the farthest thing from the committees intention
 footnote 32  the committee has amended the first of the criteria to be considered  the purpose and character of the use  to state explicitly that this factor includes a consideration of whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes this amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any sort of notforprofit limitation on educational uses of copyrighted works it is an express recognition that as under the present law the commercial or nonprofit character of an activity while not conclusive with respect to fair use can and should be weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions h r rep no 941476 supra at 66

 footnote 33  it has been suggested that consumptive uses of copyrights by home vtr users are commercial even if the consumer does not sell the homemade tape because the consumer will not buy tapes separately sold by the copyrightholder home recording of copyrighted works hearing before the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice of the house committee on the judiciary 97th cong 2d sess pt 2 p 1250 1982 memorandum of prof laurence h tribe furthermore the error in excusing such theft as noncommercial we are told can be seen by simple analogy jewel theft is not converted into a noncommercial veniality if stolen jewels are simply worn rather than sold ibid the premise and the analogy are indeed simple but they add nothing to the argument the use to which stolen jewelry is put is quite irrelevant in determining whether depriving its true owner of his present possessory interest in it is venial because of the nature of the item and the true owners interests in physical possession of it the law finds the taking objectionable even if the thief does not use the item at all theft of a particular item of personal property of course may have commercial significance for the thief deprives the owner of his right to sell that particular item to any individual timeshifting does not even remotely entail comparable consequences to the copyright owner moreover the timeshifter no more steals the program by watching it once than does the live viewer and the live viewer is no more likely to buy prerecorded videotapes than is the timeshifter indeed no live viewer would buy a prerecorded videotape if he did not have access to a vtr

in certain situations the copyright owner suffers no substantial harm from the use of his work    here again is the partial marriage between the doctrine of fair use and the legal maxim de minimus non curat lex
 footnote 35  see also 480 f supp at 451

it should be noted however that plaintiffs argument is more complicated and speculative than was the plaintiffs in williams  wilkins    here plaintiffs ask the court to find harm based on many more assumptions    as is discussed more fully in part iv infra some of these assumptions are based on neither fact nor experience and plaintiffs admit that they are to some extent inconsistent and illogical
 footnote 36  there was testimony at trial however that nielsen ratings has already developed the ability to measure when a betamax in a sample home is recording the program thus the betamax owner will be measured as a part of the live audience the later diary can augment that measurement with information about subsequent viewing id at 466

in a separate section the district court rejected plaintiffs suggestion that the commercial attractiveness of television broadcasts would be diminished because betamax owners would use the pause button or fastforward control to avoid viewing advertisements

it must be remembered however that to omit commercials betamax owners must view the program including the commercials while recording to avoid commercials during playback the viewer must fastforward 464 us 417 453   and for the most part guess as to when the commercial has passed for most recordings either practice may be too tedious as defendants survey showed 92 of the programs were recorded with commercials and only 25 of the owners fastforward through them advertisers will have to make the same kinds of judgments they do now about whether persons viewing televised programs actually watch the advertisements which interrupt them id at 468
 footnote 37  here plaintiffs assume that people will view copies when they would otherwise be watching television or going to the movie theater there is no factual basis for this assumption it seems equally likely that betamax owners will play their tapes when there is nothing on television they wish to see and no movie they want to attend defendants survey does not show any negative effect of betamax ownership on television viewing or theater attendance id at 466

 footnote 38  the underlying assumptions here are particularly difficult to accept plaintiffs explain that the betamax increases access to the original televised material and that the more people there are in this original audience the fewer people the rerun will attract yet current marketing practices including the success of syndication show just the opposite today the larger the audience for the original telecast the higher the price plaintiffs can demand from broadcasters from rerun rights there is no survey within the knowledge of this court to show that the rerun audience is comprised of persons who have not seen the program in any event if ratings can reflect betamax recording original audiences may increase and given market practices this should aid plaintiffs rather than harm them ibid

 footnote 39  this suggestion lacks merit by definition timeshift recording entails viewing and erasing so the program will no longer be on tape when the later theater run begins of course plaintiffs may fear that the betamax owners will keep the tapes long enough to satisfy all their interest in 464 us 417 454   the program and will therefore not patronize later theater exhibitions to the extent that this practice involves librarying it is addressed in section v c infra it should also be noted that there is no evidence to suggest that the public interest in later theatrical exhibitions of motion pictures will be reduced any more by betamax recording than it already is by the television broadcast of the film id at 467

 footnote 40  the court of appeals chose not to engage in any equitable rule of reason analysis in this case instead it assumed that the category of fair use is rigidly circumscribed by a requirement that every such use must be productive it therefore concluded that copying a television program merely to enable the viewer to receive information or entertainment that he would otherwise miss because of a personal scheduling conflict could never be fair use that understanding of fair use was erroneous

congress has plainly instructed us that fair use analysis calls for a sensitive balancing of interests the distinction between productive and unproductive uses may be helpful in calibrating the balance but it cannot be wholly determinative although copying to promote a scholarly endeavor certainly has a stronger claim to fair use than copying to avoid interrupting a poker game the question is not simply twodimensional for one thing it is not true that all copyrights are fungible some copyrights govern material with broad potential secondary markets such material may well have a broader claim to protection because of the greater potential for commercial harm copying a news broadcast may have a stronger claim to fair use than copying a motion picture and of course not all uses are fungible copying for commercial gain has a much weaker claim to fair use than copying for personal enrichment but the notion of social productivity cannot be a complete answer to this analysis a teacher who copies to prepare lecture notes is clearly productive but so is a teacher who copies for the sake of broadening his personal understanding of his specialty or a legislator who copies for the sake of broadening her understanding of what her constituents are watching or a constituent who copies a news program to help make a decision on how to vote

making a copy of a copyrighted work for the convenience of a blind person is expressly identified by the house committee report as an example of fair use with no suggestion that anything more than a purpose to entertain or to inform need motivate the copying in a hospital setting using a vtr to enable a patient to see programs he would otherwise miss has no productive purpose other than contributing to the psychological wellbeing of the patient virtually any timeshifting that increases viewer access to television programming may result in a comparable benefit the statutory language does not identify any dichotomy between productive and 464 us 417 456   nonproductive timeshifting but does require consideration of the economic consequences of copying 464 us 417 457

justice blackmun with whom justice marshall justice powell and justice rehnquist join dissenting

a restatement of the facts and judicial history of this case is necessary in my view for a proper focus upon the issues respondents position is hardly so unprecedented ante at 421 in the copyright law nor does it really embody a gross generalization ante at 436 or a novel theory of liability ante at 437 and the like as the court in belittling their claims describes the efforts of respondents

the introduction of the home videotape recorder vtr upon the market has enabled millions of americans to make recordings of television programs in their homes for future and repeated viewing at their own convenience while this practice has proved highly popular with owners of television sets and vtrs it understandably has been a matter of concern for the holders of copyrights in the recorded programs a result is the present litigation raising the issues whether the home recording of a copyrighted television program is an infringement of the copyright and if so whether the manufacturers and distributors of vtrs are liable as contributory infringers i would hope that these questions ultimately will be considered seriously and in depth by the congress and be resolved there despite the fact that the courts decision today provides little incentive for congressional action our task in the meantime however is to resolve these issues as best we can in the light of illfitting existing copyright law

it is no answer of course to refer to and stress as the court does this courts consistent deference to congress whenever major technological innovations appear ante at 431 perhaps a better and more accurate description is that the court has tended to evade the hard issues when they arise in the area of copyright law i see no reason for the court to be particularly pleased with this tradition or to continue it indeed it is fairly clear from the legislative history of the 1976 act that congress meant to change the old pattern and 464 us 417 458   enact a statute that would cover new technologies as well as old

in 1976 respondents universal city studios inc and walt disney productions studios brought this copyright infringement action in the united states district court for the central district of california against among others petitioners sony corporation a japanese corporation and sony corporation of america a new york corporation the manufacturer and distributor respectively of the betamax vtr the studios sought damages profits and a wideranging injunction against further sales or use of the betamax or betamax tapes

the betamax like other vtrs presently is capable of recording television broadcasts off the air on videotape cassettes and playing them back at a later time 1 two kinds of betamax usage are at issue here 2 the first is timeshifting whereby the user records a program in order to watch it at a later time and then records over it and thereby erases the program after a single viewing the second is librarybuilding 464 us 417 459   in which the user records a program in order to keep it for repeated viewing over a longer term sonys advertisements at various times have suggested that betamax users record favorite shows or build a library sonys betamax advertising has never contained warnings about copyright infringement although a warning does appear in the betamax operating instructions

the studios produce copyrighted movies and other works that they release to theaters and license for television broadcast they also rent and sell their works on film and on prerecorded videotapes and videodiscs license fees for television broadcasts are set according to audience ratings compiled by rating services that do not measure any playbacks of videotapes the studios make the serious claim that vtr recording may result in a decrease in their revenue from licensing their works to television and from marketing them in other ways

after a 5week trial the district court with a detailed opinion ruled that home vtr recording did not infringe the studios copyrights under either the act of mar 4 1909 1909 act 35 stat 1075 as amended formerly codified as 17 usc 1 et seq or the copyright revision act of 1976 1976 act 90 stat 2541 17 usc 101 et seq 1982 ed 3 the district court also held that even if home vtr recording were an infringement sony could not be held liable under theories of direct infringement contributory infringement or vicarious liability finally the court concluded that an injunction against sales of the betamax would be inappropriate even if sony were liable under one or more of those theories 480 f supp 429 1979 464 us 417 460

the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in virtually every respect 659 f2d 963 1981 it held that the 1909 act and the 1976 act contained no implied exemption for home use recording that such recording was not fair use and that the use of the betamax to record the studios copyrighted works infringed their copyrights the court of appeals also held sony liable for contributory infringement reasoning that sony knew and anticipated that the betamax would be used to record copyrighted material off the air and that sony indeed had induced caused or materially contributed to the infringing conduct the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court for appropriate relief it suggested that the district court could consider the award of damages or a continuing royalty in lieu of an injunction id at 976

the copyright clause of the constitution art i 8 cl 8 empowers congress to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries this nations initial copyright statute was passed by the first congress entitled an act for the encouragement of learning it gave an author the sole right and liberty of printing reprinting publishing and vending his map chart book or books for a period of 14 years act of may 31 1790 1 1 stat 124 since then as the technology available to authors for creating and preserving their writings has changed the governing statute has changed with it by many amendments and by complete revisions in 1831 1870 1909 and 1976 4 authors rights have been 464 us 417 461   expanded to provide protection to any original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression including motion pictures and other audiovisual works 17 usc 102a 1982 ed 5

section 106 of the 1976 act grants the owner of a copyright a variety of exclusive rights in the copyrighted work 6 including 464 us 417 462   the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords 7 this grant expressly is made subject to 107118 which create a number of exemptions and limitations on the copyright owners rights the most important of these sections for present purposes is 107 that section states that the fair use of a copyrighted work    is not an infringement of copyright 8

the 1976 act like its predecessors 9 does not give the copyright owner full and complete control over all possible 464 us 417 463   uses of his work if the work is put to some use not enumerated in 106 the use is not an infringement see fortnightly corp v united artists television inc 392 us 390 393 395 1968 thus before considering whether home videotaping comes within the scope of the fair use exemption one first must inquire whether the practice appears to violate the exclusive right granted in the first instance by 1061 to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords

a
although the word copies is in the plural in 1061 there can be no question that under the act the making of even a single unauthorized copy is prohibited the senate and house reports explain the references to copies or phonorecords although in the plural are intended here and throughout the bill to include the singular 1 usc 1 10   464 us 417 464   s rep no 94473 p 58 1975 1975 senate report h r rep no 941476 p 61 1976 1976 house report the reports then describe the reproduction right established by 1061

the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords means the right to produce a material object in which the work is duplicated transcribed imitated or simulated in a fixed form from which it can be perceived reproduced or otherwise communicated either directly or with the aid of a machine or device as under the present law a copyrighted work would be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial part and by duplicating it exactly or by imitation or simulation 1975 senate report 58 1976 house report 61
the making of even a single videotape recording at home falls within this definition the vtr user produces a material object from which the copyrighted work later can be perceived unless congress intended a special exemption for the making of a single copy for personal use i must conclude that vtr recording is contrary to the exclusive rights granted by 1061
the 1976 act and its accompanying reports specify in some detail the situations in which a single copy of a copyrighted work may be made without infringement concerns section 108a for example permits a library or archives to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work for a patron but only under very limited conditions an entire work moreover can be copied only if it cannot be obtained elsewhere at a fair price 11 108e see also 112a broadcaster 464 us 417 465   may make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program and only under certain conditions in other respects the making of single copies is permissible only within the limited confines of the fair use doctrine the senate report in a section headed single and multiple copying notes that the fair use doctrine would permit a teacher to make a single copy of a work for use in the classroom but only if the work was not a sizable one such as a novel or treatise 1975 senate report 6364 accord 1976 house report 6869 71 other situations in which the making of a single copy would be fair use are described in the house and senate reports 12 but neither the statute nor its legislative history suggests any intent to create a general exemption for a single copy made for personal or private use

indeed it appears that congress considered and rejected the very possibility of a special private use exemption the issue was raised early in the revision process in one of the studies prepared for congress under the supervision of the copyright office a latman fair use of copyrighted works 1958 reprinted in study no 14 for the senate committee on the judiciary copyright law revision studies prepared for the subcommittee on patents trademarks and copyrights 86th cong 2d sess 1 1960 latman fair use study this study found no reported case supporting the existence of an exemption for private use although it noted that the purpose and nature of a private use and in some 464 us 417 466   cases the small amount taken might lead a court to apply the general principles of fair use in such a way as to deny liability id at 12 after reviewing a number of foreign copyright laws that contained explicit statutory exemptions for private or personal use id at 25 professor latman outlined several approaches that a revision bill could take to the general issue of exemptions and fair use one of these was the adoption of particularized rules to cover specific situations including the field of personal use id at 33 13

rejecting the latter alternative the register of copyrights recommended that the revised copyright statute simply mention the doctrine of fair use and indicate its general scope the register opposed the adoption of rules and exemptions to cover specific situations 14 preferring instead to rely on the judgemade fair use doctrine to resolve new problems as they arose see registers 1961 report 25 registers supplementary report 2728

the registers approach was reflected in the first copyright revision bills drafted by the copyright office in 1964 464 us 417 467   these bills like the 1976 act granted the copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work subject only to the exceptions set out in later sections h r 11947s 3008 88th cong 2d sess 5a 1964 the primary exception was fair use 6 containing language virtually identical to 107 of the 1976 act although the copyright revision bills underwent change in many respects from their first introduction in 1964 to their final passage in 1976 these portions of the bills did not change 15 i can conclude only that congress like the register intended to rely on the fair use doctrine and not on a per se exemption for private use to separate permissible copying from the impermissible 16   464 us 417 468

when congress intended special and protective treatment for private use moreover it said so explicitly one such explicit statement appears in 106 itself the copyright owners exclusive right to perform a copyrighted work in contrast to his right to reproduce the work in copies is limited section 1064 grants a copyright owner the exclusive right to perform the work publicly but does not afford the owner protection with respect to private performances by others a motion picture is performed whenever its images are shown or its sounds are made audible 101 like singing 464 us 417 469   a copyrighted lyric in the shower twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us 151 155 1975 watching television at home with ones family and friends is now considered a performance 1975 senate report 5960 1976 house report 63 17 home television viewing nevertheless does not infringe any copyright  but only because 1064 contains the word publicly 18 see generally 1975 senate report 6061 1976 house report 6364 registers 1961 report 2930 no such distinction between public and private uses appears in 1061s prohibition on the making of copies 19

similarly an explicit reference to private use appears in 108 under that section a library can make a copy for a patron only for specific types of private use private study scholarship or research 20 108d1 and e1 see 37 464 us 417 470   cfr 20114b 1983 limits also are imposed on the extent of the copying and the type of institution that may make copies and the exemption expressly is made inapplicable to motion pictures and certain other types of works 108h these limitations would be wholly superfluous if an entire copy of any work could be made by any person for private use 21

b
the district court in this case nevertheless concluded that the 1976 act contained an implied exemption for homeuse recording 480 f supp at 444446 the court relied primarily on the legislative history of a 1971 amendment to the 1909 act a reliance that this court today does not duplicate ante at 430 n 11 that amendment however was addressed to the specific problem of commercial piracy of sound recordings act of oct 15 1971 85 stat 391 1971 amendment the house report on the 1971 amendment in a section entitled home recording contains the following statement

in approving the creation of a limited copyright in sound recordings it is the intention of the committee that this limited copyright not grant any broader rights than are accorded to other copyright proprietors under the existing title 17 specifically it is not the intention of the committee to restrain the home recording from broadcasts or from tapes or records of recorded performances 464 us 417 471   where the home recording is for private use and with no purpose of reproducing or otherwise capitalizing commercially on it this practice is common and unrestrained today and the record producers and performers would be in no different position from that of the owners of copyright in recorded musical compositions over the past 20 years h r rep no 92487 p 7 1971 1971 house report
similar statements were made during house hearings on the bill 22 and on the house floor 23 although not in the senate 464 us 417 472   proceedings in concluding that these statements created a general exemption for home recording the district court in my view paid too little heed to the context in which the statements were made and failed to consider the limited purpose of the 1971 amendment and the structure of the 1909 act
unlike television broadcasts and other types of motion pictures sound recordings were not protected by copyright prior to the passage of the 1971 amendment although the underlying musical work could be copyrighted the 1909 act provided no protection for a particular performers rendition of the work moreover copyrighted musical works that had been recorded for public distribution were subject to a compulsory license any person was free to record such a work upon payment of a 2cent royalty to the copyright owner 1e 35 stat 10751076 while reproduction without payment of the royalty was an infringement under the 1909 act damages were limited to three times the amount of the unpaid royalty 25e 35 stat 10811082 shapiro bernstein  co v goody 248 f2d 260 262263 265 ca2 1957 cert denied 355 us 952 1958 it was observed that the practical effect of these provisions was to legalize record piracy see s rep no 9272 p 4 1971 1971 house report 2

in order to suppress this piracy the 1971 amendment extended copyright protection beyond the underlying work and to the sound recordings themselves congress chose however to provide only limited protection owners of copyright in sound recordings were given the exclusive right to reproduce their works and distribute them to the public 464 us 417 473   1971 amendment 1a 85 stat 391 formerly codified as 17 usc 1f 24 this right was merely the right of commercial distribution see 117 cong rec 3474834749 1971 colloquy of reps kazen and kastenmeier the bill protects copyrighted material that is duplicated for commercial purposes only

against this background the statements regarding home recording under the 1971 amendment appear in a very different light if home recording was common and unrestrained under the 1909 act see 1971 house report 7 it was because sound recordings had no copyright protection and the owner of a copyright in the underlying musical work could collect no more than a 2cent royalty plus 6 cents in damages for each unauthorized use with so little at stake it is not at all surprising that the assistant register did not see anybody going into anyones home and preventing this sort of thing 1971 house hearings 23

but the references to home sound recording in the 1971 amendments legislative history demonstrate no congressional intent to create a generalized homeuse exemption from copyright protection congress having recognized that the 1909 act had been unsuccessful in controlling home sound recording addressed only the specific problem of commercial record piracy to quote assistant register ringer again home use was not what this legislation was addressed to id at 22 25   464 us 417 474

while the 1971 amendment narrowed the sound recordings loophole in then existing copyright law motion pictures and other audiovisual works have been accorded full copyright protection since at least 1912 see act of aug 24 1912 37 stat 488 and perhaps before see edison v lubin 122 f 240 ca3 1903 appeal dismd 195 us 625 1904 congress continued this protection in the 1976 act unlike the sound recording rights created by the 1971 amendment the reproduction rights associated with motion pictures under 1061 are not limited to reproduction for public distribution the copyright owners right to reproduce the work exists independently and the mere duplication of a copy may constitute an infringement even if it is never distributed registers supplementary report 16 see 1975 senate report 57 and 1976 house report 61 moreover the 1976 act was intended as a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of copyright law the reports accompanying the 1976 act unlike the 1971 house report contain no suggestion that homeuse recording is somehow outside the scope of this allinclusive statute it was clearly the intent of congress that no additional exemptions were to be implied 26   464 us 417 475

i therefore find in the 1976 act no implied exemption to cover the home taping of television programs whether it be for a single copy for private use or for home use taping a copyrighted television program is infringement unless it is permitted by the fair use exemption contained in 107 of the 1976 act i now turn to that issue

fair use
the doctrine of fair use has been called with some justification the most troublesome in the whole law of copyright dellar v samuel goldwyn inc 104 f2d 661 662 ca2 1939 see triangle publications inc v knightridder newspapers inc 626 f2d 1171 1174 ca5 1980 meeropol v nizer 560 f2d 1061 1068 ca2 1977 cert denied 434 us 1013 1978 although courts have constructed lists of factors to be considered in determining whether a particular use is fair 27 no fixed criteria have emerged by which that 464 us 417 476   determination can be made this court thus far has provided no guidance although fair use issues have come here twice on each occasion the court was equally divided and no opinion was forthcoming williams  wilkins co v united states 203 ct cl 74 487 f2d 1345 1973 affd 420 us 376 1975 benny v loews inc 239 f2d 532 ca9 1956 affd sub nom columbia broadcasting system inc v loews inc 356 us 43 1958
nor did congress provide definitive rules when it codified the fair use doctrine in the 1976 act it simply incorporated a list of factors to be considered the purpose and character of the use the nature of the copyrighted work the amount and substantiality of the portion used and perhaps the most important the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work emphasis supplied 107 no particular weight however was assigned to any of these and the list was not intended to be exclusive the house and senate reports explain that 107 does no more than give statutory recognition to the fair use doctrine it was intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use not to change narrow or enlarge it in any way 1976 house report 66 see 1975 senate report 62 s rep no 93983 p 116 1974 h r rep no 83 90th cong 1st sess 32 1967 h r rep no 2237 89th cong 2d sess 61 1966 464 us 417 477

despite this absence of clear standards the fair use doctrine plays a crucial role in the law of copyright the purpose of copyright protection in the words of the constitution is to promote the progress of science and useful arts copyright is based on the belief that by granting authors the exclusive rights to reproduce their works they are given an incentive to create and that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in science and the useful arts mazer v stein 347 us 201 219 1954 the monopoly created by copyright thus rewards the individual author in order to benefit the public twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us at 156  fox film corp v doyal 286 us 123 127 128 1932 see h r rep no 2222 60th cong 2d sess 7 1909

there are situations nevertheless in which strict enforcement of this monopoly would inhibit the very progress of science and useful arts that copyright is intended to promote an obvious example is the researcher or scholar whose own work depends on the ability to refer to and to quote the work of prior scholars obviously no author could create a new work if he were first required to repeat the research of every author who had gone before him 28 the scholar like the ordinary user of course could be left to bargain with each copyright owner for permission to quote from or refer to prior works but there is a crucial difference between the scholar and the ordinary user when the ordinary user decides that the owners price is too high and forgoes use of the work only the individual is the loser when the scholar forgoes the use of a prior work not only does his own 464 us 417 478   work suffer but the public is deprived of his contribution to knowledge the scholars work in other words produces external benefits from which everyone profits in such a case the fair use doctrine acts as a form of subsidy  albeit at the first authors expense  to permit the second author to make limited use of the first authors work for the public good see latman fair use study 31 gordon fair use as market failure a structural analysis of the betamax case and its predecessors 82 colum l rev 1600 1630 1982

a similar subsidy may be appropriate in a range of areas other than pure scholarship the situations in which fair use is most commonly recognized are listed in 107 itself fair use may be found when a work is used for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching    scholarship or research the house and senate reports expand on this list somewhat 29 and other examples may be found in the case law 30 each of these uses however reflects a common theme each is a productive use resulting in some added benefit to the public beyond that produced by the first authors work 31 the fair use doctrine in other words permits works 464 us 417 479   to be used for socially laudable purposes see copyright office briefing papers on current issues reprinted in 1975 house hearings 2051 2055 i am aware of no case in which the reproduction of a copyrighted work for the sole benefit of the user has been held to be fair use 32

i do not suggest of course that every productive use is a fair use a finding of fair use still must depend on the facts of the individual case and on whether under the circumstances it is reasonable to expect the user to bargain with the copyright owner for use of the work the fair use doctrine must strike a balance between the dual risks created by the copyright system on the one hand that depriving authors of their monopoly will reduce their incentive to create and on the other that granting authors a complete monopoly will reduce the creative ability of others 33 the inquiry is 464 us 417 480   necessarily a flexible one and the endless variety of situations that may arise precludes the formulation of exact rules but when a user reproduces an entire work and uses it for its original purpose with no added benefit to the public the doctrine of fair use usually does not apply there is then no need whatsoever to provide the ordinary user with a fair use subsidy at the authors expense

the making of a videotape recording for home viewing is an ordinary rather than a productive use of the studios copyrighted works the district court found that betamax owners use the copy for the same purpose as the original they add nothing of their own 480 f supp at 453 although applying the fair use doctrine to home vtr recording as sony argues may increase public access to material broadcast free over the public airwaves i think sonys argument misconceives the nature of copyright copyright gives the author a right to limit or even to cut off access to his work fox film corp v doyal 286 us at 127  a vtr recording creates no public benefit sufficient to justify limiting this right nor is this right extinguished by the copyright owners choice to make the work available over the airwaves section 106 of the 1976 act grants the copyright owner the exclusive right to control the performance and the reproduction of his work and the fact that he has licensed a single television performance is really irrelevant to the existence of his right to control its reproduction although a television broadcast may be free to the viewer this fact is equally irrelevant a book borrowed from the public library may not be copied any more freely than a book that is purchased

it may be tempting as in my view the court today is tempted to stretch the doctrine of fair use so as to permit unfettered use of this new technology in order to increase access 464 us 417 481   to television programming but such an extension risks eroding the very basis of copyright law by depriving authors of control over their works and consequently of their incentive to create 34 even in the context of highly productive educational uses congress has avoided this temptation in passing the 1976 act congress made it clear that offtheair videotaping was to be permitted only in very limited situations see 1976 house report 71 1975 senate report 64 and the senate report adds the committee does not intend to suggest    that offtheair recording for convenience would under any circumstances be considered fair use id at 66 i cannot disregard these admonitions

b
i recognize nevertheless that there are situations where permitting even an unproductive use would have no effect on the authors incentive to create that is where the use would not affect the value of or the market for the authors work photocopying an old newspaper clipping to send to a friend 464 us 417 482   may be an example pinning a quotation on ones bulletin board may be another in each of these cases the effect on the author is truly de minimis thus even though these uses provide no benefit to the public at large no purpose is served by preserving the authors monopoly and the use may be regarded as fair

courts should move with caution however in depriving authors of protection from unproductive ordinary uses as has been noted above even in the case of a productive use 1074 requires consideration of the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work emphasis added a particular use which may seem to have little or no economic impact on the authors rights today can assume tremendous importance in times to come registers supplementary report 14 although such a use may seem harmless when viewed in isolation isolated instances of minor infringements when multiplied many times become in the aggregate a major inroad on copyright that must be prevented 1975 senate report 65

i therefore conclude that at least when the proposed use is an unproductive one a copyright owner need prove only a potential for harm to the market for or the value of the copyrighted work see 3 m nimmer copyright 1305e4c p 1384 1983 proof of actual harm or even probable harm may be impossible in an area where the effect of a new technology is speculative and requiring such proof would present the real danger    of confining the scope of an authors rights on the basis of the present technology so that as the years go by his copyright loses much of its value because of unforeseen technical advances registers supplementary report 14 infringement thus would be found if the copyright owner demonstrates a reasonable possibility that harm will result from the proposed use when the use is one that creates no benefit to the public at large copyright protection should not be denied on the basis that a new technology that may result in harm has not yet done so 464 us 417 483

the studios have identified a number of ways in which vtr recording could damage their copyrights vtr recording could reduce their ability to market their works in movie theaters and through the rental or sale of prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs it also could reduce their rerun audience and consequently the license fees available to them for repeated showings moreover advertisers may be willing to pay for only live viewing audiences if they believe vtr viewers will delete commercials or if rating services are unable to measure vtr use if this is the case vtr recording could reduce the license fees the studios are able to charge even for firstrun showings librarybuilding may raise the potential for each of the types of harm identified by the studios and timeshifting may raise the potential for substantial harm as well 35

although the district court found no likelihood of harm from vtr use 480 f supp at 468 i conclude that it applied an incorrect substantive standard and misallocated the 464 us 417 484   burden of proof the district court reasoned that the studios had failed to prove that librarybuilding would occur to any significant extent id at 467 that the studios prerecorded videodiscs could compete with vtr recordings and were arguably    more desirable ibid that it was not clear that movie audiences will decrease id at 468 and that the practice of deleting commercials may be too tedious for many viewers ibid to the extent any decrease in advertising revenues would occur the court concluded that the studios had marketing alternatives at hand to recoup some of that predicted loss id at 452 because the studios prediction of harm was based on so many assumptions and on a system of marketing which is rapidly changing the court was hesitant to identify probable effects of homeuse copying ibid

the district courts reluctance to engage in prediction in this area is understandable but in my view the court was mistaken in concluding that the studios should bear the risk created by this uncertainty the studios have demonstrated a potential for harm which has not been and could not be refuted at this early stage of technological development

the district courts analysis of harm moreover failed to consider the effect of vtr recording on the potential market for or the value of the copyrighted work as required by 1074 36 the requirement that a putatively infringing use 464 us 417 485   of a copyrighted work to be fair must not impair a potential market for the work has two implications first an infringer cannot prevail merely by demonstrating that the copyright holder suffered no net harm from the infringers action indeed even a showing that the infringement has resulted in a net benefit to the copyright holder will not suffice rather the infringer must demonstrate that he had not impaired the copyright holders ability to demand compensation from or to deny access to any group who would otherwise be willing to pay to see or hear the copyrighted work second the fact that a given market for a copyrighted work would not be available to the copyright holder were it not for the infringers activities does not permit the infringer to exploit that market without compensating the copyright holder see iowa state university research foundation inc v american broadcasting cos 621 f2d 57 ca2 1980

in this case the studios and their amici demonstrate that the advent of the vtr technology created a potential market for their copyrighted programs that market consists of those persons who find it impossible or inconvenient to watch the programs at the time they are broadcast and who wish to watch them at other times these persons are willing to pay for the privilege of watching copyrighted work at their convenience as is evidenced by the fact that they are willing to pay for vtrs and tapes undoubtedly most also would be willing to pay some kind of royalty to copyright holders the studios correctly argue that they have been deprived of the ability to exploit this sizable market

it is thus apparent from the record and from the findings of the district court that timeshifting does have a substantial 464 us 417 486   adverse effect upon the potential market for the studios copyrighted works accordingly even under the formulation of the fair use doctrine advanced by sony timeshifting cannot be deemed a fair use

v
contributory infringement
from the studios perspective the consequences of home vtr recording are the same as if a business had taped the studios works off the air duplicated the tapes and sold or rented them to members of the public for home viewing the distinction is that home vtr users do not record for commercial advantage the commercial benefit accrues to the manufacturer and distributors of the betamax i thus must proceed to discuss whether the manufacturer and distributors can be held contributorily liable if the product they sell is used to infringe
it is well established that liability for copyright infringement can be imposed on persons other than those who actually carry out the infringing activity kalem co v harper brothers 222 us 55 62 63 1911 3 m nimmer copyright 1204a 1983 see twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us at 160  n 11 buck v jewelllasalle realty co 283 us 191 198 1931 although the liability provision of the 1976 act provides simply that anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner    is an infringer of the copyright 17 usc 501a 1982 ed the house and senate reports demonstrate that congress intended to retain judicial doctrines of contributory infringement 1975 senate report 57 1976 house report 61 37   464 us 417 487

the doctrine of contributory copyright infringement however is not well defined one of the few attempts at definition appears in gershwin publishing corp v columbia artists management inc 443 f2d 1159 ca2 1971 in that case the second circuit stated that one who with knowledge of the infringing activity induces causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another may be held liable as a contributory infringer id at 1162 footnote omitted while i have no quarrel with this general statement it does not easily resolve the present case the district court and the court of appeals both purporting to apply it reached diametrically opposite results

a
in absolving sony from liability the district court reasoned that sony had no direct involvement with individual betamax users did not participate in any offtheair copying and did not know that such copying was an infringement of the studios copyright 480 f supp at 460 i agree with the gershwin court that contributory liability may be imposed even when the defendant has no formal control over the infringer the defendant in gershwin was a concert promoter operating through local concert associations that it sponsored it had no formal control over the infringing performers themselves 443 f2d at 11621163 see also twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us at 160  n 11 moreover a finding of contributory infringement has never depended on actual knowledge of particular instances of infringement it is sufficient that the defendant have reason to know that infringement is taking place 443 f2d 464 us 417 488   at 1162 see screen gemscolumbia music inc v markfi records inc 256 f supp 399 sdny 1966 38 in the socalled dance hall cases in which questions of contributory infringement arise with some frequency proprietors of entertainment establishments routinely are held liable for unauthorized performances on their premises even when they have no knowledge that copyrighted works are being performed in effect the proprietors in those cases are charged with constructive knowledge of the performances 39   464 us 417 489

nor is it necessary that the defendant be aware that the infringing activity violates the copyright laws section 504c2 of the 1976 act provides for a reduction in statutory damages when an infringer proves he was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright but the statute establishes no general exemption for those who believe their infringing activities are legal moreover such an exemption would be meaningless in a case such as this in which prospective relief is sought once a court has established that the copying at issue is infringement the defendants are necessarily aware of that fact for the future it is undisputed in this case that sony had reason to know the betamax would be used by some owners to tape copyrighted works off the air see 480 f supp at 459460

the district court also concluded that sony had not caused induced or contributed materially to any infringing activities of betamax owners id at 460 in a case of this kind however causation can be shown indirectly it does not depend on evidence that particular betamax owners relied on particular advertisements in an analogous case decided just two terms ago this court approved a lower courts conclusion that liability for contributory trademark infringement could be imposed on a manufacturer who suggested even by implication that a retailer use the manufacturers goods to infringe the trademark of another inwood laboratories inc v ives laboratories inc 456 us 844 851 1982 see id at 860 opinion concurring in result i think this standard is equally appropriate in the copyright context

the district court found that sony has advertised the betamax as suitable for offtheair recording of favorite shows novels for television and classic movies 480 f supp at 436 with no visible warning that such recording 464 us 417 490   could constitute copyright infringement it is only with the aid of the betamax or some other vtr that it is possible today for home television viewers to infringe copyright by recording offtheair offtheair recording is not only a foreseeable use for the betamax but indeed is its intended use under the circumstances i agree with the court of appeals that if offtheair recording is an infringement of copyright sony has induced and materially contributed to the infringing conduct of betamax owners 40

b
sony argues that the manufacturer or seller of a product used to infringe is absolved from liability whenever the product can be put to any substantial noninfringing use brief for petitioners 4142 the district court so held borrowing the staple article of commerce doctrine governing liability for contributory infringement of patents see 35 usc 271 41 this court today is much less positive see ante 464 us 417 491   at 440442 i do not agree that this technical judgemade doctrine of patent law based in part on considerations irrelevant to the field of copyright see generally dawson chemical co v rohm  haas co 448 us 176 187 199 1980 should be imported wholesale into copyright law despite their common constitutional source see us const art i 8 cl 8 patent and copyright protections have not developed in a parallel fashion and this court in copyright cases in the past has borrowed patent concepts only sparingly see bobbsmerrill co v straus 210 us 339 345 346 1908

i recognize however that many of the concerns underlying the staple article of commerce doctrine are present in copyright law as well as the district court noted if liability for contributory infringement were imposed on the manufacturer or seller of every product used to infringe  a typewriter a camera a photocopying machine  the wheels of commerce would be blocked 480 f supp at 461 see also kalem co v harper brothers 222 us at 62

i therefore conclude that if a significant portion of the products use is noninfringing the manufacturers and sellers cannot be held contributorily liable for the products infringing uses see ante at 440441 if virtually all of the products use however is to infringe contributory liability may be imposed if no one would buy the product for noninfringing purposes alone it is clear that the manufacturer is purposely profiting from the infringement and that liability is appropriately imposed in such a case the copyright owners monopoly would not be extended beyond its proper bounds the manufacturer of such a product contributes to the infringing activities of others and profits directly thereby while 464 us 417 492   providing no benefit to the public sufficient to justify the infringement

the court of appeals concluded that sony should be held liable for contributory infringement reasoning that videotape recorders are manufactured advertised and sold for the primary purpose of reproducing television programming and virtually all television programming is copyrighted material 659 f2d at 975 while i agree with the first of these propositions 42 the second for me is problematic the key question is not the amount of television programming that is copyrighted but rather the amount of vtr usage that is infringing 43 moreover the parties and their amici have argued vigorously about both the amount of television programming that is covered by copyright and the amount for which permission to copy has been given the proportion of vtr recording that is infringing is ultimately a question of fact 44 and the district court specifically declined to make 464 us 417 493   findings on the percentage of legal versus illegal homeuse recording 480 f supp at 468 in light of my view of the law resolution of this factual question is essential i therefore would remand the case for further consideration of this by the district court

vi
the court has adopted an approach very different from the one i have outlined it is my view that the courts approach alters dramatically the doctrines of fair use and contributory infringement as they have been developed by congress and the courts should congress choose to respond to the courts decision the old doctrines can be resurrected as it stands however the decision today erodes much of the coherence that these doctrines have struggled to achieve

the courts disposition of the case turns on its conclusion that timeshifting is a fair use because both parties agree that timeshifting is the primary use of vtrs that conclusion if correct would settle the issue of sonys liability under almost any definition of contributory infringement the court concludes that timeshifting is fair use for two reasons each is seriously flawed

the courts first reason for concluding that timeshifting is fair use is its claim that many copyright holders have no objection to timeshifting and that respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for their programs ante at 442 the court explains that a finding of contributory infringement would inevitably frustrate the interests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience that is available only through timeshifting 464 us 417 494   ante at 446 such reasoning however simply confuses the question of liability with the difficulty of fashioning an appropriate remedy it may be that an injunction prohibiting the sale of vtrs would harm the interests of copyright holders who have no objection to others making copies of their programs but such concerns should and would be taken into account in fashioning an appropriate remedy once liability has been found remedies may well be available that would not interfere with authorized timeshifting at all the court of appeals mentioned the possibility of a royalty payment that would allow vtr sales and timeshifting to continue unabated and the parties may be able to devise other narrowly tailored remedies sony may be able for example to build a vtr that enables broadcasters to scramble the signal of individual programs and jam the unauthorized recording of them even were an appropriate remedy not available at this time the court should not misconstrue copyright holders rights in a manner that prevents enforcement of them when through development of better techniques an appropriate remedy becomes available 45   464 us 417 495

the courts second stated reason for finding that sony is not liable for contributory infringement is its conclusion that even unauthorized timeshifting is fair use ante at 447 et seq this conclusion is even more troubling the court begins by suggesting that the fair use doctrine operates as a general equitable rule of reason that interpretation mischaracterizes the doctrine and simply ignores the language of the statute section 107 establishes the fair use doctrine for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching    scholarship or research these are all productive uses it is true that the legislative history states repeatedly that the doctrine must be applied flexibly on a casebycase basis but those references were only in the context of productive uses such a limitation on fair use comports with its purpose which is to facilitate the creation of new works there is no indication that the fair use doctrine has any application for purely personal consumption on the scale involved in this case 46 and the courts application of it here deprives fair use of the major cohesive force that has guided evolution of the doctrine in the past 464 us 417 496

having bypassed the initial hurdle for establishing that a use is fair the court then purports to apply to timeshifting the four factors explicitly stated in the statute the first is the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 1071 the court confidently describes timeshifting as a noncommercial nonprofit activity it is clear however that personal use of programs that have been copied without permission is not what 1071 protects the intent of the section is to encourage users to engage in activities the primary benefit of which accrues to others timeshifting involves no such humanitarian impulse it is likewise something of a mischaracterization of timeshifting to describe it as noncommercial in the sense that that term is used in the statute as one commentator has observed timeshifting is noncommercial in the same sense that stealing jewelry and wearing it  instead of reselling it  is noncommercial 47 purely consumptive uses are certainly not what the fair use doctrine was designed to protect and the awkwardness of applying the statutory language to timeshifting only makes clearer that fair use was designed to protect only uses that are productive

the next two statutory factors are all but ignored by the court  though certainly not because they have no applicability the second factor  the nature of the copyrighted work  strongly supports the view that timeshifting is an infringing use the rationale guiding application of this factor is that certain types of works typically those involving more of diligence than of originality or inventiveness new york times co v roxbury data interface inc 434 f supp 217 221 nj 1977 require less copyright protection than other original works thus for example informational 464 us 417 497   works such as news reports that readily lend themselves to productive use by others are less protected than creative works of entertainment sonys own surveys indicate that entertainment shows account for more than 80 of the programs recorded by betamax owners 48

the third statutory factor  the amount and substantiality of the portion used  is even more devastating to the courts interpretation it is undisputed that virtually all vtr owners record entire works see 480 f supp at 454 thereby creating an exact substitute for the copyrighted original fair use is intended to allow individuals engaged in productive uses to copy small portions of original works that will facilitate their own productive endeavors timeshifting bears no resemblance to such activity and the complete duplication that it involves might alone be sufficient to preclude a finding of fair use it is little wonder that the court has chosen to ignore this statutory factor 49

the fourth factor requires an evaluation of the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work this is the factor upon which the court focuses but once again the court has misread the statute as mentioned above the statute requires a court to consider the effect of the use on the potential market for the copyrighted work the court has struggled mightily to show that vtr use has not reduced the value of the studios copyrighted works in their present markets even if true that showing only begins the proper inquiry the development 464 us 417 498   of the vtr has created a new market for the works produced by the studios that market consists of those persons who desire to view television programs at times other than when they are broadcast and who therefore purchase vtr recorders to enable them to timeshift 50 because timeshifting of the studios copyrighted works involves the copying of them however the studios are entitled to share in the benefits of that new market those benefits currently go to sony through betamax sales respondents therefore can show harm from vtr use simply by showing that the value of their copyrights would increase if they were compensated for the copies that are used in the new market the existence of this effect is selfevident

because of the courts conclusion concerning the legality of timeshifting it never addresses the amount of noninfringing use that a manufacturer must show to absolve itself from liability as a contributory infringer thus it is difficult to discuss how the courts test for contributory infringement would operate in practice under a proper analysis of timeshifting one aspect of the test as it is formulated by the court however particularly deserves comment the court explains that a manufacturer of a product is not liable for contributory infringement as long as the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses ante at 442 emphasis supplied such a definition essentially eviscerates the concept of contributory infringement only the most unimaginative manufacturer would be unable to demonstrate that a imageduplicating product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses surely congress desired to prevent the sale of products that are used almost exclusively to infringe copyrights 464 us 417 499   the fact that noninfringing uses exist presumably would have little bearing on that desire

more importantly the rationale for the courts narrow standard of contributory infringement reveals that once again the court has confused the issue of liability with that of remedy the court finds that a narrow definition of contributory infringement is necessary in order to protect the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce ante at 442 but application of the contributory infringement doctrine implicates such rights only if the remedy attendant upon a finding of liability were an injunction against the manufacture of the product in question the issue of an appropriate remedy is not before the court at this time but it seems likely that a broad injunction is not the remedy that would be ordered it is unfortunate that the court has allowed its concern over a remedy to infect its analysis of liability

vii
the court of appeals having found sony liable remanded for the district court to consider the propriety of injunctive or other relief because of my conclusion as to the issue of liability i too would not decide here what remedy would be appropriate if liability were found i concur however in the court of appeals suggestion that an award of damages or continuing royalties or even some form of limited injunction may well be an appropriate means of balancing the equities in this case 51 although i express no view on the merits 464 us 417 500   of any particular proposal i am certain that if sony were found liable in this case the district court would be able to fashion appropriate relief the district court might conclude of course that a continuing royalty or other equitable relief is not feasible the studios then would be relegated to statutory damages for proven instances of infringement but the difficulty of fashioning relief and the possibility that complete relief may be unavailable should not affect our interpretation of the statute

like so many other problems created by the interaction of copyright law with a new technology there can be no really satisfactory solution to the problem presented here until congress acts twentieth century music corp v aiken 422 us at 167 dissenting opinion but in the absence of a congressional solution courts cannot avoid difficult problems by refusing to apply the law we must take the copyright act    as we find it fortnightly corp v united artists television inc 392 us at 401 402 and do as little damage as possible to traditional copyright principles    until the congress legislates id at 404 dissenting opinion

 footnote 1  the betamax has three primary components a tuner that receives television rf signals broadcast over the airwaves an adapter that converts the rf signals into audiovideo signals and a recorder that places the audiovideo signals on magnetic tape sony also manufactures vtrs without builtin tuners these are capable of playing back prerecorded tapes and recording home movies on videotape but cannot record off the air since the betamax has its own tuner it can be used to record off one channel while another channel is being watched

the betamax is available with auxiliary features including a timer a pause control and a fastforward control these allow betamax owners to record programs without being present to avoid if they are present recording commercial messages and to skip over commercials while playing back the recording videotape is reusable the user erases its record by recording over it

 footnote 2  this case involves only the home recording for home use of television programs broadcast free over the airwaves no issue is raised concerning cable or pay television or the sharing or trading of tapes

 footnote 3  at the trial the studios proved 32 individual instances where their copyrighted works were recorded on betamax vtrs two of these instances occurred after january 1 1978 the primary effective date of the 1976 act all the others occurred while the 1909 act was still effective my analysis focuses primarily on the 1976 act but the principles governing copyright protection for these works are the same under either act

notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 the fair use of a copyrighted work including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching including multiple copies for classroom use scholarship or research is not an infringement of copyright in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
1 the purpose and character of the use including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes
2 the nature of the copyrighted work
3 the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and

 footnote 11  the library photocopying provisions of 108 do not excuse any person who requests a copy from a library if the requesters use exceeds fair use 108f2 moreover a library is absolved from liability for the 464 us 417 465   unsupervised use of its copying equipment provided that the equipment bears a notice informing users that the making of a copy may violate the copyright law 108f1

 footnote 12  for example the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an individual as a free service for a blind person would be a fair use as would a single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a calligrapher for a single client or a single reproduction of excerpts from a copyrighted work by a student calligrapher or teacher in a learning situation 1975 senate report 6667 see 1976 house report 7374 application of 464 us 417 466   the fair use doctrine in these situations of course would be unnecessary if the 1976 act created a general exemption for the making of a single copy

 footnote 13  professor latman made special mention of the personal use issue because the area was one that has become disturbed by recent developments     photoduplication devices may make authors and publishers groups apprehensive the copyright charter recently approved by the international confederation of societies of authors and composers emphasizes the concern of authors over private uses which because of technological developments are said to be competing seriously with the authors economic interests latman fair use study 3334

 footnote 16  in williams  wilkins co v united states 203 ct cl 74 487 f2d 1345 1973 affd by an equally divided court 420 us 376 1975 decided during the process of the revision of the copyright statutes the court of claims suggested that copying for personal use might be outside the scope of copyright protection under the 1909 act the court reasoned that because hand copying for personal use has always been regarded as permissible and because the practice of making personal copies continued after typewriters and photostat machines were developed the making of personal copies by means other than hand copying should be 464 us 417 468   permissible as well 203 ct cl at 8488 487 f2d at 13501352

there appear to me to be several flaws in this reasoning first it is by no means clear that the making of a hand copy of an entire work is permissible the most that can be said is that there is no reported case on the subject possibly because no copyright owner ever thought it worthwhile to sue see latman fair use study 1112 3 m nimmer copyright 1305e4a 1983 at least one early treatise asserted that infringement would result if an individual made copies for his personal use even in his own handwriting as there is no rule of law excepting manuscript copies from the law of infringement a weil american copyright law 1066 1917 second hand copying or even copying by typewriter is selflimiting the drudgery involved in making hand copies ordinarily ensures that only necessary and fairly small portions of a work are taken it is unlikely that any user would make a hand copy as a substitute for one that could be purchased the harm to the copyright owner from hand copying thus is minimal the recent advent of inexpensive and readily available copying machines however has changed the dimensions of the problem see registers second supplementary report ch iii p 3 hearings on h r 2223 before the subcommittee on courts civil liberties and the administration of justice of the house committee on the judiciary 94th cong 1st sess 194 1975 1975 house hearings remarks of rep danielson id at 234 statement of robert w cairns id at 250 remarks of rep danielson id at 354 testimony of irwin karp id at 467 testimony of rondo cameron id at 1795 testimony of barbara ringer register of copyrights thus the supposition that there is no tort involved in a scholar copying a copyrighted text by hand does not much advance the question of machine copying b kaplan an unhurried view of copyright 101102 1967

 footnote 18  a work is performed publicly if it takes place at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered 101

 footnote 19  one purpose of the exemption for private performances was to permit the home viewing of lawfully made videotapes the register noted in 1961 that new technical devices will probably make it practical in the future to reproduce televised motion pictures in the home we do not believe the private use of such a reproduction can or should be precluded by copyright registers 1961 report 30 emphasis added the register did not suggest that the private making of a reproduction of a televised motion picture would be permitted by the copyright law the register later reminded congress that in general the concept of performance must be distinguished sharply from the reproduction of copies registers supplementary report 22

 footnote 20  during hearings on this provision representative danielson inquired whether it would apply to works of fiction such as gone with the wind or whether it was limited to strictly technical types of information the 464 us 417 470   uncontradicted response was that it would apply only in general terms of science    and the useful arts 1975 house hearings 251 testimony of robert w cairns cf id at 300 statement of harry rosenfield we are not asking    for the right to copy gone with the wind

 footnote 21  the mention in the senate and house reports of situations in which copies for private use would be permissible under the fair use doctrine  for example the making of a free copy for a blind person 1975 senate report 66 1976 house report 73 or the recordings of performances by music students for purposes of analysis and criticism 1975 senate report 63  would be superfluous as well see n 12 supra

 footnote 22  the following exchange took place during the testimony of barbara ringer then assistant register of copyrights

rep biester    i can tell you i must have a small pirate in my own home my son has a cassette tape recorder and as a particular record becomes a hit he will retrieve it onto his little set    this legislation of course would not point to his activities would it
miss ringer i think the answer is clearly no it would not i have spoken at a couple of seminars on video cassettes lately and this question is usually asked what about the home recorders the answer i have given and will give again is that this is something you cannot control you simply cannot control it my own opinion whether this is philosophical dogma or not is that sooner or later there is going to be a crunch here but that is not what this legislation is addressed to and i do not see the crunch coming in the immediate future    i do not see anybody going into anyones home and preventing this sort of thing or forcing legislation that would engineer a piece of equipment not to allow home taping hearings on s 646 and h r 6927 before subcommittee no 3 of the house committee on the judiciary 92d cong 1st sess 2223 1971 1971 house hearings
 footnote 23  shortly before passage of the bill a colloquy took place between representative kastenmeier chairman of the house subcommittee that produced the bill and representative kazen who was not on the subcommittee

mr kazen am i correct in assuming that the bill protects copyrighted material that is duplicated for commercial purposes only
mr kastenmeier yes
mr kazen in other words if your child were to record off of a program which comes through the air on the radio or television and then used 464 us 417 472   it for her own personal pleasure for listening pleasure this use would not be included under the penalties of this bill
mr kastenmeier this is not included in the bill i am glad the gentleman raises the point
on page 7 of the report under home recordings members will note that under the bill the same practice which prevails today is called for namely this is considered both presently and under the proposed law to be fair use the child does not do this for commercial purposes this is made clear in the report 117 cong rec 3474834749 1971
 footnote 24  the 1909 acts grant of an exclusive right to copy 1a was of no assistance to the owner of a copyright in a sound recording because a reproduction of a sound recording was technically considered not to be a copy see 1971 house hearings 18 testimony of barbara ringer assistant register of copyrights 1971 amendment 1e 85 stat 391 formerly codified as 17 usc 26 for the purposes of specified sections not including 1a but not for any other purpose a reproduction of a sound recording shall be considered to be a copy thereof this concept is carried forward into the 1976 act which distinguishes between copies and phonorecords see n 7 supra

 footnote 25  during consideration of the 1976 act congress of course was well aware of the limited nature of the protection granted to sound recordings 464 us 417 474   under the 1971 amendment see 1975 house hearings 113 testimony of barbara ringer register of copyrights 1971 amendment created a copyright in a sound recording    but limited it to the particular situation of socalled piracy id at 1380 letter from john lorenz acting librarian of congress under 1971 amendment only the unauthorized reproduction and distribution to the public of copies of the sound recording is prohibited thus the duplication of sound recordings for private personal use and the performance of sound recordings through broadcasting or other means are outside the scope of the amendment

 footnote 26  representative kastenmeier the principal house sponsor of the 1976 revision bill and chairman of the house subcommittee that produced it made this explicit on the opening day of the house hearings

from time to time certain areas have not been covered in the bill but is it not the case this being a unified code that the operation of the bill does apply whether or not we specifically deal with a subject or not  
therefore we can really not fail to deal with an issue it will be dealt 464 us 417 475   with one way or the other the code title 17 will cover it so we have made a conscientious decision even by omission  
   
   by virtue of passing this bill we will deal with every issue whether we deal with it completely or not for the purpose of resolving the issues involved is the only question not whether it has dealt with the four corners of the bill because the four corners of the bill will presume to deal with everything in copyright id at 115
 footnote 27  the precise phrase fair use apparently did not enter the case law until 1869 see lawrence v dana 15 f cas 26 60 no 8136 cc mass but the doctrine itself found early expression in folsom v marsh 9 f cas 342 no 4901 cc mass 1841 justice story was faced there with the intricate and embarrassing question whether a biography containing copyrighted letters was a justifiable use of the original materials such as the law recognizes as no infringement of the copyright of the plaintiffs id at 344 348 in determining whether the use was permitted it was necessary said justice story to consider the nature and objects of the selections made the quantity and value of the materials used and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale or diminish the profits or 464 us 417 476   supersede the objects of the original work    much must in such cases depend upon the nature of the new work the value and extent of the copies and the degree in which the original authors may be injured thereby id at 348349

 footnote 34  this point was brought home repeatedly by the register of copyrights mentioning the multitude of technological developments since passage of the 1909 act including remarkable developments in the use of video tape registers supplementary report xivxv the register cautioned

i realize more clearly now than i did in 1961 that the revolution in communications has brought with it a serious challenge to the authors copyright this challenge comes not only from the evergrowing commercial interests who wish to use the authors works for private gain an equally serious attack has come from people with a sincere interest in the public welfare who fully recognize    that the real heart of civilization    owes its existence to the author ironically in seeking to make the authors works widely available by freeing them from copyright restrictions they fail to realize that they are whittling away the very thing that nurtures authorship in the first place an accommodation among conflicting demands must be worked out true enough but not by denying the fundamental constitutional directive to encourage cultural progress by securing the authors exclusive rights to him for a limited time id at xv see 1975 house hearings 117 testimony of barbara ringer register of copyrights
 footnote 35  a vtr owner who has taped a favorite movie for repeated viewing will be less likely to rent or buy a tape containing the same movie watch a televised rerun or pay to see the movie at a theater although timeshifting may not replace theater or rerun viewing or the purchase of prerecorded tapes or discs it may well replace rental usage a vtr user who has recorded a firstrun movie for later viewing will have no need to rent a copy when he wants to see it both librarybuilders and timeshifters may avoid commercials the librarybuilder may use the pause control to record without them and all users may fastforward through commercials on playback

the studios introduced expert testimony that both timeshifting and librarying would tend to decrease their revenue from copyrighted works see 480 f supp at 440 the district courts findings also show substantial librarybuilding and avoidance of commercials both sides submitted surveys showing that the average betamax user owns between 25 and 32 tapes the studios survey showed that at least 40 of users had more than 10 tapes in a library sonys survey showed that more than 40 of users planned to view their tapes more than once and both sides surveys showed that commercials were avoided at least 25 of the time id at 438439

 footnote 37  this intent is manifested further by provisions of the 1976 act that exempt from liability persons who while not participating directly in any infringing activity could otherwise be charged with contributory infringement see 108f1 library not liable for the unsupervised use of reproducing 464 us 417 487   equipment located on its premises provided that certain warnings are posted 1106 governmental body or nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization not liable for infringing performance by concessionaire in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair or exhibition

 footnote 38  in screen gems on which the gershwin court relied the court held that liability could be imposed on a shipper of unauthorized bootleg records and a radio station that broadcast advertisements of the records provided they knew or should have known that the records were infringing the court concluded that the records low price and the manner in which the records were marketed could support a finding of constructive knowledge even if actual knowledge were not shown

courts have premised liability in these cases on the notion that the defendant had the ability to supervise or control the infringing activities see e g shapiro bernstein  co v h l green co 316 f2d 304 307 ca2 1963 keca music inc v dingus mcgees co 432 f supp 72 74 wd mo 1977 this notion however is to some extent fictional the defendant cannot escape liability by instructing the performers not to play copyrighted music or even by inserting a provision to that effect into the performers contract famous music corp v bay state harness horse racing  breeding assn inc 554 f2d at 12141215 keca music inc v dingus mcgees co 432 f supp at 75 shapiro bernstein  co v veltin 47 f supp 648 649 wd la 1942 congress expressly rejected a proposal to exempt proprietors from this type of liability under the 1976 act see 1975 senate report 141142 1976 house report 159160 1975 house hearings 18121813 testimony of barbara ringer register of copyrights id at 1813 colloquy between rep pattison and barbara ringer

the courts attempt to distinguish these cases on the ground of control ante at 437 is obviously unpersuasive the direct infringer ordinarily 464 us 417 489   is not employed by the person held liable instead he is an independent contractor neither is he always an agent of the person held liable screen gems makes this apparent

 footnote 40  my conclusion respecting contributory infringement does not include the retailer defendants the district court found that one of the retailer defendants had assisted in the advertising campaign for the betamax but made no other findings respecting their knowledge of the betamaxs intended uses i do not agree with the court of appeals at least on this record that the retailers are sufficiently engaged in the enterprise to be held accountable 659 f2d 963 976 1981 in contrast the advertising agency employed to promote the betamax was far more actively engaged in the advertising campaign and petitioners have not argued that the agencys liability differs in any way from that of sony corporation and sony corporation of america

 footnote 41  the staple article of commerce doctrine protects those who manufacture products incorporated into or used with patented inventions  for example the paper and ink used with patented printing machines henry v a b dick co 224 us 1 1912 or the dry ice used with patented refrigeration systems carbice corp v american patents corp 283 us 27 1931 because a patent holder has the right to control the use of the patented item as well as its manufacture see motion picture patents co v universal film mfg co 243 us 502 509 510 1917 35 usc 271 a such protection for the manufacturer of the incorporated product is necessary to prevent patent holders from extending their monopolies by 464 us 417 491   suppressing competition in unpatented components and supplies suitable for use with the patented item see dawson chemical co v rohm  haas co 448 us 176 197 198 1980 the doctrine of contributory patent infringement has been the subject of attention by the courts and by congress see id at 202212 and has been codified since 1952 66 stat 792 but was never mentioned during the copyright law revision process as having any relevance to contributory copyright infringement

 footnote 42  although vtrs also may be used to watch prerecorded video cassettes and to make home motion pictures these uses do not require a tuner such as the betamax contains see n 1 supra the studios do not object to sonys sale of vtrs without tuners brief for respondents 5 n 9 in considering the noninfringing uses of the betamax therefore those uses that would remain possible without the betamaxs builtin tuner should not be taken into account

 footnote 43  noninfringing uses would include for example recording works that are not protected by copyright recording works that have entered the public domain recording with permission of the copyright owner and of course any recording that qualifies as fair use see e g bruzzone v miller brewing co 202 uspq 809 nd cal 1979 use of home vtr for market research studies

 footnote 44  sony asserts that much or most television broadcasting is available for home recording because 1 no copyright owner other than the studios has brought an infringement action and 2 much televised material is ineligible for copyright protection because videotapes of the broadcasts are not kept the first of these assertions is irrelevant sonys liability does not turn on the fact that only two copyright owners thus far have brought suit the amount of infringing use must be determined through consideration of the television market as a whole sonys second assertion is based on a faulty premise the copyright office permits audiovisual works 464 us 417 493   transmitted by television to be registered by deposit of sample frames plus a description of the work see 37 cfr 20220c2ii and 20221g 1983 moreover although an infringement action cannot be brought unless the work is registered 17 usc 411a 1982 ed registration is not a condition of copyright protection 408a copying an unregistered work still may be infringement cf 506a liability for criminal copyright infringement not conditioned on prior registration

 footnote 45  even if concern with remedy were appropriate at the liability stage the courts use of the district courts findings is somewhat cavalier the court relies heavily on testimony by representatives of professional sports leagues to the effect that they have no objection to vtr recording the court never states however whether the sports leagues are copyright holders and if so whether they have exclusive copyrights to sports broadcasts it is therefore unclear whether the sports leagues have authority to consent to copying the broadcasts of their events

assuming that the various sports leagues do have exclusive copyrights in some of their broadcasts the amount of authorized timeshifting still would not be overwhelming sonys own survey indicated that only 73 of all betamax use is to record sports events of all kinds tr 2353 defendants exh ot table 20 because sonys witnesses did not represent all forms of sports events moreover this figure provides only a tenuous basis for this court to engage in factfinding of its own

the only witness at trial who was clearly an exclusive copyright owner and who expressed no objection to unauthorized timeshifting was the owner of the copyright in mister rogers neighborhood but the court 464 us 417 495   cites no evidence in the record to the effect that anyone makes vtr copies of that program the simple fact is that the district court made no findings on the amount of authorized timeshifting that takes place the court seems to recognize this gap in its reasoning and phrases its argument as a hypothetical the court states if there are millions of owners of vtrs who make copies of televised sports events religious broadcasts and educational programs such as mister rogers neighborhood and if the proprietors of those programs welcome the practice the sale of vtrs should not be stifled in order to protect respondents copyrights ante at 446 emphasis supplied given that the court seems to recognize that its argument depends on findings that have not been made it seems that a remand is inescapable

 footnote 46  as has been explained some uses of timeshifting such as copying an old newspaper clipping for a friend are fair use because of their de minimis effect on the copyright holder the scale of copying involved in this case of course is of an entirely different magnitude precluding application of such an exception
