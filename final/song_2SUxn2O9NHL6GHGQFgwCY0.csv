i had a bad week
spent the evening pretending it wasnt that deep
you could see in my eyes that it was taking over
i guess i was just blind and caught up in the moment
you know you take all of my stress right down
help me get it off my chest and out
into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
we forget that were here right now

prechorus
cause were livin life at a different pace
stuck in a constant race
keep the pressure on youre bound to break
somethings gotta change
we should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
if were missin out on what the people think is right
seein through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
lose the conversation for the message that youll never read
i think maybe you and me
oh we should head out to the place where the music plays
and then

chorus
well go all night
twosteppin with the woman i love
all my troubles turn to nothin when im in your eyes electrified
well keep turnin up and go all night
oh we had dips and falls in our time
but we know what it feels to be low then up alone then loved
and all we need is us to go all

night night
twosteppin with the woman i love
night yeah
all we need is us

verse 2
what do you reckon is it just me
words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
crisis of confidence it tends to come when i feel the dark and i open my heart
if you dont see it you should trust me
i feel like i got nothin left right now
except this beauty in her dress right now
she got me feelin like the best and the rest are just less than she needs
so we press play and step to the beat

prechorus
cause were livin life at a different pace
stuck in a constant race
keep the pressure on youre bound to break
somethings gotta change
we should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
head out to the place where it plays and

chorus
well go all night
twosteppin with the woman i love
all my troubles turn to nothin when im in your eyes electrified
well keep turnin up and go all night
oh we had dips and falls in our time
but we know what it feels to be low then up alone and loved
and all we need is us to go all
postchorus
night night
twosteppin with the woman i love
night yeah
all we need is us to go all night
night night
twosteppin with the woman i love
night yeah
all we need is us to go all night14embed"
