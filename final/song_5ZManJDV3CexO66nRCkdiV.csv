verse 1
hey girl wassup
i know its late but i knew youd pick it up
naw i aint drunk
okay maybe i do have a little buzz but
that song came on and i just thought
what harm could come from one little call
i know you say youre taken but i say
girl youre takin too long

chorus
to tell him that its over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it cant wait
rip it off just like a bandaid
the way you look at me girl you cant pretend
i know you aint in love with him
break up with him

verse 2
i know you dont wanna break his heart
but that aint no good reason to be
keeping us apart
look just tell him its you it aint him
and maybe you can lie to him and say youll
still be friends
whatever you got to say to get through to him
that you aint in love
cmon you cant deny that you and i
kinda fit like a glove
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
so tell him that its over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it cant wait
rip it off just like a bandaid
it aint my business to be all up in
but i know you aint in love with him
break up with him
i know that you so done with him
break up with him break up with him

verse 3
you wouldve hung up by now
if you werent thinking it too
no pressure whatever
just do what you gotta do
but if i was you

chorus
id tell him that its over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it cant wait
just rip it off just like a bandaid
yeah i know i said it but ill say it again
i know you aint in love with him
break up with him
the way you look at me girl you cant pretend
i know you aint in love with him
break up with him
just break up with him8embed"
