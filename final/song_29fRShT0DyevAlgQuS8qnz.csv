theres a tear in the fabric
of your favorite dress
and im sneaking glances
looking for the patterns in static
they start to make sense
the longer im at it

chorus
ivory lines lead oohwhaho
oohwhaho

verse 2
your heart is a river
that flows from your chest
through every organ
your brain is the dam
and i am the fish
who cant reach the core

chorus
ivory lines lead oohwhaho
oohwhaho

refrain
oh instincts are misleading
you shouldnt think what youre feeling
they dont tell you what you know you should want
