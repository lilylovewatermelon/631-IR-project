i tried my best i gave my all
sometimes my best wasnt good enough for you
sometimes i let you go
sometimes i hurt you so
i know that i can be the meanest person in the world

chorus
so i apologize to you
and to anyone else that i hurt too
i may not be a perfect soul
but i can learn selfcontrol
so pardon me pardon me
pardon me my friend

verse 2
i never thought that anyone
was more important than the plans i made
but now i feel the shame
theres no one else to blame
for all the broken hearts are scattered on the field of war

chorus
so i apologize to you
and to anyone else that i hurt too
i may not be a perfect soul
but i can learn selfcontrol
so pardon me pardon me
pardon me my friend

sometimes i let you go
sometimes i hurt you so
i know that i can be the meanest person in the world

chorus
so i apologize to you
and to anyone else that i hurt too
i may not be a perfect soul
but i can learn selfcontrol
and in my heart i feel its true
so i will be there with you
so pardon me pardon me
pardon me my friend
i really want a friend
pardon me my friend
i really want a friend
pardon me my friend
i really want a friend1embed"
