draco a look of pure fear ahhhhhhhhh ahhh runs away with fang help



harry is left by himself the figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect it advances towards harry who backs up but trips he crawls backwards suddenly there is the sound of hoofbeats a figure leaps over harry and lands near the cloaked figure it is a silver centaur firenze it rears and the cloaked figure retreats flying away



firenze harry potter you must leave you are known to many creatures here the forest is not safe at this time especially for you

harry rises but what was that thing you saved me from

firenze a monstrous creature it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips you will have a halflife a cursed life

harry but who would choose such a life

firenze can you think of no one

harry do you mean to saythat that thing that killed the unicornthat was drinking its bloodthat was voldemort

firenze do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment

harry the philosophers stone

harry the stranger though you and he must have talked

hagrid well he wanted to know what sort of creatures i looked after i told him i said after fluffy a dragons gonna be no problem

harry and did he seem interested in fluffy

hagrid well of course he was interested in fluffy how often do you come across a three headed dog even if youre in the trade but i told him i said the trick with any beast is to know how to calm him take fluffy for example just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep



the three gape

harry how is it i got the stone sir one minute i was staring in the mirror and the next

dumbledore ah you see only a person who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it that is one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something smile both

harry does that mean with the stone gone i mean that voldemort can never come back

dumbledore ah im afraid there are ways in which he can return harry do you know why professor quirrell couldnt bear to have you touch him harry shakes his head it was because of your mother she sacrificed herself for you and that kind of act leaves a mark harry touches his scar no no this kind of mark cannot be seen it lives in your very skin

harry what is it

dumbledore love harry love pats harrys head and stands up ah bertie botts every flavour beans i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one and since then i have lost my liking for them but i think i could be safe with a nice toffeetakes brown bean and eats it mm alas earwax
