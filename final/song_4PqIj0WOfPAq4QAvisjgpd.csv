now you finally tell me how you feel
guess your words just came a little too late
all the drama boy its overkill
dont be mad at me cause youve been replaced

but if you woulda manned up
put your hand up stand up
tell me how you really felt
then maybe itd be different
if you spoke i woulda listened
but now im with somebody else
and he loves me too much for me to mess this up
bet it sucks to be all in your head
wondering where this thing could go but
