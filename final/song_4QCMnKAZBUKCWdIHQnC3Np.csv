intro jayz
i mean
ush is this what it comes to man
this how we gon do it
i mean even grass grow baby you know
seeds become plants boys become men
what we gon do lets lead the way

verse 1 jayz
uh wrapped around all girls like pashminas
whats my demeanor the grass is always greener
on the other side theres thicker thighs cant give a ring up
i couldnt give a fuck how could i give a finger
let alone half bath and closets
so claustrophobic in fear of close objects
now its sort of like twocar garages
its like two broads menagin youre the best mama

verse 2 usher
is there any chance that you remember me being more than just a horrible man
and would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance aw baby
i groomed the days when you were my girl
and i was your man though i took you for granted
but it wasnt til now i see
see usher liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likeprechorus usher
how much i miss you
girl im sorry that i ran the streets acting like a damn fool
but for once here goes the truth
i cant be fake i cant be phony
acting all hard thats for homies thats lonely
i try to flex but i confess
that when you left you took the very best thing

chorus usher
the best thing that ever happened to me
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever seen
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever had
and now all i feel is stress
cause baby when you left you took the very best

verse 3 usher
remember mimi or vita remember iesha or eva i aint got em no more
hey its for naomi and jenny was the same outcome as chilli
girl i let em all go
oooh no more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
woman i been to church and i talked to the bishop
and he wanted me to share this with you
prechorus usher
how much i miss you
im so sorry that i ran the streets acting like a damn fool
but for once here goes the truth
i cant be fake i cant be phony
acting all hard thats for homies thats lonely
i try to flex but i confess
that when you left you took the very best thing

chorus usher
the best thing that ever happened to me
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever seen
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever had
and now all i feel is stress
cause baby when you left you took the very best

verse 4 jayz
uh momma try to told me hovi hov to slow it down
you gon lose your best thing if you keep getting round
like pac need a partner when you old to hold you down
ma forever young was forever numb
sorry stacy sorry dawn amillion and all of them
all of them was for their time it wasnt you it was him
school me once school me twice three times i was dumb
now its so plain to see to me i got the one
youre the best mama
prechorus usher
i cant be fake i cant be phony
acting all hard thats for homies thats lonely
i try to flex but i confess
that when you left you took the very best thing

chorus usher
the best thing that ever happened to me
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever seen
you took the best thing
the best thing that i ever had
and now all i feel is stress
cause baby when you left you took the very bestembed"
