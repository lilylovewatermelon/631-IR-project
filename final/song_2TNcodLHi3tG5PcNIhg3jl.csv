im holding on to white balloons
up against a sky of doom
tell me you see them
cause whats inside of me is invisible to most
even in clear view
im sending out a signal to the possibility of you
cause right at this moment
i know youre connected to a part of me that i dont even know myself
the changes in me
are likely to be like the weather
stormy and clear strength into fear bound together

verse 2
but ill break my silence
if i believed that you and me could ever be
more than just whats been behind us
i tried and left they came and went
i got rejected out again
but no one believes me
ive worn a hundred faces
of the character replacements and now
nobody sees me
the changes in me
are likely to be like the weather
cloudy at best

angels
lift me
are you
with me
im holding onto you like
im holding onto white balloons
carry me away
i hope that you dont break

angels
lift me
are you
with me
im holding onto you like
im holding onto white balloons
carry me away
i hope that you dont break
i hope that you dont break
dont break

outro
cause whats inside of me is invisible to most
even in clear viewembed"
