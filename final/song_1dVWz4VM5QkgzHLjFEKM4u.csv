i thought i saw him on the video
a trance is keepin him under
i know that god is in the radio
chchchcheckin the station
the narcotic from me to you
just call in the medium
i know you hear it i hear it too
its everywhere that i go

chorus josh homme
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong

verse 2 mark lanegan
they say the devil is paranoid
always tryin to cover
but god is leakin through the stereo
between the station to station
you believe it i know you do
you wont admit it or say so
i know that god is in the radio
just repeatin a slogan
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus josh homme
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong
you come back another day
and do no wrong
