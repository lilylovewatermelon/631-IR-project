crowds that scream at superstars
where bouncers show their battle scars
ive been the first to sign on every wall
down the road and round the bend
we pray to god it never ends
ive been ive seen weve screamed to everyone

chorus
well see you at the show
if you dont come well never know
you stand off in the back
you still stand out while you wearing black
jump onto the bus
and ride around with all of us
well go out on the town
and light it up till we burn it down burn it down

verse 2
after hours and alcohol
every club weve seen em all
as long as we dont need to stand in line
party scenes and billboard dreams
the ladies love those limousines
you know theyre gonna show up every time
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likechorus
well see you at the show
if you dont come well never know
you stand off in the back
you still stand out while you wearing black
jump onto the bus
and ride around with all of us
well go out on the town
and light it up till we burn it down burn it down
