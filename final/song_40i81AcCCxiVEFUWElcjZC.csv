and it is from this world of darkness which come the evil destructive forces of mans nature

verse 1
youve got me shaking from the way youre talking
my heart is breaking but theres no use crying
what a cyanide surprise you have left for my eyes
if i had common sense id cut myself or curl up and die

prechorus
sticks and stones could break my bones
but anything you say will only fuel my lungs

chorus
dont mind us were just spilling our guts
if this is love i dont wanna be loved
you pollute the room with a filthy tongue
watch me choke it down so i can throw it up
dont mind us were just spilling our guts
if this is love i dont wanna be hanging by the neck
before an audience of death

verse 2
you could be the corpse and i could be the killer
if i could be the devil then you could be the sinner
you could be the drugs and i could be the dealer
everything you said is like music to my ears
you could be the corpse and i could be the killer
if i could be the devil then you could be the sinner
you could be the drugs then i could be the dealer
everything you said is like music to my music to my ears
