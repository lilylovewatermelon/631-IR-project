my ambitions as a rider is to drive right off a fuckin cliff
road stay froze in cold weather
the now leopard dont even grip
floatin in the ocean rollercoastin watch the fuckin dip
pistol whip yo fuckin lips
split you with the fuckin clip
ui ui ui uicideboy bitch
lick the one who whips the brick
who am who am i boy
slit your wrist ill add you to the list ruby does not exist

verse 2 lick loth
raised by the schizos right next to your bed when i tiptoe
tenfour im the psycho michael
lights low til them guns make a light show
oz of the og
fade a fade away with the night breeze
black black glocks in the trunk
face a whole blunt now i dont give a fuck
im in the 7th rollin car might be stolen
bitch my carrys open locing jocsin
my blunt be swollen always smokin
i be that slave with the gold chain
ridin in the getaway
throw another bitch away
