the glove compartment
is inaccurately named
and everybody knows it
so im suggesting
a swift orderly change

chorus 1
and we will vote
and pick the best one thats proposed
and then demand
that its definition stand
cause we wont rest
until the old one is erased
alright
lets begin tonight

verse 2
i was searching
for some legal document
and everybody knows it
weve stumbled upon
pictures i tried to forget
and thats how this idea
was drilled into my head
its too important
to stay the way its been
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likechorus 2
cause its a shame
the way that love can slowly fade
and when its gone
its like it wasnt there at all
and you are left
with disappointment and regrets
that bind
and keep you up at night
that keep you up at night

instrumental break

chorus 2
cause its a shame
the way that love can slowly fade
and when its gone
its like it wasnt there at all
and you are left
with disappointment and regrets
that bind
and keep you up at night
that keep you up at nightembed"
