i know youre hurt i know its my fault
but ive kept im sorry locked in a vault
i know that time just keeps going on
and words by themselves cant right all the wrongs
in a world thats gone crazy you dont know whats true
most people dont change but some people do

chorus
some people quit drinking too much
and some people quit lying
some people decide to grow up
but its never good timing
most wouldnt forgive what i put you through
but im here tonight hoping some people do

verse 2
some people say sorry to hear its okay
but i know its not so you dont have to say
that you understand cause i know you dont
and neither do i that dont mean that i wont
try everyday to show you the truth
most people dont change but some people do

chorus
some people quit drinking too much
and some people quit lying
some people decide to grow up
but its never good timing
most wouldnt forgive what i put you through
but im here tonight hoping some people do
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
so whether you kiss me or you close the door
just know that im better than i was before

chorus
some people quit drinking too much
and some people quit lying
some people decide to grow up
but its never good timing
most wouldnt forgive what i put you through
but im here tonight hoping some people do
im hoping some people do5embed"
