origami or or or ri o or ri

verse 1
you got a head full of paper
but baby nothing like origami
shredded thoughts and make up
wont make up for the missing piece of mind
i saw you look in the mirror
the scenery was suddenly boring
its the end of an era
forever is just a state of mind
youre last of your kind

chorus
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do about it do about it

verse 2
you were blessed with precision
so i took you to the beaches of bali
it wasnt fate but decision
luck was choosing sides
you might also likeflip the page to a silver age
life has treated you kindly
the price you pay is your vision
collision is highly likely

chorus
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do about it do about it

i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do about it do about it

chorus
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do about it do about it
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you gonna do about it do about it3embed"
