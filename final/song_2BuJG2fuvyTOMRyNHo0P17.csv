verse 1 nelly
top down theres a road down the back street
shot gun with a twin in the back seat
no one with them two its just me
pull up to the club like a pimp c
shouts out to the playas in the vip
hey dj yeah you remember me
its the nigga with the same group from the last week
and we be and we be
popping bottles making noise
on the tables on the bars
shooting game at every broad
tell the girls to freak them boys
