its a hot night the natives are restless
were sweating by the light of the moon
theres a voodoo mojo brewing at the gogo
that could knock a witch off her broom
we slither on in and shed our skin
make our way into the bump and the grind
so im passing by she gives me the eye
so i stop to give her a light

na na na na nana nanana nanana alright

chorus
one wild night blinded by the moonlight
one wild night 24 hours of midnight
one wild night i stepped into the twilight zone
and she left my heart with vertigo
one wild one wild one wild one wild night

verse 2
having as much fun as you can in your clothes
margarita had me feeling alright
it just might be that i found religion
ive been on my knees for half of the night
then im rolling the bones with jimmy no dice
gonna take him for a couple weeks pay
man if you lose this roll i take your girlfriend home
so i stopped
spoken but youre not going to believe who comes walking out
