verse mf doom
villain get the money like curls
they just tryin to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
land of milk and honey with the swirls
where reckless naked girls get necklaces of pearls
compliments of the town jeweler
left back nowschooler tryna sound cooler
on the microphone known as the crown ruler
never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
fivehundred somethin dollars layin right there in the street
huh now lets try and get somethin to eat
then he turned four and started flowin to the poor
thats about when he first started going raw
kept the dro in the drawer
a rhymin klepto who couldnt go up in the store no more
his life is like a folklore legend
why you so stiff you need to smoke more bredren
instead of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
yup you know it growin up too fast
showin up to class with moet in a flask
he ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
his girl is home alone he tryin to get the 
if you want a sip get a paper water fountain glass
how im posed to know where your mouth been last
hands so fast he can outspin flash
known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
boombash leave the room with the stash
assume its in a smash doom get the cashyou might also like50embed"
