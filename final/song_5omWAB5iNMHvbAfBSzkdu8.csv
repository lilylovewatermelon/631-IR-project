define your meanin of war
to me its what we do when were bored
i feel the heat comin off of the blacktop
and it makes me want it more
because im hyped up out of control
if its a fight im ready to go
i wouldnt put my money on the other guy
if you know what i know that i know

chorus
its been a long time comin
and the tables turned around
cause one of us is goin
one of us is goin down
im not runnin
its a little different now
cause one of us is goin
one of us is goin down

verse 2
define your meanin of fun
is it fuckin druggin or guns
i feel the heat comin off of the blacktop
so get ready for another one
lets take a trip down memory lane
the words circlin in my brain
you can treat this like another all the same
but dont cry like a bitch when you feel the pain
you might also likechorus
its been a long time comin
and the tables turned around
cause one of us is going
one of us is goin down
im not runnin
its a little different now
cause one of us is goin
one of us is goin down

bridge
this is hardly worth fightin for
but its the little petty shit that i cant ignore
when my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor
itll be a long time comin
but you got the message now
cause i was never goin
yeah youre the one thats goin down

outro
one of us is goin down
im not running
its a little different now
cause one of us is goin
one of us is going dow
one of us is going dow
