ooh
oh

verse 1
ghost in the mirror
i knew your face once but now its unclear
and i cant feel my body now
i separate from here and now

break
ooh
oh

verse 2
a drug and a dream
a lost connection oh come back to me
so i can feel alive again
as soul and body try to mend

chorus
its pulling me apart this time
everything is neverending
i slipped into a parallel
theyll never understand
this feeling always gets away
wishing i could hold on longer
why does it have to feel so strange
to be in love again be in love again be in love again
