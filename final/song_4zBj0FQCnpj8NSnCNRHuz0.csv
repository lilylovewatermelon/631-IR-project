tellin too many lies
im gonna have to build them
a city in the sky
where i can fly away yeah

a city so high
wont have it no other way no
i sure aint gonna miss
the city i leave behind
drag out the drag
its blowin my mind away

theres been too many children
with tears in their eyes
were gonna build them
a city in the sky
where they can fly away

a city so high
wont have it no other way
they sure aint gonna miss
the city they leave behind
drag out the drag
its blowin their minds away
