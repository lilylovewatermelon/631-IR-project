kiss you off my lips
i dont need another tube of that dime store lipstick
well i think im gonna buy me a brand new shade of man
kiss you off my lips
its standing room only for a piece of my pigment

kiss you off for a custom shine
pissed yours truly off this time
its why i aint just kissin you im kissin you off
im kissin you off

that crack in your veneer
some blue broad will spoil your rod
it just takes patience dear
they rush you for your life

its standing room only for a piece of my pigment

kiss you off these lips of mine
kiss you off for a custom shine
pissed yours truly off this time
its why i aint just kissin you im kissin you off
