my pet peeve is a camera in my face
have you ever heard of personal space
i walk around town in a hoodie and some shades
but now they startin to recognize the shades
even if you hate me you would trade
you would live this life too cause i got it made
i like my bed made soon enough ill have a maid
when i buy a house every surface gon be suede
but for now i got a concierge downstairs
all my neighbors arе grayhaired
they dont recognizе me and i dont think they care
but my postmates cant believe that i stay here fuck
i wanna go back to kentucky and shut down the state fair
visit my old teachers and tell em to take care
i might take a whip instead of payin the plane fare
i still remember the way there
aint a girl in my hometown i cant have now
buy a building in cash aint puttin half down
the hate used to get to me i just laugh now
yeah they fuckin with jack now
look how they act now
look how they act now
look how they act now
look how they act now
they fuckin with jack now they fuckin with—

verse 2
baby im comin home i know the kids miss me
i need some time with my friends to sip whiskey
i spent the last twelve months locked in
but tonight im content with existing
2015 we was on that pen griffey
i wanted what he had but the shoes didnt fit me
now the city with me and i got the kids listening
and im a smooth operator by instinct
word to sade walkin round broad day
like hey with the windows down im on broadway
and it was just a day ago i was in diego like the damn padres
now im at my grandparents lettin my grandpa say
what he wants to say
cause nowadays im in the paper once a day
and it aint always positive its a bunch of things
but fuck it man i done graduated from younger days
and if i aint runnin things soon ill be runnin things
im an artist man you just make fun of things
im the hardest man yall dont know what to say
this albums a museum so please dont touch a thing
its okay to give me props dont make it such a pain
its okay to give me top dont make it such a thing
dont get offended if we met and i say whats your name
i been flyin round the country for three hundred days
but i aint bout to justify how i adjust to fame
fuck the fame from the jump we aint been cut the same
i got so much but i still think about whats unobtained
never been the type for wantin things
i want power i want power
i want my life to speed up a couple miles per hour
i want my dogs to know that this shit is ours
i want respect i dont want flowers
i know they gon quote this
the flow dont make no sense the pocket is potent
it used to be potential but now its some grown shit
damn that boy floatin he treat them beats like they oceans
all these people wanna greet like we old friends
i aint holdin back tell the media hold this
i know i said i miss you but i secretly dont miss
i got stories and im bringin em home with me
