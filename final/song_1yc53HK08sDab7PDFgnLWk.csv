if there was a single day i could live
a single breath i could take
id trade all the others away

verse 1
the bloods on the wall
so youd might as well just admit it
and bleach out the stains
commit to forgetting it
youre better off empty and blank
than left with a single pathetic trace of this

prechorus
smother another failure
lay this to rest

chorus
console yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself

verse 2
ill chain you to the truth
for the truth shall set you free
ill turn the screws of vengeance
and bury you with honesty
ill make all your dreams come to life
then slay them as quickly as they came

smother another failure
lay this to rest

chorus
console yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself see who gives a fuck
absorb yourself youre better alone
destroy yourself

bridge
see who gives a fuck
see who gives a fuck
see who gives a fuck
failure

outro
if there was a day i could live
if there was a single breath i could take
id trade all the others away
id trade all the others away8embed"
