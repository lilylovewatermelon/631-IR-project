what do i do to ignore them behind me
do i follow my instincts blindly
do i hide my pride from these bad dreams
and give in to sad thoughts that are maddening
do i sit here and try to stand it
or do i try to catch them redhanded
do i trust some and get fooled by phoniness
or do i trust nobody and live in loneliness
because i cant hold on when im stretched so thin
i make the right moves but im lost within
i put on my daily façade but then
i just end up gettin hurt again

prechorus mike shinoda  chester bennington
by myself myself i ask why
but in my mind i find i cant rely on myself
myself i ask why
but in my mind i find i cant rely on myself

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
i cant hold on to what i want when im stretched so thin
its all too much to take in
i cant hold on to anything watchin everything spin
with thoughts of failure sinking in

if i turn my back im defenseless
and to go blindly seems senseless
if i hide my pride and let it all go on
then theyll take from me til everything is gone
if i let them go ill be outdone
but if i try to catch em ill be outrun
if im killed by the questions like a cancer
then ill be buried in the silence of the answer

prechorus mike shinoda  chester bennington
by myself myself i ask why
but in my mind i find i cant rely on myself
myself i ask why
but in my mind i find i cant rely on myself

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
i cant hold on to what i want when im stretched so thin
its all too much to take in
i cant hold on to anything watchin everything spin
with thoughts of failure sinking in

interlude mike shinoda
how do you think ive lost so much
im so afraid im out of touch
how do you expect i will know what to do
when all i know is what you tell me to
bridge mike shinoda  chester bennington
dont you know
i cant tell you how to make it go
no matter what i do how hard i try
i cant seem to convince myself why
im stuck on the outside dont you know
i cant tell you how to make it go
no matter what i do how hard i try
i cant seem to convince myself why
im stuck on the outside

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
i cant hold on to what i want when im stretched so thin
its all too much to take in
i cant hold on to anything watchin everything spin
with thoughts of failure sinking in
i cant hold on to what i want when im stretched so thin
its all too much to take in
i cant hold on to anything watchin everything spin
with thoughts of failure sinking16embed"
