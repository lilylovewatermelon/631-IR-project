i used to come home late and not a minute too soon
barking like a dog howling at the moon
youd be mad as an ol red hen up all night wonderin where id been
id fall down and say come help me honey
you laughed out loud i guess you thought it was funny
but i sobered up and i got to thinkin
girl you aint much fun since i quit drinkin

verse 2
now im paintin the house and im mendin the fence
i guess i gone out and lost all my good sense
too much work is hard for your health
i couldve died drinkin now im killing myself
and im feedin the dog sackin the trash
its honey do this honey do that
i sobered up and i got to thinkin
girl you aint much fun since i quit drinkin

verse 3
now im fixin the sink and im mowin the grass
you made me a list and im bustin my well
all broke down tailspin draggin
its a rough ol life up here on the wagon
now im feedin the dog sackin the trash
its honey do this honey do that
i sobered up and i got to thinkin
girl you aint much fun since i quit drinkin
yeah i sobered up and i got to thinkin
girl you aint much fun since i quit drinkinyou might also likeembed"
