verse 1
try to hear my voice
you can leave now its your choice
maybe if i fall asleep i wont breathe right
maybe if i leave tonight i wont come back

prechorus
i said it before i wont say it again
love is a game to you its not pretend
maybe if i fall asleep i wont breathe right

chorus
can nobody hear me
ive got a lot thats on my mind
i cannot breathe
can you hear it too

verse 2
you kiss and you kiss and you love and you love
youve got a history list and the rest is above
and if youre warm then you cant relate to me
from the floor to the floor and the sky to the sky
youve got to love and adore and the rest is awry
and if youre warm then you cant relate to me

ive got a lot thats on my mind
i cannot breathe
