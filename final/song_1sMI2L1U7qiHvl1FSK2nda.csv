i would die faster
all my friends think thats
pretty cool

i dont trust them im
not sure i like them much
day by day i see them
less

everyday ive been
writin shitty songs and youre
all i think about and it
makes me wanna shout about

what could have been if i
knew how to talk or
do the simple things and i
didnt think so much and i

know this doesnt help
but i guess it feels good
i know its pretty dumb but i
think im pretty dumb sometimes
sometimes
you might also likei made this simple so the
message doesnt blur ive been
feeling pretty hurt but i
think it was deserved i

guess it doesnt matter cause
no really cares i
dont share much i guess
lifes not fair huh i

expect a lot from me but i
know no one else does i
still feel the pressure even
if no one else does so i

write these songs
maybe you will sing along
i know its pretty dumb but i
think im pretty dumb sometimes
