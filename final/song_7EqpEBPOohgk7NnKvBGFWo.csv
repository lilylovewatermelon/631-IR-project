theodosia writes me a letter every day
im keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
hes on the british side in georgia
hes trying to keep the colonies in line
but he can keep all of georgia
theodosia shes mine
love doesnt discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway
we laugh and we cry
and we break
and we make our mistakes
and if theres a reason im by her side
when so many have tried
then im willing to wait for it
im willing to wait for it

my grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
preacher preacher preacher
but there are things that the homilies and hymns wont teach ya
teach ya teach ya teach ya
my mother was a genius genius
my father commanded respect respect respect
when they died they left no instructions
just a legacy to protect

death doesnt discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints

and we keep living anyway

and we break
and we make our mistakes
and if theres a reason im still alive
when everyone who loves me has died
im willing to wait for it
im willing to wait for it

what is it like in his shoes
hamilton doesnt hesitate
he exhibits no restraint
he takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway
he changes the game
he plays and he raises the stakes
and if theres a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive then goddamnit—
