i think this is yours

anyway
guess who it is everybody

verse 1 mac miller
yall is dead weight less great always gettin second place
i tend to race ahead of pace dippin while im dressed in bape
then they chase catch me if you can i aint dicaprio
this lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of adderall
capicola sandwiches are tasty from primantis
im a 57 giant brandon jacobs eli manning
girls with makeup get demanding but they fake like orange tanning
so my girl and i be up like we some college students cramming
for a test that we aint study for wonder will she love me more
with money cause if not im not sure what all this money for
feelin like a hundred wars are goin on currently
soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
poison take this mercury ill teach you for a learners fee
how to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
cool by the word of keith fabric by the hand of zeus
actin like you fuckin with me thats some shit i cant excuse
focus is on manual control the panoramic view universe
you got a chance dont blow it like how a tuba works
i plan to do somethin that aint tangible
now im bout to hand it to the homie mikey michael rocks
hear what he sayin to you

cant keep her hands off of me got her lock then lost the key lost it
weed smoke make it hard to see we go harder than carter one

chorus 1 sir michael rocks
fallin down the same rabbit hole lookin for love
but you will never ever get it because
it seem like it only happen when im holdin the drugs
and you can never ever see her because
verse 3 mac miller
life a clich√© it aint a bad one
first the plane land and then the bags come
we walkin on this planet seekin action
break a girls heart sorry ms jackson

chorus 1 sir michael rocks
fallin down the same rabbit hole lookin for love
and you will never ever get it because
it seem like it only happen when im holdin the drugs
and you can never ever see her
