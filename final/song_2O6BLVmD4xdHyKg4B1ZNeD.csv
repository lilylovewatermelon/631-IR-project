girl i swear
i get scared looking in your eyes
start thinking about where id be now
if i wasnt with you tonight
ive done a lot of crazy things
but you saved me and you reeled me in
there aint no doubt
id take us right now
over me back when

chorus
a lot of beer got drank
a lot of hell got raised
a lot of nights got long
but that was long
before i saw your face
now baby im holding on
to what i never wanna lose
i took a few wrong turns
down a couple back roads
but wound up where
i was supposed to
