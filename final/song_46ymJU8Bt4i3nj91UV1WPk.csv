shawty badder than a threeyearold
keep playing and ima eat her like a pita roll
im just saying with my love i could feed her soul
twoday getaway and we dont need our clothes
we at the pool and she looking like a center fold
two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
she got indian in her family seminole
me and shawty go together like chemicals
and she get mad when i call other women hoes
you send her rose i pick some flowers and send her those
tall glass of merlot get her in the mode
two tall glasses of merlot get her out her robe
i whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
and when she check her watch itâ€™s never time to go
and with her brain she should make the honor roll
and when i came she caught me like a common cold

prechorus lil wayne
damn you the shit
and ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
and i dont really know how to handle this shit
but tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

i say damn i must be left
cause you the best i ever seen right
shawty put me on you got me going like some green lights
see you with your girls they probably telling you that he aint right
bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
lets get together over night
shawty im a pro and you are looking like the prototype
ms cita i took your advice
sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
im cruising on the road of life but i need a passenger
appetite for loving ma im hungry like a scavenger
i be on that lavender
i be in the bath with her
then i gotta go under that water like a mariner

prechorus lil wayne
damn you the shit
and ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
and i dont really know how to handle this shit
but tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

chorus drake

verse 3 lil wayne
now she dont know about me but ima put her on it
and she aint sure about me but cant go without me
we probably aint supposed to be together
but i wonder if our love affair could last forever
and shawty im with you
smoke a lot of weed but i could never forget you
then i told her to her face
if everyone was like you the world would be a better place

prechorus lil wayne
damn you the shit
and ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
and i dont really know how to handle this shit
but tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

chorus drake

with you and only you

bridge drake
damn you the shit
and ill rip my heart out and hand you the shit
and i dont really know how to handle this shit
