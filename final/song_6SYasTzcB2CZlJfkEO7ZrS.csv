i used to love to look for a fight
id get drunk and shoot out the lights
i was known to get outta hand
a rough and rowdy honky tonk man

chorus
never thought it would happen to me
but this hard livin aint as easy as it used to be

verse 2
i looked a lot but ive never found
a woman that could settle me down
i been known to have a good time
no i could never walk the line

chorus
never thought it would happen to me
but this hard livin aint as easy as it used to be
