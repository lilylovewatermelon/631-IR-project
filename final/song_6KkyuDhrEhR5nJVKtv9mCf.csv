broken bottles in the hotel lobby
seems to me like im just scared of never feelin it again
i know its crazy to believe in silly things
but its not that easy

verse 2
i remember it now it takes me back
to when it all first started
but i only got myself to blame for it
and i accept it now
its time to let it go go out and start again
but its not that easy

chorus
but ive got high hopes
it takes me back to when we started
high hopes
when you let it go go out and start again
high hopes
when it all comes to an end
but the world keeps spinning around

verse 3
and in my dreams i meet the ghosts of all the people
whove come and gone
memories they seem to show up so quick
but they leave you far too soon
na√Øve i was just staring at the barrel of a gun
i do believe it
