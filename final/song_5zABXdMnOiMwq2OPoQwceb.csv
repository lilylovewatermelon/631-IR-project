we really shouldnt be doing this
and we both know why
just bein close enough to think like this
enough to make you need to lie
this kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
were gettin way too close to goin there
the farther off the better to resist
we really shouldnt be doin this

verse 1
only an isolated incident
but the acquaintance left me stunned
the first attraction was the hardest hit
i thought id ever overcome
this kinda situation has to pass
this chance encounter has to be the last
to take it further we would be remiss
we really shouldnt be doin this

verse 2
wed each be hurtin somebody else
if we dont say our goodbyes real fast
wont even think about a farewell kiss
we really shouldnt be doin this

we really shouldnt be doin this
and we both know why
just bein close enough to think like this
enough to make you need to lie
this kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
were gettin way too close to goin there
the farther off the better to resist
we really shouldnt be doin this
this kinda situation has to pass
this chance encounter has to be the last
to take it further we would be remiss
we really shouldnt be doin this
wont even think about a goodbye kiss
we really shouldnt be doin thisembed"
