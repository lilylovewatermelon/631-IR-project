my babys like a honky tonk
open all night make you feel right
gets me going got me buzzing like a neon light
knock you out like a punch in a barroom fight

chorus
my babys like a smooth shot of whiskey
make you feel warm kinda make you feel dizzy
cant get my fill i cant get enough of
my babys everything i love

verse 2
my babys like a coupe deville
fast motor humming coming over the hill
oh what a ride oh what a thrill
drive all night with my hands on the wheel

chorus
my babys like a trip to town
radio up top pulled down
cant get my fill i cant get enough of
my babys everything i love

bridge
shes all i need in one tight package
got a spell on me and it works like magic
im after her like a hound on a rabbit
shes got it all and i got to have it

yeah my babys like a country song
dancin through my head playin all night long
plays me like a fiddle got me singin along
well i cant turn off what she turns on

chorus
my babys like a jukebox rockin
got the guitars ringin and the big bass poppin
cant get my fill i cant get enough of
my babys everything i love
nothing but the good stuff
my babys everything i love heyembed"
