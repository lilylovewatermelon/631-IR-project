stakes washed away washed away
im burning down

verse 1 ruby da cherry
roll up and i light a fucking match to the gas no gas mask
make it splash and all of a sudden im getting ashes
lasting more than i can fathom
mass appeal is real it seems mass didnt appeal to me
sixsixsix wrists glisten cause of slits
heads missing so i split
driven apathy actually traffic
no tragic car accidents happen
youre just a fucking blip
it only matters cause were matter scatterin around a hole that gets blacker

bridge vancouver sleep clinic yung christ
stakes washed away washed away
im burning down
stakes washed away washed away
hold up before i blow up
hold up before
im burning down

verse 2 yung christ ruby da cherry
hold up before i blow up
give me one more time i can pour up
got the wheels spinnin but my bloods thinning
oddy telling me that its time to quit it—but i cant ill faint
just one little taste real quick so i get straight
im so in debt with this shit i cant pay
im so in love with this shit i cant think mind gone blank
i just keep sinking ducked out sleeping
these drugs my weakness
seek this money wrist keep bleeding ooh—
and its seeming that the death of me is gonna be these demons

sold my soul to satan waiting in line at the mall
stakes washed away washed away
i got six phones i got six homes
i got a grave six feet tall
im burning down
stakes—
what do i know
failed chemistry
—washed away washed away
hated religion fuck it all
im burning down
