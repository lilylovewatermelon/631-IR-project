he used to hold her hand he used to hold her door
but she dont know what that feels like anymore
just last night he was sleeping and she kissed his face
he said i gotta work in the morning and he rolled away

chorus
he used to love her like crazy
you couldnt pull them apart
god she felt so unbelievable in his arms
but now shes catching her self
looking down at her ring every now and then
she dont want to him to leave
she just needs him to be that way again

verse 2
so this morning she had coffee with a brand new friend
and she still had half a cup left when he asked her
can i see you again
well that made her smile like she hadnt smiled in years
and in just a second that smile turned to tears

chorus
he used to love me like crazy
you couldnt pull us apart
god i felt so unbelievable in his arms
but now shes catching her self
looking down at her ring every now and then
she dont want to leave
she just needs him to be that way again

she left that little cafe she headed straight to her car
she picked up her phone he didnt say hi he just said
hey when you getting home

chorus
she said you used to love me like crazy
you couldnt pull us apart
god i felt so unbelievable in your arms
but now im catching myself
looking down at my ring every now and then
i dont want to leave you
i just need you to be that way again

outro
i dont want to leave you
i just need you to be
that way again1embed"
