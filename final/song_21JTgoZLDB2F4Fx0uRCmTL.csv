2 am where do i begin
crying off my face again
the silent sounds of loneliness
wants to follow me to bed

prechorus
im a ghost of a girl that i want to be most
im the shell of a girl that i used to know well

chorus
dancing slowly in an empty room
can the lonely take the place of you
i sing myself a quiet lullaby
let you go and let the lonely in to take my heart again

verse 2
too afraid to go inside
for the pain of one more loveless night
but the loneliness will stay with me
and hold me til i fall asleep

prechorus
im the ghost of a girl that i want to be most
im the shell of a girl that i used to know well

dancing slowly in an empty room
can the lonely take the place of you
i sing myself a quiet lullaby
let you go and let the lonely in
to take my heart again

bridge
broken pieces of
a barely breathing story
where there once was love
now theres only me and the lonely

chorus
dancing slowly in an empty room
can the lonely take the place of you
i sing myself a quiet lullaby
let you go and let the lonely in
to take my heart again21embed"
