them damn cold vampires been keeping me awake
tryna build an empire of the things that they can take
dont let em steal your hope child and turn it something green
damn you and damn all your ties to this machine
ties to this machine

verse 1
you moved to the city girl to make something of yourself
but them vampires are groping you every night on east and 12th
so every night you carry a knife and some spray
to keep them bloodsuckers at least a fourinch blade away
a fourinch blade away

chorus
them damn cold vampires been keeping me awake
tryna build an empirе of the things that they can take
but dont lеt em steal your hope child and turn it something green
so damn you and damn all your ties to this machine
ties to this machine

verse 2
so you wanna be an artist make something that makes sense
cause them vampires will take every ounce of the blood that you can give
never let em speak and dont let em tell a lie
let em know that youre walking alone to a warm home tonight

cause theyre on the hunt for you
