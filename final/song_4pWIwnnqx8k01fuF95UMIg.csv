i do not
understand
what it is
ive done wrong
full of holes
check for pulse
blink your eyes
one for yes
two for no

chorus
i have no idea what i am talking about
i am trapped in this body and cant get out

verse 2
you killed the sound
removed backbone
a pale imitation
with the edges sawn off

chorus
i have no idea what you are talking about
your mouth moves only with someones hand up your arse

bridge
has the light gone out for you
because the lights gone out for me
it is the twentyfirst century
it is the twentyfirst century
it can follow you like a dog
it brought me to my knees
they got a skin and they put me in
they got a skin and they put me in
on the lines wrapped round my face
on the lines wrapped round my face
and for anyone else to see
and for anyone else to see
im a lie

theyve seen it coming
theyve seen it coming
