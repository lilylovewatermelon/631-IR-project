verse 2
her lifes cursed
took a wrong turn
lesson relearned
satan always comes back to burn
all the bridges
impossible to give your soul away if its not yours to give
thankful that i know the truth for others its unfortunate
but i heard hell has a lot of room so get comfortable
takin drug after drug numb the bitter truth
im a nice high guy i could love the bitter you
member popping pills before it was cool
getting ridiculed back in high school
chorus
i see the world from my window
i aint goin outside see it through my window
money from the record label spend it all on ammo
livin in paranoia got me livin like im rambo
life is a tv show if you try me itll be canceled
223s stick you just like a iv hospital
my wifey fuck me off of the whitey malcolm middle
