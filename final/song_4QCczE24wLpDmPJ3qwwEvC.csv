i dont care
if your beautiful lips exist out there
because im wonderless
why the best cant make it in hollywood no more
its like a long drag taken before the smoke hits the white sky
like the birds at night
and its fake just like the movies oh yeah

verse 2
and i cant wait just to see you again
and your two faces are locked on mine
had the worst time chasing the thought away
no hope oh no home
because maybe im a fake maybe youre to blame
maybe im a star stumbling drunklike
my mistakes ive made wont leave me alone oh no

bridge
and if you dont find me on the front page
find a way to say that you saw me
and if you dont find me in a movie
find a way to say that you knew me
and if you dont find me on a front page
find a way to say that you saw me
you and i got lost along the way
and if you dont find me at all
then i wont care
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeoutro
oh yeah
if i could find a place for the holiday
maybe i would call youre a payphone away
from the mess that ive become
im destroying what i love13embed"
