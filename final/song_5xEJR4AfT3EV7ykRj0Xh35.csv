is everybody clear
we could drive out to the dunes tonight
cause summers almost here

ive been up all night
i might sleep all day
get your dreams just right
and let em slip away
i might sleep all day

and when the roads are clear
you head on out of here
and if youre coming back
ill see you in the morning
im just staring at the ceiling staring back at me
just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me

but ive been up all night
i might sleep all day
get your dreams just right
and let em slip away
i might sleep all day

ohh its too late to get high now
ohh its too late to get high now
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likefix your hair just right
put your jeans on tight
or wear a dress so i can get it off real easy
cause ive been thinking
id like to see your eyes open up real wide
the minute that you see me

if you dont come through
i wouldnt wait for you
i understand that everyone goes disappearing
into the greater gray that covers over everyday
and hovers in the distance
in the distance
in the distance

and ive been up all night
i might sleep all day
get your dreams just right
then let em slip away
i might sleep all day

ohh its too late to get high now
ohh its too late to get high now

i said baby now now now
i said baby now now now
its too late well its too late
ohhhhhh
baby now now now
i said baby now now now
said its too late well its too late
oh i only wanna get high
na na na nanan
i said na na na nanana
its too late well its too late
oh i only wanna get high
na na na nanana i said na na na nanana
i said its too late well its too late

oh i only only only only
na na na nanana awwww na na na nanana
