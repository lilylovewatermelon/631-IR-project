chorus
spit on the track like a dog grrr
ima foam from the mouth like im having a seizure
they aint never pick up when i call fuck em
when they call my phone back i decline i dont need them
i never put trust in my dog never
when im working go hard i dont wanna see him
hundred bands ima look like a beatle
lemon squeeze on the back of the nina
run it up run it up i got a money fever
tell me is your mind made up im not a normal creature
plenty nights we stayed up im a misformer breather
plus i got my mind made up my logic informed the people

verse 1
back in the trenches when i leave the studio
great power like im julio
thirtyfive thousand on me in the back of the bucket
turning up with a big booty ho
steady telling me that i need to go
i look in his face and i ask what you mean
cant comprehend im full of that lean
see the flash in my pocket on top of the beam
when they speak on the topic of grimy lil things
count it up adoro mi lean
what is he saying i dont know what he mean
i just know he got money all up in his jeans

verse 2
hold up
never pick up when they calling not conversating with people
my nigga aint coming in clutch when i need him
i think that its love on top of a needle
smaller my circle and cut off some people
cause bitch you know that im a gangsta
get out this body i bet that i spank em
come in the nawf and you entering danger
live like a rebel and strapped like a ranger
stare in your face and can tell what you thinking
got a lil sister princess and jalayna woof woof vrrr
interlude
im supposed to keep going why you aint say nothin
noâ€” i thought i fold that bitch all the way ah
