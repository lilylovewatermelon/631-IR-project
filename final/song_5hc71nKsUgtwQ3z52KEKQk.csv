so i heard you found somebody else
and at first i thought it was a lie
i took all my things that make sounds
the rest i can do without

chorus
i dont want your body
but i hate to think about you with somebody else
our love has gone cold
youre intertwining your soul with somebody else
im looking through you
while youre looking through your phone
and then leaving with somebody else
no i dont want your body
but im picturing your body with somebody else else else

postchorus
i dont want your body i dont want your body
i dont want your body i dont want your body
i dont want your body i dont want your body
i dont want your body i dont want your body

verse 2
and cmon baby i know
this aint the last time that ill see your face
and cmon baby i know
