when i was a young boy my father
took me into the city to see a marching band
he said son when you grow up would you be
the savior of the broken the beaten and the damned
he said will you defeat them your demons
and all the nonbelievers the plans that they have made
because one day ill leave you a phantom
to lead you in the summer to join the black parade
when i was a young boy my father
took me into the city to see a marching band
he said son when you grow up would you be
the savior of the broken the beaten and the damned

verse 1
sometimes i get the feeling shes watching over me
and other times i feel like i should go
and through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
and when youre gone we want you all to know

chorus
well carry on well carry on
and though youre dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on well carry on
and in my heart i cant contain it
the anthem wont explain it
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likeverse 2
a world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back and lets shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end we hear the call

chorus
to carry on well carry on
and though youre dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on well carry on
and though youre broken and defeated
your weary widow marches

bridge
on and on we carry through the fears oh ha ha
disappointed faces of your peers oh ha ha
take a look at me cause i could not care at all

breakdown
do or die youll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try youll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part
i wont explain or say im sorry
im unashamed im gonna show my scar
and give a cheer for all the broken
listen here because its who we are
just a man im not a hero
just a boy who had to sing this song
just a man im not a hero
i dont care
chorus
well carry on well carry on
and though youre dead and gone believe me
your memory will carry on youll carry on
and though youre broken and defeated
your weary widow marches on

outro
do or die youll never make me
because the world will never take my heart
go and try youll never break me
we want it all we wanna play this part well carry on
do or die youll never make me well carry on
because the world will never take my heart well carry on
go and try youll never break me well carry
we want it all we wanna play this part well carry on220embed"
