i’ve been working this job 9 – 5
minimum wage and overtime
but here comes a few days of unpaid vacation
and there ain’t no way josé ill waste them
cause there ain’t no better feeling than when

chorus
i pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
its friday night yall heres the plan
im gonna throw back a couple and
keep em glued to my right hand
any flavor size or brand
until the point where i can’t stand
no nothing picks me up like a beer can

verse 2
i woke up at i pm
and introduced myself to my new girlfriend
and there’s a wrecking ball sized hole in the wall in the basement
i aint got no clue how or who could have made it
well all i know is shit hit the fan
and here we go again

chorus
i pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
its saturday yall heres the plan
im gonna throw back a couple and
keep em glued to my right hand
any flavor size or brand
until the point where i can’t stand
no nothing picks me up like a beer can
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
well its sunday now and im freaking out
cause i can’t handle five days without

chorus
yeah picking up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
its sunday who gives a damn
im gonna throw back a couple and
keep em glued to my right hand
any flavor size or brand
until the point where i can’t stand
no nothing picks me up like a beer can

outro
like a beer can
no nothing picks me up like a beer can1embed"
