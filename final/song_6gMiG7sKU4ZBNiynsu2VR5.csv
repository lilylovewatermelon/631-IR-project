someday ill make it there i swear
to that place that haunts my dreams at night
singing heavenly highway hymns all the way up
to that beautiful old countryside
someday ill find the words to explain
all the good times that echo through my mind
your grin in the mornings a warm southern sun
or seeing double when those chemicals align
just some kids who needed love using laughter as their drug
doing their best to tow that hard line
someday i will lie under blue skies
in a hayfield that holds me like home
and ill ask forgiveness with god as my witness
for straying so far on my own

chorus
today ill hold my head up high
knowing someday comes one day at a time
today theres a sun setting soon as suppers warm
today ive got someday on my mind

verse 2
someday ill call up all my old friends
and well catch up with too many beers
pull an allnighter sitting around fire
for the first time in so many years
someday
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 3
someday i will come to my senses
stop sitting on fences in fear
and i will realize after all of this time
that someday was always just right here

chorus
today ill hold my head up high
knowing someday has been here the whole damn time
theres a sun set setting i aint forgetting
the blood that made my heart warm
today i found what i was searching for

outro
someday i will send you a postcard
from the place that im smiling tonight
i sang heavenly highway hymns all the way up
to this beautiful warm countrysideembed"
