uh uh uh i took my first break in seventyfive
i tell the story like yesterday when was alive
didnt do shit with my brothers without makin em mad
couldnt get along with nobody so i just ran with my dad
he took me right there where the killas be
across court from mileton between clarion and wilistry
we shot ball on crates tryna get paid by all means
started snatchin purses by wall greens
seen titey get hit up in the melt when i was young
paramedics couldnt even find his tongue
thats when i started totin my heat to call a g
my family was deep but wasnt goin in that water with me
right after mrmartins class juve would leaveand me
straight to farret think i was worried bout the trulency please
got paid for them old timers puttin in work
like mr frank he sold fruit watermelons and herbs

chorus
even though the times was hard
i didnt fear no man but god
you lookin at new orleans crime rate
right up in the place souljas beware this is juve the great
juve the great
juve the great
juve the great
this is juve the great
juve the great
juve the great
juve the great
this is juve the great

mama thought her son was really doin it tight
when i was the one out here not doin it right
until she found my stash she couldnt believe all the weed she found
shit it mustve been a half a pound
i was thirteen then back when yoga was caddillacn it
my campaign was let a lil nigga get a crack at it
far from a gangsta but was learnin alot
aint just be the one that earnin the pot
after the turn of the clock i started bankin on the low with the dope
got slugged up so hoesll notice me mo
tees reeboks and girbauds i had a few  to write
regular hood shit the average niggas go through in life
wanted to be a lil gorilla and more day killas
 and we ball i know theyll flip ya
i stayed away from them cats who didnt communicate well
cause them was them niggas that wouldve had me in jail

chorus

verse 3 juvenile
at fifteen i carried alot of wieght on my back
me and my brother infact i kept my money intact
i mad my real power moves soon as juv got one
headed straight to the irish channel nigga who got guns
shit my people bobby and surviva got hit too
and i heard my name was poppin up in some shit too
wasnt no cool cans off googlin no more
it was either cry like a bitch or go and settle the score
my first case wanted my respect in the worst way
couldnt tell me shit when i was hungry and thirsty
have a nigga way out his religion ya heard me
i guess its punishment to who and never was worthy
every since i leanred about guns and coke
i made a vow to myself that i would never go broke
do what i gotta do to eat
i probably cant play no sports but i can work these streets
