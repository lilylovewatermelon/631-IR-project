from walking home and talking loads
to seeing shows in evening clothes with you
from nervous touch and getting drunk
to staying up and waking up with you

prechorus
now were slipping near the edge
holding something we dont need
all this delusion in our heads
is gonna bring us to our knees

chorus
so come on let it go just let it be
why dont you be you and ill be me
everything thats broke leave it to the breeze
why dont you be you and ill be me
and ill be me

verse 2
from throwing clothes across the floor
to teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
if this is all were living for
why are we doing it doing it doing it anymore

prechorus
i used to recognize myself
its funny how reflections change
when were becoming something else
i think its time to walk away

so come on let it go just let it be
why dont you be you and ill be me
everything thats broke leave it to the breeze
why dont you be you and ill be me
and ill be me

bridge
tryna fit your hand inside of mine
when we know it just dont belong
cause no force on earth could make it feel right no no
tryna push this problem up the hill
when its just too heavy to hold
i think nows the time to let it slide

breakdown
so come on let it go just let it be
why dont you be you and ill be me
everything thats broke leave it to the breeze
let the ashes fall forget about me

outro
come on let it go just let it be
why dont you be you and ill be me
and ill be me
ooh me you161embed"
