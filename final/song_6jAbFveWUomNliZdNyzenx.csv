today we took a walk up the street
we picked a flower and climbed the hill above the lake
and secret thoughts were said aloud
we watched the faces in the clouds
until the clouds had blown away
and were we ever somewhere else
you know its hard to say

chorus
and i never saw blue like that before
across the sky around the world
youre giving me all you have and more
and no one else has ever shown me how
to see the world the way i see it now
oh i i never saw blue like that

verse 2
i cant believe a month ago
i was alone i didnt know you
i hadnt seen you or heard your name
and even now im so amazed
its like a dream its like a rainbow its like the rain
and some things are the way they are
and words just cant explain
see shawn colvin liveget tickets as low as 66you might also likechorus
cause i never saw blue like that before
across the sky around the world
youre giving me all you have and more
and no one else has ever shown me how
to see the world the way i see it now
oh i i never saw blue like that before

bridge
and it feels like now and it feels always
and it feels like coming home

chorus
never saw blue like that before
across the sky around the world
youre giving me all you have and more
and no one else has ever shown me how
to see the world the way i see it now
oh i i never saw blue like that before
oh i i never saw blue like thatembed"
