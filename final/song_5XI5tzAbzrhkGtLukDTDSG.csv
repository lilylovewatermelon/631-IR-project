fugees fugees and mobb deep
tryin to diss now too huh
hahaha well i aint prejudiced
i dont give a fuck
this is what it sounds like
when we ride on our enemies
biatch when we ride on our enemies

verse 1
hey got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
let my little cousin k roll hes a rider now
what they want from us motherfuckin thug niggas
used to love niggas now i plug niggas and slug niggas
am i wrong niggas makin songs tryin to get with us
must be gone on stress weed in the west we trust
to the chest i bust then we ride til the sun come
shinin back to brighten up the sky how many die
heard the fugees was tryin to do me
look bitch ill cut your face this aint no motherfuckin movie
then we watch the other two die slow
castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
bam set my plan in mo
time to exterminate my foes i cant stand you hoes
uh now label this my fuckin trick shot
my lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hiphop
when we ride on our enemies

when we ride on our enemies
i bet you motherfuckers die
when we ride on our enemies
when we ride on our enemies
bet all you motherfuckers die
when we ride on our enemies

verse 2
come take a journey through my minds eye
you crossed the game dont explain nigga time to die
say goodbye watch my eyes when i pull the trigger
so right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
now dry your eyes you was heartless on your hits
niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit
pay attention heres a word to those that robbed me
i murder you then i run a train on mobb deep
dont fuck with me nigga youre barely livin dont you got sickle cell
see me have a seizure on stage you aint feelin well
hell how many niggas wanna be involved
see i was only talkin to biggie but ill kill all of yall then ball
then tell da brat to keep her mouth closed
fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin outlawz
before i leave make sure everybody heard
know i meant every motherfuckin word
when we ride on our enemies
chorus
when we ride on our enemies
make sure everybody die
when we ride on our enemies
when we ride on our enemies hehe
i make sure everybody die
when we ride on our enemies14embed"
