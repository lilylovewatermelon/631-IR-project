well everyone seems a damn genius lately
tiktok talkin latenight tv
theres still so much that i have yet to know
we get dressed up just to go downtown
in some egofilled latenight crowd
seems to be where i feel the most alone

verse 2
id like to get lost on some old back road
find a shade tree and a honey hole
and talk to my grandpa again
and i see god in everything
the trees and pain and nights in the spring
so why do i still long for a home

verse 3
id like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
and feel the fear of never wakin
to know thе true warmth of the sun
id like to lovе my lady long and hard
and lay down lines of laymen guitar
never leave her lovin arms again

verse 4
my exes hate me and my friends all miss me
i wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
leave this small town for a while
head to paris on a latenight flight
find a bar and get in a fight
write a few poems on a sunny balcony
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 5
i wanna be a child climbin trees somewhere
breathin in the fresh outside air
and before i knew this life was unkind
i want a welltrained dog on a couple of acres
a kind kind lady and a place to take her
few good friends i can count on one of my hands

verse 6
i know im bound to die one day
so when i reach those golden gates
i pray to say i did the best i can
sit with my mother and the dearly departed
send a prayer down to the brokenhearted
let em know it all turns out just fine

verse 7
to know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
i prefer my nights so lonely
love blues guitar muscle cars and gin
im a simple man i dont need much
just my simple songs and some human touch
im tired now so im bringin my ass home

chorus
so let me go down the line
let me feel it all joy pain and sky
so let me go down the line
we all burn burn burn and die
so let me go down the line
i wanna feel it all joy pain and sky
so let me go down the line
we all burn burn burn and then die
so let me go down the line
i wanna feel it all joy pain and sky
so let me go down the line
we all burn burn burn and then die1embed"
