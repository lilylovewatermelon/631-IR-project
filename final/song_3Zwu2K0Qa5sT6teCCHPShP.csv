verse 1
im going to make it bend and break
it sent you to me without wings say a prayer but let the good times roll
in case god doesnt show
let the good times roll let the good times roll
and i want these words to make things right
but its the wrongs that make the words come to life
who does he think he is if thats the worst youve got
better put your fingers back to the keys

chorus
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories even though they werent so
great he tastes like you only sweeter
one night yeah and one more time
thanks for the memories thanks for the memories
see he tastes like you only sweeter

verse 2
been looking forward to the future
but my eyesight is going bad
and this crystal ball
its always cloudy except for except for
when you look into the past look into the past
one night stand
one night stand off
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories even though they werent so
great he tastes like you only sweeter
one night yeah and one more time
thanks for the memories thanks for the memories
see he tastes like you only sweeter ohoh

bridge
they say i only think in the form of crunching numbers
in hotel rooms collecting page six lovers
get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
im a liner away from getting you into the mood woah

chorus
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories even though they werent so
great he tastes like you only sweeter
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories thanks for the memories
see he tastes like you only sweeter ohohohoh
one night and one more time one more night one more time
thanks for the memories even though they werent so
great he tastes like you only sweeter ohohoh
one night and one more time one more night one more time
thanks for the memories thanks for the memories
for the memories see he tastes like you only sweeter ohohohoh85embed"
