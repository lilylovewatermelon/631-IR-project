waiting for the ship in call
theres something in the way i move that keeps them on their own

the stars explodes a storm
a billion seasons born
a shock to the waves i know breaking far from shore

dont want to talk
all i hear is noise
dont want to talk

the futures in my hands
i hold it in my palms
engrave it the leylines running right down her arms

speak in silent tongues
lies reflect the times
the ghosts and the shadows fill the living scene

dont want to talk
all i hear is noise
dont want to talk

dont want to talk
all i hear is noise
dont want to talk

all i hear is noise
dont want to talk

dont want to talk
all i hear is noise
dont want to talk4embed"
