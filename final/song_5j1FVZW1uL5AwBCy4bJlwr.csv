we run into a blazing fire
we hold our heads up high tonight
and we breathe the smoke the fear real
we let our hearts subside tonight

prechorus
but it marks my skin cause i know ive sinned
and it plagues the air on my house looming
theres a sound out here in the darkest woods
and i know my fears are understood

chorus
its a ritual and i know you feel it
its a ritual and i know you see it
its a ritual and i know you feel it
you feel it you feel it you feel it oh

verse 2
we move into the devils shoes
its far too late to be rescued
from highway seas and thunder skies
we see our fate you hear our cries

prechorus
they go oh oh oh oh oh oh
and it wont stop here echo in my ear
theres a raging fire and it burns so near
but im ready now but im ready now
