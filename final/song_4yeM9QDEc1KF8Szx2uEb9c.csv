pop punk tough guys with neck tattoos
well if you guys are hard then id rather be soft
man i gotta find me some seriously sensitive dudes

hey ho hey
you gotta shake hands with your feelings
in the wicked sensitive crew

in pittsburgh they called us closed minded
but we know thats simply not true
yeah were touchy feely sensitive guys
i aint ashamed i cried when mickey died in rocky ii

in sydney they misunderstood us
they called us thugs and meanspirited types
yeah we might not be swedish and we sure aint vegan
but do thugs have posters on their bedroom wall
of the dude from the darkness in a creepy meat suit
zippered so low you can practically
god thats gross what its cool

hey ho hey
you gotta shake hands with your feelings
in the wicked sensitive crew

but ill tell you theres one town thats ahead of the times
man they know whats up for sure
you see its home to the godfather of love
the bald little man who started it all
one teddy huggybear etoll

hey ho hey
you gotta shake hands with your feelings
weve got a big hug waiting for you

hey ho hey
you gotta shake hands with your feelings
in the wicked sensitive crewembed"
