lie awake in bed at night
and think about your life
do you want to be different
try to let go of the truth
the battles of your youth
cause this is just a game

chorus
its a beautiful lie
its a perfect denial
such a beautiful lie to believe in
so beautiful beautiful it makes me

verse 2
its time to forget about the past
to wash away what happened last
hide behind an empty face
dont ask too much just say
cause this is just a game

chorus
its a beautiful lie
its a perfect denial
such a beautiful lie to believe in
so beautiful beautiful it makes me

im running around in circles baby
a quiet desperations building higher
ive got to remember this is just a game

so beautiful beautiful
its a beautiful lie
so beautiful beautiful
its a beautiful lie

so beautiful beautiful
its a beautiful lie
so beautiful beautiful
its a beautiful lie

chorus
its a beautiful lie
its a perfect denial
such a beautiful lie to believe in
so beautiful beautiful it makes me15embed"
