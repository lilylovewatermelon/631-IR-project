breakdown

verse 1
let the fun and games begin
she is spayed and broken in
skin is cold and white
such a lovely lonely night

prechorus
heaven is on the way
you could feel the hate
but i guess you never will
im on a roll again
and i want an end
cause i feel you creeping in

chorus
what ive found in this town
im headed for a breakdown
whats that sound youre so loud
im headed for a breakdown

verse 2
drank up all my alcohol
this is not a freeforall
ill be there for you
till my heart is black and blue

and i want an end
cause i feel you creeping in

chorus
what ive found in this town
im headed for a breakdown
whats that sound youre so loud
im headed for a breakdown

im headed for a breakdown
whats that sound youre so loud
im headed for a breakdown
