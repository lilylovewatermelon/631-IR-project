snoop
my momma got mad
i was young when i hooked up with her
one hit and i couldnt stop trippin
a long lasting relationship
pass you around and let my niggas take a hit
i used to break you down just to roll you up
you the real you never will slow me up
and you was always on my mind
say no more
i still miss you at times
all of a sudden you lost my interest
i packed it up and set about my business
you used to have a hold on me
sometimes to the point that they said you controlled me
i kept going to jail and all that
get out fuck with you again im right back
i guess i had to learn the hard way baby
im leaving you alone cause you driving me crazy i miss that bitch
