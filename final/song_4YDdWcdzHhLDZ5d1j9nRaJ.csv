youre paralyzed breathe your disguise
you feed on the lies that they tell you
got to break away from the numbing pain
succumb to the rage thats inside you

youre hypnotized hypnotized demoralized
believe every line that they sell you
start channeling channeling whatever will remains
discern from whats fiction and what is true

chorus
whoaohoh
open your eyes
whoaohoh
open your eyes
whoaohoh
open your eyes
seethrough the disguise wont you open your eyes
open your eyes
hey hey

verse 2
youve lost your sense from the emptiness
you do as the headlines compel you
become whole again and let the war begin
destroy the veneer that surrounds you
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also liketheres no defense no defense for your recklessness
you stare as the proof lies before you
why cant you see cant you see
are you afraid to be exposed to the demons around you

chorus
whoaohoh
open your eyes
whoaohoh
open your eyes
whoaohoh
open your eyes
seethrough the disguise wont you open your eyes

whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
seethrough the disguise wont you open your eyes

bridge
you would all be running in a world you cannot hide
and the end is coming for the lemmings standing in line
overcome it let the fury build inside
it could all be broken if you only opened your eyes
chorus
whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
whoaohoh hey
open your eyes
seethrough the disguise wont you open your eyes

whoaohoh hey
