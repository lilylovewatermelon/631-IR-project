jerry i really feel as human beings we need more training in our basic social skills conversational distance dont you hate these people that talk to you they talk into your mouth like youre a clown at a drivethrough and hand shakes is the worst theres absolutely no guidelines for hand shakes you know these people too long too weak sometimes they give you the threequarter handshake just the fingers early release late release sometimes people will dispute your release you let go therere hangin on i have actually said to people hey the handshake is over too many pumps coming in too high too sweaty coming from too far away sometimes a guy will give you a strong grip late release and pull you in for the too close conversation to him i say thats three strikes youre out
