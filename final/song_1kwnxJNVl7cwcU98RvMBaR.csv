verse 1
where are you goin can i come too
the whole world is open a playground for me and you
and we could be fine shit who the hell knows
its your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
head and your shoulders your knees and your toes
i dream of this moment
will it come true
the whole world they know it
they just waitin for me and you
and she just like i
got her head in the clouds
dont need to be lower
before its all over i promise well figure it out
i aint comin down
why would i need to
so much of this world is above us baby
they might tell you that i went crazy

not when im alone
but its more when im standin in crowds

days they go by
until we get old
theres water in the flowers lets grow
people they lie
but hey so do i
until it gets old
theres water in the flowers lets grow
