verse 1 gabriella
i guess i shoulda known better
to believe that my luck had changed luck had changed ooh
i let my heart and forever
finally learn each others names others names
i tell myself this time its different
no goodbyes cause i cant bear to say em
ill never survive the one thats comin
if i stay if i stay oh no

chorus gabriella
just walk away oh and dont look back
cause if my heart breaks its gonna hurt so bad
you know im strong but i cant take that
before its too late
oh just walk away

but i know that its no ones fault its no ones fault

and a prince that doesnt know hes lost know hes lost
this emptiness feels so familiar familiar
each goodbye just the same old song
but this time i will not surrender oh
cause im gone cause im gone no no

before its too late
