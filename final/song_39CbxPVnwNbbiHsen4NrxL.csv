received in paris

my dear and honored friend  i have often been desirous of writing to thee but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might fall into the hands of the british lest some printer or busybody should publish some part of the contents and give our friend pain and myself censure

some time since there fell into my hands to my great joy about
twentythree sheets in thy own handwriting containing an account of the parentage and life of thyself directed to thy son ending in the year 1730 with which there were notes likewise in thy writing a copy of which i inclose in hopes it may be a means if thou continued it up to a later period that the first and latter part may be put together and if it is not yet continued i hope thee will not delay it  life is uncertain as the preacher tells us and what will the world say if kind humane and benevolent ben  franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few but to millions  the influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great and has nowhere appeared to me so plain as in our public friends journals  it almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist  should thine for instance when published and i think it could not fail of it lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth what a blessing with that class would such a work be  i know of no character living nor many of them put together who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business frugality and temperance with the american youth  not that i think the work would have no other merit and use in the world far from it but the first is of such vast importance that i know nothing that can equal it


the foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a friend i received from him the following

letter from mr benjamin vaughan
paris january 31 1783

my dearest sir  when i had read over your sheets of minutes of the principal incidents of your life recovered for you by your quaker acquaintance i told you i would send you a letter expressing my reasons why i thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as he desired  various concerns have for some time past prevented this letter being written and i do not know whether it was worth any expectation happening to be at leisure however at present i shall by writing at least interest and instruct myself but as the terms i am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners i shall only tell you how i would address any other person who was as good and as great as yourself but less diffident  i would say to him sir i solicit the history of your life from the following motives  your history is so remarkable that if you do not give it somebody else will certainly give it and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm as
your own management of the thing might do good  it will moreover present a table of the internal circumstances of your country which will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds  and considering the eagerness with which such information is sought by them and the extent of your reputation i do not know of a more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give  all that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a rising people and in this respect i do not think that the writings of caesar and tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society  but these sir are small reasons in my opinion compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men and in conjunction with your art of virtue which you design to publish of improving the features
of private character and consequently of aiding all happiness both
public and domestic  the two works i allude to sir will in
particular give a noble rule and example of selfeducation school and other education constantly proceed upon false principles and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark but your apparatus is simple and the mark a true one and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life your discovery that the thing is in many a mans private power will be invaluable  influence upon the private character late in life is not only an influence late in life but a weak influence  it is in youth that we plant our chief habits and prejudices it is in youth that we take our party as to profession pursuits and matrimony  in youth therefore the turn is given in youth the education even of the next generation is given in youth the private and public character is determined and the term of life extending but from youth to age life ought to begin well from youth and more especially before we take our party as to our principal objects  but your biography will not merely teach selfeducation but the education of a wise man and the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man  and why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark almost without a guide in
this particular from the farthest trace of time  show then sir how
much is to be done both to sons and fathers and invite all wise men to become like yourself and other men to become wise when we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific acquiescing manners and to find how compatible it is to be great and domestic enviable and yet
goodhumored

the little private incidents which you will also have to relate will
have considerable use as we want above all things rules of prudence in ordinary affairs and it will be curious to see how you have acted in these  it will be so far a sort of key to life and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them to give them a chance of becoming wise by foresight  the nearest thing to having experience of ones own is to have other peoples affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting this is sure to happen from your pen our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike and i am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy and what more worthy of experiments and system its importance and its errors considered than human life
some men have been virtuous blindly others have speculated
fantastically and others have been shrewd to bad purposes but you sir i am sure will give under your hand nothing but what is at the same moment wise practical and good your account of yourself for i suppose the parallel i am drawing for dr franklin will hold not only in point of character but of private history will show that you are ashamed of no origin a thing the more important as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness virtue or greatness  as no end likewise happens without a means so we shall find sir that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering the means are as simple as wisdom could make them that is depending upon
nature virtue thought and habit another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everymans waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world  our sensations being very much fixed to the moment we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life  your attribution appears to have been applied to your life and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets  such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men of whom patience is so often the characteristic  your quaker correspondent sir for here again i will suppose the subject of my letter resembling dr franklin praised your frugality diligence and temperance which
he considered as a pattern for all youth but it is singular that he
should have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness without which you never could have waited for your advancement or found your situation in the mean time comfortable which is a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds if this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as i do he would have said your former writings and measures would secure attention to your biography and art of virtue and your biography and art of virtue in return would secure attention to them this is an advantage attendant upon a various character and which brings all that belongs to it into greater play and it is the more useful as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters than they are for the time or the inclination to do it  but there is one concluding reflection sir that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography  this style of writing seems a little gone out of vogue and yet it is a very useful one and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable as it will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public
cutthroats and intriguers and with absurd monastic selftormentors or vain literary triflers  if it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written it will be worth all plutarchs lives put together  but being tired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in the world without giving him the praise of it i shall end my letter my dear dr franklin with a personal application to your proper self  i am earnestly desirous then my dear sir that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character as civil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it  considering your great age the caution of your character and your peculiar style of thinking it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life or the intentions of your mind  besides all this the immense revolution of the present period will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it it will be highly important to shew that such have really influenced and as your own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny it is proper even for its effects upon your vast and rising country as well as upon england and upon europe that it should stand respectable and
eternal  for the furtherance of human happiness i have always
maintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at
present a vicious and detestable animal and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him and it is for much the same reason that i am anxious to see the opinion established that there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the race for the moment that all men without exception shall be conceived abandoned good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless and perhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life or at least of making it comfortable principally for themselves  take then my dear sir this work most speedily into hand  shew yourself good as you are good temperate as you are temperate and above all things prove yourself as one who from your infancy have loved justice liberty and concord in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life  let englishmen be made not only to respect but even to love you  when they think well of individuals in your native country they will go nearer to thinking well of your country and when your countrymen see themselves well thought of by englishmen they will go nearer to thinking well of england  extend your views even further do not stop at those who speak the english tongue but after having settled so many points in nature and politics think of bettering the whole race of men  as i have not read any part of the life in question but know only the character that lived it i write somewhat at hazard  i am sure however that the life and the treatise i allude to on the art of virtue will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated  should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain  in the hope therefore that you will listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter i beg to subscribe myself my dearest sir etc etc

continuation of the account of my life begun at passy near paris
1784

it is some time since i receivd the above letters but i have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain it might too be much better done if i were at home among my papers which would aid my memory and help to ascertain dates but my return being uncertain and having just now a little leisure i will endeavour to recollect and write what i can if i live to get home it may there be corrected and improvd

not having any copy here of what is already written i know not whether an account is given of the means i used to establish the philadelphia public library which from a small beginning is now become so considerable though i remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction 1730 i will therefore begin here with an account of it which may be struck out if found to have been already given

at the time i establishd myself in pennsylvania there was not a good booksellers shop in any of the colonies to the southward of boston in new york and philada the printers were indeed stationers they sold only paper etc almanacs ballads and a few common schoolbooks those who lovd reading were obliged to send for their books from england the members of the junto had each a few we had left the alehouse where we first met and hired a room to hold our club in i proposd that we should all of us bring our books to that room where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences but become a common benefit each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wishd to read at home this was accordingly done and for some time contented us

finding the advantage of this little collection i proposd to render the benefit from books more common by commencing a public subscription library i drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary and got a skilful conveyancer mr charles brockden to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed by which each subscriber engagd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books and an annual contribution for increasing them so few were the readers at that time in philadelphia and the majority of us so poor that i was not able with great industry to find more than fifty persons mostly young tradesmen willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum on this little fund we began the books were imported the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned the institution soon manifested its utility was imitated by other towns and in other provinces the libraries were augmented by donations reading became fashionable and our people having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study became better acquainted with books and in a few years were observd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries

when we were about to sign the above mentioned articles which were to be binding on us our heirs etc for fifty years mr brockden the scrivener said to us you are young men but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fixd in the instrument a number of us however are yet living but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company

the objections and reluctances i met with in soliciting the subscriptions made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting ones self as the proposer of any useful project that might be supposd to raise ones reputation in the smallest degree above that of ones neighbours when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project i therefore put myself as much as i could out of sight and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading in this way my affair went on more smoothly and i ever after practisd it on such occasions and from my frequent successes can heartily recommend it the present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid if it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers and restoring them to their right owner
this library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study for which i set apart an hour or two each day and thus repaird in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me reading was the only amusement i allowd myself i spent no time in taverns games or frolicks of any kind and my industry in my business continud as indefatigable as it was necessary i was indebted for my printinghouse i had a young family coming on to be educated and i had to contend with for business two printers who were established in the place before me my circumstances however grew daily easier my original habits of frugality continuing and my father having among his instructions to me when a boy frequently repeated a proverb of solomon seest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men i from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction which encouragd me tho i did not think that i should ever literally stand before kings which however has since happened for i have stood before five and even had the honor of sitting down with one the king of denmark to dinner

we have an english proverb that says he that would thrive must ask his wife it was lucky for me that i had one as much disposd to industry and frugality as myself she assisted me chearfully in my business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers etc etc we kept no idle servants our table was plain and simple our furniture of the cheapest for instance my breakfast was a long time break and milk no tea and i ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter spoon but mark how luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of principle being calld one morning to breakfast i found it in a china bowl with a spoon of silver they had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife and had cost her the enormous sum of threeandtwenty shillings for which she had no other excuse or apology to make but that she thought her husband deservd a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbors this was the first appearance of plate and china in our house which afterward in a course of years as our wealth increasd augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value

i had been religiously educated as a presbyterian and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion such as the eternal decrees of god election reprobation etc appeared to me unintelligible others doubtful and i early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect sunday being my studying day i never was without some religious principles i never doubted for instance the existence of the deity that he made the world and governd it by his providence that the most acceptable service of god was the doing good to man that our souls are immortal and that all crime will be punished and virtue rewarded either here or hereafter these i esteemd the essentials of every religion and being to be found in all the religions we had in our country i respected them all tho with different degrees of respect as i found them more or less mixd with other articles which without any tendency to inspire promote or confirm morality servd principally to divide us and make us unfriendly to one another this respect to all with an opinion that the worst had some good effects inducd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion and as our province increasd in people and new places of worship were continually wanted and generally erected by voluntary contribution my mite for such purpose whatever might be the sect was never refused

tho i seldom attended any public worship i had still an opinion of its propriety and of its utility when rightly conducted and i regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only presbyterian minister or meeting we had in philadelphia he usd to visit me sometimes as a friend and admonished me to attend his administrations and i was now and then prevaild on to do so once for five sundays successively had he been in my opinion a good preacher perhaps i might have continued65 notwithstanding the occasion i had for the sundays leisure in my course of study but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect and were all to me very dry uninteresting and unedifying since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforcd their aim seeming to be rather to make us presbyterians than good citizens

at length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of philippians finally brethren whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely or of good report if there be any virtue or any praise think on these things and i imagind in a sermon on such a text we could not miss of having some morality but he confind himself to five points only as meant by the apostle viz 1 keeping holy the sabbath day 2 being diligent in reading the holy scriptures 3 attending duly the publick worship 4 partaking of the sacrament 5 paying a due respect to gods ministers these might be all good things but as they were not the kind of good things that i expected from that text i despaired of ever meeting with them from any other was disgusted and attended his preaching no more i had some years before composd a little liturgy or form of prayer for my own private use viz in 1728 entitled articles of belief and acts of religion i returnd to the use of this and went no more to the public assemblies my conduct might be blameable but i leave it without attempting further to excuse it my present purpose being to relate facts and not to make apologies for them

ix

plan for attaining moral perfection

blockit was about this time i conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection i wishd to live without committing any fault at any time i would conquer all that either natural inclination custom or company might lead me into as i knew or thought i knew what was right and wrong i did not see why i might not always do the one and avoid the other but i soon found i had undertaken a task of more difficulty than i had imagined66 while my care was employd in guarding against one fault i was often surprised by another habit took the advantage of inattention inclination was sometimes too strong for reason i concluded at length that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous was not sufficient to prevent our slipping and that the contrary habits must be broken and good ones acquired and established before we can have any dependence on a steady uniform rectitude of conduct for this purpose i therefore contrived the following method

in the various enumerations of the moral virtues i had met with in my reading i found the catalogue more or less numerous as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name temperance for example was by some confined to eating and drinking while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure appetite inclination or passion bodily or mental even to our avarice and ambition i proposd to myself for the sake of clearness to use rather more names with fewer ideas annexd to each than a few names with more ideas and i included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurrd to me as necessary or desirable and annexed to each a short precept which fully expressd the extent i gave to its meaning

these names of virtues with their precepts were

1 temperance

eat not to dullness drink not to elevation

2 silence
speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling conversation

3 order

let all your things have their places let each part of your business have its time

4 resolution

resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve

5 frugality

make no expense but to do good to others or yourself i e waste nothing

6 industry

lose no time be always employd in something useful cut off all unnecessary actions

7 sincerity

use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak speak accordingly

8 justice

wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty

9 moderation

avoid extreams forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve

10 cleanliness

tolerate no uncleanliness in body cloaths or habitation

11 tranquillity

be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable

12 chastity
13 humility

imitate jesus and socrates

my intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues i judgd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once but to fix it on one of them at a time and when i should be master of that then to proceed to another and so on till i should have gone thro the thirteen and as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others i arrangd them with that view as they stand above temperance first as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits and the force of perpetual temptations this being acquird and establishd silence would be more easy and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that i improvd in virtue and considering that in conversation it was obtaind rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue and therefore wishing to break a habit i was getting into of prattling punning and joking which only made me acceptable to trifling company i gave silence the second place this and the next order i expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies resolution once become habitual would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues frugality and industry freeing me from my remaining debt and producing affluence and independence would make more easy the practice of sincerity and justice etc etc conceiving then that agreeably to the advice of pythagoras67 in his golden verses daily examination would be necessary i contrived the following method for conducting that examination

i made a little book in which i allotted a page for each of the virtues68 i ruld each page with red ink so as to have seven columns one for each day of the week marking each column with a letter for the day i crossd these columns with thirteen red lines marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues on which line and in its proper column i might mark by a little black spot every fault i found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day

i determined to give a weeks strict attention to each of the virtues successively thus in the first week my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against temperance leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance only marking every evening the faults of the day thus if in the first week i could keep my first line marked t clear of spots i supposd the habit of that virtue so much strengthend and its opposite weakend that i might venture extending my attention to include the next and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots proceeding thus to the last i could go thro a course compleat in thirteen weeks and four courses in a year and like him who having a garden to weed does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once which would exceed his reach and his strength but works on one of the beds at a time and having accomplishd the first proceeds to a second so i should have i hoped the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress i made in virtue by clearing successively my lines of their spots till in the end by a number of courses i should be happy in viewing a clean book after a thirteen weeks daily examination

this my little book had for its motto these lines from addisons cato

here will i hold if theres a power above us
and that there is all nature cries aloud
thro all her works he must delight in virtue
and that which he delights in must be happy
another from cicero

o vitæ philosophia dux o virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum unus dies bene et ex præceptis tuis actus peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus69

another from the proverbs of solomon speaking of wisdom or virtue

length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace iii 16 17

and conceiving god to be the fountain of wisdom i thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it to this end i formed the following little prayer which was prefixd to my tables of examination for daily use

o powerful goodness bountiful father merciful guide increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me

i used also sometimes a little prayer which i took from thomsons poems viz

father of light and life thou good supreme
o teach me what is good teach me thyself
save me from folly vanity and vice
from every low pursuit and fill my soul
with knowledge conscious peace and virtue pure
sacred substantial neverfading bliss
the precept of order requiring that every part of my business should have its allotted time one page in my little book containd the following scheme of employment for the twentyfour hours of a natural day

i enterd upon the execution of this plan for selfexamination and continud it with occasional intermissions for some time i was surprisd to find myself so much fuller of faults than i had imagined but i had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish to avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book which by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course became full of holes i transferrd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book on which the lines were drawn with red ink that made a durable stain and on those lines i markd my faults with a blacklead pencil which marks i could easily wipe out with a wet sponge after a while i went thro one course only in a year and afterward only one in several years till at length i omitted them entirely being employd in voyages and business abroad with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered but i always carried my little book with me

my scheme of order gave me the most trouble70 and i found that tho it might be practicable where a mans business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time that of a journeyman printer for instance it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master who must mix with the world and often receive people of business at their own hours order too with regard to places for things papers etc i found extreamly difficult to acquire i had not been early accustomed to it and having an exceeding good memory i was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method this article therefore cost me so much painful attention and my faults in it vexed me so much and i made so little progress in amendment and had such frequent relapses that i was almost ready to give up the attempt and content myself with a faulty character in that respect like the man who in buying an ax of a smith my neighbour desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel he turnd while the smith pressd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone which made the turning of it very fatiguing the man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on and at length would take his ax as it was without farther grinding no said the smith turn on turn on we shall have it bright byandby as yet it is only speckled yes says the man but i think i like a speckled ax best and i believe this may have been the case with many who having for want of some such means as i employd found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue have given up the struggle and concluded that a speckled ax was best for something that pretended to be reason was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as i exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals which if it were known would make me ridiculous that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself to keep his friends in countenance

the smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel
in truth i found myself incorrigible with respect to order and now i am grown old and my memory bad i feel very sensibly the want of it but on the whole tho i never arrived at the perfection i had been so ambitious of obtaining but fell far short of it yet i was by the endeavour a better and a happier man than i otherwise should have been if i had not attempted it as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies tho they never reach the wishdfor excellence of those copies their hand is mended by the endeavour and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible

it may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice with the blessing of god their ancestor owd the constant felicity of his life down to his 79th year in which this is written what reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of providence but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoyd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation to temperance he ascribes his longcontinued health and what is still left to him of a good constitution to industry and frugality the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned to sincerity and justice the confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues71 even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that evenness of temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company still sought for and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance i hope therefore that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit

it will be remarkd that tho my scheme was not wholly without religion there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect i had purposely avoided them for being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions and intending some time or other to publish it i would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone of any sect against it i purposed writing a little comment on each virtue in which i would have shown the advantages of possessing it and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice and i should have called my book the art of virtue72 because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good that does not instruct and indicate the means but is like the apostles man of verbal charity who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals exhorted them to be fed and clothed—james ii 15 16

but it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled i did indeed from time to time put down short hints of the sentiments reasonings etc to be made use of in it some of which i have still by me but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life and public business since have occasioned my postponing it for it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project that required the whole man to execute and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to it has hitherto remaind unfinishd

in this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden but forbidden because they are hurtful the nature of man alone considered that it was therefore everyones interest to be virtuous who wishd to be happy even in this world and i should from this circumstance there being always in the world a number of rich merchants nobility states and princes who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs and such being so rare have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor mans fortune as those of probity and integrity

my list of virtues containd at first but twelve but a quaker friend having kindly informed me that i was generally thought proud that my pride showd itself frequently in conversation that i was not content with being in the right when discussing any point but was overbearing and rather insolent of which he convincd me by mentioning several instances i determined endeavouring to cure myself if i could of this vice or folly among the rest and i added humility to my list giving an extensive meaning to the word

i cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue but i had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it i made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others and all positive assertion of my own i even forbid myself agreeably to the old laws of our junto the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixd opinion such as certainly undoubtedly etc and i adopted instead of them i conceive i apprehend or i imagine a thing to be so or so or it so appears to me at present when another asserted something that i thought an error i denyd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition and in answering i began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right but in the present case there appeard or seemd to me some difference etc i soon found the advantage of this change in my manner the conversations i engagd in went on more pleasantly the modest way in which i proposd my opinions procurd them a readier reception and less contradiction i had less mortification when i was found to be in the wrong and i more easily prevaild with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when i happened to be in the right

and this mode which i at first put on with some violence to natural inclination became at length so easy and so habitual to me that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me and to this habit after my character of integrity i think it principally owing that i had early so much weight with my fellowcitizens when i proposed new institutions or alterations in the old and so much influence in public councils when i became a member for i was but a bad speaker never eloquent subject to much hesitation in my choice of words hardly correct in language and yet i generally carried my points

in reality there is perhaps no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride disguise it struggle with it beat it down stifle it mortify it as much as one pleases it is still alive and will every now and then peep out and show itself you will see it perhaps often in this history for even if i could conceive that i had compleatly overcome it i should probably be proud of my humility

thus far written at passy 1784

i am now about to write at home august 1788 but cannot have the help expected from my papers many of them being lost in the war i have however found the following73

having mentioned a great and extensive project which i had conceivd it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper accidentally preservd viz

observations on my reading history in library may 19th 1731

that the great affairs of the world the wars revolutions etc are carried on and effected by parties

that the view of these parties is their present general interest or what they take to be such

that the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion

that while a party is carrying on a general design each man has his particular private interest in view

that as soon as a party has gaind its general point each member becomes intent upon his particular interest which thwarting others breaks that party into divisions and occasions more confusion

that few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country whatever they may pretend and tho their actings bring real good to their country yet men primarily considered that their own and their countrys interest was united and did not act from a principle of benevolence

that fewer still in public affairs act with a view to the good of mankind

there seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a united party for virtue by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body to be governd by suitable good and wise rules which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to than common people are to common laws

i at present think that whoever attempts this aright and is well qualified cannot fail of pleasing god and of meeting with success

b f

revolving this project in my mind as to be undertaken hereafter when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure i put down from time to time on pieces of paper such thoughts as occurrd to me respecting it most of these are lost but i find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed containing as i thought the essentials of every known religion and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion it is expressd in these words viz

that there is one god who made all things

that he governs the world by his providence

that he ought to be worshiped by adoration prayer and thanksgiving

but that the most acceptable service of god is doing good to man

that the soul is immortal

and that god will certainly reward virtue and punish vice either here or hereafter

my ideas at that time were that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks examination and practice of the virtues as in the beforementiond model that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret till it was become considerable to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous welldisposed youths to whom with prudent caution the scheme should be gradually communicated that the members should engage to afford their advice assistance and support to each other in promoting one anothers interests business and advancement in life that for distinction we should be calld the society of the free and easy free as being by the general practice and habit of the virtues free from the dominion of vice and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality free from debt which exposes a man to confinement and a species of slavery to his creditors

this is as much as i can now recollect of the project except that i communicated it in part to two young men who adopted it with some enthusiasm but my then narrow circumstances and the necessity i was under of sticking close to my business occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time and my multifarious occupations public and private inducd me to continue postponing so that it has been omitted till i have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise though i am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme and might have been very useful by forming a great number of good citizens and i was not discouragd by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking as i have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes and accomplish great affairs among mankind if he first forms a good plan and cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business

71 while there can be no question that franklins moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life franklins own suggestion that the scheme smacks of foppery in morals seems justified woodrow wilson well puts it men do not take fire from such thoughts unless something deeper which is missing here shine through them what may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct what redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in franklin himself who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life see galatians chapter v for the christian plan of moral perfection

poor richards almanac and other activities

blockin 1732 i first publishd my almanack under the name of richard saunders it was continud by me about twentyfive years commonly calld poor richards almanac74 i endeavourd to make it both entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in such demand that i reapd considerable profit from it vending annually near ten thousand and observing that it was generally read scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it i considerd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people who bought scarcely any other books i therefore filled all the little spaces that occurrd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality as the means of procuring wealth and thereby securing virtue it being more difficult for a man in want to act always honestly as to use here one of those proverbs it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright

these proverbs which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations i assembled and formd into a connected discourse prefixd to the almanack of 1757 as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction the bringing all these scatterd councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression the piece being universally approved was copied in all the newspapers of the continent reprinted in britain on a broadside to be stuck up in houses two translations were made of it in french and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants in pennsylvania as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication

i considered my newspaper also as another means of communicating instruction and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the spectator and other moral writers and sometimes publishd little pieces of my own which had been first composed for reading in our junto of these are a socratic dialogue tending to prove that whatever might be his parts and abilities a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense and a discourse on selfdenial showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations these may be found in the papers about the beginning of 173575

in the conduct of my newspaper i carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country whenever i was solicited to insert anything of that kind and the writers pleaded as they generally did the liberty of the press and that a newspaper was like a stagecoach in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place my answer was that i would print the piece separately if desired and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself but that i would not take upon me to spread his detraction and that having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining i could not fill their papers with private altercation in which they had no concern without doing them manifest injustice now many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels and are moreover so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states and even on the conduct of our best national allies which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences these things i mention as a caution to young printers and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices but refuse steadily as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not on the whole be injurious to their interests

in 1733 i sent one of my journeymen to charleston south carolina where a printer was wanting i furnishd him with a press and letters on an agreement of partnership by which i was to receive onethird of the profits of the business paying onethird of the expense he was a man of learning and honest but ignorant in matters of account and tho he sometimes made me remittances i could get no account from him nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived on his decease the business was continued by his widow who being born and bred in holland where as i have been informd the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards and managed the business with such success that she not only brought up reputably a family of children but at the expiration of the term was able to purchase of me the printinghouse and establish her son in it

i mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females as likely to be of more use to them and their children in case of widowhood than either music or dancing by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men and enabling them to continue perhaps a profitable mercantile house with establishd correspondence till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family

about the year 1734 there arrived among us from ireland a young presbyterian preacher named hemphill who delivered with a good voice and apparently extempore most excellent discourses which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions who joind in admiring them among the rest i became one of his constant hearers his sermons pleasing me as they had little of the dogmatical kind but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue or what in the religious stile are called good works those however of our congregation who considered themselves as orthodox presbyterians disapprovd his doctrine and were joind by most of the old clergy who arraignd him of heterodoxy before the synod in order to have him silencd i became his zealous partisan and contributed all i could to raise a party in his favour and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success there was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion and finding that tho an elegant preacher he was but a poor writer i lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets and one piece in the gazette of april 1735 those pamphlets as is generally the case with controversial writings tho eagerly read at the time were soon out of vogue and i question whether a single copy of them now exists76

during the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly one of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired thought he had somewhere read the sermon before or at least a part of it on search he found that part quoted at length in one of the british reviews from a discourse of dr fosters77 this detection gave many of our party disgust who accordingly abandoned his cause and occasiond our more speedy discomfiture in the synod i stuck by him however as i rather approvd his giving us good sermons composed by others than bad ones of his own manufacture tho the latter was the practice of our common teachers he afterward acknowledgd to me that none of those he preachd were his own adding that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only on our defeat he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune and i quitted the congregation never joining it after tho i continud many years my subscription for the support of its ministers

i had begun in 1733 to study languages i soon made myself so much a master of the french as to be able to read the books with ease i then undertook the italian an acquaintance who was also learning it usd often to tempt me to play chess with him finding this took up too much of the time i had to spare for study i at length refusd to play any more unless on this condition that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart or in translations etc which tasks the vanquishd was to perform upon honour before our next meeting as we playd pretty equally we thus beat one another into that language i afterwards with a little painstaking acquird as much of the spanish as to read their books also

i have already mentiond that i had only one years instruction in a latin school and that when very young after which i neglected that language entirely but when i had attained an acquaintance with the french italian and spanish i was surprisd to find on looking over a latin testament that i understood so much more of that language than i had imagined which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it and i met with more success as those preceding languages had greatly smoothd my way

from these circumstances i have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages we are told that it is proper to begin first with the latin and having acquird that it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are derivd from it and yet we do not begin with the greek in order more easily to acquire the latin it is true that if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps you will more easily gain them in descending but certainly if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top and i would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth whether since many of those who begin with the latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency and what they have learnt becomes almost useless so that their time has been lost it would not have been better to have begun with the french proceeding to the italian etc for tho after spending the same time they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the latin they would however have acquired another tongue or two that being in modern use might be serviceable to them in common life78

after ten years absence from boston and having become easy in my circumstances i made a journey thither to visit my relations which i could not sooner well afford in returning i calld at newport to see my brother then settled there with his printinghouse our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate he was fast declining in his health and requested of me that in case of his death which he apprehended not far distant i would take home his son then but ten years of age and bring him up to the printing business this i accordingly performd sending him a few years to school before i took him into the office his mother carried on the business till he was grown up when i assisted him with an assortment of new types those of his father being in a manner worn out thus it was that i made my brother ample amends for the service i had deprivd him of by leaving him so early

our former differences were forgotten and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate
in 1736 i lost one of my sons a fine boy of four years old by the smallpox taken in the common way i long regretted bitterly and still regret that i had not given it to him by inoculation this i mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it my example showing that the regret may be the same either way and that therefore the safer should be chosen

our club the junto was found so useful and afforded such satisfaction to the members that several were desirous of introducing their friends which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number viz twelve we had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret which was pretty well observd the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance some of whom perhaps we might find it difficult to refuse i was one of those who were against any addition to our number but instead of it made in writing a proposal that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club with the same rules respecting queries etc and without informing them of the connection with the junto the advantages proposed were the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion as the junto member might propose what queries we should desire and was to report to the junto what passd in his separate club the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation and the increase of our influence in public affairs and our power of doing good by spreading thro the several clubs the sentiments of the junto

the project was approvd and every member undertook to form his club but they did not all succeed five or six only were compleated which were called by different names as the vine the union the band etc they were useful to themselves and afforded us a good deal of amusement information and instruction besides answering in some considerable degree our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions of which i shall give some instances in course of time as they happened

my first promotion was my being chosen in 1736 clerk of the general assembly the choice was made that year without opposition but the year following when i was again proposd the choice like that of the members being annual a new member made a long speech against me in order to favour some other candidate i was however chosen which was the more agreeable to me as besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members which securd to me the business of printing the votes laws paper money and other occasional jobbs for the public that on the whole were very profitable

i therefore did not like the opposition of this new member who was a gentleman of fortune and education with talents that were likely to give him in time great influence in the house which indeed afterwards happened i did not however aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him but after some time took this other method having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book i wrote a note to him expressing my desire of perusing that book and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days he sent it immediately and i returnd it in about a week with another note expressing strongly my sense of the favour when we next met in the house he spoke to me which he had never done before and with great civility and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions so that we became great friends and our friendship continued to his death this is another instance of the truth of an old maxim i had learned which says he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged and it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove than to resent return and continue inimical proceedings

in 1737 colonel spotswood late governor of virginia and then postmastergeneral being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at philadelphia respecting some negligence in rendering and inexactitude of his accounts took from him the commission and offered it to me i accepted it readily and found it of great advantage for tho the salary was small it facilitated the correspondence that improvd my newspaper increasd the number demanded as well as the advertisements to be inserted so that it came to afford me a considerable income my old competitors newspaper declind proportionately and i was satisfyd without retaliating his refusal while postmaster to permit my papers being carried by the riders thus he sufferd greatly from his neglect in due accounting and i mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employd in managing affairs for others that they should always render accounts and make remittances with great clearness and punctuality the character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business

74 the almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather franklin took his title from poor robin a famous english almanac and from richard saunders a wellknown almanac publisher for the maxims of poor richard see pages 331335

78 the authority of franklin the most eminently practical man of his age in favor of reserving the study of the dead languages until the mind has reached a certain maturity is confirmed by the confession of one of the most eminent scholars of any age

our seminaries of learning says gibbon do not exactly correspond with the precept of a spartan king that the child should be instructed in the arts which will be useful to the man since a finished scholar may emerge from the head of westminster or eton in total ignorance of the business and conversation of english gentlemen in the latter end of the eighteenth century but these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach the latin and greek languages—bigelow

interest in public affairs

blockibegan now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs beginning however with small matters the city watch was one of the first things that i conceivd to want regulation it was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night those who chose never to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excusd which was supposd to be for hiring substitutes but was in reality much more than was necessary for that purpose and made the constableship a place of profit and the constable for a little drink often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with walking the rounds too was often neglected and most of the nights spent in tippling i thereupon wrote a paper to be read in junto representing these irregularities but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this sixshilling tax of the constables respecting the circumstances of those who paid it since a poor widow housekeeper all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds paid as much as the wealthiest merchant who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his stores

on the whole i proposed as a more effectual watch the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be proportiond to the property this idea being approvd by the junto was communicated to the other clubs but as arising in each of them and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution yet by preparing the minds of people for the change it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence

about this time i wrote a paper first to be read in junto but it was afterward publishd on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means proposed of avoiding them this was much spoken of as a useful piece and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger associates in this scheme were presently found amounting to thirty our articles of agreement obligd every member to keep always in good order and fit for use a certain number of leather buckets with strong bags and baskets for packing and transporting of goods which were to be brought to every fire and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions

the utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on one new company being formed after another till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property and now at the time of my writing this tho upward of fifty years since its establishment that which i first formed called the union fire company still subsists and flourishes tho the first members are all deceasd but myself and one who is older by a year than i am the small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been applyd to the purchase of fireengines ladders firehooks and other useful implements for each company so that i question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations and in fact since these institutions the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed

the flames have often been extinguished
in 1739 arrived among us from ireland the reverend mr whitefield79 who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher he was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy taking a dislike to him soon refusd him their pulpits and he was obligd to preach in the fields the multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was matter of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they admird and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of them by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils it was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants from being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seemd as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk thro the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street

and it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner proposd and persons appointed to receive contributions but sufficient sums were soon receivd to procure the ground and erect the building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad about the size of westminster hall80 and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected both house and ground were vested in trustees expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at philadelphia the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect but the inhabitants in general so that even if the mufti of constantinople were to send a missionary to preach mohammedanism to us he would find a pulpit at his service

mr whitefield in leaving us went preaching all the way thro the colonies to georgia the settlement of that province had lately been begun but instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed to labour the only people fit for such an enterprise it was with families of broken shopkeepers and other insolvent debtors many of indolent and idle habits taken out of the jails who being set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight of their miserable situation inspird the benevolent heart of mr whitefield with the idea of building an orphan house there in which they might be supported and educated returning northward he preachd up this charity and made large collections for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers of which i myself was an instance

i did not disapprove of the design but as georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from philadelphia at a great expense i thought it would have been better to have built the house here and brought the children to it this i advisd but he was resolute in his first project rejected my counsel and i therefore refusd to contribute i happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of which i perceived he intended to finish with a collection and i silently resolved he should get nothing from me i had in my pocket a handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold as he proceeded i began to soften and concluded to give the coppers another stroke of his oratory made me ashamd of that and determind me to give the silver and he finishd so admirably that i emptyd my pocket wholly into the collectors dish gold and all at this sermon there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments respecting the building in georgia and suspecting a collection might be intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from home towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong desire to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him to borrow some money for the purpose the application was unfortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher his answer was at any other time friend hopkinson i would lend to thee freely but not now for thee seems to be out of thy right senses

some of mr whitefields enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument but i who was intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his sermons and journals etc never had the least suspicion of his integrity but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection he usd indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to his death

the following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood upon one of his arrivals from england at boston he wrote to me that he should come soon to philadelphia but knew not where he could lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host mr benezet was removed to germantown my answer was you know my house if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most heartily welcome he replyd that if i made that kind offer for christs sake i should not miss of a reward and i returned dont let me be mistaken it was not for christs sake but for your sake one of our common acquaintance jocosely remarkd that knowing it to be the custom of the saints when they received any favour to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders and place it in heaven i had contrivd to fix it on earth

the last time i saw mr whitefield was in london when he consulted me about his orphan house concern and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college

he had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great distance especially as his auditories however numerous observd the most exact silence he preachd one evening from the top of the courthouse steps which are in the middle of marketstreet and on the west side of secondstreet which crosses it at right angles both streets were filld with his hearers to a considerable distance being among the hindmost in marketstreet i had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and i found his voice distinct till i came near frontstreet when some noise in that street obscurd it imagining then a semicircle of which my distance should be the radius and that it were filld with auditors to each of whom i allowd two square feet i computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand this reconcild me to the newspaper accounts of his having preachd to twentyfive thousand people in the fields and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies of which i had sometimes doubted

by hearing him often i came to distinguish easily between sermons newly composd and those which he had often preachd in the course of his travels his delivery of the latter was so improvd by frequent repetitions that every accent every emphasis every modulation of voice was so perfectly well turnd and well placd that without being interested in the subject one could not help being pleasd with the discourse a pleasure of much the same kind with that receivd from an excellent piece of musick this is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals

his writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies unguarded expressions and even erroneous opinions delivered in preaching might have been afterwards explaind or qualifid by supposing others that might have accompanid them or they might have been denyd but litera scripta manet critics attackd his writings violently and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase so that i am of opinion if he had never written anything he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect and his reputation might in that case have been still growing even after his death as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed

my business was now continually augmenting and my circumstances growing daily easier my newspaper having become very profitable as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces i experienced too the truth of the observation that after getting the first hundred pound it is more easy to get the second money itself being of a prolific nature

the partnership at carolina having succeeded i was encouragd to engage in others and to promote several of my workmen who had behaved well by establishing them with printinghouses in different colonies on the same terms with that in carolina most of them did well being enabled at the end of our term six years to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves by which means several families were raised partnerships often finish in quarrels but i was happy in this that mine were all carried on and ended amicably owing i think a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled in our articles everything to be done by or expected from each partner so that there was nothing to dispute which precaution i would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships for whatever esteem partners may have for and confidence in each other at the time of the contract little jealousies and disgusts may arise with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business etc which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences

defense of the province

blockihad on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in pennsylvania there were however two things that i regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat education of youth no militia nor any college i therefore in 1743 drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time thinking the reverend mr peters who was out of employ a fit person to superintend such an institution i communicated the project to him but he having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries which succeeded declind the undertaking and not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust i let the scheme lie awhile dormant i succeeded better the next year 1744 in proposing and establishing a philosophical society the paper i wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings when collected

with respect to defense spain having been several years at war against great britain and being at length joind by france which brought us into great danger and the laboured and longcontinued endeavour of our governor thomas to prevail with our quaker assembly to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of the province having proved abortive i determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people to promote this i first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled plain truth in which i stated our defenceless situation in strong lights with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense and promisd to propose in a few days an association to be generally signed for that purpose the pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect i was calld upon for the instrument of association and having settled the draft of it with a few friends i appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned the house was pretty full i had prepared a number of printed copies and provided pens and ink dispersd all over the room i harangued them a little on the subject read the paper and explained it and then distributed the copies which were eagerly signed not the least objection being made

when the company separated and the papers were collected we found above twelve hundred hands and other copies being dispersed in the country the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand these all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise and other parts of military discipline the women by subscriptions among themselves provided silk colours which they presented to the companies painted with different devices and mottos which i supplied

the officers of the companies composing the philadelphia regiment being met chose me for their colonel but conceiving myself unfit i declind that station and recommended mr lawrence a fine person and man of influence who was accordingly appointed i then proposd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town and furnishing it with cannon it filled expeditiously and the battery was soon erected the merlons being framd of logs and filld with earth we bought some old cannon from boston but these not being sufficient we wrote to england for more soliciting at the same time our proprietaries for some assistance tho without much expectation of obtaining it

meanwhile colonel lawrence william allen abram taylor esqr and myself were sent to new york by the associators commissiond to borrow some cannon of governor clinton he at first refusd us peremptorily but at dinner with his council where there was great drinking of madeira wine as the custom of that place then was he softened by degrees and said he would lend us six after a few more bumpers he advancd to ten and at length he very goodnaturedly conceded eighteen they were fine cannon eighteenpounders with their carriages which we soon transported and mounted on our battery where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted and among the rest i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier

my activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council they took me into confidence and i was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association calling in the aid of religion i proposd to them the proclaiming a fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing of heaven on our undertaking they embracd the motion but as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation my education in new england where a fast is proclaimed every year was here of some advantage i drew it in the accustomed stile it was translated into german81 printed in both languages and divulgd thro the province this gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association and it would probably have been general among all but quakers if the peace had not soon intervend

it was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in these affairs i should offend that sect and thereby lose my interest in the assembly of the province where they formed a great majority a young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the house and wished to succeed me as their clerk acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election and he therefore in good will advisd me to resign as more consistent with my honour than being turnd out my answer to him was that i had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when offerd to him i approve says i of his rule and will practice it with a small addition i shall never ask never refuse nor ever resign an office if they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another they shall take it from me i will not by giving it up lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries i heard however no more of this i was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election possibly as they dislikd my late intimacy with the members of council who had joind the governors in all the disputes about military preparations with which the house had long been harassd they might have been pleasd if i would voluntarily have left them but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association and they could not well give another reason

indeed i had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them provided they were not requird to assist in it and i found that a much greater number of them than i could have imagined tho against offensive war were clearly for the defensive many pamphlets pro and con were publishd on the subject and some by good quakers in favour of defense which i believe convincd most of their younger people

a transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments it had been proposd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock then about sixty pounds in tickets of the lottery by our rules no money could be disposd of till the next meeting after the proposal the company consisted of thirty members of which twentytwo were quakers and eight only of other persuasions we eight punctually attended the meeting but tho we thought that some of the quakers would join us we were by no means sure of a majority only one quaker mr james morris appeard to oppose the measure he expressed much sorrow that it had ever been proposd as he said friends were all against it and it would create such discord as might break up the company we told him that we saw no reason for that we were the minority and if friends were against the measure and outvoted us we must and should agreeably to the usage of all societies submit when the hour for business arrivd it was movd to put the vote he allowd we might then do it by the rules but as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing

while we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desird to speak with me i went down and found they were two of our quaker members they told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by that they were determind to come and vote with us if there should be occasion which they hopd would not be the case and desird we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends being thus secure of a majority i went up and after a little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of another hour this mr morris allowd to be extreamly fair not one of his opposing friends appeard at which he expressd great surprize and at the expiration of the hour we carrid the resolution eight to one and as of the twentytwo quakers eight were ready to vote with us and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were not inclind to oppose the measure i afterward estimated the proportion of quakers sincerely against defense as one to twentyone only for these were all regular members of that society and in good reputation among them and had due notice of what was proposd at that meeting

the honorable and learned mr logan who had always been of that sect was one who wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments he put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service he told me the following anecdote of his old master william penn respecting defense he came over from england when a young man with that proprietary and as his secretary it was wartime and their ship was chasd by an armed vessel supposd to be an enemy their captain prepard for defense but told william penn and his company of quakers that he did not expect their assistance and they might retire into the cabin which they did except james logan82 who chose to stay upon deck and was quarterd to a gun the supposd enemy provd a friend so there was no fighting but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence william penn rebukd him severely for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel contrary to the principles of friends especially as it had not been required by the captain this reproof being before all the company piqud the secretary who answerd i being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee was willing enough that i should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger

my being many years in the assembly the majority of which were constantly quakers gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war whenever application was made to them by order of the crown to grant aids for military purposes they were unwilling to offend government on the one hand by a direct refusal and their friends the body of the quakers on the other by compliance contrary to their principles hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable the common mode at last was to grant money under the phrase of its being for the kings use and never to inquire how it was applied

but if the demand was not directly from the crown that phrase was found not so proper and some other was to be invented as when powder was wanting i think it was for the garrison at louisburg and the government of new england solicited a grant of some from pennsylvania which was much urgd on the house by governor thomas they could not grant money to buy powder because that was an ingredient of war but they voted an aid to new england of three thousand pounds to be put into the hands of the governor and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat or other grain some of the council desirous of giving the house still further embarrassment advisd the governor not to accept provision as not being the thing he had demanded but he replid i shall take the money for i understand very well their meaning other grain is gunpowder which he accordingly bought and they never objected to it83

it was in allusion to this fact that when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery and i had said to my friend mr syng one of our members if we fail let us move the purchase of a fireengine with the money the quakers can have no objection to that and then if you nominate me and i you as a committee for that purpose we will buy a great gun which is certainly a fireengine i see says he you have improvd by being so long in the assembly your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain

these embarrassments that the quakers sufferd from having establishd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful and which being once published they could not afterwards however they might change their minds easily get rid of reminds me of what i think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that of the dunkers i was acquainted with one of its founders michael welfare soon after it appeard he complaind to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and chargd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers i told him this had always been the case with new sects and that to put a stop to such abuse i imagind it might be well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline he said that it had been proposd among them but not agreed to for this reason when we were first drawn together as a society says he it had pleased god to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines which we once esteemed truths were errors and that others which we had esteemed errors were real truths from time to time he has been pleased to afford us farther light and our principles have been improving and our errors diminishing now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge and we fear that if we should once print our confession of faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confind by it and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement and our successors still more so as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done to be something sacred never to be departed from

this modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth and that those who differ are so far in the wrong like a man traveling in foggy weather those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those behind him and also the people in the fields on each side but near him all appears clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them to avoid this kind of embarrassment the quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the assembly and in the magistracy choosing rather to quit their power than their principle

in order of time i should have mentioned before that having in 1742 invented an open stove84 for the better warming of rooms and at the same time saving fuel as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering i made a present of the model to mr robert grace one of my early friends who having an ironfurnace85 found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing as they were growing in demand to promote that demand i wrote and published a pamphlet entitled an account of the newinvented pennsylvania fireplaces wherein their construction and manner of operation is particularly explained their advantages above every other method of warming rooms demonstrated and all objections that have been raised against the use of them answered and obviated etc this pamphlet had a good effect govr thomas was so pleasd with the construction of this stove as described in it that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years but i declind it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions viz that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours and this we should do freely and generously

an ironmonger in london however assuming a good deal of my pamphlet and working it up into his own and making some small changes in the machine which rather hurt its operation got a patent for it there and made as i was told a little fortune by it and this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others tho not always with the same success which i never contested as having no desire of profiting by patents myself and hating disputes the use of these fireplaces in very many houses both of this and the neighbouring colonies has been and is a great saving of wood to the inhabitants

public services and duties
17491753
blockpeace being concluded and the association business therefore at an end i turnd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy the first step i took was to associate in the design a number of active friends of whom the junto furnished a good part the next was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania this i distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis and as soon as i could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it i set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years by so dividing it i judgd the subscription might be larger and i believe it was so amounting to no less if i remember right than five thousand pounds

in the introduction to these proposals i stated their publication not as an act of mine but of some publickspirited gentlemen avoiding as much as i could according to my usual rule the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit

the subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose out of their number twentyfour trustees and appointed mr francis86 then attorneygeneral and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy which being done and signed a house was hired masters engagd and the schools opened i think in the same year 1749

the scholars increasing fast the house was soon found too small and we were looking out for a piece of ground properly situated with intention to build when providence threw into our way a large house ready built which with a few alterations might well serve our purpose this was the building before mentioned erected by the hearers of mr whitefield and was obtained for us in the following manner

it is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects care was taken in the nomination of trustees in whom the building and ground was to be vested that a predominancy should not be given to any sect lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect contrary to the original intention it was therefore that one of each sect was appointed viz one churchofengland man one presbyterian one baptist one moravian etc those in case of vacancy by death were to fill it by election from among the contributors the moravian happend not to please his colleagues and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect the difficulty then was how to avoid having two of some other sect by means of the new choice

several persons were named and for that reason not agreed to at length one mentiond me with the observation that i was merely an honest man and of no sect at all which prevailed with them to chuse me the enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abatd and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the groundrent and discharging some other debts the building had occasiond which embarrassd them greatly being now a member of both sets of trustees that for the building and that for the academy i had a good opportunity of negotiating with both and brought them finally to an agreement by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy the latter undertaking to discharge the debt to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers according to the original intention and maintain a freeschool for the instruction of poor children writings were accordingly drawn and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories and different rooms above and below for the several schools and purchasing some additional ground the whole was soon made fit for our purpose and the scholars removd into the building the care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen purchasing materials and superintending the work fell upon me and i went thro it the more cheerfully as it did not then interfere with my private business having the year before taken a very able industrious and honest partner mr david hall with whose character i was well acquainted as he had workd for me four years he took off my hands all care of the printingoffice paying me punctually my share of the profits the partnership continued eighteen years successfully for us both

the trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated by a charter from the governor their funds were increasd by contributions in britain and grants of land from the proprietaries to which the assembly has since made considerable addition and thus was established the present university of philadelphia87 i have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning now near forty years and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receivd their education in it distinguishd by their improvd abilities serviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country

when i disengaged myself as above mentioned from private business i flatterd myself that by the sufficient tho moderate fortune i had acquird i had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements i purchased all dr spences apparatus who had come from england to lecture here and i proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity but the publick now considering me as a man of leisure laid hold of me for their purposes every part of our civil government and almost at the same time imposing some duty upon me the governor put me into the commission of the peace the corporation of the city chose me of the common council and soon after an alderman and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in assembly this latter station was the more agreeable to me as i was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates in which as clerk i could take no part and which were often so unentertaining that i was inducd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles or anything to avoid weariness and i conceivd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good i would not however insinuate that my ambition was not flatterd by all these promotions it certainly was for considering my low beginning they were great things to me and they were still more pleasing as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion and by me entirely unsolicited

the office of justice of the peace i tryd a little by attending a few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes but finding that more knowledge of the common law than i possessd was necessary to act in that station with credit i gradually withdrew from it excusing myself by my being obligd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the assembly my election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years without my ever asking any elector for his vote or signifying either directly or indirectly any desire of being chosen on taking my seat in the house my son was appointed their clerk

the year following a treaty being to be held with the indians at carlisle the governor sent a message to the house proposing that they should nominate some of their members to be joind with some members of council as commissioners for that purpose88 the house named the speaker mr norris and myself and being commissiond we went to carlisle and met the indians accordingly

as those people are extreamly apt to get drunk and when so are very quarrelsome and disorderly we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to them and when they complaind of this restriction we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty we would give them plenty of rum when business was over they promisd this and they kept their promise because they could get no liquor and the treaty was conducted very orderly and concluded to mutual satisfaction they then claimd and received the rum this was in the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodgd in temporary cabins built in the form of a square just without the town in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter we found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their darkcolourd bodies half naked seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied by their horrid yellings formd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagind there was no appeasing the tumult and we retired to our lodging at midnight a number of them came thundering at our door demanding more rum of which we took no notice

the next day sensible they had misbehavd in giving us that disturbance they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology the orator acknowledgd the fault but laid it upon the rum and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying the great spirit who made all things made everything for some use and whatever use he designd anything for that use it should always be put to now when he made rum he said let this be for the indians to get drunk with and it must be so and indeed if it be the design of providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means it has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the seacoast

in 1751 dr thomas bond a particular friend of mine conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in philadelphia a very beneficent design which has been ascribd to me but was originally his for the reception and cure of poor sick persons whether inhabitants of the province or strangers he was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being a novelty in america and at first not well understood he met but with small success

at length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a publicspirited project through without my being concernd in it for says he i am often askd by those to whom i propose subscribing have you consulted franklin upon this business and what does he think of it and when i tell them that i have not supposing it rather out of your line they do not subscribe but say they will consider of it i enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation i not only subscribd to it myself but engagd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others previously however to the solicitation i endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers which was my usual custom in such cases but which he had omitted

the subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous but beginning to flag i saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the assembly and therefore proposd to petition for it which was done the country members did not at first relish the project they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approvd of it my allegation on the contrary that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations they considered as a most extravagant supposition and utterly impossible

on this i formd my plan and asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition and granting them a blank sum of money which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the house could throw the bill out if they did not like it i drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one viz and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of——value the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital free of charge for diet attendance advice and medicines and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the assembly for the time being that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker and he is hereby required to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds in two yearly payments to the treasurer of the said hospital to be applied to the founding building and finishing of the same

this condition carried the bill through for the members who had opposd the grant and now conceivd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense agreed to its passage and then in soliciting subscriptions among the people we urgd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give since every mans donation would be doubled thus the clause workd both ways the subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum and we claimd and receivd the public gift which enabled us to carry the design into execution a convenient and handsome building was soon erected the institution has by constant experience been found useful and flourishes to this day and i do not remember any of my political manoeuvers the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure or wherein after thinking of it i more easily excusd myself for having made some use of cunning

it was about this time that another projector the rev gilbert tennent89 came to me with a request that i would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meetinghouse it was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the presbyterians who were originally disciples of mr whitefield unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellowcitizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions i absolutely refusd he then desired i would furnish him with a list of the names of persons i knew by experience to be generous and publicspirited i thought it would be unbecoming in me after their kind compliance with my solicitations to mark them out to be worried by other beggars and therefore refusd also to give such a list he then desird i would at least give him my advice that i will readily do said i and in the first place i advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something next to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not and show them the list of those who have given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken he laughd and thankd me and said he would take my advice he did so for he askd of everybody and he obtaind a much larger sum than he expected with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meetinghouse that stands in archstreet

our city tho laid out with a beautiful regularity the streets large straight and crossing each other at right angles had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpavd and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages ploughd them into a quagmire so that it was difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust was offensive i had livd near what was calld the jersey market and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions a strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pavd with brick so that being once in the market they had firm footing but were often over shoes in dirt to get there by talking and writing on the subject i was at length instrumental in getting the street pavd with stone between the market and the brickd footpavement that was on each side next the houses this for some time gave an easy access to the market dryshod but the rest of the street not being pavd whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement it shook off and left its dirt upon it and it was soon coverd with mire which was not removd the city as yet having no scavengers

after some inquiry i found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours doors for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house i then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtaind by this small expense the greater ease in keeping our houses clean so much dirt not being brought in by peoples feet the benefit to the shops by more custom etc etc as buyers could more easily get at them and by not having in windy weather the dust blown in upon their goods etc etc i sent one of these papers to each house and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences it was unanimously signd and for a time well executed all the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market it being a convenience to all and this raisd a general desire to have all the streets paved and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose

after some time i drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the assembly it was just before i went to england in 1757 and did not pass till i was gone90 and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment which i thought not for the better but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets which was a great improvement it was by a private person the late mr john clifton his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one at his door that the people were first impressd with the idea of enlighting all the city the honour of this public benefit has also been ascribd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman i did but follow his example and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplyd with from london those we found inconvenient in these respects they admitted no air below the smoke therefore did not readily go out above but circulated in the globe lodgd on its inside and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford giving besides the daily trouble of wiping them clean and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it totally useless i therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke by this means they were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hours as the london lamps do but continud bright till morning and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane easily repaird

i have sometimes wonderd that the londoners did not from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps usd at vauxhall91 have in keeping them clean learn to have such holes in their street lamps but these holes being made for another purpose viz to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro them the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of and therefore after the lamps have been lit a few hours the streets of london are very poorly illuminated

the mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one i proposd when in london to dr fothergill who was among the best men i have known and a great promoter of useful projects i had observd that the streets when dry were never swept and the light dust carried away but it was sufferd to accumulate till wet weather reducd it to mud and then after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms it was with great labour rakd together and thrown up into carts open above the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometimes to the annoyance of footpassengers the reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses

an accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time i found at my door in cravenstreet92 one morning a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom she appeared very pale and feeble as just come out of a fit of sickness i askd who employd her to sweep there she said nobody but i am very poor and in distress and i sweeps before gentlefolkses doors and hopes they will give me something i bid her sweep the whole street clean and i would give her a shilling this was at nine oclock at 12 she came for the shilling from the slowness i saw at first in her working i could scarce believe that the work was done so soon and sent my servant to examine it who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean and all the dust placd in the gutter which was in the middle and the next rain washd it quite away so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean

i then judgd that if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours a strong active man might have done it in half the time and here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street running down its middle instead of two one on each side near the footway for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with but when divided into two channels it is often too weak to cleanse either and only makes the mud it finds more fluid so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the footpavement which is thereby rendered foul and slippery and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking my proposal communicated to the good doctor was as follows

for the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of london and westminster it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons and the mud rakd up at other times each in the several streets and lanes of his round that they be furnishd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes to be kept at their respective stands ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service

that in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened when the scavengers with closecovered carts shall also carry it all away

that the mud when rakd up be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts not placd high upon wheels but low upon sliders with lattice bottoms which being coverd with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit the water to drain from it whereby it will become much lighter water making the greatest part of its weight these bodies of carts to be placd at convenient distances and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows they remaining where placd till the mud is draind and then horses brought to draw them away

i have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal on account of the narrowness of some streets and the difficulty of placing the drainingsleds so as not to encumber too much the passage but i am still of opinion that the former requiring the dust to be swept up and carryd away before the shops are open is very practicable in the summer when the days are long for in walking thro the strand and fleetstreet one morning at seven oclock i observd there was not one shop open tho it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours the inhabitants of london chusing voluntarily to live much by candlelight and sleep by sunshine and yet often complain a little absurdly of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow

some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating but when they consider that tho dust blown into the eyes of a single person or into a single shop on a windy day is but of small importance yet the great number of the instances in a populous city and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day thus if you teach a poor young man to shave himself and keep his razor in order you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas the money may be soon spent the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it but in the other case he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers and of their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breaths and dull razors he shaves when most convenient to him and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument with these sentiments i have hazarded the few preceding pages hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city i love having lived many years in it very happily and perhaps to some of our towns in america

having been for some time employed by the postmastergeneral of america as his comptroller in regulating several offices and bringing the officers to account i was upon his death in 1753 appointed jointly with mr william hunter to succeed him by a commission from the postmastergeneral in england the american office never had hitherto paid anything to that of britain we were to have six hundred pounds a year between us if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office to do this a variety of improvements were necessary some of these were inevitably at first expensive so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us but it soon after began to repay us and before i was displacd by a freak of the ministers of which i shall speak hereafter we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of ireland since that imprudent transaction they have receivd from it—not one farthing

the business of the postoffice occasiond my taking a journey this year to new england where the college of cambridge of their own motion presented me with the degree of master of arts yale college in connecticut had before made me a similar compliment thus without studying in any college i came to partake of their honours they were conferrd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy

albany plan of union

blockin 1754 war with france being again apprehended a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was by an order of the lords of trade to be assembled at albany there to confer with the chiefs of the six nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours governor hamilton having receivd this order acquainted the house with it requesting they would furnish proper presents for the indians to be given on this occasion and naming the speaker mr norris and myself to join mr thomas penn and mr secretary peters as commissioners to act for pennsylvania the house approvd the nomination and provided the goods for the present and tho they did not much like treating out of the provinces and we met the other commissioners at albany about the middle of june

in our way thither i projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for defense and other important general purposes as we passd thro new york i had there shown my project to mr james alexander and mr kennedy two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs and being fortified by their approbation i venturd to lay it before the congress it then appeared that several of the commissioners had formd plans of the same kind a previous question was first taken whether a union should be established which passd in the affirmative unanimously a committee was then appointed one member from each colony to consider the several plans and report mine happend to be preferrd and with a few amendments was accordingly reported

join or die
by this plan the general government was to be administered by a presidentgeneral appointed and supported by the crown and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies met in their respective assemblies the debates upon it in congress went on daily hand in hand with the indian business many objections and difficulties were started but at length they were all overcome and the plan was unanimously agreed to and copies ordered to be transmitted to the board of trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces its fate was singular the assemblies did not adopt it as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it and in england it was judgd to have too much of the democratic the board of trade therefore did not approve of it nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty but another scheme was formd supposed to answer the same purpose better whereby the governors of the provinces with some members of their respective councils were to meet and order the raising of troops building of forts etc and to draw on the treasury of great britain for the expense which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of parliament laying a tax on america my plan with my reasons in support of it is to be found among my political papers that are printed

being the winter following in boston i had much conversation with governor shirley upon both the plans part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers the different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium and i am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted the colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves there would then have been no need of troops from england of course the subsequent pretence for taxing america and the bloody contest it occasioned would have been avoided but such mistakes are not new history is full of the errors of states and princes

look round the habitable world how few
know their own good or knowing it pursue
those who govern having much business on their hands do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects the best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom but forcd by the occasion

the governor of pennsylvania in sending it down to the assembly expressed his approbation of the plan as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention the house however by the management of a certain member took it up when i happend to be absent which i thought not very fair and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all to my no small mortification

quarrels with the proprietary governors

blockin my journey to boston this year i met at new york with our new governor mr morris just arrivd there from england with whom i had been before intimately acquainted he brought a commission to supersede mr hamilton who tird with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to had resignd mr morris askd me if i thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration i said no you may on the contrary have a very comfortable one if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the assembly my dear friend says he pleasantly how can you advise my avoiding disputes you know i love disputing it is one of my greatest pleasures however to show the regard i have for your counsel i promise you i will if possible avoid them he had some reason for loving to dispute being eloquent an acute sophister and therefore generally successful in argumentative conversation he had been brought up to it from a boy his father as i have heard accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion while sitting at table after dinner but i think the practice was not wise for in the course of my observation these disputing contradicting and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs they get victory sometimes but they never get good will which would be of more use to them we parted he going to philadelphia and i to boston

in returning i met at new york with the votes of the assembly by which it appeard that notwithstanding his promise to me he and the house were already in high contention and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retaind the government i had my share of it for as soon as i got back to my seat in the assembly i was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages and by the committees always desired to make the drafts our answers as well as his messages were often tart and sometimes indecently abusive and as he knew i wrote for the assembly one might have imagined that when we met we could hardly avoid cutting throats but he was so goodnaturd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasiond by the contest and we often dind together

one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street
one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street franklin says he you must go home with me and spend the evening i am to have some company that you will like and taking me by the arm he led me to his house in gay conversation over our wine after supper he told us jokingly that he much admird the idea of sancho panza93 who when it was proposed to give him a government requested it might be a government of blacks as then if he could not agree with his people he might sell them one of his friends who sat next to me says franklin why do you continue to side with these damnd quakers had not you better sell them the proprietor would give you a good price the governor says i has not yet blacked them enough he indeed had laboured hard to blacken the assembly in all his messages but they wipd off his colouring as fast as he laid it on and placd it in return thick upon his own face so that finding he was likely to be negrofied himself he as well as mr hamilton grew tird of the contest and quitted the government

these public quarrels94 were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries our hereditary governors who when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions the assemblies for three years held out against this injustice tho constrained to bend at last at length captain denny who was governor morriss successor ventured to disobey those instructions how that was brought about i shall show hereafter

but i am got forward too fast with my story there are still some transactions to be mentiond that happened during the administration of governor morris

war being in a manner commenced with france the government of massachusetts bay projected an attack upon crown point95 and sent mr quincy to pennsylvania and mr pownall afterward governor pownall to new york to solicit assistance as i was in the assembly knew its temper and was mr quincys countryman he applid to me for my influence and assistance i dictated his address to them which was well received they voted an aid of ten thousand pounds to be laid out in provisions but the governor refusing his assent to their bill which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary the assembly tho very desirous of making their grant to new england effectual were at a loss how to accomplish it mr quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent but he was obstinate

i then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor by orders on the trustees of the loan office which by law the assembly had the right of drawing there was indeed little or no money at that time in the office and therefore i proposd that the orders should be payable in a year and to bear an interest of five per cent with these orders i supposd the provisions might easily be purchasd the assembly with very little hesitation adopted the proposal the orders were immediately printed and i was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them the fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan together with the revenue arising from the excise which being known to be more than sufficient they obtaind instant credit and were not only receivd in payment for the provisions but many moneyd people who had cash lying by them vested it in those orders which they found advantageous as they bore interest while upon hand and might on any occasion be used as money so that they were eagerly all bought up and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen thus this important affair was by my means completed mr quincy returnd thanks to the assembly in a handsome memorial went home highly pleasd with this success of his embassy and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship

braddocks expedition

blockthe british government not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as proposd at albany and to trust that union with their defense lest they should thereby grow too military and feel their own strength suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertaind of them sent over general braddock with two regiments of regular english troops for that purpose he landed at alexandria in virginia and thence marchd to frederictown in maryland where he halted for carriages our assembly apprehending from some information that he had conceived violent prejudices against them as averse to the service wishd me to wait upon him not as from them but as postmastergeneral under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence and of which they proposd to pay the expense my son accompanied me on this journey

we found the general at frederictown waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro the back parts of maryland and virginia to collect waggons i stayed with him several days dind with him daily and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices by the information of what the assembly had before his arrival actually done and were still willing to do to facilitate his operations when i was about to depart the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in by which it appeard that they amounted only to twentyfive and not all of those were in serviceable condition the general and all the officers were surprisd declard the expedition was then at an end being impossible and exclaimd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores baggage etc not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary

i happend to say i thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon the general eagerly laid hold of my words and said then you sir who are a man of interest there can probably procure them for us and i beg you will undertake it i askd what terms were to be offerd the owners of the waggons and i was desird to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary this i did and they were agreed to and a commission and instructions accordingly prepard immediately what those terms were will appear in the advertisement i publishd as soon as i arrivd at lancaster which being from the great and sudden effect it producd a piece of some curiosity i shall insert it at length as follows

advertisement

to the inhabitants of the counties of lancaster york and cumberland
friends and countrymen

being occasionally96 at the camp at frederic a few days since i found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been expected from this province as most able to furnish them but through the dissensions between our governor and assembly money had not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose

it was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them

i apprehended that the progress of british soldiers through these counties on such an occasion especially considering the temper they are in and their resentment against us would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means the people of these back counties have lately complained to the assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum for if the service of this expedition should continue as it is more than probable it will for one hundred and twenty days the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds which will be paid you in silver and gold of the kings money

the service will be light and easy for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day and the waggons and baggagehorses as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army must march with the army and no faster and are for the armys sake always placed where they can be most secure whether in a march or in a camp

if you are really as i believe you are good and loyal subjects to his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it easy to yourselves for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver may do it together one furnishing the waggon another one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay proportionately between you but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected the kings business must be done so many brave troops come so far for your defense must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you waggons and horses must be had violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be little pitied or regarded

i have no particular interest in this affair as except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good i shall have only my labour for my pains if this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed i am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days and i suppose sir john st clair the hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose which i shall be sorry to hear because i am very sincerely and truly your friend and wellwisher

b franklin

i received of the general about eight hundred pounds to be disbursed in advancemoney to the waggon owners etc but that sum being insufficient i advancd upward of two hundred pounds more and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons with two hundred and fiftynine carrying horses were on their march for the camp the advertisement promised payment according to the valuation in case any waggon or horse should be lost the owners however alleging they did not know general braddock or what dependence might be had on his promise insisted on my bond for the performance which i accordingly gave them

while i was at the camp supping one evening with the officers of colonel dunbars regiment he represented to me his concern for the subalterns who he said were generally not in affluence and could ill afford in this dear country to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march thro a wilderness where nothing was to be purchasd i commiserated their case and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief i said nothing however to him of my intention but wrote the next morning to the committee of the assembly who had the disposition of some public money warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments my son who had some experience of a camp life and of its wants drew up a list for me which i enclosd in my letter the committee approvd and used such diligence that conducted by my son the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons they consisted of twenty parcels each containing

6 lbs loaf sugar	1 gloucester cheese
6 lbs good muscovado do	1 kegg containing 20 lbs good butter
1 lb good green tea	2 doz old madeira wine
1 lb good bohea do	2 gallons jamaica spirits
6 lbs good ground coffee	1 bottle flour of mustard
6 lbs chocolate	2 wellcurd hams
12 cwt best white biscuit	12 dozen dryd tongues
12 lb pepper	6 lbs rice
1 quart best white wine	6 lbs raisins
1 quart best white wine vinegar

these twenty parcels well packd were placed on as many horses each parcel with the horse being intended as a present for one officer they were very thankfully receivd and the kindness acknowledgd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments in the most grateful terms the general too was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons etc and readily paid my account of disbursements thanking me repeatedly and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him i undertook this also and was busily employd in it till we heard of his defeat advancing for the service of my own money upwards of one thousand pounds sterling of which i sent him an account it came to his hands luckily for me a few days before the battle and he returnd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds leaving the remainder to the next account i consider this payment as good luck having never been able to obtain that remainder of which more hereafter

this general was i think a brave man and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some european war but he had too much selfconfidence too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops and too mean a one of both americans and indians george croghan our indian interpreter joind him on his march with one hundred of those people who might have been of great use to his army as guides scouts etc if he had treated them kindly but he slighted and neglected them and they gradually left him

in conversation with him one day he was giving me some account of his intended progress after taking fort duquesne97 says he i am to proceed to niagara and having taken that to frontenac98 if the season will allow time and i suppose it will for duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days and then i see nothing that can obstruct my march to niagara having before revolvd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road to be cut for them thro the woods and bushes and also what i had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred french who invaded the iroquois country i had conceivd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign but i venturd only to say to be sure sir if you arrive well before duquesne with these fine troops so well provided with artillery that place not yet completely fortified and as we hear with no very strong garrison can probably make but a short resistance the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians who by constant practice are dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attackd by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come up in time to support each other

he smild at my ignorance and replyd these savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw american militia but upon the kings regular and disciplind troops sir it is impossible they should make any impression i was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession and said no more the enemy however did not take the advantage of his army which i apprehended its long line of march exposd it to but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place and then when more in a body for it had just passed a river where the front had halted till all were come over and in a more open part of the woods than any it had passd attackd its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemys being near him this guard being disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance which was done in great confusion thro waggons baggage and cattle and presently the fire came upon their flank the officers being on horseback were more easily distinguishd pickd out as marks and fell very fast and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till twothirds of them were killed and then being seizd with a panick the whole fled with precipitation

the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians
the waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamperd their example was immediately followed by others so that all the waggons provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy the general being wounded was brought off with difficulty his secretary mr shirley was killed by his side and out of eightysix officers sixtythree were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred these eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army the rest had been left behind with colonel dunbar who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores provisions and baggage the flyers not being pursud arrivd at dunbars camp and the panick they brought with them instantly seizd him and all his people and tho he had now above one thousand men and the enemy who had beaten braddock did not at most exceed four hundred indians and french together instead of proceeding and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour he ordered all the stores ammunition etc to be destroyd that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements and less lumber to remove he was there met with requests from the governors of virginia maryland and pennsylvania that he would post his troops on the frontier so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants but he continued his hasty march thro all the country not thinking himself safe till he arrived at philadelphia where the inhabitants could protect him this whole transaction gave us americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regulars had not been well founded99

in their first march too from their landing till they got beyond the settlements they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants totally ruining some poor families besides insulting abusing and confining the people if they remonstrated this was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders if we had really wanted any how different was the conduct of our french friends in 1781 who during a march thro the most inhabited part of our country from rhode island to virginia near seven hundred miles occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an apple

captain orme who was one of the generals aidsdecamp and being grievously wounded was brought off with him and continud with him to his death which happend in a few days told me that he was totally silent all the first day and at night only said who would have thought it that he was silent again the following day saying only at last we shall better know how to deal with them another time and dyd in a few minutes after

the secretarys papers with all the generals orders instructions and correspondence falling into the enemys hands they selected and translated into french a number of the articles which they printed to prove the hostile intentions of the british court before the declaration of war among these i saw some letters of the general to the ministry speaking highly of the great service i had rendered the army and recommending me to their notice david hume100 too who was some years after secretary to lord hertford when minister in france and afterward to general conway when secretary of state told me he had seen among the papers in that office letters from braddock highly recommending me but the expedition having been unfortunate my service it seems was not thought of much value for those recommendations were never of any use to me

as to rewards from himself i askd only one which was that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted this he readily granted and several were accordingly returnd to their masters on my application dunbar when the command devolvd on him was not so generous he being at philadelphia on his retreat or rather flight i applyd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of lancaster county that he had enlisted reminding him of the late generals orders on that head he promised me that if the masters would come to him at trenton where he should be in a few days on his march to new york he would there deliver their men to them they accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to trenton and there he refusd to perform his promise to their great loss and disappointment

as soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known all the owners came upon me for the valuation which i had given bond to pay their demands gave me a great deal of trouble my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymasters hands but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from general shirley101 and my assuring them that i had applyd to that general by letter but he being at a distance an answer could not soon be receivd and they must have patience all this was not sufficient to satisfy and some began to sue me general shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims and ordering payment they amounted to near twenty thousand pound which to pay would have ruined me

before we had the news of this defeat the two doctors bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking fort duquesne i looked grave and said it would i thought be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice they seemd surprisd that i did not immediately comply with their proposal why the d——l says one of them you surely dont suppose that the fort will not be taken i dont know that it will not be taken but i know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty i gave them the reasons of my doubting the subscription was dropt and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared dr bond on some other occasion afterward said that he did not like franklins forebodings

governor morris who had continually worried the assembly with message after message before the defeat of braddock to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province without taxing among others the proprietary estates and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success the danger and necessity being greater the assembly however continud firm believing they had justice on their side and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their moneybills in one of the last indeed which was for granting fifty thousand pounds his proposd amendment was only of a single word the bill expressd that all estates real and personal were to be taxed those of the proprietaries not excepted his amendment was for not read only a small but very material alteration however when the news of this disaster reached england our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the assemblys answers to the governors messages raisd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions some going so far as to say that by obstructing the defense of their province they forfeited their right to it they were intimidated by this and sent orders to their receivergeneral to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the assembly for such purpose

this being notified to the house was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax and a new bill was formd with an exempting clause which passed accordingly by this act i was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money sixty thousand pounds i had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage and had at the same time drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia which i carried thro the house without much difficulty as care was taken in it to leave the quakers at their liberty to promote the association necessary to form the militia i wrote a dialogue102 stating and answering all the objections i could think of to such a militia which was printed and had as i thought great effect

franklins defense of the frontier

blockwhile the several companies in the city and country were forming and learning their exercise the governor prevaild with me to take charge of our northwestern frontier which was infested by the enemy and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts i undertook this military business tho i did not conceive myself well qualified for it he gave me a commission with full powers and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to be given to whom i thought fit i had but little difficulty in raising men having soon five hundred and sixty under my command my son who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army raisd against canada was my aiddecamp and of great use to me the indians had burned gnadenhut103 a village settled by the moravians and massacred the inhabitants but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts

in order to march thither i assembled the companies at bethlehem the chief establishment of those people i was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense the destruction of gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger the principal buildings were defended by a stockade they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from new york and had even placd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw down upon the heads of any indians that should attempt to force into them the armed brethren too kept watch and relievd as methodically as in any garrison town in conversation with the bishop spangenberg i mentiond this my surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies i had supposd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms he answerd me that it was not one of their established principles but that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a principle with many of their people on this occasion however they to their surprise found it adopted by but a few it seems they were either deceivd in themselves or deceivd the parliament but common sense aided by present danger will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions

it was the beginning of january when we set out upon this business of building forts i sent one detachment toward the minisink with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country and another to the lower part with similar instructions and i concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to gnadenhut where a fort was thot more immediately necessary the moravians procurd me five waggons for our tools stores baggage etc

just before we left bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven from their plantations by the indians came to me requesting a supply of firearms that they might go back and fetch off their cattle i gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition we had not marchd many miles before it began to rain and it continued raining all day there were no habitations on the road to shelter us till we arrivd near night at the house of a german where and in his barn we were all huddled together as wet as water could make us it was well we were not attackd in our march for our arms were of the most ordinary sort and our men could not keep their gun locks104 dry the indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose which we had not they met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned and killed ten of them the one who escapd informd that his and his companions guns would not go off the priming being wet with the rain

we had not marchd many miles before it began to rain
the next day being fair we continud our march and arrivd at the desolated gnadenhut there was a sawmill near round which were left several piles of boards with which we soon hutted ourselves an operation the more necessary at that inclement season as we had no tents our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there who had been half interrd by the country people

the next morning our fort was plannd and markd out the circumference measuring four hundred and fiftyfive feet which would require as many palisades to be made of trees one with another of a foot diameter each our axes of which we had seventy were immediately set to work to cut down trees and our men being dexterous in the use of them great despatch was made seeing the trees fall so fast i had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine in six minutes they had it upon the ground and i found it of fourteen inches diameter each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end while these were preparing our other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisades were to be planted and our waggons the bodys being taken off and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch105 we had ten carriages with two horses each to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot when they were set up our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within about six feet high for the men to stand on when to fire thro the loopholes we had one swivel gun which we mounted on one of the angles and fird it as soon as fixd to let the indians know if any were within hearing that we had such pieces and thus our fort if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade was finishd in a week though it raind so hard every other day that the men could not work

our axes  were immediately set to work to cut down trees
our axes  were immediately set to work to cut down trees
this gave me occasion to observe that when men are employd they are best contentd for on the days they worked they were goodnaturd and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good days work they spent the evening jollily but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread etc and in continual illhumour which put me in mind of a seacaptain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work and when his mate once told him that they had done everything and there was nothing further to employ them about oh says he make them scour the anchor

this kind of fort however contemptible is a sufficient defense against indians who have no cannon finding ourselves now posted securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we venturd out in parties to scour the adjacent country we met with no indians but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings there was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention it being winter a fire was necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discoverd their position at a distance they had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter and somewhat deeper we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods with these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we observd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by their laying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point this kind of fire so managd could not discover them either by its light flame sparks or even smoke it appeard that their number was not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage

we had for our chaplain a zealous presbyterian minister mr beatty who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations when they enlisted they were promised besides pay and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually servd out to them half in the morning and the other half in the evening and i observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it upon which i said to mr beatty it is perhaps below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers you would have them all about you he liked the thot undertook the office and with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended so that i thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for nonattendance on divine service

i had hardly finishd this business and got my fort well stord with provisions when i receivd a letter from the governor acquainting me that he had calld the assembly and wished my attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary my friends too of the assembly pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and my three intended forts being now compleated and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection i resolved to return the more willingly as a new england officer colonel clapham experienced in indian war being on a visit to our establishment consented to accept the command i gave him a commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and introducd him to them as an officer who from his skill in military affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving them a little exhortation took my leave i was escorted as far as bethlehem where i rested a few days to recover from the fatigue i had undergone the first night being in a good bed i could hardly sleep it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two

while at bethlehem i inquird a little into the practice of the moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to me i found they workd for a common stock ate at common tables and slept in common dormitories great numbers together in the dormitories i observed loopholes at certain distances all along just under the ceiling which i thought judiciously placed for change of air i was at their church where i was entertaind with good musick the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes clarinets etc i understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other times their wives then the young men the young women and the little children each division by itself the sermon i heard was to the latter who came in and were placd in rows on benches the boys under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a young woman the discourse seemd well adapted to their capacities and was delivered in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it were to be good they behavd very orderly but looked pale and unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors or not allowd sufficient exercise

i inquird concerning the moravian marriages whether the report was true that they were by lot i was told that lots were usd only in particular cases that generally when a young man found himself disposd to marry he informd the elders of his class who consulted the elder ladies that governd the young women as these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were suitable and their judgments were generally acquiescd in but if for example it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then recurred to i objected if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties some of them may chance to be very unhappy and so they may answerd my informer if you let the parties chuse for themselves which indeed i could not deny

being returned to philadelphia i found the association went on swimmingly the inhabitants that were not quakers having pretty generally come into it formed themselves into companies and chose their captains lieutenants and ensigns according to the new law dr b visited me and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law and ascribed much to those endeavours i had had the vanity to ascribe all to my dialogue however not knowing but that he might be in the right i let him enjoy his opinion which i take to be generally the best way in such cases the officers meeting chose me to be colonel of the regiment which i this time accepted i forget how many companies we had but we paraded about twelve hundred welllooking men with a company of artillery who had been furnished with six brass fieldpieces which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute the first time i reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus and my new honour proved not much less brittle for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in england

during this short time of my colonelship being about to set out on a journey to virginia the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as far as the lower ferry just as i was getting on horseback they came to my door between thirty and forty mounted and all in their uniforms i had not been previously acquainted with the project or i should have prevented it being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion and i was a good deal chagrind at their appearance as i could not avoid their accompanying me what made it worse was that as soon as we began to move they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor and it gave him great offense no such honour had been paid him when in the province nor to any of his governors and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal which may be true for aught i know who was and still am ignorant of the etiquette in such cases

this silly affair however greatly increased his rancour against me which was before not a little on account of my conduct in the assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation which i had always opposd very warmly and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it he accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the kings service preventing by my influence in the house the proper form of the bills for raising money and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force he also applied to sir everard fawkener the postmastergeneral to deprive me of my office but it had no other effect than to procure from sir everard a gentle admonition

notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the house in which i as a member had so large a share there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself and we never had any personal difference i have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me for the answers it was known i drew up to his messages might be the effect of professional habit and that being bred a lawyer he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit he for the proprietaries and i for the assembly he would therefore sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points and sometimes tho not often take my advice

we acted in concert to supply braddocks army with provisions and when the shocking news arrived of his defeat the governor sent in haste for me to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties i forget now the advice i gave but i think it was that dunbar should be written to and prevaild with if possible to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection till by reinforcements from the colonies he might be able to proceed on the expedition and after my return from the frontier he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops for the reduction of fort duquesne dunbar and his men being otherwise employed and he proposed to commission me as general i had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he professd to have and i believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men and my influence in assembly the grant of money to pay them and that perhaps without taxing the proprietary estate finding me not so forward to engage as he expected the project was dropt and he soon after left the government being superseded by captain denny

scientific experiments

blockbefore i proceed in relating the part i had in public affairs under this new governors administration it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation

in 1746 being at boston i met there with a dr spence who was lately arrived from scotland and showd me some electric experiments they were imperfectly performd as he was not very expert but being on a subject quite new to me they equally surprisd and pleased me soon after my return to philadelphia our library company receivd from mr p collinson fellow of the royal society106 of london a present of a glass tube with some account of the use of it in making such experiments i eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what i had seen at boston and by much practice acquired great readiness in performing those also which we had an account of from england adding a number of new ones i say much practice for my house was continually full for some time with people who came to see these new wonders

to divide a little this incumbrance among my friends i caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse with which they furnishd themselves so that we had at length several performers among these the principal was mr kinnersley an ingenious neighbour who being out of business i encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money and drew up for him two lectures in which the experiments were rangd in such order and accompanied with such explanations in such method as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following he procurd an elegant apparatus for the purpose in which all the little machines that i had roughly made for myself were nicely formd by instrumentmakers his lectures were well attended and gave great satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies exhibiting them in every capital town and pickd up some money in the west india islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments could be made from the general moisture of the air

obligd as we were to mr collinson for his present of the tube etc i thought it right he should be informd of our success in using it and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments he got them read in the royal society where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their transactions one paper which i wrote for mr kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with electricity107 i sent to dr mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs the papers however being shown to dr fothergill he thought them of too much value to be stifled and advisd the printing of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for publication in his gentlemans magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and dr fothergill wrote the preface cave it seems judged rightly for his profit for by the additions that arrived afterward they swelld to a quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for copymoney

it was however some time before those papers were much taken notice of in england a copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the count de buffon108 a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in france and indeed all over europe he prevailed with m dalibard109 to translate them into french and they were printed at paris the publication offended the abbé nollet preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family and an able experimenter who had formd and publishd a theory of electricity which then had the general vogue he could not at first believe that such a work came from america and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at paris to decry his system afterwards having been assurd that there really existed such a person as franklin at philadelphia which he had doubted he wrote and published a volume of letters chiefly addressd to me defending his theory and denying the verity of my experiments and of the positions deducd from them

i once purposd answering the abbé and actually began the answer but on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify and if not to be verifid could not be defended or of observations offerd as conjectures and not delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing in different languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations and thence misconceptions of one anothers meaning much of one of the abbés letters being founded on an error in the translation i concluded to let my papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend what time i could spare from public business in making new experiments than in disputing about those already made i therefore never answered m nollet and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my friend m le roy of the royal academy of sciences took up my cause and refuted him my book was translated into the italian german and latin languages and the doctrine it containd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of europe in preference to that of the abbé so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except monsieur b—— of paris his élève and immediate disciple

what gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success of one of its proposed experiments made by messrs dalibard and de lor at marly for drawing lightning from the clouds this engagd the public attention everywhere m de lor who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy and lecturd in that branch of science undertook to repeat what he called the philadelphia experiments and after they were performed before the king and court all the curious of paris flocked to see them i will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment nor of the infinite pleasure i receivd in the success of a similar one i made soon after with a kite at philadelphia as both are to be found in the histories of electricity

dr wright an english physician when at paris wrote to a friend who was of the royal society an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in england the society on this resumd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them and the celebrated dr watson drew up a summary account of them and of all i had afterwards sent to england on the subject which he accompanied with some praise of the writer this summary was then printed in their transactions and some members of the society in london particularly the very ingenious mr canton having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod and acquainting them with the success they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me without my having made any application for that honour they chose me a member and voted that i should be excusd the customary payments which would have amounted to twentyfive guineas and ever since have given me their transactions gratis they also presented me with the gold medal of sir godfrey copley110 for the year 1753 the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president lord macclesfield wherein i was highly honoured

agent of pennsylvania in london

blockour new governor captain denny brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the royal society which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city he accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me having as he said been long acquainted with my character after dinner when the company as was customary at that time were engagd in drinking he took me aside into another room and acquainted me that he had been advisd by his friends in england to cultivate a friendship with me as one who was capable of giving him the best advice and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power he said much to me also of the proprietors good disposition towards the province and of the advantage it might be to us all and to me in particular if the opposition that had been so long continud to his measures was dropt and harmony restord between him and the people in effecting which it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself and i might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses etc etc the drinkers finding we did not return immediately to the table sent us a decanter of madeira which the governor made liberal use of and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises

my answers were to this purpose that my circumstances thanks to god were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me and that being a member of the assembly i could not possibly accept of any that however i had no personal enmity to the proprietary and that whenever the public measures he proposd should appear to be for the good of the people no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself my past opposition having been founded on this that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest with great prejudice to that of the people that i was much obliged to him the governor for his professions of regard to me and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with

on this he did not then explain himself but when he afterwards came to do business with the assembly they appeard again the disputes were renewed and i was as active as ever in the opposition being the penman first of the request to have a communication of the instructions and then of the remarks upon them which may be found in the votes of the time and in the historical review i afterward publishd but between us personally no enmity arose we were often together he was a man of letters had seen much of the world and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation he gave me the first information that my old friend jas ralph was still alive that he was esteemd one of the best political writers in england had been employed in the dispute111 between prince frederic and the king and had obtaind a pension of three hundred a year that his reputation was indeed small as a poet pope having damned his poetry in the dunciad112 but his prose was thought as good as any mans

the assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people but with the service of the crown resolvd to petition the king against them and appointed me their agent to go over to england to present and support the petition the house had sent up a bill to the governor granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the kings use ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general lord loudoun which the governor absolutely refusd to pass in compliance with his instructions

i had agreed with captain morris of the packet at new york for my passage and my stores were put on board when lord loudoun arrivd at philadelphia expressly as he told me to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and assembly that his majestys service might not be obstructed by their dissensions accordingly he desird the governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what was to be said on both sides we met and discussed the business in behalf of the assembly i urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time which were of my writing and are printed with the minutes of the assembly and the governor pleaded his instructions the bond he had given to observe them and his ruin if he disobeyd yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if lord loudoun would advise it this his lordship did not chuse to do though i once thought i had nearly prevaild with him to do it but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the assembly and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose declaring that he would spare none of the kings troops for the defense of our frontiers and that if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves they must remain exposd to the enemy

i acquainted the house with what had passd and presenting them with a set of resolutions i had drawn up declaring our rights and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro force against which we protested they at length agreed to drop that bill and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions this of course the governor passd and i was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage but in the meantime the packet had sailed with my seastores which was some loss to me and my only recompense was his lordships thanks for my service all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share

he set out for new york before me and as the time for dispatching the packetboats was at his disposition and there were two then remaining there one of which he said was to sail very soon i requested to know the precise time that i might not miss her by any delay of mine his answer was i have given out that she is to sail on saturday next but i may let you know entre nous that if you are there by monday morning you will be in time but do not delay longer by some accidental hindrance at a ferry it was monday noon before i arrived and i was much afraid she might have sailed as the wind was fair but i was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor and would not move till the next day one would imagine that i was now on the very point of departing for europe i thought so but i was not then so well acquainted with his lordships character of which indecision was one of the strongest features i shall give some instances it was about the beginning of april that i came to new york and i think it was near the end of june before we saild there were then two of the packetboats which had been long in port but were detained for the generals letters which were always to be ready tomorrow another packet arrivd she too was detaind and before we saild a fourth was expected ours was the first to be dispatchd as having been there longest passengers were engaged in all and some extremely impatient to be gone and the merchants uneasy about their letters and the orders they had given for insurance it being war time for fall goods but their anxiety availd nothing his lordships letters were not ready and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk pen in hand and concluded he must needs write abundantly

going myself one morning to pay my respects i found in his antechamber one innis a messenger of philadelphia who had come from thence express with a packet from governor denny for the general he delivered to me some letters from my friends there which occasiond my inquiring when he was to return and where he lodgd that i might send some letters by him he told me he was orderd to call tomorrow at nine for the generals answer to the governor and should set off immediately i put my letters into his hands the same day a fortnight after i met him again in the same place so you are soon returnd innis returnd no i am not gone yet how so i have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordships letter and it is not yet ready is it possible when he is so great a writer for i see him constantly at his escritoire yes says innis but he is like st george on the signs always on horseback and never rides on this observation of the messenger was it seems well founded for when in england i understood that mr pitt113 gave it as one reason for removing this general and sending generals amherst and wolfe that the minister never heard from him and could not know what he was doing

this daily expectation of sailing and all the three packets going down to sandy hook to join the fleet there the passengers thought it best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ships should sail and they be left behind there if i remember right we were about six weeks consuming our seastores and obligd to procure more at length the fleet saild the general and all his army on board bound to louisburg with the intent to besiege and take that fortress all the packetboats in company ordered to attend the generals ship ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready we were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for england the other two packets he still detained carried them with him to halifax where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts then altered his mind as to besieging louisburg and returned to new york with all his troops together with the two packets above mentioned and all their passengers during his absence the french and savages had taken fort george on the frontier of that province and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation

i saw afterwards in london captain bonnell who commanded one of those packets he told me that when he had been detaind a month he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing a point of consequence for a packetboat and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom he was asked how long time that would require he answered three days the general replied if you can do it in one day i give leave otherwise not for you must certainly sail the day after tomorrow so he never obtaind leave though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months

i saw also in london one of bonnells passengers who was so enragd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at new york and then carrying him to halifax and back again that he swore he would sue him for damages whether he did or not i never heard but as he represented the injury to his affairs it was very considerable

on the whole i wonderd much how such a man came to be intrusted114 with so important a business as the conduct of a great army but having since seen more of the great world and the means of obtaining and motives for giving places my wonder is diminished general shirley on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of braddock would in my opinion if continued in place have made a much better campaign than that of loudoun in 1757 which was frivolous expensive and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception for tho shirley was not a bred soldier he was sensible and sagacious in himself and attentive to good advice from others capable of forming judicious plans and quick and active in carrying them into execution loudoun instead of defending the colonies with his great army left them totally exposd while he paraded idly at halifax by which means fort george was lost besides he derangd all our mercantile operations and distressd our trade by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtaind by the enemy but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors in whose profits it was said perhaps from suspicion only he had a share and when at length the embargo was taken off by neglecting to send notice of it to charlestown the carolina fleet was detaind near three months longer whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home

shirley was i believe sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business i was at the entertainment given by the city of new york to lord loudoun on his taking upon him the command shirley tho thereby superseded was present also there was a great company of officers citizens and strangers and some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood there was one among them very low which fell to the lot of mr shirley perceiving it as i sat by him i said they have given you sir too low a seat no matter says he mr franklin i find a low seat the easiest

while i was as afore mentiond detaind at new york i receivd all the accounts of the provisions etc that i had furnishd to braddock some of which accounts could not sooner be obtaind from the different persons i had employd to assist in the business i presented them to lord loudoun desiring to be paid the balance he causd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer who after comparing every article with its voucher certified them to be right and the balance due for which his lordship promisd to give me an order on the paymaster this was however put off from time to time and tho i calld often for it by appointment i did not get it at length just before my departure he told me he had on better consideration concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors and you says he when in england have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury and you will be paid immediately

i mentiond but without effect the great and unexpected expense i had been put to by being detaind so long at new york as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid and on my observing that it was not right i should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money i had advancd as i charged no commission for my service o sir says he you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer we understand better those affairs and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means in the doing it to fill his own pockets i assurd him that was not my case and that i had not pocketed a farthing but he appeard clearly not to believe me and indeed i have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments as to my balance i am not paid it to this day of which more hereafter

our captain of the packet had boasted much before we sailed of the swiftness of his ship unfortunately when we came to sea she proved the dullest of ninetysix sail to his no small mortification after many conjectures respecting the cause when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours which however gaind upon us the captain ordered all hands to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as possible we were passengers included about forty persons while we stood there the ship mended her pace and soon left her neighbour far behind which provd clearly what our captain suspected that she was loaded too much by the head the casks of water it seems had been all placd forward these he therefore orderd to be movd further aft on which the ship recoverd her character and proved the best sailer in the fleet

the captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots which is accounted thirteen miles per hour we had on board as a passenger captain kennedy of the navy who contended that it was impossible and that no ship ever sailed so fast and that there must have been some error in the division of the logline or some mistake in heaving the log115 a wager ensud between the two captains to be decided when there should be sufficient wind kennedy thereupon examind rigorously the logline and being satisfid with that he determind to throw the log himself accordingly some days after when the wind blew very fair and fresh and the captain of the packet lutwidge said he believd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots kennedy made the experiment and ownd his wager lost

the above fact i give for the sake of the following observation it has been remarkd as an imperfection in the art of shipbuilding that it can never be known till she is tried whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a goodsailing ship has been exactly followd in a new one which has provd on the contrary remarkably dull i apprehend that this may partly be occasiond by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading rigging and sailing of a ship each has his system and the same vessel laden by the judgment and orders of one captain shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another besides it scarce ever happens that a ship is formd fitted for the sea and saild by the same person one man builds the hull another rigs her a third lades and sails her no one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others and therefore cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole

even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea i have often observd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches the wind being the same one would have the sails trimmd sharper or flatter than another so that they seemd to have no certain rule to govern by yet i think a set of experiments might be instituted first to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing next the best dimensions and properest place for the masts then the form and quantity of sails and their position as the wind may be and lastly the disposition of the lading this is an age of experiments and i think a set accurately made and combind would be of great use i am persuaded therefore that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it to whom i wish success

sailboat
we were several times chasd in our passage but outsaild every thing and in thirty days had soundings we had a good observation and the captain judgd himself so near our port falmouth that if we made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemys privateers who often cruisd near the entrance of the channel accordingly all the sail was set that we could possibly make and the wind being very fresh and fair we went right before it and made great way the captain after his observation shapd his course as he thought so as to pass wide of the scilly isles but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up st georges channel which deceives seamen and caused the loss of sir cloudesley shovels squadron this indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us

we had a watchman placd in the bow to whom they often called look well out before there and he as often answered ay ay but perhaps had his eyes shut and was half asleep at the time they sometimes answering as is said mechanically for he did not see a light just before us which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discoverd and occasiond a great alarm we being very near it the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel it was midnight and our captain fast asleep but captain kennedy jumping upon deck and seeing the danger ordered the ship to wear round all sails standing an operation dangerous to the masts but it carried us clear and we escaped shipwreck for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected this deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in america if i should live to return there

in the morning it was found by the soundings etc that we were near our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight about nine oclock the fog began to rise and seemd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a playhouse discovering underneath the town of falmouth the vessels in its harbor and the fields that surrounded it this was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasiond

i set out immediately with my son for london and we only stopt a little by the way to view stonehenge116 on salisbury plain and lord pembrokes house and gardens with his very curious antiquities at wilton we arrived in london the 27th of july 1757117

as soon as i was settled in a lodging mr charles had provided for me i went to visit dr fothergill to whom i was strongly recommended and whose counsel respecting my proceedings i was advisd to obtain he was against an immediate complaint to government and thought the proprietaries should first be personally applid to who might possibly be inducd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends to accommodate matters amicably i then waited on my old friend and correspondent mr peter collinson who told me that john hanbury the great virginia merchant had requested to be informed when i should arrive that he might carry me to lord granvilles118 who was then president of the council and wished to see me as soon as possible i agreed to go with him the next morning accordingly mr hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that noblemans who receivd me with great civility and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in america and discourse thereupon he said to me you americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution you contend that the kings instructions to his governors are not laws and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion but those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony they are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws they are then considered debated and perhaps amended in council after which they are signed by the king they are then so far as they relate to you the law of the land for the king is the legislator of the colonies119 i told his lordship this was new doctrine to me i had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our assemblies to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them and as the assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent so neither could he make a law for them without theirs he assurd me i was totally mistaken i did not think so however and his lordships conversation having a little alarmd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us i wrote it down as soon as i returnd to my lodgings i recollected that about 20 years before a clause in a bill brought into parliament by the ministry had proposd to make the kings instructions laws in the colonies but the clause was thrown out by the commons for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seemd that they had refusd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves

with his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of american character he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of england this conversation with grenville makes these last pages of the autobiography one of its most important parts

after some days dr fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries they agreed to a meeting with me at mr t penns house in spring garden the conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations but i suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable we then went into consideration of our several points of complaint which i enumerated the proprietaries justifyd their conduct as well as they could and i the assemblys we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement however it was concluded that i should give them the heads of our complaints in writing and they promisd then to consider them i did so soon after but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor ferdinand john paris who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of maryland lord baltimore which had subsisted 70 years and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the assembly he was a proud angry man and as i had occasionally in the answers of the assembly treated his papers with some severity they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression he had conceived a mortal enmity to me which discovering itself whenever we met i declind the proprietarys proposal that he and i should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves and refusd treating with anyone but them they then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the attorney and solicitorgeneral for their opinion and counsel upon it where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days during which time i made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the attorney and solicitorgeneral what it was when they did receive it i never learnt for they did not communicate it to me but sent a long message to the assembly drawn and signed by paris reciting my paper complaining of its want of formality as a rudeness on my part and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose intimating thereby that i was not such

we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement
we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement
the want of formality or rudeness was probably my not having addressd the paper to them with their assumd titles of true and absolute proprietaries of the province of pennsylvania which i omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing what in conversation i had delivered viva voce

but during this delay the assembly having prevailed with govr denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people which was the grand point in dispute they omitted answering the message

when this act however came over the proprietaries counselled by paris determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent accordingly they petitioned the king in council and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employd by them against the act and two by me in support of it they alledgd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people and that if it were sufferd to continue in force and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes they would inevitably be ruined we replyd that the act had no such intention and would have no such effect that the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves this is the purport of what i remember as urged by both sides except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal for that the money £100000 being printed and given to the kings use expended in his service and now spread among the people the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many and the total discouragement of future grants and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly was insisted on in the strongest terms on this lord mansfield one of the counsel rose and beckoning me took me into the clerks chamber while the lawyers were pleading and asked me if i was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act i said certainly then says he you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point i answerd none at all he then calld in paris and after some discourse his lordships proposition was accepted on both sides a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the clerk of the council which i signd with mr charles who was also an agent of the province for their ordinary affairs when lord mansfield returned to the council chamber where finally the law was allowed to pass some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law but the assembly did not think them necessary for one years tax having been levied by the act before the order of council arrived they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries after a full enquiry they unanimously signd a report that they found the tax had been assessd with perfect equity

the assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement as an essential service to the province since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country they gave me their thanks in form when i returnd but the proprietaries were enraged at governor denny for having passd the act and turnd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe he however having done it at the instance of the general and for his majestys service and having some powerful interest at court despisd the threats and they were never put in execution unfinished

electrical kite

to peter collinson
philadelphia oct 19 1752

sir

as frequent mention is made in public papers from europe of the success of the philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings c it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed that the same experiment has succeeded in philadelphia though made in a different and more easy manner which is as follows

make a small cross of two light strips of cedar the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross so you have the body of a kite which being properly accommodated with a tail loop and string will rise in the air like those made of paper but this being of silk is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thundergust without tearing to the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharppointed wire rising a foot or more above the wood to the end of the twine next the hand is to be tied a silk ribbon and where the silk and twine join a key may be fastened this kite is to be raised when a thundergust appears to be coming on and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window or under some cover so that the silk ribbon may not be wet and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window as soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them and the kite with all the twine will be electrified and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger and when the rain has wet the kite and twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle at this key the phial may be charged and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled and all the electric experiments be performed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated

from father abrahams speech 1760 reproduced from a copy at the new york public library

the way to wealth

from father abrahams speech forming the preface to poor richards almanac for 1758

it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people onetenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more if we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth or doing of nothing with that which is spent in idle employments or amusements that amount to nothing sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life sloth like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright as poor richard says but dost thou love life then do not squander time for thats the stuff life is made of as poor richard says how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says

if time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all easy as poor richard says and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him as we read in poor richard who adds drive thy business let not that drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise

industry need not wish and he that lives upon hope will die fasting

there are no gains without pains

he that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor but then the trade must be worked at and the calling well followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes

what though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy diligence is the mother of goodluck as poor richard says and god gives all things to industry

one today is worth two tomorrows and farther have you somewhat to do tomorrow do it today

if you were a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle

stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for constant dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable and little strokes fell great oaks

methinks i hear some of you say must a man afford himself no leisure i will tell thee my friend what poor richard says employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as poor richard says a life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things

keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again if you would have your business done go if not send

if you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself

a little neglect may breed great mischief adding for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for the want of care about a horseshoe nail

so much for industry my friends and attention to ones own business but to these we must add frugality

what maintains one vice would bring up two children you may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember what poor richard says many a little makes a mickle

beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship and again who dainties love shall beggars prove and moreover fools make feasts and wise men eat them

buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries

if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing

the second vice is lying the first is running in debt

lying rides upon debts back

poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright

and now to conclude experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we cannot give conduct as poor richard says however remember this they that wont be counseled cant be helped as poor richard says and farther that if you will not hear reason shell surely rap your knuckles

the whistle

to madame brillon
passy november 10 1779

i am charmed with your description of paradise and with your plan of living there and i approve much of your conclusion that in the meantime we should draw all the good we can from this world in my opinion we might all draw more good from it than we do and suffer less evil if we would take care not to give too much for whistles for to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by neglect of that caution

you ask what i mean you love stories and will excuse my telling one of myself

when i was a child of seven year old my friends on a holiday filled my pocket with coppers i went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that i met by the way in the hands of another boy i voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one i then came home and went whistling all over the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the family my brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain i had made told me i had given four times as much for it as it was worth put me in mind what good things i might have bought with the rest of the money and laughed at me so much for my folly that i cried with vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure

this however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing on my mind so that often when i was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing i said to myself dont give too much for the whistle and i saved my money

as i grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men i thought i met with many very many who gave too much for the whistle

when i saw one too ambitious of court favor sacrificing his time in attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps his friends to attain it i have said to myself this man gives too much for his whistle

when i saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by neglect he pays indeed said i too much for his whistle

if i knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all the pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellow citizens and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of accumulating wealth poor man said i you pay too much for your whistle

when i met with a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal sensations and ruining his health in their pursuit mistaken man said i you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you give too much for your whistle

if i see one fond of appearance or fine clothes fine houses fine furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he contracts debts and ends his career in a prison alas say i he has paid dear very dear for his whistle

when i see a beautiful sweettempered girl married to an illnatured brute of a husband what a pity say i that she should pay so much for a whistle

in short i conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things and by their giving too much for their whistles

yet i ought to have charity for these unhappy people when i consider that with all this wisdom of which i am boasting there are certain things in the world so tempting for example the apples of king john which happily are not to be bought for if they were put to sale by auction i might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase and find that i had once more given too much for the whistle

adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection

a letter to samuel mather

passy may 12 1784

revd sir

it is now more than 60 years since i left boston but i remember well both your father and grandfather having heard them both in the pulpit and seen them in their houses the last time i saw your father was in the beginning of 1724 when i visited him after my first trip to pennsylvania he received me in his library and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage which was crossed by a beam overhead we were still talking as i withdrew he accompanying me behind and i turning partly towards him when he said hastily stoop stoop i did not understand him till i felt my head hit against the beam he was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction and upon this he said to me you are young and have the world before you stoop as you go through it and you will miss many hard thumps this advice thus beat into my head has frequently been of use to me and i often think of it when i see pride mortified and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high
