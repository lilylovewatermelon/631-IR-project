it might look like the same old same
the same old town the same old name
come right in sit right down
find yourself hanging around
for a couple more days
and im here to tell you for a pretty small town
theres a whole lot of something going down down down

chorus
hey hey dig a little deeper
drive a little further down an old dirt road
old crow gets a little sweeter
once it gets to kicking and anything goes
my my amen
just wait until the stars come out
theres a whole lot of something going down down down
down home
down home

verse 2
just sing along with the radio
just the good old boys playing curtis loew
cheap guitars play out of tune
barefoot dancing underneath the moon
its a hell of a show
and what happens in the river we dont talk about
its just a whole lot of something going down down down
yes there is

hey hey dig a little deeper
drive a little further down an old dirt road
old crow gets a little sweeter
once it gets to kicking and anything goes
my my amen
just wait until the stars come out
theres a whole lot of something going down down down
down home
down home

chorus
hey hey dig a little deeper
drive a little further down that old dirt road
old crow gets a little sweeter
once it gets to thinking and anything goes
my my amen
just wait until the stars come out
theres a whole lot of something going down down down
it might look like nothing baby going down down down
but theres a whole lot of something going down down down
down home
