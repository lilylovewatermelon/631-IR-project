yeah

verse 1
my favorite bitch just cut me off and she wont even let me know the reason yeah
its probably one of her lil messy hatinass friends bein evil
i aint stressin bout it shell come around when she wanna eat it up
slow stroke fast stroke grindin it im a real pleaser
sixty hoes in new york havin dinner
bottega send it to me soon as they get it
i put maybach seats in the sprinter
make sure evеrybody sit comfortable
you gotta really pay attention im not mumblin
shе tryna have a good time she wanna come with us
they know we cant be fucked with they not one of us
its done been some times i slipped im not fallin
brabus baby blue the inside too im feelin like a kid again
they thought i got lucky last time fuck it im back on that shit again
her last bag was a crocodile kelly
got it chocolate to match her skin
i just gave bro a hundred pounds of wham
told him tell the city its in
majority of the time i hi and bye these niggas
i aint with all that lockin in shit
money over everything try to stop it
you get popped right then and there
message thread full of where you ats and pull up on me
bunch of whens and wheres
youngins out here wildin with no guidance
all they care about is who they kill
i was tryna keep that shit in order
it got harder cause im never there
its a better life out here
i promise brodie ima keep it in they ear
i know how it feel to spin a opp
but it feel way better to count a million
i come from the bottom of the bottom
i shot right up through the fuckin ceilin

verse 2
yeah stay down hustle hard until you come up
take some only when you need it
you wont make it far bein greedy
my grandma taught me how to be a leader
if we fly commercial we got greeters
they just know that we important people
they see how we comin think we ghetto
until they children tell em im their hero
flight attendant said i look familiar
crack a smile tell her its a small world
oh thats your bitch thats my ho too
we gon share her call her our girl
real street music i ran that field
if you can hit that then she aint my girl
get your lick back come step in my world
two bitches on the same itinerary
the same flight same hotel they dont even know each other yet yeah
one of em dont say nothin the other askin do we go together yet
young turnt nigga aint no holdin back
this a brabus bro not a regular wagon
i dont kiss and tell i aint into that
i dont think i met a nigga colder yet like
