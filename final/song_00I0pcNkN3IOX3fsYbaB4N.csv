verse 2 takeoff
i give you the world more than diamonds and pearls world
i show you more love than that double cup and syrup syrup
pickin up the phone when the vision is a blur
knowin’ that im dead wrong that i gotta call her brrt
drippin in the fur got the bentley we can swerve
and the mansion super big everything his and hers
she dont kick it with the birds and the iced out patek on her wrist
it got her lookin like she wanna go and surf ice
but from the gate i aint blowin out the cake
we been goin eight rounds straight now we out of shape
smokin’ while i contemplate i’m thinkin ’bout the better days
when me and you we met each other it would never be the same never
them material things i dont care about the fame nah
i miss you so much that i went and tatted your name tatted
let me be your drug tell me when you feel in pain where
and you can be my stripper baby no i aint ashamed
thinkin ’bout when i hit her no precision i got aim
double r we pullin up and watch the rolls all lanes
i need you in my life i promise that ill make it right
and by the end of the night i bet your mind gon change wait
it aint bout the cars it aint all bout the chains
lookin up up at the stars take a look what i became look at me
what you want a range what you want a pinky ring
i can get you what you name but love dont cost a thing cost a thing
