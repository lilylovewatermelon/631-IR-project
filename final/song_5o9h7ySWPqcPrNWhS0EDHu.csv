rolling ‘til the land dont touch the sky
taken on my way by the wind that blows
sailing to the sun for a thousand miles

i’m the right taste to the wrong bite
im a lover mostly when the time is right
i’m my own rule
im a coward im a fool
im a builder but i cannot tear apart
curse my stubborn heart

momma did you hear im coming home
id love to find a place where i can lie
the well’s run dry
the gardens overgrown
i’ll help as best i can before july

i’m a phone ring on a cold night
im the wrong choice thats never worth the fight
i’m a hard rain
im a sinner im a saint
im the wise words i only took in part
curse my stubborn heartsee wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeembed"
