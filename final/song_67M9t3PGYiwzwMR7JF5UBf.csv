and i didnt care
well these are just a few words
to let you know how i feel
hey yeah
let me be the first to let you know

oh i had an awful dream
that you were needing someone elses love to take the place of mine
so i over came the distance
that challenged my persistence
i let my ego go and drowned my pride
and you ask why

youre such a special lady
though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you know
such a special lady
though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you know

one more thing i need to say
is that i need you every day
its not the same till you come back to me
girl ive loved you from conception
so if you follow my direction
ill lead you where you always need to be
right next to me oh

though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you know
such a special lady
though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you know

let me be the first to let you know
i appreciate the things you do for me
when youre loving me at night
let me be the first to let it show
id show the way to go
cuz every waking move is oh so right

youre such a special lady
though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you know
such a special lady
though i havent told you lately
so let me be the first to let you knowembed"
