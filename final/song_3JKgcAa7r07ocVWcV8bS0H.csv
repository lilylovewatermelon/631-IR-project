decorate your block with red tape foenem slidin every day
bunch of hollows spittin out the glock
i been servin fiends all day out there posted with the gang
nigga we was taught to get it off the block
its a hundred bands in the safe now i got expensive taste
mike amiri jeans fill em up with knots
i been on my grind every day dont believe in takin breaks
i aint stoppin til we chillin at the top

verse 1
swervin on the eway dont care if i crash in this coupe
shit im thinkin bout too real might lose my mind in this coupe
cant relapse off these drugs man rip to juice
we was tweakin off them percs i popped my last one with you
bond tight with my day ones aint tryna find no recruits
we was playin give and take on that front line with my troops
ayy like who want smoke we got plenty guns
keep two lil savages on x and they gon get it done
and them hollow tips do surgery they gon clip his lungs
it was goin down on the set thats when this shit was fun
i just been ballin on these niggas like im kendrick nunn
every day my birthday bitch its lit i just turned twentyone

ever since i stepped up in this game ive been a bomb threat
i was in the trenches tryna see a life beyond that
cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
nigga where im from they turn death into a contest
livin by the gun put all my trust into this compact
my niggas went to war but they aint get no vietnam check
lil bro want his head he tryna make his brains ooze
lil bitch im from the northside where they raise goons
took losses in these streets shit got me singin gang blues
i been a real nigga fore this shit became cool
im the type to switch my watch up every time i change moods
he the type to get excited cause he made the shade room
