devil had a daughter
took him to deep water
tried to kill him with a kiss
he said hey now honey what about the money
i said i aint got time for this

chorus
take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
make me make me someone trouble don’t know

verse 2
he said baby come inside
i said sorry ive got to ride
sorry but ive got to ride
you know you could end up dead
for sleepin in the devil’s bed
sleepin in a devil’s bed

chorus
take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
make me make me someone trouble don’t know

verse 3
baby wants to drive my car
but he wants to go too far
but he wants to go too far
first comes love and it’s so fine
then comes heartache right behind
then comes heartache right behind
my baby used to be so sweet
now he won’t come down my street
now he won’t come down my street
all my plans got derailed
he locked up my heart in jail
he locked up my heart in jail

take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
make me make me someone trouble don’t know
take me take me somewhere trouble don’t go
make me make me someone trouble don’t know
