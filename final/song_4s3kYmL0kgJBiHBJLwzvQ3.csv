salt in the air salt on the drinks
sand on our backs sand in the sheets
ferris wheel lights stars falling down
like me and you and this beach town
were meant to be together
i could stay right here forever

chorus
id be alright if summer never ended
and these long nights kept on coming
be me and you burning hot every minute
id be alright if summer id be alright if summer
wanted to stop in its track right now
if every night was night one laying you down
them sunburnt kisses wouldnt have no limit
id be alright if summer never ended

verse 2
coconut rum coconut tan
beach boys song from a beach bar band
spend half the night at the end of that pier
if forever had a chance itd be right here

chorus
id be alright if summer never ended
and these long nights kept on coming
be me and you burning hot every minute
id be alright if summer id be alright if summer
wanted to stop in its track right now
if every night was night one laying you down
them sunburnt kisses wouldnt have no limit
id be alright if summer never ended
