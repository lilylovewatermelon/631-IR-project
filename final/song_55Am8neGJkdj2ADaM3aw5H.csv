laying in the silence
waiting for the sirens
signs any signs im alive still
i dont wanna lose it
but im not getting through this
hey should i pray
should i pray yeah to myself
to a god to a saviour who can
chorus
unbreak the broken
unsay these spoken words
find hope in the hopeless
pull me out the train wreck
unburn the ashes
unchain the reactions now
im not ready to die not yet
pull me out the train wreck
pull me out pull me out
pull me out pull me out
pull me out

verse 2
underneath our bad blood
weve still got a sad song
home still a home still a home here
its not too late to build it back
cause a one in a million chance
is still a chance still a chance
and i would take those odds

unbreak the broken
unsay these spoken words
find hope in the hopeless
pull me out the train wreck
unburn the ashes
unchain the reactions now
im not ready to die not yet

pull me out pull me out
pull me out pull me out
pull me out pull me out

and i need you to be my guard

unbreak the broken
unsay these reckless words find hope in the hopeless
