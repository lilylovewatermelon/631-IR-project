been holding mine but im just fine
since ive been without you
no prisoner could climb the walls
that ive built up in my mind
since ive been without you

but im holding down and out
im desperate without you

look at the shape im in
talking to the walls again
just look at the state im in
bent and broken is all ive been

no universal truth this time

no other universe but mine
could ever feel as unaligned
since ive been without you
no instances from time to time
feel like things will turn out right
since ive been without you

but im holding down and out
im desperate without you
you might also likelook at the shape im in
talking to the walls again
just look at the state im in
bent and broken is all ive been

no universal truth this time
theres no universe for you and i
theres no one to make me realize

look at the shape im in
talking to the walls again
just look at the state im in
bent and broken is all ive been

look at the shape im in
talking to the walls again
just look at the state im in
bent and broken is all ive been

no universal truth this time

look at the shape im in
talking to the walls again
look at the state im in
bent and broken is all ive been
no universal truth this timeembed"
