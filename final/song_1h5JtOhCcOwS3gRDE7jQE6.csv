verse 3 lord infamous
the devils greatest trick was convincing the world he did not exist
now i must wrote this strategy to the drunk of this
narcotic cocaine knowledges we will not acknowledge it
nickels sold up in the park dog i want my fucking part of it
gotta make a plenty pay schedule for the night and day
niggas on the ledge or on the roof we got to move this today
and dont get no prophet posse when you pushing hop yo
tell this china white style you back oh you go oh
im going to take a walk to the boulevard
till they check on his face and pace
and make sure way this movie straight keyser soze
im walking on razor blades and keeping them flambayed
cause whats on that plate is that peruvian high grade
i love crack addicts they have this magic to me sunny
with rocks in your hand it should disappear and turn to money
the green ill leafs the evil roots and the seed is greed paint enemy
like time the streets is calling me to feed

verse 4 project pat
friends and money just like oil and water
cross the line and you can prepare for the slaughter
oughta be shot what you looking for some credit bro
i got the rocks to get you high but you twenty short
a newport is all i can give ya player
so push on project pat aint no perpetrator
a demonstrator demonstrating dog how it goes
hanging with killers with them drains coming out their nose
opposing laws in this game so i can stay on top
by slanging rock oh i use my mask and my glock
its nonstop crack sales every block in town
im trying to come up in this shit just like nino brown
im staying down watching out trigger finger itching
but collard greens like the dope cook up in the kitchen
you come up missing when you owe a nigga on my block
cause down here you get killed over a dime rock
chorus fades outembed"
