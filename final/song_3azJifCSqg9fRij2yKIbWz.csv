i took my drugs and took my lovin when i left out the spot
i left the party with a barbie marking x on the dot
she calls my phone up but i told her im a loner uh
but she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona uh
we hit the highway onefivefive with my whole foot on the dash
shes in my ear shes got no fear she could care less if we crash

prechorus
but on my radar ive got some nerve to play hard
i waited for my chance but playboys we dont dance dance dance

chorus
i lost my heart uh
speedin car goin ninety in the rain
shе took my heart filled it with nothin but pain
this beat in my dancе is not for romance
i wanna stay but playboys we dont dance dance dance i

postchorus

no i wont dance again i
no i wont dance again

uh
face in the daylight wastin time on the stars in the sky
shes got my pager blankets of love fall on my eyes

the afterparty was on wilson and 73rd
you got the notion that somebody else was with me first

prechorus
but on my radar you had some nerve to play hard
you took away my chance but playboys we dont dance dance dance

chorus
i lost my heart uh
speedin car goin ninety in the rain
she took my heart filled it with nothin but pain
this beat in my dance is not for romance
i wanna stay but playboys we dont dance dance dance i
