verse 1
my nail tech knows how to keep a lil secret
i dont wish for my success i speak it
i caught a buzz and you did too but you tweakin
i look like i been gettin money i reek it
you smell me thats lv
walkin round with my chest out and my skin smooth im healthy
im in the mix and im handshakin but most of yall cant help me nah
most of yall aint wealthy nope most of yall just dress like it
i caught the vibe that yall givin off and im tryna make myself less like it
this chick got a lil porsche body i might let the bro test drive it
its hard for me to get excited i love music and stress bout it
my city haulin and im cosigning this wave comin up next out it
ridin round and this shotgun in her tesla
hangin both of my legs out of it like whats up whats up
i got stakes and they too high now i cant fuck up cant fuck up
i like girls thats down to earth so dont be stuck up stuck up
i dont take ls i give em out and i chuck em up
first listen they hearin this shit like what the fuck

prechorus
ten toes thats my mo
fam over gram thats my mo on my momma
fuck a close friends i got friends that i keep close
and they let it go while i reload

verse 2
and im not no fashionista but im fly though but im fly

i told her i dont cum from head but you can try though you can try
im not on top of this shit yet but im that guy though

i notice they treat me like im chosen im chosen
eyes open heart clean and my mind focused
this shit just keeps goin how i wrote it
how the hell could you doubt us
i mean back then it made sense but its like now what
now they down to come round just to be round us
you aint one of my dawgs why do you hound us
its very few of you i like but its a whole lot of yall i dont trust
