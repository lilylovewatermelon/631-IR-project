nothing about you is typical
nothing about yous predictable
you got me all twisted and confused its all new
up til now i thought i knew love
nothing to lose and its damaged cause
patterns will fall as quick as i do but now

prechorus
bridges are burning
baby im learning a new way of thinking of
love i can see nothing will be just like it was
is that because

chorus
baby youre so unusual
didnt anyone tell you youre supposed to
break my heart i expect you to
so why havent you
maybe youre not even human cause
only an angel could be so unusual
sweet surprise i could get used to
unusual you

postchorus

been so many things when i was someone else
boxer in the ring tryna defend myself
and the private eye to see whats going on thats long gone
when im with you i can just be myself
youre always where you say you will be
shocking cause i never knew love like this could exist

prechorus
tables are turning my heart is soaring
youll never let me down
answer my call here after all
never met anyone like you

chorus
baby youre so unusual
didnt anyone tell you youre supposed to
break my heart i expect you to
so why havent you
maybe youre not even human cause
only an angel could be so unusual
sweet surprise i could get used to
unusual you

postchorus
ahah ahah
ahah ahah
bridge
cant believe that i almost didnt try
when you called my name
now everything is changed

chorus
baby youre so unusual
didnt anyone tell you youre supposed to
break my heart i expect you to
so why havent you
maybe youre not even human cause
only an angel could be so unusual
sweet surprise i could get used to
unusual you
