did you never give a damn in the first place
maybe its time you had the tables turned
cause in the interest of all involved i got the problem solved
and the verdict is guilty

verse 1
man nearly killed me steppin where you fear to tread
stop drop and roll you were dead from the gitgo
big mouthfucker stupid cocksucker
are you scared of me now then youre dumber than i thought
always is and never was
foundation made of piss and vinegar
step to me ill smear ya think i fear ya bullshit
just another dumb punk chompin at this tit
is there any way to break through the noise
was it something that i said that got you bent
its gotta be that way if you want it
sanity literal profanity hit me

chorus
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
spit it out
all you wanna do is drag me down
all i wanna do is stamp you out
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeverse 2
maybe its the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor fodder
keepin all your little spies and leavin when you realize
step up fairy
i guess its time to bury your ass with the chrome
straight to the dome
you heard me right bitch i didnt stutter
and if you know whats good just shut up and beg brother
backstab dont you know who youre dissin
sideswipe we know the ass that youre kissin

verse 3
biggetybiggety bitchboy halfway houser
dont hear shit cause it keeps gettin louder
come up and you get a face full o tactic
lippin off hard goin home in a basket
you got no pull no power no nothin
now you start shit well aint that somethin
payoffs dont protect and you can hide if you want
but ill find you comin up behind you

chorus
