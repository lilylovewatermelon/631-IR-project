whatever your shit is man do it
whatever bring you that immense joy do that thats your luxury
the greatest thing that ever happened to me was
bein damn near twenty and leavin los angeles for the first time
i got out my bubble my eyes just wide
my passport is the most valuable—

chorus tyler the creator
massa couldnt catch me my legs long than a bitch
got too much selfrespect i wash my hands fore i piss
they try to talk me— ehm ima just go

verse 1 tyler the creator
yeah when i turned twentythree thats when pubеrty finally hit me
my facial hair started growin my clothing aint really fit mе
that caterpillar went to cocoon do you get me
see i was shiftin thats really why cherry bomb sounded so shifty
my taste started changin from what it was when they met me
but first impression is everything aint wanna let me go
always curious as a child and askin questions so
i aint give no fucks if and buts if they accept me
yo my boy skateboard p gave me that speech in italy session um
thankfully by hour three it detoured perspective um
thoughts changed so rapid turned to butterfly flower boy happened
all the bees buzzed me the bugs screamed they loved me
first time i private airlined accolades song got airtime
grew into my style body and feelings and fixed my hairline
calmed down in front of cameras business hit tens of millions
im not that little boy yall was introduced to at onenine
mom was in the shelter when yonkers dropped i dont say it i dont say it
when i got her out thats the moment i knew i made it yeah yeah
i dont come from money they deny it
since i dont mirror the stereotypical products of my environment
eight figures in taxes taken that shit is stupid
a flower gets its petal they pluck it but never use it
its still potholes in the schools where does it go
its still loopholes that i use nobody knows

massa couldnt catch me my legs long than a bitch
got too much selfrespect i wash my hands fore i piss
they try to talk me up but i keep short like caesar
eyes open if i pray cause i cant trust god either uh

seein that we only get one life to live
how far do you really wanna take it
dont let em ever tell you nothin you cant do

verse 2 tyler the creator
yeah i purchase more wheels when i feel like im thirdwheelin
my favorite part of the double r is the bird ceilin
the panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin
that ray of light show that nobody is frontseatin
im on the hunt for perfect but decent is what i been on
i know she fell in love but commitment is not my end goal
and all my friends that did got too comfy a little chubby
and that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny
we aint gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles
everyone i ever loved had to be loved in the shadows
tugofwar with x and y felt like a custody battle
felt like the boat goin down it felt like im missin a paddle
might buy that crib in seattle covered in grass lackin gravel yeah
it come with two boats and cattle im livin sweet aint you heard aint you heard nigga
this perspective from the beak of a bird
you hope i peak you take my peace
you gon see me and run like thieves in the night
im paranoid i sleep with a gun
the heat on my dungaroos because they beefin for fun
im vegan for now im conscious know my hands meet when i bow
im grateful you niggas hateful you eat at me you got a plate full
you cant relate to these things i say to these instrumentals
whether its wealth talk or shit thats painful
i paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks
just for you to tell me its not good from your lunch break
outro dj drama
holiday season
a vision you have to understand from perspective
