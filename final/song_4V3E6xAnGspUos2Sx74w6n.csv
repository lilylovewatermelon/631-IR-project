i know why judas wept motherfucker

verse 1
the fires burn on the summit
shining a light on the ones ive killed
survivors guilt undetermined
i could murder the world in all the blood ive spilled
banishment sequestered and conquered
to hell with your intelligence
just figure out your common sense
no one is bulletproof yeah

verse 2
ill eat the skins of my brothers
the alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
can i fill in the cracks of these feelings
with every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all
selfishness take credit for everything
what more could you ask for
and does it matter anymore
no one is bulletproof yeah

chorus
can you feel the cold
fortune never favors the old
tired of defending myself
go complain to somebody else somebody else
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likebridge
the monsters in your madness are the voices in your head
theyre scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed
you live like fucking heathens so youll die like pagan gods
in between the poisons and the pure contagions and the cure
nine for sure
nine for sure
nine for sure
nine for sure

verse 3
i got a bone thats dead inside of me
its a rotting sick that i dont need
feel free to vent your denigration
i cant believe im saying this
ill live with my regrets
ill die by my decisions
im not your fucking superstar
keep it close youre going way too far

outro
no one is bulletproof
bulletproof
no one is bulletproof
bulletproof
no one is bulletproof
