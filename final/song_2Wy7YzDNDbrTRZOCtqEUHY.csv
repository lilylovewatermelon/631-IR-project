i love the women
i love smokin on killer shit
and i love them loud guitars with those 808s i swear i be feelin it

verse 2 lil wyte
forgive me
ive been on the road my tanks on empty
ive rocked so many shows did too many drugs and drank all the whiskey
we rock stars
and i know that our fathers are up there listening
you name it weve done it and yeah we still run it
my brother and i are so gifted
stress lifted off of the shoulders that we like to hold up the world with
when jelly and i are off in the lab we often get caught in a whirlwind
the shit spins
shrooms kick in
and the room begins to glow
sorry that im not sorry
forgive me jesus i love rock and roll
hook jelly roll
ive been drinking under neon lights
where that country music flows
had my share of cocaine nights
forgive me jesus i love rock and roll
my momma used to say id pay that price
i told her hiphop sinned my soul
so when you hear that guitar ring
we gon let that 808 explode
whoa
we gon let that 808 explode
whoa
forgive me jesus i love rock and roll
whoa
