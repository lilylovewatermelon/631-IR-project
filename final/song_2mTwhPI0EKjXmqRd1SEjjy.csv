headlights burnin up the highway
cigarette hangin off my lip
mama i aint seen the light of day
since i met some habits i cant kick

chorus
its a dark night
i dont know if ill make it out on my own
sunrise to sunrise
everythings a blur behind the whiskey and smoke
devils on my shoulder demons gettin closer
all i know is i gotta ride
ride into that dark night
ride into that dark night

verse 2
red and blue shinin off the rearview
honey you were my halo
swear to god i hear you
sayin please just come on home

chorus
its a dark night
i dont know if ill make it out on my own
sunrise to sunrise
everythings a blur bеhind the whiskey and smoke
dеvils on my shoulder demons gettin closer
all i know is i gotta ride
ride into that dark night
ride into that dark night
see warren zeiders liveget tickets as low as 98you might also likebridge
red and blue shinin off the rearview
im an outlaw without you

chorus
ride into that dark night
i dont know if ill make it out on my own
sunrise to sunrise
everythings a blur behind the whiskey and smoke
devils on my shoulder demons gettin closer
all i know is i gotta ride
ride into that dark night
ride into that dark nightembed"
