here i lay
still and breathless
just like always
still i want some more
mirrors sideways
who cares whats behind
just like always
still your passenger

prechorus
chrome buttons
buckles and leather surfaces
these and other
lucky witnesses
now to calm me
this time wont you please
drive faster

chorus 1 maynard james keenan
roll the window down
this cool night air is curious
let the whole world look in
who cares who sees anything
im your passenger
im your passenger
you might also likeverse 2 chino moreno and maynard james keenan
drop these down
then put them on me
nice cool seats
there to cushion your knees
now to calm me
take me around again
dont pull over
this time wonâ€™t you please
drive faster

chorus 2 maynard james keenan
roll the window down
this cool night air is curious
let the whole world look in
who cares who sees what tonight
roll these misty windows
down to catch my breath and then
go and go and go
just drive me home and back again

outro chino moreno and maynard james keenan
here i lay
just like always
dont let me go go go go
go go go go
take me to the edge17embed"
