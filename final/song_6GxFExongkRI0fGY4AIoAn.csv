embrace the senile genius
watch him reinvent the wheel
i dont need your summary acts summary acts
to give into the narrative age

chorus
old to begin
i will set you back set you back set you
old to begin
i will set you back set you back set you

verse 2
you get to feeling like a fixture
set in 1966
time came that we drifted apart drifted apart
find an unidentical twin

chorus
old to begin
i will set you back set you back set you
old to begin
i will set you back set you back fella

verse 3
searching for latent cause
blame it on menopause
or perhaps stress and strain
credit cards lumbar pain
but ive seen your double dares
everything extraordinaire
i know the things you do
are gonna come backyou might also like2embed"
