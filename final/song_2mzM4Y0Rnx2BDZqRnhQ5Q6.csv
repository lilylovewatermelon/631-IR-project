verse 1
i said five in the morning
i wake up to fight for my earnings
fear in my mind is a warning
pray to the one you rely in
ive been wandering all day
i try to be fine but i cant be
the noise in my mind wouldnt leave me
i try to get by but im burning

prechorus
and behind my mind it runs
all these thoughts of troubling
fighting to give up my pain
fighting to be on my lane
my mind running to the other side
when its time to live my life
then it tries to take mе out

man will desist if he cannot pray
i need to find release

prechorus
but behind my mind it runs
