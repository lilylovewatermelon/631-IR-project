i know that i am unlike them
just another situation
dont hold me back
i dont look up to them
they always act so dirty
they keep themselves so clean
why cant they find the answers to
the questions that are right in front of me

im so high
im never low
i hold the sky
never letting go
let it go

no ones ever listening
the lines i crossed somewhere between
my head is spinning like a top
i dont know when this shit is going to stop

they always act so dirty
they keep themselves so clean
why cant they find the answers to
the questions that are right in front of me
