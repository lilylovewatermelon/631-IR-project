working all day for a mean little man
with a clipon tie and a rubon tan
hes got me running round the office like a dog around a track
but when i get back home youre always there to rub my back

chorus
hey julie look what theyre doing to me
trying to trip me up trying to wear me down
julie i swear its so hard to bear it
and id never make it through without you around
no id never make it through without you around

verse 2
hours on the phone making pointless calls
i got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
sometimes i catch myself staring into space
counting down the hours til i get to see your face

chorus
hey julie look what theyre doing to me
trying to trip me up trying to wear me down
julie i swear its so hard to bear it
and id never make it through without you around
no id never make it through without you around
you might also likebridge
how did it come to be that you and i must be
far away from each other every day
why must i spend my time filling up my mind
with facts and figures that never add up anyway
they never add up anyway

verse 3
working all day for a mean little guy
with a bad toupee and a soupstained tie
hes got me running round the office like a gerbil on a wheel
he can tell me what to do but he cant tell me what to feel

chorus
hey julie look what theyre doing to me
trying to trip me up trying to wear me down
julie i swear its so hard to bear it
and id never make it through without you around
no id never make it through without you around
no id never make it through without you around1embed"
