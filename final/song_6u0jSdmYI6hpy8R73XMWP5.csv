feels like im running in place
a past i cant erase
im breaking breaking apart
i know theyre after me
its like im fading each day
they took it all away
left nothing nothing but scars
they make it hard to breathe

prechorus
dont know where it went wrong
but my love for this is gone

chorus
ive tried to numb the pain numb the pain
but i cant get away get away
hiding behind this disguise
the games ive had to play had to play
the hell ive had to pay had to pay
everything comes with a price

yeah

verse 2
youre waiting for me to fail
that ship will never sail
keep pulling and pushing me down
but i just wont let go
i know you wish i was dead
im stuck inside your head
and im taking and breaking your crown
im better left alone
