verse 2 nas
sometimes i cant help but feel helpless
im havin daymares in daytime wide awake try to relate
this cant be happenin like im in a dream while im walkin
cause what im seein is hauntin
human beings like ghost and zombies
president mugabe holdin guns to innocent bodies in zimbabwe
they make john pope seem godly sacrilegious and blasphemous
in my lifetime i look back at paths i walked
where savages fought and pastors taught
prostitutes stomp in highheel boots
and badges scream at young black children stop or i will shoot
i look back at cooked crack plush cars that pass by jaguars mad fly
and im guilty for materialism fuck that
blacks is still up in the prison trust that
so save me your sorries im raisin a army
revolutionary warfare with damian marley
we sparkin the ions marchin to zion
you know how nas be â€” nyc state of mind im in
