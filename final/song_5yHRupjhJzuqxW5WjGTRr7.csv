i can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
and the heavens open everytime she smiles
and when i come to her thats just where i belong
yet i run into her like a rivers song

chorus
she gives me love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love crazy love

verse 2
shes got a fine sense of humor when im feeling low down
and when i come to her when the sun goes down
takes away my trouble takes away my grief
takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief

chorus
she gives me love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love crazy love

bridge
yes i need her in the daytime
oh but i need her in the night
yes i want to throw my arms around her
kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight

she gives me some sweet lovin brightens up my day
yes it makes me righteous it makes me feel whole
and it makes me mellow down into my soul

chorus  outro
she gives me love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love crazy love
she gives me love love love love love crazy love
i need love love love love crazy love love love love love crazy love
crazy love
