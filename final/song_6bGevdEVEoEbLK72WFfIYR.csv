what you dont tell no one you can tell me
little ghost tall tan like milk and honey
youre very brave
and very free

chorus
i push you high cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
what you dont tell no one you can tell me
verse 2
swing it high like jesus wild and free
dandelions in your hair baby
youre very brave
and theres much to see

chorus
i push you high cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
what you dont tell no one you can tell me

bridge
and when youre scared ill be right here
you feel afraid mommy is there
its a cruel cruel world but we dont care
cause what weve got weve got to share

what you dont tell no one you can tell me
little ghost blonde hair with lemonade tea

i push you high angelina on your sycamore tree
what you dont tell no one you can tell me21embed"
