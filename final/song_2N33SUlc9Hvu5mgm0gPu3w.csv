you know this song
sing it with me

verse 1
i was blown away
what could i say
it all seemed to make sense
youve taken away everything
but i try to see the good in life
but good things in life are hard to find
well blow it away blow it away

prechorus
can we make this something good
well ill try to do it right this time around

chorus
lets start over
try to do it right this time around
its not over
cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
this love is killing me but youre the only one
its not over

verse 2
ive taken all i could take
and i cannot wait
were wasting too much time
being strong holding on
cant let it bring us down
my life with you means everything
so i wont give up that easily
