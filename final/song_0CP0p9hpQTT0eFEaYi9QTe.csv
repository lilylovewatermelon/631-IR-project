hes a victim of his own type
in his vintage suit and tie
hes a casualty dressed to the teeth
in the latest genocide
the new seasons come and go
at the dog and pony show
gonna sit and beg and fetch the names
and hell follow your dress codes
whats in a name hey

verse 2 billie joe armstrong
shes a scented magazine
lookin sharp and livin clean
livin well and dressed to kill
but she looks like hell to me
when youre dancin through your wardrobe
do the anorexagogo
cloaked with style for pedophiles
as your credit card explodes

chorus  billie joe armstrong
well you auctioned off your life
for the most expensive price
