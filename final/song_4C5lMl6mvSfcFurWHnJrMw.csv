ive seen your face a thousand times
have all your stories memorized
ive kissed your lips a million ways
but i still love to have you around
ive held you too many times to count
i think i know you inside out
and were together most days
but i still love to have you around

prechorus
and youre the one i want and its not just a phase
and youre the one i trust our love is the real thing

chorus
dont go away
my love my love
i want you to stay
in my life
dont go away
my lover my love
im happiest when we spend time

verse 2
youre a salty water ocean wave
you knock me down you kiss my face
i know the storms will always come
but i still love to have you around
and heaven knows what will come next
so emotional youre so complex
a rollercoaster built to crash
but i still love to have you around
