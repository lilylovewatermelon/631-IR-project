well i dont think that the city moves slow enough for me
so im gonna leave now and i aint showin no warnings
and i know that mama said her love will always lead you home
but ive been followin this lonely road for way too long

chorus
so wont you pray for me tonight
ive been headin down a dark cold road
ive been dreamin of a porch swing with some lights
hopin i can find myself back home

verse 2
now im breakin horses out in tishomingo
and every night i lie there and wonder where a good mans dreams go
and most nights i wonder how far train cars can travel
or how far a man can go before ones truly unraveled

chorus
so wont you pray for me tonight
ive been headin down a dark cold road
and ive been dreamin of a porch swing with some lights
hopin i can find myself back home

verse 3
dont jump in so quick kid youre gonna wind up hurt
shes with a new man in new york the last time i heard
and i know that mama said her love will always lead me home
but ive been followin a lonely road for way too long

ive been dreamin of you by my side
