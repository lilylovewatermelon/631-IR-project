saw you for you
remember remember remember remember
you changed my life in so many ways  would you remember remember remember remember
i just think back to  would you remember remember remember remember
how i used to be and how you dealt with me would you remember remember remember remember
just want to thank you

verse 1
just in case i never see your face again
just in case the worst was meant to happen
just in case tomorrow never come there is something you should know should know
ive given you every bit of the man i am the man i am
i know at times it wasnt pretty but it was all i had
i never held back not one little bit and the world can attest to this
and baby you flipped my program upside down upside down

chorus
listen to me now
i was a hustler and player girl before i met you
id drink a little something then hit a little something before i met you
but how you made a difference look what ive been missing
you got my life together and i thank you forever
i really used to throw a lot before i met you
but i do one every night and sometimes i had two
but all of that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right
and i love you for life girl i love you for life

there was so many times i wasnt there for you
and for everyone of those times i hated myself for
the way i went about it the ups and the downs
one foot in while the other foots out
loving on you loving on another
but i aint no different from any other brother
so what i give to you right here right now
in this here place is my voice say it out
in this here space let my heart pour out
as i state my case as i break it down
to tell you where im coming from so youve seen the good youve done
so youve feel the change youve made stay with me every day

chorus
i was a hustler and player girl before i met you
id drink a little something then hit a little something before i met you
but how you made a difference look what ive been missing
you got my life together and i thank you forever
i really used to throw a lot before i met you
but i do one every night and sometimes i had two
but all of that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right
and i love you for life girl i love you for life

bridge
girl if i died tonight before i wake
know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
and sugar if this song is i had to give would you remember
remember my heart remember it was good
remember that i tried as long as i could
remember that i gave til i had nothing else
remember my voice
