oh you like the way that sounds

hes gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
and all the girls are gettin pretty theyre sprayin on the white rain

if we got the gas it gets wild
yeah but thats the way we get down
in a hicktown

and his woman smokin pall malls watchin laura ingalls
and grannys gettin lit shes headin out to bingo

and they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
