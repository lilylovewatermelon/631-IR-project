we got large and we got small
we got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
we turn red and we turn green
its the craziest thing ive ever seen

verse 1
lost my mind cause im on the plastic
who knew its so damn drastic
show me what it is you believe in
slowly she sinks all her teeth in
do you want to go fishing in new orleans
do you want to get up early in the morning
take me to the river where we do the little storming
hallelujah i feel it warming

prechorus
sitting here i count the moons
the orders we obeyed
every night fore we go to bed
i watch while the others pray

chorus
send it off through delaware just
make it fair for the legionnaires
paint a simple portrait of my kind
permission to the heartless bombs
gold plated hate and the waitress moms
serving up the stories of my mind
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
mexico you are my neighbor
home of the lets be braver
give me all your sick and your tired
races that we admire
do you want to go dancing in chicago
trinidads got it bad for tobago
take me to the lake where we do the avocado
hallelujah a desparado

prechorus
sitting here i count the moons
the orders we obeyed
every night fore we go to bed
i watch while the others pray

chorus
send it off through delaware just
make it fair for the legionnaires
paint a simple portrait of my kind
permission to the heartless bombs
gold plated hate and the waitress moms
serving up the stories of my mind
coming down from the deserts where you
caught a glimpse of the billionaire
tell me im the right one for the ride
paper signs out on the lawns
gold minds and the priceless pawns
does your canyon really open wide
outro
we got large and we got small
we got a swimming pool and a cannonball
we turn red and we turn green
its the craziest thing ive ever seen9embed"
