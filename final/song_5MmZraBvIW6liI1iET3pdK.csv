geah
renegades is back

freeway
8 miles
lets go

verse 1 jay z
eight miles and runnin got my seventh album droppin
and my eighth album comin feeding a thousand growling stomachs
but i can rewind the calendar back back when it was now or nothin
people said i would amount to nothin that i had talent for nothin
said i would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
i could just hear the folks now he got what he had comin
now that my eighth albums comin everybodys smilin
wanting somethin claiming that they done somethin for him
got their jay z pompoms and their hov uniform
claiming they been runnin and tellin everybody like martin lawrence
bout how hot my rap performance was before i was who i was
claiming that they threw it up before i threw it up—you what
where was you before i blew this up
i didnt see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin us
i didnt see you in all black when everybody was suitin up
back on the block getting it in—it wasnt no you with us

back when nobody would find he had talent nobody would sign me
nobody believed in me nobody but mommy blindly

thats why im taking all the industrys money
revenge is sweet honey we run this
young is the illest free is the future
beans and bleek is right now we can see yall eight miles nigga
