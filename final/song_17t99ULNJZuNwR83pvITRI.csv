i land on an island coast
where the only souls i see are ghosts
i run through a wooded isle
and i chase the sunlight mile after mile

and i feel like i know this place
as the tree line breaks into wideopen space
i stare at a bright red sun
though i search all day i never find anyone

verse 2
i walk on a winding road
in the deep of the night near the edge of the known
i pass by a moonlit lake
and a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake

and i feel i should know this place
as the road winds on into wideopen space
the wind plays a haunting tone
as i make my way through the night all alone

chorus
i been dreaming again of a lonesome world
where im lost and ive got no friends
just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
and a road that dont never end

verse 3
i lie under starlit sky
and the seasons change in the blink of an eye
i watch as the planets turn
and the old stars die and the young stars burn

but i dont really know this place
and its lonesome here in the wideopen space
can it be as real as it seems
maybe this time i wont wake from the dream

chorus
i been dreaming again of a lonesome world
where im lost and ive got no friends
just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
and a road that dont never end
i been dreaming again of a lonesome world
where im lost and im on my own
what am i destined to be its a mystery baby
just please dont leave me alone yeah
