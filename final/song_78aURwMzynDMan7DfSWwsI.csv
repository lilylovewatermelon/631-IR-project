verse
they say my brain meltin
and the only thing ill tell em is
im livin for the present and the future dont exist
so baby take your clothes off a chance like this
you may never get to show off show off

unless you like to tease baby
when in reality you dont know how to please baby

better than your next man
and if he swingin i get dumber than the next man
