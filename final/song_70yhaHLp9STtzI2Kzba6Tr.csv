how soon do we forget how we felt
dealing with emotions that never left
playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
maybe im the sinner and youre the saint
gotta stop pretending what we aint
why we pointing fingers anyway when were the same

prechorus ariana grande
break up make up total waste of time
can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind yeah yeah
cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
stars fall and the world goes blind
boy you know ill be savin my love for you for you

chorus ariana grande  big sean
cause youre the best mistake ive ever made
but we hold on mm hold on
theres no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
but we hold on uhuh mm hold on ayy yeah
verse 2 big sean
i guess times wasting
ticktockin lip lockin
how can we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock it
wear your heart up on your sleeve
so watch out for pickpockets swerve
i guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
hold up hold up i know love can be a beach with no shore shore
i done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four four
i know sometimes its hard to realize im the man that you need
i had a dream we branched out started a family tree huh
and i feel like that everything we do is overdue
you asked why i love your mom so much cause shes a older you
i wish that you were happy
i guess thats the one thing i should be providing
aint no number twos
we both ones of ones and we the oddest oddest couple
only humans cept you you a goddess
only lying to you when i lie you down just bein honest
when you start as friends its hard to say youre never going back
if im not the one then im the best mistake you ever had
