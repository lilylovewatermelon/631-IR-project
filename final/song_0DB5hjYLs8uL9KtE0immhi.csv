uicide

verse 1 yung mutt
its that marble martyr fucking daughters
rocking starter going farther
sauce aint tarter bitch its barbecue
bitch i be that breadcrumbcovered motherfucker
bitch im fuckin southern fried
lyin to all you lookalikes just to further you from the truth
sippin white wine then committed uicide
now im sippin red wine in the booth
blowin on a blunt puffin up me and lick go poof
goku on the beat
steady getting money like a toll booth—nah im just playin
bitch im broke loth broke too
ridin in that droptop with the whole crew no proof
white pearls wit one gold tooth uh

chorus yung mutt
let me get the keys to the rover truck
let me get the keys to the rover truck
let me get the keys to the rover truck
let me get the keys to the rover truck

verse 2 yung christ
ride til the sun up old trucks with the top up
yet these bitches still stutter
yung christ and im smokin on butter just another
white creep with no respect
everyday i hold my breath tryna meet death
no check no balance and no debt
no money no cars but im on flex
see you motherfuckers dont get that i could give a fuck about this rap shit
born with a dope flow and a accent
808s with the slap got ya back bent
so heres a big fuck you to you motherfuckers
buncha clones uicide not like the others
so if you wanna meet that devil shit i got in me
keep talking lil bitch

let me get the keys to the rover truck
let me get the keys to the rover truck
