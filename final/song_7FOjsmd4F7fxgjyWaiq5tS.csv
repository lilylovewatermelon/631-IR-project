i want to be the man that you thought i was
i want to be the man that made you fall in love
i cant undo everything ive done
but let me tell you right now
baby youre the only one

chorus
i dont want to be a restless soul
running on empty burning up the road
never knowing what im trying to find
while the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
i dont wanna take a long way home
sleeping in a roadside room alone
head in the clouds foot on the gas living my life too fast

verse 2
ive been making a living not making a life
and knowing that now well it cuts like a knife
the way its been aint how its gonna be
baby starting right now gonna give you the best of me

chorus
i dont want to be a restless soul
running on empty burning up the road
never knowing what im trying to find
while the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
i dont wanna take a long way home
sleeping in a roadside room alone
head in the clouds foot on the gas living my life too fast
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likebridge
ooh ive been a rolling stone
i think its time for me to roll on home

chorus
i dont want to be a restless soul
running on empty burning up the road
never knowing what im trying to find
while the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
i dont want to take the long way home
sleeping in a roadside room alone
head in the clouds foot on the gas living my life too fast
living my life too fastembed"
