life is so simple
a little boy a little girl
laughing and loving
tryin to figure out the world
it felt like summer when i kissed you in the rain
and i know your story but tell me again

prechorus 1
nothing you say wouldnt interest me
all of your words are like poems to me
i would be honored if you would take me as i am

chorus
i want you
to look right in my eyes
to tell me you love me
to be by my side
i want you
at the end of my life
wanna see your face
when i fall with grace
at the moment i die
is that alright
is that alright

i hope you’re still with me
when i’m not quite myself
and i pray that you’ll lift me
when you know i need help
it’s a warm celebration of all of our years
i dream of our story of our fairytale

prechorus 2
family dinners and family trees
teachin the kids to say thank you and please
knowing if we stay together that things will be right

chorus
i want you
to look right in my eyes
to tell me you love me
to be by my side
i want you
at the end of my life
wanna see your face
when i fall with grace
at the moment i die
is that alright
is that alright
outro
is that alright5embed"
