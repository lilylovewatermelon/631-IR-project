lets get out of this town baby were on fire
everyone around here seems to be going down down down
if you stick with me i can take you higher and higher
it feels like all of our friends are lost nobodys found found found

prechorus
i got so scared i thought no one could save me
you came along scooped me up like a baby

chorus
every now and then the stars align
boy and girl meet by the great design
could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
everybody told me love was blind
then i saw your face and you blew my mind
finally you and me are the lucky ones this time

verse 2
boy get into my car got a bad desire
you know that well never leave if we dont get out now now now
youre a careless con and youre a crazy liar but baby
nobody can compare to the way you get down down down

prechorus
i tried so hard to act nice like a lady
you taught me that it was good to be crazy
