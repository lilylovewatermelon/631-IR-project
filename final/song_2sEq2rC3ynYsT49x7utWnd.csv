dear theodosia
how to say to you
sometime last night
your mother breathed your name
and like a flame
that flickers out too soon
she died
shes gone
she dedicated every day to you
she changed my life
she made my life worthwhile
and when you smile
i know a part of her lives on
i know i can go on
you have come of age with our young nation
we bleed and fight for you
sometimes it seems thats all we do
and you and i will build a strong foundation
and ill be here for you
the way is clear for you
to blow us all away some day
some day some day
blow us all away some day
some day some day
blow us all away some day
some day
ooh
some day
blow us all away
some dayyou might also likeembed"
