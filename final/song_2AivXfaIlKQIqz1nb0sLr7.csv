i remember the night we first met
we were so young i can’t forget
how you kissed my face whoa
and you took me home whoa
i remember the life years ago
the air mattress on the floor
that was before whoa
a life took control

chorus
oh how we lost our minds
when we fell in love that night
i never thought that i
would ever leave your side
oh how we lost our minds
when we fell in love that night
promise me you wont cry
this is our last goodbye

verse 2
when i was lost i found you
when i was broke you bought me shoes
you were my first whoa
and dammit this hurts whoa
now youve got a girl someone new
and i cant pretend to just be cool
i cant be your friend whoa
so this is the end
