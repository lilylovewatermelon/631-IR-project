i turned to rap cause it made me feel tough when i wasnt wasnt

which is why i identify with the guy

ice cold like snake eyes twice in a row on a dice roll
but if the only reason i blowed is cause im white though
why dont every other white rapper sell what i sold ooh

fore i jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
cause im takin yall with me when i go cyclone

i heard your freestyle on shade 45 that shit was embarrassing
there is no way we ever air that shit again i guarantee that
wait that shit was so ass its somethin we wouldnt dare reair it get it

verse 4
wait wait got the eeriest feelin
somethin evil is lurkin im no conspiracy theorist
but somethin here is a foot—oh yeah its my dick
get the measurin stick what 12 inches of wood haha
wait but ive been goin for your jugular since craig g duck alert
and ive come to pay respects
cause if you sleep youre fucked—other words
you get laid to rest and i hope your butt is hurt
put me on a track i go cray on it like a color book
you got some views but youre still below me
mine are higher so when you compare our views you get overlooked
and i dont say the hook unless i wrote the hook
and now im just freestylin in the vocal booth
and you know ive always spoke the truth
youre lyin through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
and it aint somethin i need a phone to do
when i say i cant wait til i get ahold of you
and i dont know what im sposed to do
line up the rappers take my pic like a photo shoot222embed"
