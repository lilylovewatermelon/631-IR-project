ive done this before
not like this

verse 1
i dont drink to get drunk
i feel all the right funk
if theres somethin i want
ill take all the right wrongs now
im gonna stay in my zone
im tired of pickin that bone
and i cant be bothered
to fight it no more no

prechorus
numb on a roof set it on fire
just to give me proof im livin on a wire
numb on a roof set it on fire
just to give me proof im livin on a wire

chorus
so say what you wanna say what you wanna
so say what you wanna say what you gotta say now
so say what you wanna say what you want
shame is you wont say that to my face

verse 2
time for me to move up
so many hours have gone
heart beats the pump of my blood
no strings for you to pull on
youve got your tongue in your cheek
so pardon if i dont speak
cant tune my chords
into your song no

prechorus
numb on a roof set it on fire
just to give me proof im livin on a wire

chorus
so say what you wanna say what you wanna
so say what you wanna say what you gotta say now so say what you wanna say
so say what you wanna say what you want
shame is you wont say that to my face
