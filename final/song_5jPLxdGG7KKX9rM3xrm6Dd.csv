neck chest waist to floor
easy to take you could take me in fours
make me a deal a day a piece
take it all just stay a week

verse 2 romy
ill take you in pieces we can take it all apart
ive suffered shipwrecks right from the start
ive been underwater breathing out and in
i think im losing where you end and i begin

hook both
basic space open air
dont look away when theres nothing there

verse 3 romy
im setting us in stone
piece by piece before im alone
air tight before we break
keep it in keep us safe

verse 4 oliver
its a pool of boiling wax im getting in
let it set got to seal this in
cant adjust cant relearn
got to keep what i have preserve

basic space open air
dont look away when theres nothing there

bridge oliver
hot wax has left me with a shine
wouldnt know if id been left behind
second skin second skin
