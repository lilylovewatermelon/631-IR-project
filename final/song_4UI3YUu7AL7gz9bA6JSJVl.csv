say the pressure’s plain to see yea
written all over me babe
i need you day and night
help me sometimes when the world is fallin’ over me
seems there’s nothing i can do to bring release
say my love
take me now
you’re my drug

hook
ooh pressure too thicke
when you move pressure moves with
only you make me lose it
you got me so electrified
ooh pressure movin
when you goove
cuts right through my skin
only you take it perfect
you got me so electrified

verse 2
say i don’t wanna work no more i wanna play
people in my face don’t hear a word they say
every thought all my wants your my drug
let me put you in my mouth i love the way you taste
i just wanna savour you till morning breaks
hey my love take me high everything i do is for us
