its dark but just a game
thats what he would say to me
the faces arent the same but their stories all end tragically
sweet or whatever baby
and thats the price of fame
a tale as old as time youd be sweet or whatever baby
a pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
just walk around like you and me this way
but life is sweet or whatever baby
you gotta take them for what they got
and while the whole world is crazy
were getting high in the parking lot

chorus
wе keep changing all the time
the bеst ones lost their minds
so im not gonna change
ill stay the same
no rose left on the vines
dont even want whats mine
much less the fame
its dark but just a game
its dark but just a game

verse 2
its dark but just a game
so play it like a symphony
you know our loves the same theyll both go down in infamy
i was a pretty little thing and god i loved to sing
but nothing came from either one but pain but fuck it
life is sweet or whatever baby
dont ever think its not
while the whole world is crazy
were making out in the parking lot

we keep changing all the time
the best ones lost their minds
so im not gonna change
ill stay the same
no rose left on the vines
dont even want whats mine
much less the fame
its dark but just a game
we keep changing all the time
the best ones lost their minds
so im not gonna change
ill stay the same
no rose left on the vines
dont even want whats mine
much less the fame
its dark but just a game
its dark but just a game
its dark but just—42embed"
