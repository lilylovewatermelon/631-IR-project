mmm mmm

verse
remember i was a small child we would play
that was way before the drama i endured and the pain
mama had already told me therell be days when it rains
but lately its been crazy hurricanes
and this life we live is strange ive been lost since i was young
member pops had went to prison thats when we was low on funds
mama said i have this chip on my shoulder thats forever
seen them close the casket on deja we grew up together
then ace told me play it safe three days later he was murdered
got me on my knees im askin god whats my purpose
i pray that before i leave i leave my heart in these verses
til then ill lay in this bed and replay thoughts in my head

chorus
mama told me when it rains it be pourin
mama told me it would rain but its stormin
i got this chip on my shoulder forever
i got this chip on my shoulder forever
mama told me when it rains it be pourin
mama told me it would rain but its stormin
i got this chip on my shoulder forever
i got this chip on my shoulder forever
