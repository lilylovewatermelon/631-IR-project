i couldnt utter my love when it counted
ah but im singing like a bird bout it now
and i couldnt whisper when you needed it shouted
ah but im singing like a bird bout it now

chorus
words hung above but never would form
like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
remember me love when im reborn
as the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

verse 2
id no idea on what ground i was founded
all of that goodness is going with you now
then when i met you my virtues uncounted
all of my goodness is going with you now

chorus
dragging along following your form
hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
remember me love when im reborn
as the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

verse 3
i fled to the city with so much discounted
ah but im flying like a bird to you now
back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
ah but im flying like a bird to you now

i was housed by your warmth thus transformed
by your grounded and giving and darkening scorn
remember me love when im reborn
as the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn30embed"
