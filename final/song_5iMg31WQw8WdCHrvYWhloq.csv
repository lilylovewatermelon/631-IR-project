and you should hear her beat

mark
you earned this on the street

angel
it was my lucky day today
on avenue a
when a lady in a limousine
drove my way
she said darling be a dear
havenâ€™t slept in a year
i need your help
to make my neighbors yappy dog disappear
this akita evita just wont shut up
i believe if you play nonstop that pup
will breathe its very last
high strung breath
im certain that cur
will bark itself to death
today 4 u
tomorrow for me
today 4 u
tomorrow for me

we agreed on a fee
a 1000 guarantee
tax free
and a bonus
if i trim her tree
now who could foretell
that it would go so well
but sure as i am here
that dog is now in doggy hell
after an hour
evita in all her glory
on the window ledge
of that 23rd story
like thelma and louise did
when they got the blues
swan dove into
the courtyard of the gracie mews
today 4 u
tomorrow for me
today 4 u
tomorrow for me
back on the street
where i met my sweet
where he was moaning and groaning
on the cold concrete
the nurse took him home
for some mercurochrome
and i dressed his wounds
and got him back on his feet
sing it
today 4 u
tomorrow 4 me
today 4 u
tomorrow 4 me
i said today 4 u
tomorrow 4 me
today 4 u
tomorrow 4 meembed"
