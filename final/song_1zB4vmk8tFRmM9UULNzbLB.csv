just a young gun with a quick fuse
i was uptight wanna let loose
i was dreaming of bigger things
and wanna leave my own life behind
not a yes sir not a follower
fit the box fit the mold
have a seat in the foyer take a number
i was lightning before the thunder

verse 2
kids were laughing in my classes
while i was scheming for the masses
who do you think you are
dreaming bout being a big star
they say youre basic they say youre easy
youre always riding in the backseat
now im smiling from the stage
while you were clapping in the nosebleeds
