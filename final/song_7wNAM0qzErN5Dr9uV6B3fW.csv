if i could travel through time i think i
would tell myself from the past youll be fine

verse
but what you dont know is the fun part of passion
and its the place where i think all the fun begins
what you dont see is what you believe
but to be is the place where the angels dance
what you dont hear is the voice of fear
when you get passed that is when your life appears
what you dont touch is what you wont clutch
but youll latch on tight when the coast is clear

chorus
