eerie whispers trapped beneath my pillow
wont let me sleep your memories
and i know youre in this room im sure i heard you sigh
floating in between where our worlds collide

chorus
scares the hell out of me
and the end is all i can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all i can see
yeahyeah yeahyeah yeahyeah woah

verse 2
and i know the moments near
and theres nothing we can do
look through a faithless eye
are you afraid to die yeah

chorus
cause it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all i can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all i can see
yeahyeah yeahyeah yeahyeah woah
