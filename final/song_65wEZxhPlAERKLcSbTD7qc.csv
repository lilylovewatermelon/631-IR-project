verse 1
you let the wrong people love you
oohoh oohoh oohoh oohoh
but you dont see that do you
no no
when you cry and need my comfort
oohoh oohoh oohoh oohoh
i drop everything to come over
oohoh oohoh oohoh oohoh

chorus
dont bite your lip or grit your teeth
just count to ten and try to breathe
you stupid bitch cant you see
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
the perfect one for you is me
you stupid bitch cant you see
the perfect one for you is me

then make the worst decisions
oohoh oohoh oohoh oohoh

dont bite your lip or grit your teeth
