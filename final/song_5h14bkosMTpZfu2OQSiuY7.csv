i sit alone in my bedroom
starin at the walls
ive been up all damn night long
my pulse is speedin my love is yearnin

chorus
i hold my breath and close my eyes and
dream about her
cause shes 2000 lightyears away
she holds my malachite so tight so
never let go
cause shes 2000 lightyears away
years away

verse 2
i sit outside and watch the sunrise
lookout as far as i can
i cant see her but in the distance
i hear some laughter we laugh together

chorus
i hold my breath and close my eyes and
dream about her
cause shes 2000 lightyears away
she holds my malachite so tight so
never let go
cause shes 2000 lightyears away
years away
