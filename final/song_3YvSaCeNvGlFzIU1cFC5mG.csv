you fault my pride
dont ever need to pologize
as your lips unfold
shaken purple from the cold

chorus
you better learn to crawl
you better learn to crawl
fore i walk away
fore i walk away

verse 2
you broke my mouth
the bloody bits are spitting out
is your grave unscathed
the worm is counting down the days

chorus
he wants to see you crawl
he wants to see you crawl
before i walk away
fore i walk away

postchorus
the reds and the whites and abused
the crucified usa
as their hypocrisy unfolds
oh hell is truly on its way
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3
as the rat and the fly
theyre searching for an alibi
as we await the wrath
they never went to sunday mass

chorus
they want to see us crawl
they want to see us crawl
fore they walk away
before they walk away

postchorus
the reds and the whites and abused
the crucified usa
as their hypocrisy unfolds
oh hell is truly on its way2embed"
