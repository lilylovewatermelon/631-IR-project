calling out your name
your face is everywhere
im reaching out to you
to find that youre not there
i wake up every night to see the state im in
its like an endless fight i never seem to win

prechorus
i cant go on as long as i believe
cant let go when i keep wondering

chorus
where are you now what have you found
where is your heart when im not around
where are you now you gotta let me know
oh baby so i can let you go

verse 2
i can hear your voice
the ring of yesterday
it seems so close to me
but yet so far away
i should let it out
to save whats left of me
and close the doors of doubt
revive my dignity but
