i want you to understand
this love that i feel is so right and so real
i realize how lucky i am
and should you ever wonder if my love is true
theres something that i want to make clear to you

theres no way i can make it without you
theres no way that id even try
if i had to survive without you in my life
i know i wouldnt last a day
oh babe theres no way

it means so much to me whenever i see
that wanting me look in your eyes
i dont know how i could do without
holding you close every night
ive waited so long just to have you to hold
now that ive got you
ill never let go

theres no way i can make it without you
theres no way that id even try
if i had to survive without you in my life
i know i wouldnt last a day
oh babe theres no way

theres no way i can make it without you
theres no way that id even try
if i had to survive without you in my life
i know i wouldnt last a day
oh babe theres no way
