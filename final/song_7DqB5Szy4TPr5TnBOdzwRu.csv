seen your exiled love parade
for you another hit is so easy
one more mask for the charade

chorus
yea you dont hear the sounds i hear
yea you dont feel the fear you fear
the distance that is there
well its wearing pretty thin now
and breaking you down is gonna be so easy

ive felt your high and mighty
parasols and darkest shades
your sideways glance says maybe
longing eyes give you away

chorus

well walk this way now baby
bring the pleasure bring the pain
your secrets safe with me for saving
no one has to know you came
