when you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
and whispered in my ear guess who
i rattled off names like i really didnt know
but all along i knew it was you

and the longer we talked the more we laughed
and wondered why we didnt last
it had been a long time but later last night
baby we caught up real fast

chorus
and maybe its a little too early
to know if this is going to work
all i know is youre sure looking
good in my shirt
thats right
you look good in my shirt

verse 2
well now im not saying that we solved overnight
every way that we went wrong
oh but what im seeing id sure love seeing
every morning from now on

chorus
and maybe its a little too early
to know if this is going to work
all i know is youre sure looking
good in my shirt

chorus
and maybe its a little too early
to know if this is going to work
all i know is youre sure looking
good in my shirt
and maybe its a little too early
to know if this is going to work
all i know is youre sure looking
good in my shirt
you look good in my shirt
