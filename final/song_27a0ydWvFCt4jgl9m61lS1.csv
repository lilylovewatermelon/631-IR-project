haha

verse 1
im not on your radar then your radars broke
dont blame me for the way yalls jokes
fall flat get your mouth slapped—aint no hoax
i get an inkling they picked me for the weak link
im gonna have to pose
a question for the ones that dont accept that i been exceptional
cause the moment i get involved is the moment a song takes off
so how could you think i wouldnt last long in a game that
i was made to play what do yall take me for
rest assured
when i do come back to tour itll be christmas mor
​n​ing in a way cause ima wake up with a present so big theyll jump for joy
yeah let it be known
im better when im outta control
i cannot be the butt of a joke
im cutting in the front of you po
sers talkin like you really a pro
when you aint even part of the convo
nothin but an amateur ill slow down when i want it colossal
only way to put it if i chose
i could be bigger maybe consider it a bit if it was helpin you all
to comprehend you condescend youre gone
incompetent the consequences are
hard to miss its common sense im on
one so wrap your head around it or
i might have to get up off the porch
show you how its done i got the form
power trippin on me get destroyed
pull the plug im rollin up your cord
see nf liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus

verse 2
yeah took a minute now im at the better end of all of it
the day i wanna quitll be a bitter one to swallow cause
i meant it when i said i wasnt really into audibles
i guess you gotta call em when your odds are at the bottom and
theyre stackin up against you its a pity but they gotta give a nod to me
im runnin with the best i been the kind to make a profit
off of everything you told me wasnt possible
so why would you continue with the narrative
and not admit im somewhat incredible look of a general
hit em with the end of shovel they wanna forget it
i put em on the ground and i get up and open the pit of my stomach
to remind em again im a whole different animal
whatever the case ima get it im in it no doubt i would give it
everything if i gotta but not if the commas
are pushin me to run with the common the jokin aside
if you took away the dummies and bias youll notice that i am insane insane
improved a lot but i still feel
its hard to keep my lid from poppin off but i prevail
how you gonna skip over the details
and tell me to be focused hold that thought
dont tell me you mean well if you dont mean well
i call the shots but dont need my hand held
when it comes to makin records
who you know that does that better
the way i connect letters
youd think that the alphabet was made by me
when it comes to storytellin im great at it
tune in or get tuned out my face got redder
cause im embarrassed for the ones unaware of my work
what did i stutter
known to be cordial
but those that think that never seen me in a war zone
my delivery gets better every time i spit i dont keep my sword low
tell me why would i do that doesnt make sense when youre in a game this cutthroat
if you wanna maintain control
then you gotta keep up if you cant handle the workload
somebody else will
how could you call me unskilled
thats like lookin at mount everest and then calling it a small hill
not at all thrilled im in awe still
tryin not to laugh but it just spills
out sometimes i been writin chill
just chew on this til the records built okay
chorus
fool me once—shame on you
fool me twice—shame on you on you
fool me three times hold up rewind
thats not even possible
me i keep it honorable okay
whos your favorite let me know lemme know
tally up count the votes
wasnt me thats a joke
yeah ayy thats a joke joke
thats a thats a joke joke
funny yeah thats a joke joke
thats a thats a joke joke
funny woo thats a joke joke
thats a thats a joke joke
funny ayy thats a joke
