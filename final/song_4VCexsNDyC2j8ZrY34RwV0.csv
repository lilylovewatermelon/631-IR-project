there are few who deny at what i do i am the best
for my talents are renowned far and wide
when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
i excel without ever even trying

verse 2
with the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
i have seen grown men give out a shriek
with the wave of my hand and a wellplaced moan
i have swept the very bravest off their feet

prechorus
yet year after year its the same routine
and i grow so weary of the sound of screams
and i jack the pumpkin king
have grown so tired of the same old thing

chorus 1
oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
an emptiness began to grow
theres something out there far from my home
a longing that ive never known

verse 3
im a master of fright and a demon of light
and ill scare you right out of your pants
to a guy in kentucky im mister unlucky
and im known throughout england and france

and since i am dead i can take off my head
to recite shakespearean quotations
no animal nor man can scream like i can
with the fury of my recitations

prechorus
but who here would ever understand
that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin
would tire of his crown if they only understood
he would give it all up if he only could

chorus 2
oh theres an empty place in my bones
that calls out for something unknown
the fame and praise come year after year
does nothing for these empty tears2embed"
