live your life like youre a demigod
you force your weight on everything and everyone
the bars you live behind are made of straw
how do you see the world when you are dead and gone

prechorus
i dare not say what i want to say
no sudden movement
no sudden moves
i dare not say whats inside of me

chorus
right between your eyes
nowhere to hide

verse 2
youre a wolf hiding amongst the herd
you build a bridge so you can watch it burn
kick and scream
your voice is never heard
write down your complaints
and ill act like im concerned
