2YRmhchXAv3Qwo6aUQtbNv,I Never Thought I'd Live This Long,Montgomery Gentry,6yITsogKnqqWkEKqODSrDG,"1 contributori never thought iâ€™d live this long lyricsive treated this ol body like a stolen car
just some old disposable machine
pedal to the metal and a trail of broken hearts
yea id fill it up with almost anything
my motto was live fast and go out strong
but i never thought that id live this long

once i had a woman and she treated me real good
the kinda love i never will replace
one day i thought i aint seen the world the way i should
so one night i got up and stepped away
i knew thered be some lonelys commin on
but i never thought that id live this long

there have been many times i really should have died
but somehow i survived on my mistakes
they say it makes me stronger but why does it take longer
gettin up these days

yea im old enough to have a few regrets
im still young enough to have my dreams
maybe thats the reason that my life aint over yet
all the places and faces i aint seen
i probably wont have time to see them all
but then again i never thought id live this longyou might also likeembed"
