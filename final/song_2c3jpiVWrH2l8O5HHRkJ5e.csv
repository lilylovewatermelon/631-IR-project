sometimes
some lies can take a minute
to fully realize his tears your eyes
thirty seconds to apologize
you give it one more chance
just like the time before
but he already know youd give a hundred more
until that night in bed
you wake up in a sweat
youre racin to the door
cant take it anymore

chorus alicia keys
i was burned but i called it a lesson learned
mistake overturned
so i call it a lesson learned
my soul has returned
so i call it a lesson learned
another lesson learned
