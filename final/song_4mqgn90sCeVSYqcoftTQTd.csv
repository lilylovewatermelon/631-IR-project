loving him is like
driving a new maserati down a dead end street
faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
loving him is like
trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the freefall
like the colors in autumn
so bright just before they lose it all
chorus
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
verse 2
touching him was like
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
regretting him was like
wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
but loving him was red
oh red
burning red
bridge
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself its time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning it was red
chorus
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
cause loving him was red
yeah yeah red
were burning red

breakdown
and thats why hes spinning round in my head
burning red burning red
outro
his love was like
driving a new maserati down a dead end streetembed"
