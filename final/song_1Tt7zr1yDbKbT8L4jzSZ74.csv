what was that samantha

verse 1
this will all make sense when i am older
someday i will see that this makes sense
one day when im old and wise
ill think back and realize
that these were all completely normal events
ah

verse 2
ill have all the answers when im older
like why were in this dark enchanted wood
i know in a couple years
these will seem like childish fears
and so i know this isnt bad its good
excuse me

verse 3
growing up means adapting
puzzling out your world and your place
when im more mature ill feel totally secure
being watched by something with a creepy creepy face
ah ah

see that will all make sense when i am older
so theres no need to be terrified or tense
ill just dream about a time
when im in my agéd prime
cause when youre older
absolutely everything makes sense
