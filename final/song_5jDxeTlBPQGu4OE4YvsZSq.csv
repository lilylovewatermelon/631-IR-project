below the words
a universe waiting to explode

and i felt the words crawl out of my skull
and now you know
exactly what you should

dont bother pretending i seem fine
i like that im a mess
i cant stand it much longer in my head
i think its time for bullets

became soso suicidal
and now i know the ugly from the good

dont bother pretending i seem fine
i like that im a mess
i cant stand it much longer in my head
i think its time for bullets

dont bother pretending i seem fine
im trying to confess
i cant stand it much longer in my head
but its not time for bulletsyou might also likeembed"
