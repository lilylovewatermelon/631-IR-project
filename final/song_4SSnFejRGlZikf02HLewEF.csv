verse 2 billie eilish  mehki raine
listen
keep you in the dark what had you expected
me to make you my art and make you a star
and get you connected
ill meet you in the park ill be calm and collected
but we knew right from the start that youd fall apart
cause im too expensive
its probably somethin that shouldnt be said out loud
honestly i thought that i would be dead by now wow
calling security keepin my head held down
bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

bridge billie eilish  mehki raine
the debt i owe gotta sell my soul
cause i cant say no no i cant say no
then my limbs all froze and my eyes wont close
and i cant say no i cant say no
careful
