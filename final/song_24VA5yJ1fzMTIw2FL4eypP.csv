i try to hide myself
give this to someone else
my hands are stained with scum
wish i could wash it away
you keep taking taking away
and keep breaking breaking break

chorus
i cant believe in yesterday
i feel you coming in
i cant just stand by and watch you
save yourself as you fall from grace
when you come around
i wont be your sympathy

verse 2
the worst is over now
you said it anyhow
my life in monochrome
wish i could regain control
you keep taking taking away
i keep faking faking fake

chorus
i cant believe in yesterday
i feel you coming in
i cant just stand by and watch you
save yourself as you fall from grace
when you come around
i wont be your sympathy
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likebridge
find me feel me fill me then cut me up again
find me feel me fill me then cut me up
hate
me

chorus
i cant believe in yesterday
i feel you coming in
i cant just stand by and watch you
save yourself as you fall from grace
when you come around
i wont be your sympathy
save yourself as you fall from grace
when you come around
i wont be your sympathy
