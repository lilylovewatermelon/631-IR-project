shame shame
i was a loner unloved
i really didnt need any help at all
shame shame
i really thought i was fine
i was living it up just despite my self
shame shame
i used to wander the streets at midnight
avoiding any signs of life
shame shame
i used to suffer alone
i really did think it would make me strong
shame shame
i used to write it all down
hoping someone would read it years from now
shame shame
i used to act like i was in a movie
so mysterious and misunderstood
shame shame
you started hanging around
i really didnt think i could live it down
shame shame
i tried to play it cool
but every single part of me felt so good
shame shame
you took me someplace i would never been before
i was a foreigner in your hands
i just couldnt let it go until now
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likebridge
a letter unopened just like a knock on the door
do you think youre so special that no one knows what your for
well you can mutter on sweet nothings like youre on the other side of town
do you fear the attachment to things that you want
do you want to cut off things for fear of their love
well you can roll on to the graveyard and let them take you whole
or you can live it up and leave nothing but your bones

outro
shame shame
i dont know what to do
i was losing myself turning into you
shame shame
i was really undone
the life that i lived seemed so useless now
shame shame
you know you made me do it
and no i dont regret a thingembed"
