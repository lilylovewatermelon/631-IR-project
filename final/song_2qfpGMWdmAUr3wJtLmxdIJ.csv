they say good things
dont last forever
i guess they were right

verse 1
guess i really gotta let it go
telling myself that this just not for me
here we go around this merry go
dont you understand that
one of us just gots to leave
so should i close the door
you take the key
telling me ive been violent
wishing i could rewind
how this broken heart
i cant believe
didnt know how to make this work

chorus
you know i thought i had it all yall
it seems that im wasting time
even though ive tried
guess ive done it all wrong
i wish that i
wish that i could help us
but i gotta take off off off
for once in my life
i gotta take off off off
its time for me to break away

baby we should let this curtain close
this is really nothing else thats left to show
its like everytime you look were starting over
baby we done it too many times before
cant you see i had enough
all my love maybe you didnt deserve it
acting like youre miss perfect
im manning up standing up
cause i know you aint been doing me right

chorus
you know i thought i had it all yall
it seems that im wasting time
even though ive tried
guess ive done it all wrong
i wish that i
wish that i could help us
but i gotta take off off off
for once in my life
i gotta take off off off
its time for me to break away

verse 3
what am i doing
who do i tell
i was blinded from the truth
thats why i stayed so long
i should blame myself
girl we used to be so close
but i gotta get far away
baby maybe we can roll
if i get far away
chorus
you know i thought i had it all yall
it seems that im wasting time
even though ive tried
guess ive done it all wrong
i wish that i
wish that i could help us
but i gotta take off off off
for once in my life
i gotta take off off off
its time for me to break away5embed"
