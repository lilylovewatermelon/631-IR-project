high tide’s up
and the water’s coming in on the shore
usually wait until vacation
but i sure can’t take this city anymore

verse 1
work’s been hell
and that rush hour traffic’s never been a breeze
ain’t no hustle where i’m goin’
just a warm trade wind a blowin’ through the trees

chorus
i don’t need no sympathy
that won’t bring satisfaction
just need to charge my battery
had a bad reaction
going to do my best to decompress
chillaxin’

verse 2
i could fire up my old motorcycle
and head up to the country where it’s green
maybe head up to montana
but there’s something about the ocean that’s serene
you might also likefifteen hundred miles
still got seven hundred left to do
but it don’t seem like forever
when you know that you’re outrunning the blues

chorus
i don’t need no sympathy
that won’t bring satisfaction
just need to charge my battery
had a bad reaction
going to do my best to decompress
chillaxin’

verse 3
there’s a worm in the bottle and wild shot on the table
with some salt and lime and some mezcal maybe i’ll be able
to find my paradise put this broken world on ice
chillaxin’

outro
high tide’s up
and the water’s coming in on the shore
i usually wait until vacation
but i just can’t take this city anymoreembed"
