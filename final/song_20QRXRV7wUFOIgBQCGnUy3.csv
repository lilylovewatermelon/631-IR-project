the day a door is closed
the echoes fill your soul
they wont say which way to go
just trust your heart
to find what youre here for
open another door
but im not sure anymore
its just so hard

verse 1 troy
voices in my head tell me they know best
got me on the edge
theyre pushin pushin theyre pushin
i know theyve got a plan but the balls in my hands
this time its man to man
im drivin fightin inside a world thats upside down
and spinnin faster
what do i do now without you

chorus troy
i dont know where to go
whats the right team
i want my own thing
so bad im gonna scream
i cant choose so confused
whats it all mean
i want my own dream
so bad im gonna scream

fight to find myself me and no one else
which way i cant tell
im searchin searchin
cant find the way that i should turn
i should turn right or left
its its like nothin works without you

chorus troy
i dont know where to go
whats the right team
i want my own thing
so bad im gonna scream
i cant choose so confused
whats it all mean
i want my own dream
so bad im gonna scream

bridge troy
yeah the clocks runnin down
hear the crowd gettin loud
im consumed by the sound

chorus troy
i dont know where to go
whats the right team
i want my own thing
so bad im gonna scream
i cant choose so confused
whats it all mean
i want my own dream
so bad im gonna scream
i dont know where to go
whats the right team
i want my own thing
i want my own thing
i cant choose so confused
whats it all mean
i want my own dream
so bad im gonna scream
