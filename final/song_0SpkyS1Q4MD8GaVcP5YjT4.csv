sunsets
we wander through a foreign town
strangely theres nobody else around
so you open your dress and show me your tits
on the swing set at the old playground

chorus
and when you go away i still see you
with sunlight on your face in my rearview

verse 2
sunsets
i wanna hear your voice
a love that nobody could destroy
took photographs like brautigans book covers
that we both adored

chorus
and when you go away i still see you
with sunlight on your face in my rear view
this always happens to me this way
recurring visions of such sweet days
and when you go away i still see you
with sunlight on your face in my rear view
when you go away i still see you
with sunlight on your face in my rear viewyou might also like18embed"
