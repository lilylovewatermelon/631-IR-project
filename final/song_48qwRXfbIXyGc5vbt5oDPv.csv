when i step in the room
i bring the heat like the month of june
crank the volume make the bass go boom
wild out like we some wild baboons
we go bananas to the tune
i wanna throw bows give me elbow room move nigga
when im out my cocoon im ready to consume
lets hit the saloon cos

and thats the way we do it
we get a little loopy off the ignorant fluid
and act a little stupid just in case you didnt knew it
thats just how we do it dont ask why we do it

its time to get wasted and scope the whole place
for girls with cute faces
cause i see some fly mamas so pack your pajamas
but dont bring the drama
but you could bring your melody
ill plug in my mic and sing my harmonies lalala
for how many times we gonna hit it
how many times we gonna split it
how many times you gonna get it get it
or else you are gonna wanna come over
youre gonna have to wanna man
cause im the alligator champ
driving the train driving the tram
or you could bring your friend and i switch my lane
and get buddy buddy with your friend mary jane
she really blows my brain brain
she really blows my brain brain
