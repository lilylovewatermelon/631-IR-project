hold me up to the light
tell me if the sun comes shining through
and i got this heaviness in my chest
since your love came breaking through

prechorus
and i wanna know where its coming from
where this is coming from where this is coming from
and i wanna know what youre running from
what are you running from

chorus
who am i who am i
without you without you
who am i who am i
without you without you

verse 2
lay my dreams down at your feet
baby watch out where you step
and theres no need for us
knowing all the answers yet

prechorus
and i wanna know what youre running from
what are you running from what are you running from
and i wanna know where its coming from
where this is coming from
