neithers anybody else but i think my kids deserve
to be with daddy out in public without all the interruptions
when the lies and gossips published im the topic of discussion
and i stay in trouble just to show these suckers i aint lost it

verse 2 ti usher both
ayy you seen it all before guys know how the story goes
its like 2pac never died sit back enjoy the show
you see the shit that scares you senseless i done lived through it
knew the risks and the consequences and i still do it
and then im so fresh them niggas mildew it
not just a actor by profession pimp i live movies
thats why they whisper when they see me point and stare at me
cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
fashion week in paris we party like a rockstar
get blown by a top model til she catch lockjaw
got the dough you get a year stashed in my sock drawer
showed you the troubles and the struggles of a outlaw
top dog would not fall i am not yall niggas
couple pages out the calendar and im out yall
kid listen pay attention you dont wanna be me
its safer to watch it on tv

verse 3 usher
now see i dont think it would even matter to me
working a nine to five would it be better i mean be honest
would you care to gossip about me not likely
i guess thats just the way that it goes the way that it goes
cause i know see i can be somewhere out keeping it cool
and get told almost anything instead of the truth
yall know more than i do its breaking news to me too
easy killer yall know that aint how i move ooh
he said and she said what i did what with them who
no not me i said not me she gave me no head ooh
wont get me again ayy i pleaded the fifth ayy
i know better than to ever talk during the film
man them flashing lights can blind your eyesight
to when you cant see whats wrong from right
well shorty til you walk a mile in my shoes
and understand this is who i am

verse 4 ti
thats right
usher i completely concur yeah
life can be such a blur blur obviously we prefer okay
our privacy but instead we endure
yes sir dont expect nothin less of me
cause this gon probably be this way until the death of me
but for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
plus all my kids and my moms ima calm down
and yo we doin just fine as the time just flyin
live one headline at a time
ya dig
