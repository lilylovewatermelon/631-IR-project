for a hardworking john deere man
youre real tired well no wonder
cause you earned that farmers tan
while i been working in the garden
you been melting all the ice in my sweet tea
well look at what ya started
all because you got a little thirsty

good god almighty
boy you got me begging like an ol hound dog
buttered up and rolling like a skillet smoking up a kitchen down in arkansas
yeah we on to something wont ya keep it coming
baby i can handle the heat
yeah boy you make me wanna rear back and slap my mama
hot damn four hundred degrees
now we cooking with grease
now we cooking with grease

lets slow it down let me help ya
button down that blue collar
boy your touch is burning up
you make the kettle on the stove wanna holler
got me saying hallelujah
like a good ol girl is supposed to do
but that hat turned back and them kisses like that
make it real hard to keep it cool

boy you got me begging like an ol hound dog
buttered up and rolling like a skillet smoking up a kitchen down in arkansas
yeah we on to something wont ya keep it coming
baby i can handle the heat
yeah boy you make me wanna rear back and slap my mama
hot damn four hundred degrees
now we cooking with grease
now we cooking with grease

its getting hot in here
you know whos bringing home the bacon

good god almighty
boy you got me begging like an ol hound dog
buttered up and rolling like a skillet smoking up a kitchen down in arkansas
yeah we on to something wont ya keep it coming
baby i can handle the heat
yeah boy you make me wanna rear back and slap my mama
hot damn four hundred degrees
now we cooking with grease
yeah we cooking with grease
