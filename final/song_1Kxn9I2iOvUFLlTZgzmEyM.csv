well
take your vitamins

verse 1
well i was on my way to meet up with this woman that i met
the other day while i was on my break to smoke cigarettes
i hit her up she had some weed and told me come through we should smoke
bring a pair of lungs dont bring no money baby i aint broke
so im walkin up the stairs to the porch
knocked against the door heard some feet against the floor
the door had opened up and it was her
she told me hurry come right in
leave your shoes up by the front cause we just put new carpets in
she asked me bout my day then sat me down
told me we should have some fun there aint nobody around
she got this crazy pill the other day when she was on her way to work
told me it would make my problems go away and fix the hurt
that i had well that dont sound bad
down the hatch kinda nervous just relax she said rubbin on my back
well i aint really into drugs but fuck it
ima take a trip and ima love it love it

chorus
i dont know what happened to me
but as soon as it hit me i was fuckin free
it took me to somewhere off the map
and i dont think ill ever find my way back back

i left right after that and started drivin to my house where i reside
i was high and possibly a little fuckin out my mind
cant remember where i live it aint like i just bought this house
i said fuck it took a breath opened my door and just jumped out
and its funny cause i didnt even hit against the road
i just went right through the ground and started floatin on my own
i see colors different colors like they glowin and theyre light
they was glowin like they glowin in the dark but it was bright
thats alright this shit crazy what the fuck she had me take
if this kill me ima come back haunt her every single day
as i wait sittin somewhere that i never seen
feel like i forever dream just imagine set a scene
power and imagination got all my surroundings changin
found a place to drown my brain in somethin like its outer space
but nothin like the pictures from the astronauts
they showed me back at school
when they told me drugs were bad oh man oh man they had me fooled

chorus
i dont know what happened to me
but as soon as it hit me i was fuckin free
it took me to somewhere off the map
and i dont think ill ever find my way back back
