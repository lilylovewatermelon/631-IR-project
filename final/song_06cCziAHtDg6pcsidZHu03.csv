she had a face straight out a magazine
god only knows but youll never leave her
her balaclava is starting to chafe
and when she gets his gun hes begging babe stay stay
stay stay stay

chorus
ill give you one more time
well give you one more fight
said one more line
will i know you

verse 2
now if you never shoot youll never know
and if you never eat youll never grow
you got a pretty kind of dirty face
and when shes leaving your home shes begging you to stay stay
stay stay stay

chorus
ill give you one more time
well give you one more fight
said one more line
therell be a riot cause i know you
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likebridge
well now that youve got your gun
its much harder now the police have come
and ill shoot him if its what you ask
but if you just take off your mask
youd find out everythings gone wrong

outro
now everybodys dead
and theyre driving past my old school
and hes got his gun and hes got his suit on
and she says babe you look so cool
you look so cool
you look so cool
you look so cool one more time
you look so cool one more fight
you look so cool one more line
cause i know you233embed"
