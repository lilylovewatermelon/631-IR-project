we can fight our desires
ooh but when we start making fires
we get ever so hot
ooh whether we like it or not
they say we can love who we trust
ooh but what is love without lust
two hearts with accurate devotions
ooh what are feelings without emotions

chorus
im going in for the kill
im doing it for a thrill
oh im hoping youll understand
and not let go of my hand
im going in for the kill
im doing it for a thrill
oh im hoping youll understand
and not let go of my hand

verse 2
i hang my hopes out on the line
ooh well theyd be ready for you in time
if you leave them out too long
ooh theyll be withered by the sun
full stops and exclamation marks ahah
ooh my words stumble before i start
how far can you send emotions oohooh
ooh can this bridge cross the ocean

im going in for the kill
im doing it for a thrill
oh im hoping youll understand
and not let go of my hand
im going in for the kill
im doing it for a thrill
oh im hoping youll understand
and not let go of my hand

bridge
lets go to war to make peace
lets be cold to create heat
i hope in darkness we can see
and youre not blinded by the light from me

interlude
ooh ooh
ooh ooh

chorus
im going in for the kill
im doing it for a thrill
oh im hoping youll understand
and not let go of my hand1embed"
