were pleased to inform you that your applications been accepted
starting from the time you get this letter
your life will be one neverending
“hope youre feeling better”
you get your choice of anesthetic
we need to chop your clock off ticktock ticktock ticktock ticktock
it might not be what you expected
there is no money back once youve been ripped off ripped off ripped off

todays a very special day
the boysll murder for it but what will the neighbors say
it leaves you feeling pretty hollow
it might be nice to look at
dont forget youre stuck with it tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
hey

youre big enough to stop pretending
youll start to really show within a week or so
so dont go saying its just come to your attention
youll get more than youre asking for without the right protection

todays a very special day
and how youd love to have a little thing with which to play
but love wont get you very far
today be still your beating heart
youll have to keep on feeding it tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

girls will be girls will be guys will be boys that dont cry over toys that they use to beat girls they despise by the morning
they always said that sex would change you

no second thoughts the knife is nearing
youll never hear the little pitterpatter pitterpatter
of this little feat of engineering
of course i love you and of course its whats inside that matters
but i think the whole charade is ending
it seems to me to be the only way to keep from getting
caught up in a long life of regretting
the doctors say that once you get a taste for it youll keep on cutting

but while we happen to be here
why dont you whisper all those sweet forevers in my ear
stiff upper lip in all this sorrow
hurry up and stick it in
you never know when it will end
tomorrow or tomorrow or tomorrow2embed"
