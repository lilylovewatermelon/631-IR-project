forgiven to me
youre forgiven to me
youre just another dead man living to me
forgiven to me
youre forgiven to me
how can you let a dead man live

verse 1
forgiven to me
youre forgiven to me
youre just another dead man living to me
forgiven to me
youre all giving to me
how can you let a dead man live
forgiven to me
youre forgiven to me
youre just another nightmare walking to me
you were driven to me
now youre given to me
how can i let a nightmare live

chorus
to be purified in fire
anesthetic for the pain
as the final words erupt from your mouth
who will remember your name

youre forgiven to me
youre just another dead man living to me
forgiven to me
youre all giving to me
how can you let a dead man live
forgiven to me
youre forgiven to me
youre just another nightmare walking to me
you were driven to me
now youre given to me
no longer will the nightmare live

chorus
to be purified in fire
anesthetic for the pain
as the final words erupt from your mouth
who will remember your name

bridge
walking the line that the world has drawn
fighting for balance alone in the dark
will you carry the burden the world has grown
will you destroy everything in your sight
you alone can give this one more try
you alone will bury me tonight
chorus
to be purified in fire
anesthetic for the pain
as the final words erupt from your mouth
who will remember you now
who will remember your name

outro
remember your name
remember your name
remember your name forgiven to me youre forgiven to me
remember your name forgiven to me youre forgiven to me1embed"
