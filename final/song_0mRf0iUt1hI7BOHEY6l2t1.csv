love strung out i am found in the price you paid
i know that your life is the blood running through my veins
my eyes fixed wide on the light of the cross again
i feel the weight drop in the wake of the empty grave

chorus
i want you need you
i love you jesus
my heart beats forever
just to know you
let go and throw
my future into your hands
again

verse2
heart beats loud to the sound of a different drum
calling me out from the crowd to pursue the one

chorus
i want you need you
i love you jesus
my heart beats forever
just to know you
let go and throw
my future into your hands
i want you need you
i love you jesus
my heart beats forever
just to know you
let go and throw
my future into your hands
again

break me down till i soar on grace
lead me on through the fire and rain
the rhythm of my heart beats wild
for your endless praise
every waking hour i will seek your face

chorus
i want you need you
i love you jesus
my heart beats forever
just to know you
let go and throw
my future into your hands
i want you need you
i love you jesus
my heart beats forever
just to know you
let go and throw
my future into your hands
again
