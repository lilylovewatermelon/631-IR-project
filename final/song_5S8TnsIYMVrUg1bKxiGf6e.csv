dear rodeo
id be lying if i tried to tell you i don’t think about you
after all the miles and the wild nights that we been through
lord knows we had a few

verse 2
dear rodeo
id like to say that i took the reins and rode away
no regrets no leftunsaids just turn the page
oh but you know better babe

chorus
tween them almosthad’ems and broken bones
the dream of a buckle ill never put on
im jaded whoa i hate it
but somehow the highs outweigh the lows
and id do it all again even though we both know
id still have to let you go

verse 3
so dear rodeo
i tried like hell to tell myself it was all your fault
i held on tight with all my might i just couldnt hang on
and thats hard to hang your hat on
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
tween them almosthad’ems and the broken bones
the dream of a buckle i’ll never put on
im jaded whoa i hate it
but somehow the highs outweigh the lows
and i’d do it all again even though we both know
id still have to let you go

instrumental bridge

verse 4
dear rodeo
id like to think you miss me too but i know you dont
oh but that don’t change the past and that dont change the truth
im still in love with you
