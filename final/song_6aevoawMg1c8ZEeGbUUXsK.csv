verse 1
living inside my head
pulling my strings
letting me think im in control
giving you all of my heart
was a good start
but it turns out you want my soul

chorus
i dont know nothing about that
in fact i dont know nothing at all
im tired of proving you right
by doing everything so wrong
so tell me what you really want
cause i dont wanna be
i dont wanna be alone

break
oohoohooh
ooh
oohoohooh uh

i was just going to roll over oh no

chorus
i dont know nothing about that
in fact i dont know nothing at all
