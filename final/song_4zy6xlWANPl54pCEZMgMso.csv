lookin back well i see you
with eyes that shouldnt be so blue
clearer than the calm before the rain
so alive it wasnt fair
to live without a single care
i loved you and you felt for me the same

prechorus 1
so beautiful that words cannot define
sweeter than the lords communion wine

chorus
evangeline cant you see im sorry
cant you hear my tears ringing through the night
i wait in hell between these bedsheets
and pray to god for morning light

verse 2
and winter came and blood ran cold
as everpresent sleet and snow
outside of a december window pane
and this house would never be our home
oh handinhand we walked alone
i thought the sun would never shine again
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeprechorus 2
and the oldest violin could never whine
a melody as sorrowful as mine

chorus
evangeline cant you see im sorry
cant you hear my tears ringing through the night
i wait in hell between these bedsheets
and pray to god for morning light

verse 3
and now ive seen your face a thousand times
nightmares running through my mind
it hurts just to pretend
but the devil fell and so have i
from perfect grace your face to sky
i never thought a love like this would end

prechorus 3
now your words they cut right through me like a knife
well i gave my love and now i take my life

chorus
evangeline cant you see im sorry
cant you hear my tears ringing through the night
i wait in hell between these bedsheets
and pray to god for morning light
i wait in hell between these bedsheets
and pray to god for morning lightembed"
