he was killed by a cellular phone explosion
they scattered his ashes across the ocean
the water was used to make baby lotion
the wheels of promotion were set into motion
chorus
but the sun still shines in the summer time
ill be yours if youll be mine
i tried to change but i changed my mind
think ill have another glass of mexican wine

verse 2
she lived alone in a small apartment
across the street from the health department
she left her pills in the glove compartment
that was the afternoon her heart went
chorus
but the sun still shines in the summer time
ill be yours if youll be mine
i tried to change but i changed my mind
think ill have another glass of mexican wine

verse 3
i used to fly for united airlines
then i got fired for reading high times
my license expired in almost no time
now im retired and i think thats fine
