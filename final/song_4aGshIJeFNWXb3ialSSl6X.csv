you fell down of course
and then you got up of course
and started over
forgot my name of course
then you started to remember
pretty tough to think about
the beginning of december

bridge
pretty tough to think about
pretty tough to think about yeah yeah
pretty tough to think about

verse 2
youre looking down again
and then you look me over
were laying down again
on a blanket in the clover
the same boy youve always known
well i guess i havent grown
the same boy youve always known
same boy youve always known

chorus
think of what the past did
it couldve lasted
so put it in your basket
i hope you know a strong man
who can lend you a hand
lowering my casket
you might also likeverse 3
i thought this is just today
and soon youd been returning
the coldest blue ocean water
cannot stop my heart and mind
from burning
everyone whos in the know says
thats exactly how it goes
and if theres anything good about me
im the only one who knows4embed"
