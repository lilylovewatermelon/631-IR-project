verse 1
stay on your porch nigga if u aint ready to make a shake
cuz this the home of the bodies check the murder rate

so you better kill him if you dont want him at your court date
if you comin you better come with em choppers and dont fake
cuz if you bullshit you the one that get erased
this niggas murkin out pussy niggas in broad day
and whereever you get caught slippin at thats where you lay
and like they say nigga no face no case
as long as these goons are lurkin these streets aint safe
the more rounds you shoot nigga the less aim it takes
its murkin season so you pussies better stay out the way

its impossible too many choppers floating around

old lady said she got woke up by that chopper sound

from what i heard em crackers fired 120 rounds
4 mothafuckin dead bodies laying on the ground
niggas bettin on it now who goin get off first
running ya fuck box better what how u choose u words
and niggas sending threats pussy u got a lot of nerves

everywhere you turn you see dead niggas on tshirts
every time i pass by the graveyard i see a hearse

this the wrong place to play games dawg the streets real
trying to impress a mothafuckerll get you nigga killed
