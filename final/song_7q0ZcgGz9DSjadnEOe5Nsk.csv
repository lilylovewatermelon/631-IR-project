theres a whole lot of shit goin on let me tell you how i feel listen to these dog ass hoes

hook
im so fed up with my niggas switchin sides
im so fed up with these bitches and the lies
im so fed up you see the anger in my eyes
im so fed up with being sick and tired
im so fed up somebody might die
im so fed up with these niggas in disguise
i keep my head up cause im too strong to cry
im so fed up that i wish that i could fly

verse
i just asked my homie could he help me bounce back
shit so fucked up he aint even hit me back
everything good right now but i was on my back
im good though i just had to see if ya had my back
fam just caught a charge and he took the time and rolled
tbird went down he bitched out and told
alfie caught an l and that pressure made him fold
how come street niggas aint livin by the code
im so iced out fucked around and caught a cold
i done ran my bands up i just came from up the road
im so fed up of these petty ass hoes
im so fed up im blowin kush out my nose
all these bitches want a lil piece of my thang
all these niggas want a lil piece of my fame
im so fed up i put codeine in my drank
all this stress i feel stranded in the rain
got me in the booth im rappin my pain
im so fed up it make me wanna sang
im so fed up im going insane
im so fed up i went and copped the chain
then i copped the bezels i love the blang blang
and about whatever i love to bang bang
