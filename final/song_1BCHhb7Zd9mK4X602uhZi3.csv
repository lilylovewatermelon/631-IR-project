verse 1
ooh tell me if you got me
i aint been maybach riding its in la i dont drive it
we dont go to the lauberge while we on highland
you wanna go in make sure you call before the night end
it came in like a powerball powerball oh
i admit it caught me slippin
i admit i wasnt prepared for how your love came hit me
now you got me but around feel i should still tote my glizzy
salt lake city covered up in snow with my apparel on
old ways and just might settle with a stand off
lets see who draw the fastest i aint going down

aint shown love since dump got killed
ride that rolls and lift the front i got killers on my rear
i got loss sittin on my brain feel like ive been here for years
tryna do better for my girl feel like my heart made of steel

told myself one million dollars but i did that last year
young nigga still riding round with them choppers bout some shit from last year
