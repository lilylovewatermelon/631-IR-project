sing it out
boy youve got to see what tomorrow brings
sing it out
girl youve got to be what tomorrow needs
for every time that they want to count you out
and use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

chorus gerard way
sing it for the boys sing it for the girls
every time that you lose it sing it for the world
sing it from the heart sing it til youre nuts
sing it out for the ones thatll hate your guts
sing it for the deaf sing it for the blind
sing about everyone that you left behind
sing it for the world sing it for the world

verse 2 gerard way
sing it out
boy theyre gonna sell what tomorrow means
sing it out
girl before they kill what tomorrow brings
youve got to make a choice if the music drowns you out
and raise your voice every single time
they try and shut your mouth

bridge gerard way
cleanedup corporation progress
dying in the process
children that can talk about it living on the webways
people moving sideways sell it til your last days
buy yourself the motivation generation nothing
nothing but a dead scene product of a white dream
i am not the singer that you wanted but a dancer
i refuse to answer talk about the past sir
wrote it for the ones who want to get away
keep running

chorus gerard way
sing it for the boys sing it for the girls
every time that you lose it sing it for the world
sing it from the heart sing it til youre nuts
sing it out for the ones thatll hate your guts
sing it for the deaf sing it for the blind
sing about everyone that you left behind
sing it for the world sing it for the world
