i stumbled on a bunch of junk of mine
in a shoebox the other night
in between cleaning up piles of messes
that ive made of my life
ticket stubs love poems and old letters
i dumped them all out on the bed
found a homemade birthday card from my mom
and this is what it said
yeah this is what it said

chorus
dont forget the little moments
theyre the ones that mean the most
when the way home seems so far away
take em out and hold them close
and take a picture with your father
cause one day hell be gone
and dont forget to fill an old shoebox
full of things to look back on
full of things to look back on

verse 2
i opened up my grandpas pocket knife
and i was back to his back porch
it was summertime i was turning nine
he said you want that knife its yours
i remember running off in the yard
carved my name in every tree
i havent held it since he passed away
man it meant the world to me
because he meant the world to me

dont forget the little moments
theyre the ones that mean the most
when the way home seems so far away
take em out and hold them close
and take a picture with your father
cause one day hell be gone
and dont forget to fill an old shoebox
full of things to look back on

bridge
look back on
a little window to the past
look back on
god knows life goes by so fast
if ever you should ever doubt the blessings that youve had

chorus
dont forget the little moments
theyre the ones that mean the most
when the way home seems so far away
take em out and hold them close
and take a picture with your father
cause one day hell be gone
and dont forget to fill an old shoebox
full of things to look back on
i stumbled on a bunch of junk of mineembed"
