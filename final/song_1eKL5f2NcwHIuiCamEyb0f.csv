women cant live with em
and somehow you cant ever live without
women cant understand em
but tryin to is what makes the world go round

chorus
ive made a sad one laugh and ive made a good one cry
ive made one scream my name to the good lord by and by
ive made em go insane and ive made em go away
just cant ever seem to make one stay

verse 2
women theyre all crazy
some hide it well and some just let it show
women take it from me
ive been around enough of them to know

chorus
cause ive made a sad one laugh and ive made a bad one cry
ive made one scream my name to the good lord by and by
ive made em go insane and ive made em go away
i just cant ever seem to make one stay

verse 3
women aint no winnin
when all they want to do is fuss and fight
women keep our heads spinnin
but with any luck ill take one home tonightyou might also likeembed"
