got a foot in the door
god knows what for
and hell cut me down to size
stupidity tries
everything here is free
everything but you and me
this painting never dries
stupidity tries

chorus 1
savannah shoulder raised a cheer
coloring the sky with ash
because they found some privateer
to sail across the sea of trash

verse 2
the enemy is within
dont confuse me with him
the truth is otherwise
stupidity tries

chorus 2
and so i go from floor to floor
looking for a port of call
another drunk conquistador
conquering the governors ball
you might also likeverse 3
i couldnt think of a thing
that i hope tomorrow brings
oh what a surprise
