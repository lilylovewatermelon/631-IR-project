youre my forever my slice of heaven
on this side of the mississippi river baby
youre my infinity no end to you and me
come hellfire or rain baby nothin can change it
no nothin can change it

chorus
ooh when the good lord calls me home and this life is through
i may be six feet deep but ill still be lovin you
baby what we got wont ever die
cant take diamonds cant take gold
but ill take your love with me when i go
im gonna take it to the grave with me

verse 2
youre my destiny youll always be with me
today tomorrow all the way to eternity baby baby
no last breath taken on this earth
no concrete tombstone no amount of dirt can change it
no nothin can change it

chorus
ooh when the good lord calls me home and this life is through
i may be six feet deep but ill still be lovin you
baby what we got wont ever die
cant take diamonds cant take gold
but ill take your love with me when i go
im gonna take it to the grave with me to the grave with me
to the grave to the grave to the grave with me
