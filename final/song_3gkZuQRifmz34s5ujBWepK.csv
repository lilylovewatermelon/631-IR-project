to the left of me a striped fence
to me this all does not make sense
whats two when all you need is one
whos to blame for the empty gun
if all tears fall from the sky
why do they fall from your eyes
leave a sparkle thats you see in dreams
whats to come when the grass dont turn green

chorus
its runnin fast cannot slow
sittin wonderin where ill go
driftin head and lazy eyes
hold me mama as i learn to fly on my own

verse 2
and if it tastes too good it could be a lie
you aint the apple of your mamas eye
who needs a moon for the light
flip a switch and were back to life
now whats in the air whos on the street
and whos the pretty girl glaring at me
whys the sun shinin off her hair
why now do i seem to care
see parker mccollum liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
its runnin fast cannot slow
sittin wonderin where ill go
driftin head and lazy eyes
hold me mama as i learn to fly on my own

verse 3
now shake a left or take a right
and hope that theres no one in sight
do shadows really dance and gleam
they all look pretty damn dark to me
and if times the only thing id say were in
while we fightin til the bitter end
cashin in everything we know
dâ€‹oes dying rich determine where we go

chorus
its runnin fast cannot slow
sittin wonderin where ill go
driftin head and lazy eyes
hold me mama as i learn to fly
its runnin fast cannot slow
sittin wonderin where ill go
driftin head and lazy eyes
hold me mama as i learn to fly on my own
outro
on my own
darling on my own
darling on my own yeahembed"
