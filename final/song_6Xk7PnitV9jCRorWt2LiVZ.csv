now this shits about to kick off this party looks wack
lets take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
im bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
thats why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the rag
just like i did with addiction im bout to kick it
like a magician critics i turn to crickets
got em still on the fence whether to picket
but quick to get it impaled when i tell em stick it
so sick im looking pale—wait thats my pigment
bout to go ham ya bish shout out to kendrick
lets bring it back to that vintage slim bitch
the art of mcing mixed with da vinci and mc ren
and i dont mean stimpys friend bitch
been public enemy since you thought pe was gym bitch

kick your shoes off let your hair down
and go berserk all night long
grow your beard out just weird out
and go berserk all night long

chorus 1 eminem  billy squier
were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
so turn the volume loud
cause its mayhem til the am
so baby make just like kfed
and let yourself go let yourself go
say fuck it before we kick the bucket
lifes too short to not go for broke
so everybody everybody go berserk
grab your vial yeah

and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam

shithead with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
kangols and carheartless cargos
