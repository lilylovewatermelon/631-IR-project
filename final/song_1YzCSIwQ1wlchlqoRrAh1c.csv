what would i give to live where you are
what would i pay to stay here beside you
what would i do to see you smiling at me
where would we walk where would we run
if we could stay all day in the sun
just you and me and i could be
part of your world

i dont know when i dont know how
but i know somethings starting right now
watch and youll see someday ill be
part of your worldyou might also like1embed"
