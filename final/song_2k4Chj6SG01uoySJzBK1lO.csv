youre a vodka drink
with two lemons and no lime
you wont listen to the words
but youll sing em when they rhyme
youre a sunday backwards ball cap
drive too fast when it rains
and you talk like youre from charleston
but youre just made that way

chorus
put together like an angel
tempted by your every tangle
bet you dont even know how
im hanging on to every word you say
every touch damn near kills me
never thought that anybody
could make me want to slow down and stay
but baby youre made that way

verse 2
you dont overthink
so youre a complicated mess
not afraid to make mistakes
hold your cards close to the vest
youre christmas lights in august
wont wake up til 10 am
and my heart pounds just like a kick drum
anytime that you walk in
see jordan davis liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus
put together like an angel
tempted by your every tangle
bet you dont even know how
im hanging on to every word you say
every touch damn near kills me
never thought that anybody
could make me want to slow down and stay
but baby youre made that way

bridge
everything falls into place
as soon as i see your face
dont stop loving me
baby dont stop loving me

chorus
put together like an angel
tempted by your every tangle
bet you dont even know how
im hanging on to every word you say
every touch damn near kills me
never thought that anybody
could make me want to slow down and stay
baby youre made that way
outro
yeah you were made that way
baby you were made that wayembed"
