have you got colour in your cheeks
do you ever get that fear that you cant shift the tide
that sticks around like summat in your teeth
are there some aces up your sleeve
have you no idea that youre in deep
ive dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep
cause theres this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow an i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep spillin drinks on my settee

prechorus
do i wanna know if this feelin flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin that youd stay
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day

chorus
crawlin back to you
ever thought of callin when
youve had a few
cause i always do
maybe im too
busy bein yours
to fall for somebody new
now ive thought it through
crawlin back to you

so have you got the guts
been wonderin if your hearts still open
and if so i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an pucker up im sorry to interrupt
its just im constantly on the cusp of tryin to kiss you
but i dont know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to

prechorus
do i wanna know if this feelin flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin that youd stay
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day

chorus
crawlin back to you crawlin back to you
ever thought of callin when
youve had a few had a few
cause i always do cause i always do
maybe im too maybe im too busy
busy bein yours bein yours
to fall for somebody new
now ive thought it through
crawlin back to you
outro
do i wanna know if this feelin flows both ways
sad to see you go was sorta hopin that youd stay
baby we both know that the nights were mainly made
for sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day

sad to see you go ever thought of callin darlin
