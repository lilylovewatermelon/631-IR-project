and thinkin was suicide
close your eyes youd be petrified
so i bought myself a ticket
back where i belonged in those days
back where i belonged in those days

see a guy like that walking down the street
youd nearly leave your skin
hes proud to say hes got his wits about him
take a look at the shape youre in
all the faith youve got left is in your medicine

so open up wide and swallow that pride
and long for a comfort the world wont provide
adrift on the oceans of doubt in your soul
consumed by the tide youre swallowed up whole

if only someobody wouldve told me so
cause i didnt put up much of a fight in those days
i didnt put up too much of a fight in those daysyou might also likeembed"
