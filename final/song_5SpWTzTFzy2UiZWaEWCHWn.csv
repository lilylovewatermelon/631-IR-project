verse 1 eminem
its like im in the dirt diggin up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
all it takes is one song on the radio youre
right back on it reminding me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryna soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but im coming for closure
dont suppose an explanation im owed
for the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over
you could just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
well ive never recovered
but tonight bet you that what youre
bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered
cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
hearts saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset

i flee the scene the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth the truth
but its easier to justify whats bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy the bad guy
follow me follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun
i just hate to be the bad–

verse 2 eminem
and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
thought some time would pass and id forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
may be gone but hes not forgotten
and dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
youre wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that ive gone through
feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how im doing
letters you dont respond to em
fuck it im coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on ya
poof then im gone voosh
chorus sarah jaffe
i flee the scene the scene like it was my last ride
you see right through right through
oh you had me pegged the first time
you can see the truth the truth
but its easier to justify whats bad is good
and i hate to be the bad guy the bad guy
i just hate to be the bad guy the bad guy
follow me follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun
i just hate to be the bad guy
follow me i ruhuhun follow me i ruhuhun

verse 3 eminem
ive been drivin around your side of this town
like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like ive been waitin on this moment all of my life
and its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and im duckin on the side of your house
see its sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment
to come and see ya but i aint here for your empathy
i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
its revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reach my full potential—i peeked haha
continue to peep still bent low then keep
tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
all the way round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
you dont plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat got your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
ironys spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk
and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it
were in a car right now—wait here comes my favorite lyric
im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey heres a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
hows this for a publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this youll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell
bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
hope we dont get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear
guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
as cops appear in my drivers side mirror
oh god police agh
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge
ha ha big bro its for you slim this is for him
and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again

verse 4 eminem
i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope its hopeless im that denial that youre hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approaching its end
but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
backs to the wall im stackin up all them odds
toilets clogged yeah cause im talkin a lot of shit but im backin it all up
but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished
i am your lack of a conscience
im the ringing in your ears
im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eating your vocal cords after your concerts
im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
grab for some water
but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya
every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rappers persona
is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic
of you not knowin what you had til its gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam
no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
im the hindsight to say i told you so
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you dont stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
when its time to walk away im every guilt trip
the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
if theres anything you have left to say
less it makes an impact then dont bother
so fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop a wallop

outro eminem
so one last time im back
fore it fades into black and its all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started it all
tragic portrait of an artist tortured
trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
here goes a wild stab in the dark
uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off582embed"
