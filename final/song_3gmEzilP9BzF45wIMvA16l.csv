oh i miss the misery

verse 1
ive been a mess since you stayed
ive been a wreck since you changed
dont let me get in your way
i miss the lies and the pain
the fights that keep us awakeakeake
im tellin you

refrain
i miss the bad things the way you hate me
i miss the screamin the way that you blame me
miss the phone calls when its your fault
i miss the late nights dont miss you at all
i like the kick in the face
and the things you do to me
i love the way that it hurts
i dont miss you i miss the misery

verse 2
ive tried but i just cant take it
id rather fight than just fake it cause i like it rough
you know that ive had enough
i dare you to call my bluff
cant take too much of a good thiing
im tellin you

i miss the bad things the way you hate me

bridge
just know that ill make you hurt
i miss the lies and the pain what you did to me
when you tell me youll make it worse
id rather fight all night than watch the tv
i hate that feelin inside
you tell me how hard youll try
but when were at our worst
i miss the misery

refrain
i miss the bad things the way you hate me
i miss the screamin the way that you blame me
i miss the rough sex leaves me a mess
i miss the feeling of pains in my chest
miss the phone calls when its your fault
i miss the late nights dont miss you at all
i like the kick in the face
and the things you do to me
i love the way that it hurts
i dont miss you i miss the misery
outro
i dont miss you i miss the misery
i dont miss you i miss the misery17embed"
