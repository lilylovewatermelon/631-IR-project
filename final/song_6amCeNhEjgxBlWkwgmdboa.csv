yeah bad and evil is back
dont stop

verse 1 royce da 59
we bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon
just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin
01s the year where i fell from blunderin
shady lifted his wing then i fell from under it
now i’m freefallin’ my career is gone into recalling
regardless of who’s fault i was speedballin
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
then marshall doubled back and got me from on top of a hearse
i’m alive nigga justin t ain’t got nothin on me
cause i done cried mary j blige rivers
i realized that god’s with us soon as i decided
to put that bottle down and pick up my todd bridges
the writings on the wall
since niggas seen me at the baseball game
with shady and jayz suddenly everybody calls
like i’m just checking on you dog
while i throw up this message on the stall

chorus royce da 59
when them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stoppin
do what you did to get it and dont stop dont stop
i made a promise to my mama ima out live her
how can i be a quitter when haters dont stop dont stop
i’m living proof nigga
its pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away
its the worldwide american way
i’m living proof nigga

your body language is sayin’ your confidence is gone
well pick ya ass up lil homie come on
you just gon sit there and take it or make em suck it
tell em where to shove it straight up
you gon make love to the world or you gon fuck it
the last time that life kicked me in the ass
i pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass
man what a catastrophe it’d be for me to be a bitchass pussy
and not open a can of whoopass let you pissants whoop me
will be the day i say i ate poop shit the day that
i dont straight shoot ill drop outta my antiwomen hate group
say i’m a sissy faggot record it play it back
and put it on straight loop you haters look like you ate a grape fruit
to see me climbing back on that wagon got my swagger back
i was dragging hopped back on it grab the reigns on that bastard
and came back on em without remorse
man of course i’m a onetrick pony
cause i’ll be screaming on these whores til i’m hoarse

chorus royce da 59
when them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stoppin
do what you did to get it and dont stop dont stop
i made a promise to my mama ima out live her
how can i be a quitter when haters dont stop dont stop
i’m living proof nigga
its pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away
its the worldwide american way
i’m living proof nigga
verse 3 royce da 59
nah i aint fading yet i’d rather stay and rap
i mightve made a debt but i find excitement in wondering what i’ma write next so i dont stay in debt
me broke you might as well cut the embryo
out of my momma and play catch
with the baby with aks with baby bayonets
i’ma get rich or i’ma die trying
thats why its either kill or be killed
so call me suicide homicide ryan

verse 4 eminem
theres a bomb inside my head i’m a live wire
i am on the edge teetering on it like a totter i might
get on a nut like a tire iron i have no desire stopping
so why would i drop and roll thats how much on fire i am
rappers are fun and i’m the time cause i’m just flying by ‘em
man i’m laughing at ‘em the entire time why am i up
cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch i’m fired up
so one time for me just let your fuckin lighters light the sky up

chorus royce da 59
when them bottles stop poppin’ and them dollars start stoppin
do what you did to get it and dont stop dont stop
i made a promise to my mama ima out live her
how can i be a quitter when haters dont stop dont stop
i’m living proof nigga
its pretty safe to say
god giveth and god taketh away
its the worldwide american way
