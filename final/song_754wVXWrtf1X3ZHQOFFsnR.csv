put your hand down boy welcome to my zoo
put your head inside my big black wild while
i can still help you
see the snake baboon funky chic and smooth
honey can you spy the divine apeswine
cause he can see you

chorus
i’m a man i’m a twisted fool
my hands are twisted too
five fingers to black hooves
i’m a man don’t spin me a lie
got toes and i can smile
i’m crooked but upright

prechorus
and all i ever want is just a little love
i said in purrs under the palms
and all i ever want is breaking me apart
i said to the thing that i once was

chorus
i’m a man i’m a twisted fool
my hands are twisted too
five fingers to black hooves
i’m a man don’t spin me a lie
got toes and i can smile
i’m crooked but upright

to the left now boy underneath the moon
by the thick tan sand and the tall thin grass
one more thing for you
see the distant flume in the sleepy dunes
makes my nerves clench close and my bones go cold
when i see that room

prechorus
and all i ever want is just a little love
i said in purrs under the palms
and all i ever want is breaking me apart

chorus
i’m a man i’m a twisted fool
my hands are twisted too
five fingers to black hooves
i’m a man don’t spin me a lie
got toes and i can smile
i’m crooked but upright34embed"
