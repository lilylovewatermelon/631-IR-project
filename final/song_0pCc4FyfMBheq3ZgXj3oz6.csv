my grandmother owned a nightclub on the arkansasoklahoma line
momma put me on a greyhound and i went to stay with her in the summertime
id box up those empty long necks and stack em in the back and make a hand
then at night shed let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band

verse 2
yes i have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
i knew it wouldnt last forever semipro always means semipaid
i started climbin drillin rig im oil field trash and proud as i can be yeah
then i took my songs and guitar and sang em to a man from tennessee

chorus
ive played every beer joint tavern from new york city out to pasadena
every corn dog fair and rodeo and sold out every basketball arena
i like to get down with my boys in afghanistan and baghdad city too
i am a red white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk u

verse 3
a star cant burn forever and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
but the glass wont ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
ill still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and play it loud
as long as theres a barroom with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

chorus
ive played every beer joint tavern from new york city out to pasadena
every corn dog fair and rodeo and sold out ever basketball arena
i like to get down with my boys in afghanistan and baghdad city too
son im a red white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk u
thats right a red white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk uyou might also likeembed"
