ruby rarely rap about stackin up cash yeah yeah yeah yeah

took some dabs last night now im back to no wax
always gotta get fucked up i cant last one day without fuckin it up

pills are better whenever the going gets tough
ill bash in my casket climb in and laugh until the grass is growin through my skull
ayy walk into the cvs with vvss bitch drippin on my chest oh
bright white lights oh make the diamonds ohh flex
but they also reveal my face without a mask on oh what a mess
lookin for a reason yeah yeah but i wanna rest

verse 2 lil cig
lil cig jump in this bitch
tell me do we got a problem what what what what

smokin dope los angeles in the corvette
knock it out the park like a fuckin dodger
