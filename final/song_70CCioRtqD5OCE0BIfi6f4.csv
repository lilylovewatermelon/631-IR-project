red tears run down my scattered face
six blunts rolled laced
holdin the pace with fate
hand on the wheel with my foot on the clutch
made a deal with the devil just to get my dick sucked
by six different bitches—watch em switch up
triple six lynches tie the rope up
abusin narcotics because my life is chaotic
dont even get no fucking pleasure whether or not its erotic
into my grave i left my conscience there between the pistol
and the blade that i had used to end my fucking fate again
i swear

verse 2 norman atomic
hades born and raised im chokin in the smoky blaze
im drownin in the local lake i make em frozen how i flake
draped in purple velvet cloaks
ruby stones up in my crown the earth will be my fucking throne
ruby drowned and pluto was found
threeheaded dog locked up in the pound
but i let them out every once in a while
gimmie what you got and ill put it in a pile
burn it up then i smile
starvin all i got is stomach bile number dialed
