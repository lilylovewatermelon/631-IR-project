verse 2 takeoff
foreign exchange the chain chains
fame came with the change fame
you get a stripe for a stain stripe
you bout to crash out your lane skrrt
the umbrella out of the rolls royce cullinan
know it came with the rain cullinan
no letterman ive been a veteran
nigga do anything for a name anything
when you start getting a lil change watch how your partners and everything change change
and when you step foot in that field make sure youre strapped and make sure you got aim grah
my niggas they shooting to live i seen some niggas they shooting for fame nah
they dont know that this shit real thats how you end up getting blown out ya brains brrt
the money the car the chains the fame id give up everything why
to see my grandma just to see my kinpica
the drugs can’t heal all the pain no cap
i get you knocked off of earth you play with my body you play with my name play with it
i wet em up like he surf if he looking strange i pop out his brain dont play with me
im rockin a watch with no diamonds in it it cost me a ticket its plain
i put baguettes in the patek what time is it and it cost me a rolls insane rolls
i dont post pics with sticks and shit thats how them boys get framed fool
