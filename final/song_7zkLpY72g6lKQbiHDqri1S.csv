sunrise sunrise looks like mornin in your eyes
but the clocks held 915 for hours
sunrise sunrise couldnt tempt us if it tried
cause the afternoons already come and gone

verse 2
surprise surprise couldnt find it in your eyes
but im sure its written all over my face
surprise surprise never something i could hide
when i see we made it through another day

ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh
to you
