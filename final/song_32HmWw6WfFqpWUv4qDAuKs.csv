listen close as the rain falls down to the ground

its true
we are we are destined to fail
its true
we are we are destined to fail

verse 1
there is a problem here with our society
the absence of my tears is my sobriety
i have a growing fear and youre not helping me
am i the only one who realizes its true

chorus 1
beat but im not broken
guide me through with your hand
lead with your words spoken
show me how to listen

verse 2
youre persecuting me showing hypocrisy
i have a remedy for your insecurity
its all the same sadly nobody works for free
am i the only one who realizes its true
you might also likechorus 2
beat but im not broken
guide me through with your hand
lead with your words spoken
show me how to listen

let your light shine through me
take this hate i cant release
help me make the blind see
misery loves its company

bridge
when i dream i see dawn turn
into dusk into dusk

chorus 2
beat but im not broken
guide me through with your hand
lead with your words spoken
show me how to listen

let your light shine through me
take this hate i cant release
help me make the blind see
misery loves its company
outro
its true
we are we are destined to fail
its true
we are we are destined to fail1embed"
