days pass by and my eyes they dry and i think that im okay
til i find myself in conversation fading away
the way you smile the way you walk
the time you took to teach me all that you had taught
tell me how am i supposed to move on

refrain
these days im becoming everything that i hate
wishing you were around but now its too late
my mind is a place that i cant escape your ghost

prechorus
sometimes i wish that i could wish it all away
one more rainy day without you
sometimes i wish that i could see you one more day
one more rainy day

chorus
oh im a wreck without you here
yeah im a wreck since youve been gone
ive tried to put this all behind me
i think i was wrecked all along
yeah im a wreck

verse 2
they say that the time will heal it the pain will go away
but everything it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
the way you laugh when your shoulders shook
the time you took to teach me all that you had taught
tell me how am i supposed to move on

these days im becoming everything that i hate
wishing you were around but now its too late
my mind is a place that i cant escape your ghost

prechorus
sometimes i wish that i could wish it all away
one more rainy day without you
sometimes i wish that i could see you one more day
one more rainy day

chorus
oh im a wreck without you here
yeah im a wreck since youve been gone
ive tried to put this all behind me
i think i was wrecked all along

bridge
these days when im on the brink of the edge
i remember the words that you said
remember the life you led
youd say oh suck it all up dont get stuck in the mud
thinking of things that you should have done
ill see you again my loved one
ill see you again my loved one
yeah im a wreck
ill see you again my loved one
chorus
yeah im a wreck without you here
im a wreck without you here loved one
yeah im a wreck since youve been gone
im a wreck since youve been gone
ive tried to put this all behind me
i think i was wrecked all along im a wreck
yeah im a wreck

outro
sometimes i wish that i could wish it all away but i cant
one more rainy day without you one more rainy day
sometimes i wish that i could see you one more day but i cant
one more rainy day22embed"
