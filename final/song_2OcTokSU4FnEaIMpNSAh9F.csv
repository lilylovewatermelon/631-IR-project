do you live in new york city
or a couple towns away
wherever you are
id jump in my car just to see you today

prechorus
will i meet you at a party
sit next to you on a plane
maybe i already know you and loathe you
but well fall in love some day

chorus
dear soulmate
do you think of me
like i do
do you have green eyes
or are they brown like mine
do you have a sister too
dear soulmate
one day ill give this song to you

verse 2
will we drive up to the mountains
camp in a little tent
when the bears come at night
will you put up a fight
or will you hide with mе and my flashlight
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeprechorus
do you sleep on the right side
cause i prеfer the left
will you make me buttered toast
perhaps a morning roast
when i wake up and im sad

chorus
dear soulmate
do you think of me
like i do
do you have green eyes
are they brown like mine
do you have a sister too
dear soulmate
one day ill give this song to you

outro
dear soulmate
i cant wait to fall in love with you2embed"
