ive never been running so far so immense far
when will i fall into your arms
i want to try and stand the pain
of my longtimehurtingfeet

and what about you you drunken soul
is that your own will to go
on and on until i die
or are you going to give up now

to give up now
to give up now
to give up now

verse
ive never run so real so immense real
when will i fall into your heart
i want to try and stand the pain
of my longtimehurtingfeet

and what about you you drunken soul
is that your own will to go
on and on until i die
or are you going to give up now
