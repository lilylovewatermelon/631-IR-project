im not gonna be the same steve that you knew that was
five years ago
why would i still be on the same shit bro

i change you change change
why would one stay the same
thats no fun
youre strange so strange
if you choose to remain the same

verse 1
when i say change i mean evolve
all my old friends they just dissolve
because they stayed on the same old shit
just hung out offcampus smoking this
you see me im not that type of guy
but i used to before i found my high
but they cant grasp they dont know why
im not the same steve they used to like
