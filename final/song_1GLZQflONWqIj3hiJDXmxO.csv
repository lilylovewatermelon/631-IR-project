cold dark lonesome
dead of night
things gone so wrong
cant get right
in the darkness
hear the sound
of a world thats
upside down

chorus
mercy aint got no judgment
justice got a rag tied around her eyes
ought to be tears rolling down her face
at the blind tryin to lead the blind
rich man rolls the dice
poor man pays the price

verse 2
only hurts to
think of home
makes it hard to
be alone
every moment
of a day
trouble standing
in my way
