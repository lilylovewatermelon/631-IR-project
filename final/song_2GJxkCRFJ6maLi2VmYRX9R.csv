that wasnt funny
but she laughed so hard she almost cried
theyre countin months theyve been together
almost fortynine
yo sam this shit heat
hes making fun of how she acted round the holidays
damn dawson
she wears a ring but they tell people that theyre not engaged
they met in class for metaphysical philosophy
he tells his friends i like her
cause shes so much smarter than me
theyre having talks about their futures until 4 am
and im happy for thеm
but i wanna feel all that love and emotion
be that attachеd to the person im holdin
someday ill be falling without caution
but for now im only people watchin
yeah uh

verse
thinkin about my life and how far a nigga came
thinkin about my life and mistakes a nigga made
steady duckin the reaper everybody got a day grrah
hopefully ill be ready for it yeah yeah
uh i told em my dreams they aint believe this
i cant lie even i couldnt of seen this
i just was on the bus stop gettin high out of my brain
headphones in listenin to kevin gates sayin
shooting star shooting star
rapper with a pistol that made me a shooting star
now we all across the globe three hundred thousand dollar shows
we wasnt posed to get this far
this shit so crazy how these hoes tryna plot on me tryna plot on me
these niggas hatin want my spot sendin shots at me
know i fuck with sosa ghetto spec and tee
boy you must aint know them boys gon park the car jump out on feet
wont you pay a nigga back for saving ya life
i dont know yet but im a make it right
im tryna ball these niggas tryna take my life
ill tell you whatll make a gangster change his life
go to sleep with millions in his bank
wake up in the morning see his daughter face
just as broke as a joke when we was down we was fine youngin
start achievin his dreams now my life on the line
