verse 1
who do i meet i can’t choose
i want to but jessica won’t let me
why showing butts it will slow down the kids stuff
that is so immature if that’s so stupid where do i start baby
what are you up to baby what
two minutes songs can be super tough for business
don’t give a ring finger lake side what the heck
want play around until you leave me for a minute
got nothing to do baby
i want to be a fan of you and the music group
i will end up in jail to get my diet a world
it sames dangerous to not eat for a week baby

chorus
i got nothing left to eat oh oh
