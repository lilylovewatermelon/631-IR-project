cannot spend another night in this home
i close my eyes and take a breath real slow
the consequence is if i leave im alone
but whats the difference when you beg for love
cause i run through glass in the street
kerosene hearts carry the name that my father gave me
and take the face of the wolf

chorus
cause this is a wasteland my only retreat
with heaven above you theres hell over me

verse 2
i met a girl who never looked so alone
like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm
she tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue
we fell in love and now were both alone
cause i dont need any more friends
and another kiss like a fire on pavement
well burn it down to the end
oh oh

chorus
this is a wasteland my only retreat
with heaven above you theres hell over me
the water is rusted the air is unclean
and there for a second i feel free
this is a wasteland my only retreat
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likebridge
ive waited all this night to honor you and say
i know its hard but who are you to fall apart on me on me

chorus
this is a wasteland my only retreat
with heaven above you theres hell over me
cause this is a wasteland my only retreat
with heaven above you theres hell over me
you said what about us well what about me
hang from the gallows asleep in the rain
this is a wasteland my only retreat

outro
paralyze me
dont let me jump dont let me fall44embed"
