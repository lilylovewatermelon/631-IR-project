never wouldve hitchhiked to birmingham
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve caught the train to louisiana
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve run through the blindin rain
without one dollar to my name
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love

verse 2
never wouldve seen the trouble that im in
if it hadnt been for love
wouldve been gone like a wayward wind
if it hadnt been for love
nobody knows it better than me
i wouldnt be wishing i was free
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love

chorus
four cold walls against my will
at least i know shes lying still
four cold walls without parole
lord have mercy on my soul

instrumental break

never wouldve gone to that side of town
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve took a mind to track her down
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve loaded up a 44
put myself behind a jailhouse door
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love

chorus
four cold walls against my will
at least i know shes lying still
four cold walls without parole
lord have mercy on my soul

verse 4
never wouldve hitchhiked to birmingham
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve caught the train to louisiana
if it hadnt been for love
never wouldve loaded up a 44
put myself behind a jailhouse door
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love
outro
if it hadnt been if it hadnt been for loveembed"
