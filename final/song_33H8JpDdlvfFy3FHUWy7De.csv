verse 1
every time i look up
he be slidin through in the f150 pickup
on them things shinin with the crazy banging system
laid back reclinin with his arm up out the window like ooh ooh
every time he calls i pick up
when he doesnt i be quick to double check my signal
hold it out the window and pull up my antenna
im so gone gotta hit em infatuated wit em
and ooh i never felt this before

and i think it might be love
