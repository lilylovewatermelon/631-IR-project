dont you tell me youre fine i can tell when youre lying
caught you slipping on ice but your heart is on fire
cause i noticed your scars and i know that its hard
and i hope you dont start getting all fucking quiet
cause we made it so far i dont wanna restart
recollecting these sparks reconnecting these wires
cause im scared of the dark can we skip to the part
where you fall in my arms and you tell me youre tired

postchorus
ooh ooh ooh oohooh
you can tell me youre tired
ooh ooh oohoohooh oohooh

verse 1
last night you looked quite alright
but you seem so formal all the time
cause you laugh and smile
but you never cry so why are you tired
we go where we want to go
and we call whatever we want home
and we wonder why they never leave us on our own

chorus
dont you tell me youre fine i can tell when youre lying
caught you slipping on ice but your heart is on fire
cause i noticed your scars and i know that its hard
and i hope you dont start getting all fucking quiet
cause we made it so far i dont wanna restart
recollecting these sparks reconnecting these wires
cause im scared of the dark can we skip to the part
where you fall in my arms and you tell me youre tired

verse 2
they say youre better off by yourself
but they never understood just how you felt
when the beat dies down and your soul just melts
and you dont have to hold back tears
cause after everything im here for you
theres nothing you should fear

chorus
dont you tell me youre fine i can tell when youre lying
caught you slipping on ice but your heart is on fire
cause i noticed your scars and i know that its hard
and i hope you dont start getting all fucking quiet

cause im scared of the dark can we skip to the part
where you fall in my arms and you tell me youre tired
