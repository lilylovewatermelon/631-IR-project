i cant imagine how hard it must be to be you
adopting all your history its hard being me too
are your secrets where you left them
cause now your ghosts are mine as well
i think its time i met them and i think its time you tell
and you should have told me when you met me all these things i should know
and i should have asked we should have talked about this so long ago

prechorus
its not fair its not fair you dont need me here
oh hows this happening to me it feels so lonely here

chorus
we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
what will happen next you never know
we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
what will happen next you never know

verse 2
now we share the closet now youve let me come inside
and now youre finally undressing and i feel like i might die
the damage is infectious the confession is too late
and how can i accept this how is this happening to me

prechorus
its not fair its not fair help me come up for air
oh hows this happening to me it feels so lonely here

spoken interlude
all your secrets
all your lies

chorus
we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
what will happen next you never know
im completely paralyzed
we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
ive crashed ten thousand times
what will happen next you never know
this is the last time

we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
how do i deserve this
what will happen next you never know
i dont know whats going to happen
we are in a mess a danger zone a danger zone
what will happen next you never know
why would you do this
