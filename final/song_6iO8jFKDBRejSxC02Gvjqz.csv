so she left me said so long
yeah so what ill find someone
in no time with a little luck
it dont really bother me that much

chorus
its only a girl
theres a million of em in this town
only a girl
theyre everywhere just look around
she dont matter anymore
im probably better off for sure
it aint the end of the world
its only a girl

verse 2
there goes one now
pretty smile oh well
i watch her walk by
just keep to myself
cause when youre in love with someone else

chorus
its only a girl
theres a million of them in this town
only a girl
theyre everywhere just look around
she dont matter anymore
im probably better off for sure
it aint the end of the world
its only a girl
