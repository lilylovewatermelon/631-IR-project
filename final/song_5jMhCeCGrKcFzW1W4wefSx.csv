now listen i think you and me have come to the end of our time
what do you want some kind of reaction
well okay thats fine
alright how would it make you feel if i said you never made me cum
in the year and a half that we spent together
yeah i never really had much fun

prechorus
all those times that i said i was sober
well im afraid i lied
id be lying next to you and you next to me
all the while i was high as a kite
i can see it in your face as you break it to me gentle
yeah you really must think youre great
well lets see how you feel in a couple of weeks
when i work my way through your mates

chorus
i never wanted it to end up this way
youve only got yourself to blame
im gonna tell the world youre rubbish in bed now
and that youre small in the game

verse 2
so you thought this was gonna be easy
well youre outta luck
yeah lets rewind lets turn back time
to when you couldnt get it up
you know what it shouldve ended there
thats when i shouldve shown you the door
as if that werent enough to deal with
you became premature
