we don’t have time left to regret hold on
it will take more than common sense hold on
so stop your wondering take a stand hold on
cause theres more to life than just to live hold on

chorus
cause an empty room can be so loud
its too many tears to drown them out
so hold on hold on
hold on hold on

verse 2
one single smile a helping hand hold on
its not that hard to be a friend hold on
so don’t give up stand til the end hold on
cause theres more to life than just to live hold on

chorus
cause an empty room can be so loud
its too many tears to drown them out
so hold on hold on
hold on hold on
when you love someone and they break your heart
don’t give up on love have faith restart
just hold on hold on
hold on hold on
