one at a time constants become surreal
one at a time heart attacks are concealed
i can see that i lose the joys of life
one at a time suicides are revealed
you will see that i lost another life
but tonight

chorus
ill let you tear it up if you dont wake me up
but if you tear it we cant repair it
so please dont wake me til someone cares
now no one cares

verse 2
one at a time i watched them all forget
one at a time im lost in little deaths
its the place that i i forget my life
like tonight

chorus
ill let you tear it up if you dont wake me up
but if you tear it we cant repair it
so please dont wake me til someone cares
now no one cares

will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me
will the flood behind me will the flood put out the fire inside me

chorus
ill let you tear it up
ill let you break it up if you dont wake me up
but if you tear it we cant repair it
so please dont wake me til someone cares
now no one cares cares

outro
ill let you tear it up if you dont wake me up
cause its apparent that you dont care
and its sunk into me cause i dont care
now no one cares2embed"
