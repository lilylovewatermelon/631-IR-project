not like i need to depend upon anyone
since i can see the lack of need for me to be here at all
one more anthem for the know it all
i wont be standing up for long
i better learn how to crawl
learn how to crawl

chorus
in ten minutes ill be laying out flat on the floor

verse 2
like i need to defend my own innocence
so what i did it i admit it and im pleading the 5th
one more anthem for the know it all
i wont be standing up for long
i better learn how to crawl
learn how to crawl

chorus
in ten minutes ill be laying out flat on the floor

verse 3
eight minutes from losing it a little bit
five minutes your description might be starting to fit
three to go and im forgetting all that ive ever known
i wont be standing up for long
i better learn how to crawl

chorus
in ten minutes ill be laying out flat on the floor
i cant stand up at all
cant see nothing at all
in ten minutes ill be laying out flat on the floor1embed"
