i was unafraid i was a boy i was a tender age
melic in the naked knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
hurdle all the waitings up i know it wasnt wedded love why
four long minutes in and it was over itd all be back
and the frost took up the eyes

verse 2
pressed against the pane
could see the veins and there was poison out
resting in a raze the inner claims i hadnt breadth to shake
searching for an inner clout may not take another bout why
honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
hon it wasnt yet the spring

verse 3
aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
nose up in the globes you never know if you are passing out
no it wasnt maidenup the falling or the faded luck why
hung up in the ivory both were climbing for a finer cause
love can hardly leave the room
with your heartyou might also like5embed"
