verse 1 zac brown
black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
like the king finds no peace his work is never done
night falls smoke on the water darkness closes in
cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

chorus 2 zac brown
its a life long expedition
second guessing your decisions
trying to find out whats been missing
pages keep on filling

bridge zac brown
crying out go and wake the king
call to arms for those who kiss the ring
stand your ground the walls are coming down
its do or die do or die

mad man blood on the altar the queen will have his head
his ghost will shake those rattling chains long after hes dead
no soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
loved by few and judged by many he bears that weight alone

chorus 2 chris cornell
its a life long expedition
second guessing your decisions
trying to find out whats been missing
and the pages keep on filling
