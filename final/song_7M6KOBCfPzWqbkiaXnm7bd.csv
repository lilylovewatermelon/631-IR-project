hes so beautiful
makes me wanna believe
hes got a heart of gold
that nobody can see
bringing party favors
dollar bills rolled nice and neat
party boy you took too much
its time for you to leave

prechorus
i want to want you baby
but youre making it so hard
i tried to bite the bullet
and just take you as you are

chorus
you get too close
take the one i love the most
i think its time for you to go
make it so hard you know youve gone too far and
i think its time for you to go

verse 2
so predictable just like what they told me
hes staring at the floor tail between your knees
see sir chloe liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likefragile like ive never seen
youre pretty when you do not speak
fragile like ive never seen
youre pretty when you do not speak

prechorus
youre so unsure
youre so afraid
dont tell me to listen when you got nothing to say

chorus
you get too close
take the one i love the most
i think its time for you to go
make it so hard you know youve gone too far and
i think its time for you to go

postchorus
youre so unsure
youre so afraid
dont tell me to listen when you got nothing to say8embed"
