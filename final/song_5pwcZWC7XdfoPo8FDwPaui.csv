verse 1
if youre only as good as the company you keep
then ima blame you for what they say about me
free your mind let your conscience be free
when i was by myself i was fast asleep
since you came around ive been up for weeks
free your mind let your conscience be free
yiyiyikes ive been with the wrong crowd
i can make you a believer if i turn the nonsense down
i keep my secrets in a safehouse a safehouse
better if i dont speak dont speak
devils tryna tempt me
they just outline my shape out shape out
place me at the crime scene crime scene
i can see from this high up
you aint got a heart girl you aint got a heart girl
privacy is for the cheater
obviously youre deceivin

prechorus
