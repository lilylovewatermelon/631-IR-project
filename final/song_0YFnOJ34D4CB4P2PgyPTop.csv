its a big mistake
50 days 3 months away
id be laughing today
but your voice on the phone gives me no reason
dont take from me
my heart is barely beating
dont take from me
im falling down

chorus
all i want to do is lie in bed with you
all i really ever need is you
all i got to do is give up all i have to be with you

verse
its a different day
1500 miles away
why would you want to stay
so take a look around

chorus
all i want to do is lie in bed with you
all i really ever need is you
all i got to do is give up all i have to be with you
you might also likepostchorus
all i want to do is to be close to you
all i want to do is to be next to you
all i want is you to give up all we had to be
i cant remember why im here
if youd let me spend my life with you

outro
decembers gone
it came and went
decembers gone
it came and went
all i really need is you
im waiting here for you
decembers gone
it came and went
decembers gone
it came and went
decembers gone
it came and wentembed"
