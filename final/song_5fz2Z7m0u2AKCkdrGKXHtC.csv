might as well have fun cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked
might as well have fun cause your happiness is done

might as well have fun cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked

verse 1 big boi
first rule in this thang never let em see you sweat
never let em be a threat and your feelings you must protect em
as well as your rectum must keep self out of harm
out of dangers way let strangers play while you graduate and move on
true happiness is not acquired and you wont find it for sale
unless youre in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail
you would be happy as hell you thought you was happy until that court date came
couldnt abort that case nobody to take your place
family home is at stake too late to escape and get on the run

verse 2 big boi sleepy brown  debra killings
once upon a rhyme one time when i was a child
flip that smile upside down now
when i found out that santa claus was nothing more than vanilli
it was silly cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny
didnt have many but had enough to get by
enough to get fly only to start the new year off in debt
now you forget your happiness came and went
like mom and dads relationship take a trip you bring potato chips
ill bring the hot sauce hot sauce

and your goose is cooked
might as well have fun cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked
might as well have fun cause your happiness is done
and your goose is cooked
verse 3 big boi  debra killings
1979 dirty south local lounge
flip that smile upside down now
i never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
graphic language mild violence and the silence
of the the fams no members to remember
but i know just who i am ive grown into a man
and like my nigga said we executed the game plan
cause we got that hot sauce
