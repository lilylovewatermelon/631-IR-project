silver screen such a disgrace
i couldnt look her straight in the face
a blue addiction i live in disgust
degradation im being eaten by lust

verse 2
inspiration thats blue and uncut
cant kick the habit obssesion of smut
voyeur straining in love with his hand
a poison passion pulsating gland

chorus

verse 3
flaps
i shouldnt do it the guilt tells me why
i just cant stop it i try and i try
xrated demon that lives in my head
hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed
