hot shit aww shit

verse 1 count bass d
i strive to be humble lest i stumble
never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
sauce tyson is a fowl holocaust
hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry im fed up
ignore cordon bleu stand up get up
lunge for your knife dont forget your potholders
hot shit

verse 2 mf doom
what these old things about to throw em away
with the gold rings that make em dont fit like oj
usually i take them off with oil of olay
mcs is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
hot as hell and its a cold day innit
working on a way that we can roll away tinted
some say the price of holding heat is often too high
you either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
the one thats too fly to eat shoo pie
never too busy when it comes down to you and i
swear to god a lot of niggas wish to die
they need to hold they horses theres bigger fish to fry
youre on the list if not pick a number spot
ten and a half timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
i coulda had a v8
f150 quad cab but ill be straight
money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
that night that tried to rush me dwight pass the dutchie
so i can calm down so they dont get it twisted
take it from the fire side it wont get blistered
got it what happened oh its not lit
these metal fingers be holding hot shit

when i was four i penned god was born in new york
back in 77 still got nan in the crescent
the effervescence of gods presence is thick
unlike vapor esther rolle extra raw word to the baker
peace to the hardworkin gingerbread makers
looked her up and down said hmm too much makeup
poor music taste ten years from being grown up
rappers dont blow up heads do aww shit
my name is dwight spitz im a sonic addict
i use to think it was merely a nagging habit
born under a bad sign im serious about this curse of mine
i strive to flip it into fine wine
barely born a virgin is what the stars said
black not white red all over though like elmo
twentyeight years have passed i feel im peaking
i make music every weekend
its a chore a fact of life a labor of love
i get mad love but i detest the labor
and its wagesâ€”you know death
im servin life from this gift of god
dont forget your potholders my niggas
