i have this paralyzing fear that ill maybe go nowhere
but god forbid me ever admitting i could be scared
and i cant stand my friends right now we got nothing in common
but being lonelys worse than just having friends that dont care

prechorus
you said it looks like ive been going through hell
how did you know how could you tell
ask me to explain myself well

chorus
im trying my best here to be brutally honest
nobody said changing would be this exhausting
a foot on the brake cause its been making me carsick
how could you blame me growing up is chaotic

verse 2

dont think ill do that again no

prechorus
you said it looks like ive been going through hell
how did you know how could you tell

but i cant help it no i cant help it
fooling myself thinking that ill never love again

maybe im just blowing all this shit up in my head
but i cant help it no i cant help it
spending too much time on things i know that ill forget
but damn i felt it
