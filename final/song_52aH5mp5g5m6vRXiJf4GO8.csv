its been a long long time comin and its time for me to go
time to split things up that drive us crazy
so im gunna make this easy baby

you can have the money
you can have the house
take the cadillac and that boat out back
and your mothers pink and yellow couch
you can have every penny that ill make from this here song
girl all i want you to leave me is alone

dont get me wrong i will always love you girl
you were my life you were my heart you were my world
but we both know its over theres no need to fight it
girl i just need some peace and quiet

so you can have the money
you can have the house
take the cadillac and that boat out back
and that ugly pink and yellow couch
you can have every penny that i will make from this here song
girl all i want you to leave me is alone

you can have the money
you can have the house
take the big screen and your diamond ring
and those shoes that you swore you couldnt live without
you can have every penny that i will make from this here song
girl all i want you to leave me is alone
girl all i need you to leave me is alonesee darius rucker liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeembed"
