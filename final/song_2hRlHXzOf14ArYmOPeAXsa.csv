drifting
watchin the world go round
world go yeah world go round
listening
to unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
unknown sounds unknown sounds

verse 1
slippin through my fingertips ayy lingerin
shoulda woulda coulda whered i put the pen woah
make a list of all my failed attempts
runnin outta space again
highlight all the things i wish i never said stop
if feeling makes you stronger im the weakest
that would mean that i would have to separate from my beliefs
its not a secret im a puzzle got a lotta missin pieces
underneath this strong persona i put ons a kid thats screamin
arent these waters so deceivin so dеceivin
they look differеnt dont they
well at least thats how they seem to me
cause we just drift and drift and drift
until we see something that we define as peaceful
grab the needle shoot reminders in my veins
that people leave you while im driftin

watchin the world go round
world go yeah world go round
listening
to unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
unknown sounds unknown sounds

verse 2
lots of gossip ive been watchin you
how youre talkin to yourself is rude
driftin im in the same boat as you
sinkin dreamin screamin for some truth
and my my escalators broke ill take the stairs i guess
climb until im outta breath
questioning my every step woah
my train of thought is leadin me to different tracks
positive that where im at is not where i should stay and thats why
told you look into the mirror and say i love you
convince yourself that no one in the world would ever want to
passin by the people that have been there to support you
from the getgo disrespectful drive you mental
might get stressful when im driftin
i see you in the distance
askin me why im so distant im convicted
im convinced that i predict that all my wishes on my wish list wont be heard
cause im committed to the lie that feeling safe is unrealistic
when im driftin
chorus
watchin the world go round
world go yeah world go round
listening
to unfamiliar feelings and unknown sounds
unknown sounds unknown sounds

outro
ignorant to my ignorance
tell me im worth it god
give me the faith to rise and help me diversify
to take a step forward immersed in my belligerence amplified
the feelings and words collide
intensified by living a life deprived
id rather be burned alive
than go back to thinkin im insignificant insignificant
every impotent moment debated can trigger it
god is my witness definitive
holdin my head up there isnt an innocent bone in my body
but thats what gives me the energy lacked
to renovate have to innovate past intimidates
cant remain afraid71embed"
