took a deep breath in the mirror
he didnt like it when i wore high heels but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didnt get this song but i do i do

verse 2
i walked in expectin youd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you dont know how nice that is but i do

chorus
and you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spendin the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wеdnesday in a café i watched it begin again

verse 3
you said you nеver met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you but i do
we tell stories and you dont know why
im comin off a little shy but i do

chorus
but you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spendin the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i wanna talk about that
and for the first time whats past is past

chorus
cause you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spendin the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again
