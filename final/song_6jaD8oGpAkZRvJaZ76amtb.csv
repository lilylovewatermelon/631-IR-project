verse 1
treasure hunter you are dead
the light of the world is fading
you cannot see the other end
your bodys lost all feeling
those creatures of your woken mind
dont fear them or their hunger
forgive the sea follow the tide
with the monsters on your shoulder

chorus
pearl diver dive dive deeper
pearl diver dive dive down
pearl diver dive dive deeper
pearl diver dive dive down

verse 2
oh hunter if you didnt want
the beautiful so badly
perhaps you wouldve found it
in your spirit singing softly
but hunter you were human
dont forget it and go safely
and i ill live without you
though the struggle will be daily
