verse 2 baby bash
now i aint worried about a thang cause i just hit me a lick
i got a fat sack and a superfly chick
and uhuh and there aint nothin you can say to a player
cause doowop she fly like the planes in the air
thats right she fullgrown settin the wrong tone
im diggin the energy and im lovin her ozone
so fly like a dove fly like a raven
quick to politic with some fly conversation
in a natural mood then im a natural dude
and we some natural fools blowin out by the pool
she like my sexy cool mama well blaze on the bravada
rockin dolce gabbana hydro in a cubana
