they gave me a life thats not so easy to live
and then they sent me on my way
i left my love and forgot my dreams
i lost them along the way

bridge
those little things you say
when words mean so much
you never back down
and they all shy away
you always listen to me

chorus
and what do i get to get me through these sleepless nights
and what do i have to hold when no ones there to hold me tight
and what do i see
the only thing that gets me through
this is what i feel and i feel you

verse 2
and this aint no bed of nails
but theyre not roses just the same
god this road sure can be long
another endless day another seven hundred miles
thatll take me further from my home

those little things you say
when words mean so much
you never back down
and they all shy away
you always listen to me

chorus
and what do i get to get me through these sleepless nights
and what do i have to hold when no ones there to hold me tight
and what do i see
the only thing that gets me through
this is what i feel and i feel you

refrain
i know what youre going through now
believe me i live this

chorus
and what do i get to get me through these sleepless nights
and what do i have to hold when no ones there to hold me tight
and what do i see
the only thing that gets me through
this is what i feel and i feel youembed"
