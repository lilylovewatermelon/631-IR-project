lets go

verse 1
with bloodshot eyes i watch you sleepin
the warmth i feel beside me is slowly fadin
would she hear me if i called her name
would she hold me if she knew my shame

prechorus
theres always something different goin wrong
the path i walks in the wrong direction
theres always someone fuckin hangin on
can anybody help me make things better

chorus
your tears dont fall they crash around me
her conscience calls the guilty to come home
your tears dont fall they crash around me
her conscience calls the guilty to come home

verse 2
the moments died i hear no screamin
the visions left inside me are slowly fadin
would she hear me if i called her name
would she hold me if she knew my shame
