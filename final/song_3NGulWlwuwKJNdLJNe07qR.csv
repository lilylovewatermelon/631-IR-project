its not what you think
these tears arent some sweet response to tragedy
today i cant say why they fall
honey its all chemical
dont be deceived
and dont take my bitterness as empathy
darling its a broken bridge
can you still get over it

chorus
if youre not afraid of the water
you should dive right in
im not so brave but im gonna
give it a try
but itll take a little while

verse 2
can you fix my flaws
are you a bad excuse for therapy
how am i supposed to live
one foot out and one foot in
i fear the fall
right now i just cant find thе energy
weighеd down by a ton of bricks
im forgetting how to swim

if youre not afraid of the water
you should dive right in
im not so brave but im gonna
give it a try
but itll take a little while

now im not afraid of the water
ill dive right in
and i can be brave so im gonna
give it a try

now im not afraid of the water
ill dive right in
and i can be brave so im gonna
give it a try

cause youll be on the other sideembed"
