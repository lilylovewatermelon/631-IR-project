so bad so bad good to be
so bad so bad good to be
so bad so bad well it feels so
good to be bad good to be bad
good to be bad

verse 1
i’ve been thinking ‘bout this year a lot
whether i’ve been a good girl or not
santa promised he won’t get mad
sometimes it feels so good to be bad
i missed my curfew by an hour late
i fed the dog the veggies off of my plate
tried my best to obey mom and dad
sometimes it feels so good to be bad

prechorus
so maybe i’ll get anothing for christmas
but i had the thrill
or maybe just maybe you’ll go easy on me
oh i hope you will
i sure hope you will

verse 2
i played hooky and i failed the test
snuck out the house and didn’t act my best
and now my face is in a wanted ad
sometimes it feels so good to be bad
see pentatonix liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus
so maybe i’ll get nothing for christmas
but i had the thrill
or maybe just maybe you’ll go easy on me
oh i hope you will

bridge
i grab a present from under the tree
a big ‘ol box all wrapped in red and green
rip up the paper and untie the bow
just to find out it’s a box of coal
so bad so bad good to be
so bad so bad good to be
so bad so bad well it feels so
good to be bad good to be bad
good to be bad

outro
i couldn’t help but have a little fun
said all the golden years are said and done
let’s try next year and see where i’m at
but oh it feels so good to be badembed"
