verse 2
got it from the thieves served it to the fiends
got married to the mob thats word to my mom
shorty bounced it back i showed a hundred racks
she ran up out the back she threw me on her back
ima spin around the corner work on my diploma
wanna talk man to man not two or three soldiers
in atlanta out with flocka spinnin round with gucci
had the white like sushi and the brown like karrueche
got the scar like the fugees cash money like tunechi
they all love me like im boosie gd up fuck this gucci
gotta leave it up to god cook it up and dry it
hit the 95 hustlin was a job
