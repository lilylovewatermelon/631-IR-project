and this beat from cash not from youtube
i been poppin— uh ayy ayy ayy
i been poppin beans like i dont love nobody uh
and im booked up overseas so i been detoxin uh
i got chrome heart on my sleeve but she still broke it probably
she got neptune on her tee but she do what she want
and they still love me over east even though i dont pick my phone
got the goodfellas for me bodies in the trunk
bodies in the trunk but its a martian

verse

hеr best friend said fuck me shе know it aint that— uh
her best friend said fuck me she know it aint that simple
i just found a new new i say that cause her dimples

you still aint call me back you must want me to retire the actin uh
keep it in the streets but thats when i been hardly rappin
even thought it aint that deep round up everybody been starred for hats
man uh look uh
karma must be racin me dream ho on a date with me
i would tell the truth but when i do you get to hating me
just had deja vu you said that too even though you fakin it
called me out the blue you seen the news you said its dangerous
waitin on your apology know you aint gettin that out of me
hide from all the cameras all they do is damage us
i just flew you home you said la was startin to wear on ya
i was with a bitch i told her dip because i care too much
i been poppin beans cause i dont love nobody right
thats my problem right now
