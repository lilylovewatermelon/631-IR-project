suzanne wont you help me to draw the line
between floozy women and having cigarettes with wine

there seems to be no room here for my laughter
but you never seemed to mind all those nights before

by god wont you please just cut out the lights
but whatever you do
wont you leave my candle burning

working for nickel down at the armory
trying to support my dime life style

the bossman telling me i better get it done
what a way to treat the boy whos your only son

by god wont you please just cut out the lights
but whatever you do
wont you leave my candle burning

count your money out on your own time
you stole somebodys heart my dear but it sure as hell wasnt mine

pick your rags up off my bedroom floor
i done told you one time youre not welcome here no more

but whatever you do
wont you leave my candle burning

by god wont you please just cut out the lightsembed"
