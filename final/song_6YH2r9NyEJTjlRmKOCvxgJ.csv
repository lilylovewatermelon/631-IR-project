verse 1 linmanuel miranda
we read the wind and the sky when the sun is high
we sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze
at night we name every star
we know where we are
we know who we are who we are

hook 2 chorus linmanuel miranda
aue aue
we set a course to find
a brand new island everywhere we roam
aue aue
we keep our island in our mind
and when its time to find home
we know the way

aue aue
we are explorers reading every sign
we tell the stories of our elders in a neverending chain
aue aue
te fenua te mālie
nae ko hakilia
we know the way9embed"
