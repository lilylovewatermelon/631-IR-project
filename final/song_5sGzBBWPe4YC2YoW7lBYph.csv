one thousand different houses and münchausen ima make you
wanna punch out somefuckinone ouch what the fuck you hit me for
screamed life as i punch counter in bunches out of anger
i once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
black hoodie with a scythe shit i laughed in his face spit
bitch gave me an extra life like take this
now get your ass back in that game bitch dont take shit
for granted and dont take shit give it
only bull you should take is by the horns a mixture of whitey ford
and mighty thor i everlast pen is mightier than sword
finish writin then record replenish keep writin more
nothings ridin on it but your pride thats all youre fightin for
so you fight scratch you claw backs to wall no one was there to catch you fall
you pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off
you grab your balls like theyre gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin bad you want it
pull out your badge for whoopin ass and flash it on em
nobodys gonna back you in the corner youre a hornet
no ones more ignorant than you fuckin four in the mornin
youre at the laboratory stormin like theres nothin thats more important
emcees you better consider this a formal warnin youre in for it
girl what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face
i aint finished bitch i meant in half oil the blades
nobody wants to play they say im a spoiled lil baby but—

verse 2
what goes through an addicts brain besides static pain
and big daddy kane breakbeats and words an erratic train
of thought like splatter paint scatter brain
yeah maybe that explains why youre back but dont rap the same yeah
and youre lookin way thinner cause your hunger got you lookin like
they took away dinner chicka sugar ray leonard
wouldnt sugarcoat a fuckin booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hookers coat
when you say youre a chicka what chicka goat
now fling that bitch from your fingertips hope it lands on
another rap singers lips who cant think of shit anything of wit
thats interesting to spit yo whos king of this fuckin english lit
let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin the shit
how low can you go lower than chuck d ho
hear the bassiness in my voice rockys back where my adrians
nobodys crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
im what tom brady is to the patriots
to rap im not a man im a weapon who just happened
to be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
when it happened i had an epiphany in the bathroom
id never be the same after now im back with an appe
tite for destruction and a fuckin recipe for disaster
so lets eat cause im famished every deed is a dastardly
one evilest bastard even you askin for me to be po
lite to peoples like me havin my teeth pulled
chorus
nobody puts baby in the corner
im only tryna warn ya
cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
hell fuckin flip on ya
cause nobody puts baby in the corner
im only tryna warn ya
cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
hell fuckin flip on ya

verse 3
so step inside a dimension demented side of a mind thats like
an inside of an engine while i multiply your undivided attention
but be reminded if i didnt mention
i lose my mind and my temper youll be the first one who finds him offensive
got him climbin the fences lost some time to addiction
but look up rhyme in the dictionary im in the picture
eminem is the synonym for it im an enigma
fuck it lets get to the meatballs im gonna skip the
veg and potatoes edumacator they are
shit legends are made of spit treacherous data
shit that you would say to your worst enemy
this wretched is what you get when you mix treach with a jada
then combine em with method man and redman with metham
phetamines in each left hand in each right is a sledgehammer
in pajamas standin in front of a webcam
beatin themselves in the head til russell lets him off def jam
maybe i need my head examed hannibal lecter with a dead lamb
hangin from his ceiling drippin with a bed pan
i need meds swear to god cause if i go off the edge
ti aint talkin me off the ledge man
heartthrob thatll fart ah nah
more like a smart slob part blob thatll stab you with a sharp ob
ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the wal
mart walls little baby with large balls
fuck mudslingin im bloodflingin
theres nothing on this fuckin earth better than bein the
king of the playground i hate the swings but i love bein
an underdog cause when im pushed i end up swingin ah
chorus
nobody puts baby in the corner
im only tryna warn ya
cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
hell fuckin flip on ya
cause nobody puts baby in the corner
im only tryna warn ya
cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin a tantrum
hell fuckin flip on ya75embed"
