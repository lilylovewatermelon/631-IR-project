tomorrow tomorrow
tomorrow tomorrow

verse 1 cody carson
tell me im clear to breathe this air alone tonight
tomorrow tomorrow
take this all in the sun will dim but im alive
theyre gonna try to clip your wings
lock you up and make you sing
but theyll never cage your dreams so fly away

chorus cody carson
cause weve got tomorrow were the pages in the wind
weve got tomorrow were the tale that lies within
theres always another day another night
a bittersweet blessing in disguise
tomorrow were the authors of our lives tomorrow

tomorrow tomorrow
tomorrow tomorrow

verse 2 cody carson
eyes open wide daydream at night my thoughts collide
tomorrow tomorrow
someday theyll see behind their screens me shining bright
theyre gonna try to clip your wings
lock you up and make you sing
but theyll never cage your dreams so fly away

bridge jason lancaster
and oh ive been obsessed in search of success
been blinded by the light
sometimes you are the spider sometimes you are the
flying towards the sky our starting line

chorus cody carson
cause weve got tomorrow were the pages in the wind
weve got tomorrow were the tale that lies within
theres always another day another night
a bittersweet blessing in disguise
