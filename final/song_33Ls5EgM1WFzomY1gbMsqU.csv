so you took a chance with me cause you heard im cool
well let me show you why what you heard is true
and youre supposed to feel like its all for you
and this is what we bout to do here
i dance around my house to your favorite song
its electrifying when you got my tshirt on
and i wanna touch but i just stay cool
and this is what we bout to do

prechorus
it dont take a lot to keep it unpredictable
as long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
and when you give it up to me you give your all
cause all that i give in return is

chorus
cold hard hard love
cold hard hard love

verse 2
put your records on hot sex all up in the air
wakin up my fingers all up in your hair
those eyes you do make my world blue
and what we bout to do is
now take hold of me baby i feel it too
never been this far from safe but i wont hold you
cause theres nothing left to hold true

verse 3
uh what if i told you i ainâ€™t know love
and all the chicks im with i dont love
shit still getting harder for me when im trying to find it alone
but i know im supposed to be grown up
it might be time a nigga owned up for the shit i once did
games that i once played shit i once said
no ones turning back on me now
dont turn your back on me now
i need you more than ever
you make me wanna put this tv off of sound
and pull these covers over us and take it slow forever
we go together we so forever
put the sunny in the stormy weather
i spent forever trying to figure out how i can fit up in your endeavors
you know i love you like a bow and arrow
cupid shootin who he aiming at
who laying the body down and where the statement at
when love is lost who gonna show you where to claim it at
you always told me you could show me how to claim it back uh
outro
cold hard love
cold hard love
theres nothing in this world that i
nothing in this world that i16embed"
