she said im going out with my girlfriends
margaritas at the holiday inn
oh have mercy my only thought
was tequila makes her clothes fall off

verse 2
i told her put an extra layer on
i know what happens when she drinks patr√≥n
her closets missing half the things she bought
yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off

chorus
shell start by kickin out of her shoes
lose an earring in her drink
leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
drop a contact down the sink

verse 3
them pantyhose aint gonna last too long
if the dj puts bon jovi on
she might come home in a tablecloth
yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off whoaoh

verse 4
she can handle any champagne brunch
a bridal shower with bacardi punch
jello shooters full of smirnoff
but tequila makes her clothes fall off
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
shell start by kickin out of her shoes
lose an earring in her drink
leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
drop a contact down the sink

outro
she dont mean nothin
shes just havin fun
tomorrow shell say oh what have i done
her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
yeah tequila makes her clothes fall off
oh tequila makes her clothes fall off
oh tequila makes her clothes fall offembed"
