woo
hmm yeah

verse 1
lifes like a road that you travel on
when theres one day here and the next day gone
sometimes you bend sometimes you stand
sometimes you turn your back to the wind
theres a world outside every darkened door
where blues wont haunt you anymore
where the brave are free and lovers soar
come ride with me to the distant shore

prechorus
we wont hesitate
to break down the garden gate
theres not much time left today yeah

chorus
life is a highway
i wanna ride it all night long
if youre goin my way
i wanna drive it all night long

verse 2
through all these cities and all these towns
its in my blood and its all around
i love you now like i loved you then
this is the road and these are the hands
from mozambique to those memphis nights
the khyber pass to vancouvers lights
knock me down im back up again
youre in my blood im not a lonely man
