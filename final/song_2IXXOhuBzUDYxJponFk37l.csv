the roads are wrapped around your waist
they lead me place to place
i take trips from hip to hip
in fact ive made a career of it
i always thought the left was your strongest side
but when it comes to you and i cant decide
its only a matter of time

chorus
i need the product of your fears
in the form of tears
its the only way i can survive
it breaks my heart to see you cry
and baby its the only way i stay alive
green eyes blue skies
natural disasters when she cries
green eyes theyre mine
its only a matter of time

oh oh

like the climate
you never know what weather youll get
no denying youre the habit that i cant quit
its only a matter of mine
you might also likechorus
youre rotating im shaking
i hope you turn around in time
tides changing im waiting
you and i are one of a kind
youre changing
ive been to both hemispheres
over my short years
i still cant pick my favorite place
dont make me
the contour of your lips
they match your continents
and i still love the way that you taste

chorus
only a matter of time
its only a matter of timeembed"
