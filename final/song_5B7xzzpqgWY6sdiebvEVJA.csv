and honestly i have been begging for answers
that you and only you can give to me
my voice crying loud
ive been crying for days now
and as i start to run i stop to breathe

verse 2
and i was nearly scared to death
and i was nearly scared to death
of why you left in paragraphs
of why you left in paragraphs
the words were nearly over us
the words were nearly over us
you stop and turn and grab your bags

chorus
and ill be here by the ocean
just waiting for proof that theres sunsets and silhouette dreams
all my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
and every wave drags me to sea
i could stand here for hours
just to ask god the question is everyone here makebelieve
with a tear in his voice he says son thats the question
does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likeverse 3
as hours move to minutes
and minutes take longer to break
i will be desperately awaiting
when my tongue wont fall apart
and weve been sitting here for hours
all alone and in the dark

verse 4
so let me think of how to word it
is it too soon to say perfect
if i could find another thirty minutes somewhere
im sure everything would find me
all thats left is just to sing

chorus
and ill be here by the ocean
just waiting for proof that theres sunsets and silhouette dreams
all my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
and every wave drags me to sea
i could stand here for hours
just to ask god the question is everyone here makebelieve
with a tear in his voice he says son thats the question
does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me

bridge
and if you sing to me sweet until then
i may never sail virginia again
and as this current moves slow for me
this much you must know well meet again
and el ill have you know im scared to death
tell me once again
that youll love me to the death
and should i die you swear that you will come for me
as i fade away you reach out your hand
interlude
and please dont let me go
and please dont let me go
and please dont let me go
and please dont let me go

chorus
and ill be here by the ocean
just waiting for proof that theres sunsets and silhouette dreams
all my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
and every wave drags me to sea
i could stand here for hours
just to ask god the question is everyone here makebelieve
with a tear in his voice he says son thats the question
does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me6embed"
