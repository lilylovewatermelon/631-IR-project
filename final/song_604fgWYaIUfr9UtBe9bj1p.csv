you were laying on the carpet
like youre satin in a coffin
you said do you believe what youre saying
yeah right now but not that often

chorus
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
god i sure hope you are dead

verse 2
well you disappeared so often
like you dissolved into coffee
are you here right now or are there probably
fossils under your meat

chorus
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
god i sure hope you are dead

bridge
now the blows been softened
since the air we breathes our coffin
well now the blows been softened
since the ocean is our coffin
often times you know our laughter
is your coffin ever after
and you know the blows been softened
since the world is our coffin
well now the blows been softened
since we are our own damn coffins
well everybodys talking about their short lists
everybodys talking about death
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likeverse 3
you were laying on the carpet
like youre satin in a coffin
you said do you believe what youre saying
yeah right now but not that often

chorus
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
are you dead or are you sleeping
god i sure hope you are dead4embed"
