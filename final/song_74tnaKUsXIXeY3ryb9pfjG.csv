touch your thighs im the lonely one
remember that last sweat cause that was the right one
oh all your mysteries are moving in the sun
i show some love and respect

baby you can see that the gazing eye wont lie
dont give up your lover tonight
cause its just you me and this wire alright
lets tend to the engine tonight

she keeps on waiting for time out there
