i grabbed my things and rode to your place
i knew youd be there four twenty three
on your porch swing talking with me
and im thinking what am i doing
this is killing me im dying quietly
four twenty three

verse 2
i heard your name and thought id stop by
cut open your screen door and sneak in slow
just to say hello to you
and see how youve been doing without me
call you and see how youve been doing without meyou might also like4embed"
