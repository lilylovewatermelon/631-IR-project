everybody wants to know
if we fucked on the bathroom sink
how your hands felt in my hair
if we were high on amphetamines

and everybody wants to hear
how we chainsmoked until three
and how you laughed when you said my name
and how you gripped my hips so mean

prechorus
we wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
but the ending is the same every damn time no no no
we wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
but the ending is the same every damn time

chorus
they think im insane they think my lover is strange
but i dont have to fucking tell them anything anything
and im gonna write it all down and im gonna sing it on stage
but i dont have to fucking tell you anything anything

postchorus
thats the beauty of a secret
you know youre supposed to keep it
thats the beauty of a secret
oh waoh waoh waoh waoh
thats the beauty of a secret
you know youre supposed to keep it
but i dont have to fucking tell you anything anything

everybodys waiting up to hear if i dare speak your name
put it deep beneath the track like the hole you left in me
and everybody wants to know bout how it felt to hear you scream
they know you walk like youre a god they cant believe i made you weak

prechorus
we wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
but the ending is the same every damn time no no no
we wrote a story in the fog on the windows that night
but the ending is the same every damn time

chorus
they think im insane they think my lover is strange
but i dont have to fucking tell them anything anything
and im gonna write it all down and im gonna sing it on stage
but i dont have to fucking tell you anything anything
