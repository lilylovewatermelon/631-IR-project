stay with me
youre the one i need
you make the hardest things seem easy
keep my heart somewhere drugs dont go
where the sunshine slows
always keep me close

chorus
if only you could see the stranger next to me
you promise you promise that youre done
but i cant tell you from the drugs

verse 2
dont let go
well dig a great big hole
down an endless hole well both go
youre so blind
you cant save me this time
hope comes from inside and i feel so low tonight

chorus
if only you could see the stranger next to me
you promise you promise that youre done
but i cant tell you from the drugs
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likei wish that you could see this face in front of me
youre sorry you swear it youre done
but i cant tell you from the drugs

bridge
take me i need your hands
so far away to pull me up
take me out from me
so far out from me

chorus
take me if only you could see i need your hands
so far away the stranger next to me to pull me up take the wheel
take me you promise you promise that youre done out from me
so far but i cant tell you from the drugs out from me

i wish that you could see i need your hands
this face in front of me to pull me up
take me youre sorry you swear it youre done out from me
but i cant tell you from the drugs out from me

outro
keep my heart somewhere drugs dont go
where the sunshine slows
always keep me close4embed"
