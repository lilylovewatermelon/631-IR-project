i can hear a heartbeat it seems a little strong
i can hear the things that i did wrong
i can hear a song by looking in her eyes
i can hear all the times shes cried

verse 2
i can hear the memories as they echo off the wall
falling from the pictures down the hall
i can hear regret building up inside of me
i can hear all them things i could not see

chorus
those are the sounds of a woman leaving
stronger than the wind in a willow tree
those are the sounds of a heart breaking
you cant hear it but the noise is killing me

verse 3
i should have heard it coming but i chose to pretend
i should have recognized that sound way back then
but i just wouldnt listen and didnt want to all those years
now the truth is ringing clear in my ears

chorus
those are the sounds of a woman leaving
stronger than the wind in a willow tree
those are the sounds of a heart breaking
you cant hear it but the noise is killing me

those are the sounds of a heart breaking
you cant hear it but the noise is killing me
i can hear it and the silence is killing meembed"
