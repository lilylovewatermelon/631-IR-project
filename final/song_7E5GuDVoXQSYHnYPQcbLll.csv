7E5GuDVoXQSYHnYPQcbLll,Good to Know That If I Ever Need Attention All I Have to Do Is Die,Brand New,6vDiMhyfSnTn18OY99BSQX,"21 contributorsgood to know that if i ever need attention all i have to do is die lyricsverse 1
am i correct to defend the fist that holds this pen
its ink that lies
the pen the prose the paper
i live i learn
you will always take what i have earned
and so aid my end while i believe im winning
our friends speak out in our defense
pay ten deaf ears for two months rent
we burn the gallows they erect
and cut the nooses they tie for our necks

chorus
you constantly make it impossible to make conversation
were comatose but audible
and i liked it the farther i get out
we passed it off but its all on us
only common conversation it took everything i got
and i liked it the farther i get out

verse 2
once said always said
i will hold the past over your head
ill speak my mind whenever i feel slighted
i am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
take heart sweetheart or i will take it from you
i slip concealed back to the keep
concede to do the work for free
we prey as wolves among the sheep
and slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep
you might also likechorus
you constantly make it impossible to make conversation
were comatose but audible
and i liked it the farther i get out
we passed it off but its all on us
only common conversation it took everything i got
and i liked it the farther i get out

chorus
you constantly make it impossible to make conversation
were comatose but audible
and i liked it the farther i get out
we passed it off but its all on us
only common conversation it took everything i got
and i liked it the farther i get out
you constantly make it impossible to make conversation
were comatose but audible
and i liked it the farther i get out
we passed it off but its all on us
only common conversation it took everything i got
and i liked it the farther i get out5embed"
