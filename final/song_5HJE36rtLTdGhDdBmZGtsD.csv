though at times it seems like im coming undone
this walk can often feel lonely
no matter what until this race is won
i will stand my ground where hope can be found
i will stand my ground where hope can be found

chorus
oh
olord olord i know you hear my cry
your love is lifting me above all the lies
no matter what i face this i know in time
youll take all that is wrong and make it right
youll take all that is wrong and make it right

verse 2
your strength is found at the end of my rope
your grace it reaches to the hurting
still through the tears and the questioning why
i will stand my ground where hope can be found
i will stand my ground where hope can be found

chorus
oh
olord olord i know you hear my cry
your love is lifting me above all the lies
no matter what i face this i know in time
youll take all that is wrong and make it right
youll take all that is wrong and make it right
make it right right so right
make it right right right so right
