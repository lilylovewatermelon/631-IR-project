where sixtynine meets forty
theres a single stop light town
and back when i was really young
a part of that burned down
on any given friday night
wed drive a hundred miles
between the sonic and the grocery store
laughing all the while
with as many friends as i could pack in my daddys ford
but i aint in checotah anymore

verse 2
my hotel in manhattan
holds more people than our town
and what i just paid for dinner
would be a down payment on a house
id rather be tipping cows in tulsa
than hailing cabs here in new york
but i aint in checotah anymore

chorus
im in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue skies
the oklahoma kind
see carrie underwood liveget tickets as low as 94you might also likeverse 3
in a world of long red carpets
the bright lights of hollywood
all the paparazzi flashing
could make a girl feel pretty good
you can get anything you want here
except a walmart store
but i aint in checotah anymore

chorus
im in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue skies
the oklahoma kind

bridge
where the wildcats beat the ironheads
old settlers day and the okrafest
after prom down at the bowling lanes
catching crappie fish in eufaula lake
i aint in checotah anymore

chorus
oh yeah
im in a world so wide
it makes me feel small sometimes
i miss the big blue skies
the oklahoma kind
but i aint in checotah
no i aint in checotah
oh theres nothing like oklahoma
outro
where sixtynine meets forty
theres a single stoplight townembed"
