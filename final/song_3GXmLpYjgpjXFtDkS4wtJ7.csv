in the winds of your cape
ive sailed with you
from the shore to the gates
we sway

chorus 1
were alive somewhere else
far ahead of our time

verse 2
in a game of display we break in two
we perform the ornate escape

chorus 2
were alive somewhere else
still asleep someplace new
were ahead of our time
floating through

bridge 1
the sky is falling down
this night belongs to you

verse 3
forty years in the winds
ive played with you
for the rest of our days
ill remain

the sky is falling down
the night is calling you
a star is burning out
the sky belongs to you

were alive somewhere else
still asleep someplace new
far ahead of our time
