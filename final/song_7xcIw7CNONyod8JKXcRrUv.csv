i left my heart in san francisco with some club kids
on a crowded street somewhere
the sky was red and he said
would you like to come be a part of my north american dream
i could try to chase life down
down the street and id find
the separation of fact and fiction

chorus
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might

verse 2
i left my conscience somewhere with my rhythm
i heard about it from the mouth of a man
he was hopping some trains and combing the land
looking for a lover planted in the east
tryna run from the dreaded fist beast

prechorus
and it lies it lies
in the picket fence call
it was my own paradise with
my own private corridor

im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might

verse 3
so im dancing to a new beat and it came to me in bed
my veins became a strain of light that i let to flow instead
and a wish came to me like peter pan at my window and said
evolve your destiny child and youll never walk alone no
youll never walk alone but
travel to the land of surrender
til you cant cry no more
til you cant till you cant
and youll never walk alone

bridge
all this inspirations passing me by
all i can do is chill when i really wanna fly
and this pollution does nothing but dirty up my mind
faster than forever in the blink of an eye
to see past my lethargy is hard i feign
the beauty of my youth is gone
but the chemicals remain
chorus
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might
im trynna find a way trynna find a way
im trynna find a right trynna find a right
and if i budge i just might

outro
i travel to this land of surrender but i see its all over me over and over
again and i try and i try and i try an angel on my left side and a devil
on my right and they fight and they fight and they fight theyre fighting
theyre fighting theyre fighting for my attention
hello you have my attention
do i have your attention can i have your attention please
please youve made such such an impression on meembed"
