funnyfeeling that i had you know and ever since the baby was there i just kept it close to me for some reason pope fed the baby and fixed a bed for it in a dresser drawer she stayed with the baby to care for him during the night because he was spitting up she could not sleep while melissa was there

the next morning awakened by the crying of the child pope fed him throughout the day melissa changed back and forth when melissa was herself she took care of her child when melissa thought she was god pope undertook the maternal duties pope watched the child like it was my own because i felt maybe melissa could hurt the child when she confessed she was god i felt close to the baby maybe because you know i felt i havent had a baby for so long you know i enjoyed taking care of the baby and watching it at a baby shower saturday evening at the home of popes mother melissa again reverted to being god looking wild speaking loudly preaching and giving orders melissa and the baby returned to popes home melissa put the child in bed with her but pope thought it better that the child not remain there she was afraid melissa would roll over and smother it to death she told melissa ill just take the baby in the living room  ill watch it ill get up and feed it i dont mind the next morning sunday at about 430 oclock pope prepared the babys bottle and fed him when melissa got up pope suggested that she go back to bed melissa behaved normally for awhile then her episodes of changing to god became more pronounced she stomped and gestured as she strode back and forth putting crosses on doors and demanding the departure of the evil which she claimed to see she kicked and banged at the door of popes son and fearful that by breaking in melissa would frighten him pope unfastened the door to permit entry loudly exhorting satan to leave the premises melissa anointed popes son with oil placing some of the oil in the childs mouth she subsequently repeated the process with popes daughter when dressed popes children left the house expeditiously lingering only long enough to embrace their mother pope 38 md app at 531

during a lucid period melissa prepared to go to church she got a tub of water to bathe the baby what next occurred is graphically described in the opinion of the court of special appealsthen from her suddenly changed voice and appearance pope knew melissa had changed again to god calling out that satan had hidden in the body of her son melissa began to verbally exorcise that spirit and physically abuse the child by punching and poking him repeatedly about the stomach chest and privates after she undressed the child that which ensued was hardly describable in her religious frenzy of apparent exorcism melissa poked the childs vitals and beat the child about the head she reached her fingers down its throat wiping mucus and blood on diapers at hand and even lifted the child by inserting her hands in its mouth and shook him like a rag idcontinuing to talk and stomp melissa began to squeeze the baby then holding the child by the neck with one hand she took him into the bathroom acting like she did not know that pope was present when she first started this abuse melissa in her god voice called pope and asked her didnt i give you eyes to see pope noticed that melissas finger nails were real long and she said to melissa how do you handle a baby with such long nails but pope did nothing she admitted that she knew at some point that melissa was hurting the baby and was fearful amazed and shocked at the unbelievable and horrible thing that was happening

melissas frenzy diminished angela came to the house to take them to church pope did not tell angela what happened — i could not get it out angela asked her what was wrong and pope said its melissa the baby she locked the door at angelas direction so angelas children would stay in the yard with popes children angela wrapped the child in a towel raised him over her head and prayed

pope melissa and angela left with the child to go to church at melissas request they stopped by her grandfathers house arriving about 200 pm pope told him the child was dead but he did not believe her because all three were acting so strangely he refused to take or look at the baby the three women with the child went to bel pre health center picked up another member of the christian tabernacle congregation telling her that god has a job for you to do and proceeded to the church en route they passed several hospitals police stations and rescue squads at the church the child was given to or taken by the reverend leon hart who handed him to mother dorothy king for her prayers she discovered that the babys body was cool and sent for ambulance assistance police and rescue personnel arrived and determined that the child was dead there was expert medical testimony that the child had died sometime during the period of fifteen minutes to several hours after it was injured the medical expert expressed no opinion as to whether the child could have been successfully treated if the injury had been reported sooner

the police questioned melissa in popes presence pope did not contradict melissas denial of abusing the child in fact pope in response to inquiry by the police said that the baby did not fall and told them that she had not seen melissa strike the baby she explained this untruth in subsequent statements to the police it was her body in the flesh but it wasnt her because it was something else

pope melissa and angela attended the evening service at the church melissa reverted to god during the service and reverend hart restrained her and attempted to convince her that she was not jesus christ melissa refused to go to her grandfathers home and returned home with pope the next morning pope was again interviewed at the police station and wrote a full explanation of what had happened she later made an oral statement which was recordedithe crime of child abusethe statutethe general assembly first evidenced its concern with the mistreatment of children fifteen years ago when it added § 11a to art 27 of the maryland code5 later codified as § 35a of that article6 declaring an assault on a child to be a felony the statute in its entirety providedany parent adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody of a minor child under the age of fourteen years who maliciously beats strikes or otherwise mistreats such minor child to such degree as to require medical treatment for such child shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be sentenced to not more than fifteen years in the penitentiarythe legislatures increasing interest in child abuse is reflected in the amendment from time to time of the seminal statute7 the result is a comprehensive scheme to fulfill the legislative intent and purpose expressed in 19738 as the protection of children who have been the subject of abuse by mandating the reporting of suspected abuse by extending immunity to those who report in good faith by requiring prompt investigations of such reports and by causing immediate cooperative efforts by the responsible agencies on behalf of such children md code 1957 1976 repl vol art 27 § 35a all of these were of course imposed over the felonious crime of child abuse see subsections a through jthe nature of child abuseas we have seen when the crime was first created by the general assembly it comprised the malicious beating striking or otherwise mistreating a child to such degree as to require medical treatment we pointed out in state v fabritz 276 md 416 348 a2d 275 1975 cert denied 425 us 942 1976 that by the terms of the enactment it did not reach acts not constituting in one form or another an assault on a child id at 423 acts 1973 ch 835 repealed the maliciously beats strikes or otherwise mistreats test of child abuse and substituted in its place a new and different measure of the offense the 1973 amendment added a definition subsection to § 35a subsection b 7 provided that whenever abuse was used in § 35a it shall mean any physical injury or injuries sustained by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of malicious act or acts acts 1974 ch 554 designated this meaning as item a of ¶ 7 and expanded the definition of child abuse by adding item b so as to include in the offense any sexual abuse of a child whether physical injuries are sustained or not the amendment also added ¶ 8 defining sexual abuse to mean any act or acts involving sexual molestation or exploitation including but not limited to incest rape carnal knowledge sodomy or unnatural or perverted sexual practices on a child acts 1977 ch 290 substituted or sexual offense in any degree for carnal knowledge in ¶ 89

we considered the scope of item a subsection b7 in fabritz applying the rules of statutory construction 276 md at 421423 we thought it evident that the legislature plainly intended to broaden the area of proscribed conduct punishable in child abuse cases id at 423424 we saidits use in the amended version of § 35a of the comprehensive phraseology who causes abuse to a minor child coupled with its broad twopronged definition of the term abuse supports the view that the legislature by repealing the narrow measure of criminality in child abuse cases then provided in § 35a and redefining the offense undertook to effect a significant change of substance in the scope of the statutes prohibitions in making it an offense for a person having custody of a minor child to cause the child to suffer a physical injury the legislature did not require that the injury result from a physical assault upon the child or from any physical force initially applied by the accused individual it provided instead in a more encompassing manner that the offense was committed if physical injury to the child resulted either from a course of conduct constituting cruel or inhumane treatment or by malicious act or acts id at 424we found that the failure of the mother to seek or obtain any medical assistance for her child although the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent caused the child to sustain bodily injury additional to and beyond that inflicted upon the child by reason of the original assault by another the act of omission by the mother constituted a cause of the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to the childs death and that in these circumstances the mothers treatment of the child was cruel or inhumane within the meaning of the statute and as those terms are commonly understood id at 425426 we therefore vacated the judgment of the court of special appeals which in fabritz v state 24 md app 708 332 a2d 324 1975 had reversed the judgment of the trial court entered upon the conviction of the mother of child abuse10responsibility for abuse of a childin fabritz we went no farther than to determine that the legislature intended that the cause of an injury may include an act of omission so as to constitute cruel or inhumane treatment in that case the failure of the mother to seek or obtain medical assistance for her child who had been abused by another fabritz did not go to the class of persons to whom the statutory proscription applies as the accused there was a parent the victims mother expressly designated in the statute
we have seen that the statute as originally enacted concerned any parent adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody of a minor child acts 1963 ch 743 this has been once amended to bring within the ambit of the statute any person who has responsibility for the supervision of a minor child acts 1966 ch 221 thus since 1 june 1966

      any parent adoptive parent or other person who has the       permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for       the supervision of a minor child under the age of eighteen       years11 who causes abuse to such minor child shall be       guilty of a felony § 35aa

persons subject to the statute are designated in those terms also in subsection b 7 a defining abuse and in subsection b8 defining sexual abuse

in bowers v state 283 md 115 389 a2d 341 1978 we discussed the class of persons to whom § 35a applies in rejecting the contention that the statute was vague and therefore constitutionally defective for the reason that it failed to define adequately that class bowers urged that the statute was too indefinite to inform a person who is not a parent or adoptive parent of a child whether he comes within the ambit of the statute he argued that no one in such position is capable of ascertaining whether the statute is aimed only at persons who have been awarded custody by judicial decree or includes also those who may simply be caring for a child in place of the parent we were of the view that the general assembly intended that the statute apply to persons who stand in loco parentis to a child we said had the legislature wished to narrow application of the child abuse law to those who had been awarded custody or control by court order it could readily have done so in explicit language to that end id at 130 we observed that bowers own testimony amply established that he had assumed the care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of his stepdaughter and thus stood in loco parentis with respect to her id

bowers challenge centered on the temporary care or custody provision of the statute it does not follow from our holding that permanent or temporary care or custody is synonymous with responsibility for the supervision of such was clearly not the legislative intent because as we have seen the latter provision was added by amendment three years after the former had been written into the law there would have been no need to do so had the legislature deemed the two provisions to have the same meaning

the child abuse statute speaks in terms of a person who has responsibility for the supervision of a minor child it does not prescribe how such responsibility attaches or what responsibility and supervision encompass a doubt or ambiguity exists as to the exact reach of the statutes provision with respect to has responsibility for the supervision of justifying application of the principle that permits courts in such circumstances to ascertain and give effect to the real intention of the legislature see fabritz at 423 clerk v chesapeake beach park 251 md 657 663664 248 a2d 479 1968 domain v bosley 242 md 1 7 217 a2d 555 1966 bowers equates permanent or temporary care or custody with in loco parentis but responsibility for the supervision of is not bound by certain of the strictures required for one to stand in place of or instead of the parent a person in loco parentis is charged factitiously with a parents rights duties and responsibilities blacks law dictionary 4th ed 1951 a person in loco parentis to a child is one who means to put himself in the situation of the lawful father or mother of the child with reference to the fathers or mothers office and duty of making provision for the child or as defined by sir wm grant master of the rolls a person in loco parentis is one assuming the parental character and discharging parental duties weatherby v dixon 19 ves 412 there must be some indication in some form of an intention to establish it it is a question of intention von der horst v von der horst 88 md 127 130131 41 a 124 1898the term in loco parentis according to its generally accepted common law meaning refers to a person who has put himself in the situation of a lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relation without going through the formalities necessary to legal adoption it embodies the two ideas of assuming the parental status and discharging the parental duties niewiadomski v united states 159 f2d 683 686 6th cir cert denied 331 us 850 1947this relationship involves more than a duty to aid and assist more than a feeling of kindness affection or generosity it arises only when one is willing to assume all the obligations and to receive all the benefits associated with one standing as a natural parent to a child fuller v fuller 247 a2d 767 dc 1968 appeal denied 418 f2d 1189 1969a person may have the responsibility for the supervision of a minor child in the contemplation of § 35a although not standing in loco parentis to that child responsibility in its common and generally accepted meaning denotes accountability and supervision emphasizes broad authority to oversee with the powers of direction and decision see american heritage dictionary of the english language 1969 websters third new international dictionary 1968 as in the case of care or custody of a minor child under the child abuse law a judicial decree is not necessary to obtain responsibility for the supervision of a minor child under that statute had the legislature wished to narrow application of that law to those who had been charged with responsibility for the supervision of a child by court order it could readily have done so in explicit language to that end see bowers 283 md at 130 absent a court order or award by some appropriate proceeding pursuant to statutory authority we think it to be selfevident that responsibility for supervision of a minor child may be obtained only upon the mutual consent expressed or implied by the one legally charged with the care of the child and by the one assuming the responsibility in other words a parent may not impose responsibility for the supervision of his or her minor child on a third person unless that person accepts the responsibility and a third person may not assume such responsibility unless the parent grants it so it is that a baby sitter temporarily has responsibility for the supervision of a child the parents grant the responsibility for the period they are not at home and the sitter accepts it and it is by mutual consent that a school teacher has responsibility for the supervision of children in connection with his academic duties on the other hand once responsibility for the supervision of a minor child has been placed in a third person it may be terminated unilaterally by a parent by resuming responsibility expressly or by conduct the consent of the third party in such circumstances is not required he may not prevent return of responsibility to the parent but of course the third person in whom responsibility has been placed is not free to relinquish that responsibility without the knowledge of the parent for example a sitter may not simply walk away in the absence of the parents and leave the children to their own devices

under the present state of our law a person has no legal obligation to care for or look after the welfare of a stranger adult or childgenerally one has no legal duty to aid another person in peril even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvenience to himself a moral duty to take affirmative action is not enough to impose a legal duty to do so w lafave  a scott criminal law 183 1972see clark  marshall a treatise on the law of crimes § 1002 7th ed 1967 the legal position is that the need of one and the opportunity of another to be of assistance are not alone sufficient to give rise to a legal duty to take positive action r perkins criminal law 594595 2d ed 1969 ordinarily a person may stand by with impunity and watch another being murdered raped robbed assaulted or otherwise unlawfully harmed he need not shout a warning to a blind man headed for a precipice or to an absentminded one walking into a gunpowder room with a lighted candle in hand he need not pull a neighbors baby out of a pool of water or rescue an unconscious person stretched across the railroad tracks though the baby is drowning or the whistle of an approaching train is heard in the distance lafave  scott at 183 the general assembly has enacted two good samaritan statutes which afford protection to one who assists another in certain circumstances those statutes however impose no requirement that assistance be rendered12

in the face of this status of the law we cannot reasonably conclude that the legislature in bringing a person responsible for the supervision of a child within the ambit of the child abuse law intended that such responsibility attach without the consent criteria we have set out were it otherwise the consequences would go far beyond the legislative intent for example a person taking a lost child into his home to attempt to find its parents could be said to be responsible for that childs supervision or a person who allows his neighbors children to play in his yard keeping a watchful eye on their activities to prevent them from falling into harm could be held responsible for the childrens supervision or a person performing functions of a maternal nature from concern for the welfare comfort or health of a child or protecting it from danger because of a sense of moral obligation may come within the reach of the act in none of these situations would there be an intent to grant or assume the responsibility contemplated by the child abuse statute and it would be incongruous indeed to subject such persons to possible criminal prosecutionthe sufficiency of the evidencethe trial court found pope guilty of the crime of child abuse as a principal in the first degree and alternatively as a principal in the second degree a principal in the first degree is the one who actually commits a crime either by his own hand or by an inanimate agency or by an innocent human agent a principal in the second degree is one who is actually or constructively present when a felony is committed and who aids or abets in its commission see camphor v state 233 md 203 205 196 a2d 75 1963 thornton v state 232 md 542 544 194 a2d 617 1963 veney v state 225 md 237 238 170 a2d 171 1961 agresti v state 2 md app 278 280 234 a2d 284 1967 4 w blackstone commentaries 34 clark  marshall a treatise on the law of crimes §§ 801802 7th ed 1967 l hochheimer crimes and criminal procedure §§ 3132 1st ed 1897 r perkins criminal law 656 and 658 2d ed 196913

in convicting pope the trial court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that under the doctrine of fabritz  she is a principal in the first degree and is guilty of child abuse it further held however if this interpretation of fabritz is in error then pope is guilty as a principal in the second degree on direct appeal the court of special appeals applied maryland rule 1086 and set aside the judgment the rule provides that when a criminal case is tried without the intervention of a jury the court of special appeals shall review both the law and the evidence but the judgment of the trial court will not be set aside on the evidence unless clearly erroneous and due regard will be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses the appellate courts function is merely to decide whether there was sufficient evidence or proper inferences from the evidence from which the trier of fact could properly draw the conclusion of the accuseds guilt beyond a reasonable doubt brooks v state 277 md 155 161162 353 a2d 217 1976 and cases therein cited the trial court as the trier of facts is not only the judge of the witnesss credibility but is also the judge of the weight to be attached to the evidence id the court of special appeals determined that the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain the conviction of pope either as a principal in the first degree or a principal in the second degree the evidence was deficient with regard to her being a principal in the first degree in that it was not sufficient for the trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she was within the class of persons subject to the prohibitions of the child abuse statute thus the teaching of fabritz regarding causing abuse was in no event applicable pope v state 38 md app at 538 it was deficient with regard to her being a principal in the second degree because despite her presence during the commission of the felony it was not sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that she aided and abetted the actual perpetrator therefore the judgment of the trial court on the evidence was clearly erroneous and had to be set aside id at 539541

as did the court of special appeals we find evidentiary insufficiency with respect to the conviction of pope of child abuse both as a principal in the first degree and as a principal in the second degree so that the judgment of the trial court on the evidence was clearly erroneous we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of special appeals we explain why we find that the evidence was legally insufficientprincipal in the first degreeas we have indicated a person may be convicted of the felony of child abuse created by § 35a as a principal in the first degree upon evidence legally sufficient to establish that the person

      1 was

      a the parent of or

      b the adoptive parent of or
      c in loco parentis to or

      d responsible for the supervision of
a minor child under the age of eighteen years and

      2 caused by being in some manner accountable for by act of commission or omission abuse to the child in the form of

      a physical injury or injuries sustained by the child as the result of

      i cruel or inhumane treatment or

      ii malicious act or acts by such person or

      b any act or acts by such person involving sexual molestation or exploitation whether or not physical injuries were sustained

under the teaching of fabritz popes lack of any attempt to prevent the numerous acts of abuse committed by the mother over a relatively protracted period and her failure to seek medical assistance for the child although the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent could constitute a cause for the further progression and worsening of the injuries which led to the childs death in such circumstances popes omissions constituted in themselves cruel and inhumane treatment within the meaning of the statute see fabritz 276 md at 425426 it follows that pope would be guilty of child abuse if her status brought her within the class of persons specified by the statute it being clear that she was neither the childs parent nor adoptive parent and there being no evidence sufficient to support a finding that she had the permanent or temporary care or custody of the child as that status was construed in bowers v state supra so as to be in loco parentis to the child the sole question is whether she had responsibility for the supervision of the child in the circumstances if she had such responsibility the evidence was legally sufficient to find her guilty of child abuse as a principal in the first degree

the state would have us translate compassion and concern acts of kindness and care performance of maternal functions and general help and aid with respect to the child into responsibility for the supervision of the child the crux of its argument is that although pope was not under any obligation to assume responsibility for the supervision of the child at the outset once she undertook to house feed and care for the mother and child she did accept the responsibility and came within the coverage of the statute but the mother was always present14 pope had no right to usurp the role of the mother even to the extent of responsibility for the childs supervision we are in full accord with the view of the court of special appeals that it could not in good conscience hold that a person who has taken in a parent and child is given the responsibility for the childs supervision and protection even while the child is in the very arms of its mother pope 38 md app at 538 it would be most incongruous that acts of hospitality and kindness made out of common decency and prompted by sincere concern for the wellbeing of a mother and her child subjected the good samaritan to criminal prosecution for abusing the very child he sought to look after and it would be especially ironic were such criminal prosecution to be predicated upon an obligation to take affirmative action with regard to abuse of the child by its mother when such obligation arises solely from those acts of hospitality and kindness

the evidence does not show why pope did not intervene when the mother abused the child or why she did not at least timely seek medical assistance when it was obvious that the child was seriously injured whether her lack of action was from fear or religious fervor or some other reason is not clearly indicated as the court of special appeals correctly stated popes testimony sought to indicate that her passivity was motivated by fear but other evidence belied that inference pope 38 md app at 532 the court observed that when popes sister arrived shortly after the acts of abuse and the mothers frenzy had diminished pope did not tell her sister what had occurred although she claimed that she tried to but could not do so but popes conduct during and after the acts of abuse must be evaluated with regard for the rule that although she may have had a strong moral obligation to help the child she was under no legal obligation to do so unless she then had responsibility for the supervision of the child as contemplated by the child abuse statute she may not be punished as a felon under our system of justice for failing to fulfill a moral obligation and the short of it is that she was under no legal obligation in the circumstances the mothers acquiescence in popes conduct was not a grant of responsibility to pope for the supervision of the child nor was popes conduct an acceptance of such responsibility popes concern for the child did not convert to legal responsibility nor parental prerogatives pope 38 md app at 538 we hold that the evidence was not sufficient in law to prove that pope fell within that class of persons to whom the child abuse statute applies thus it is that the judgment of the trial court that she was a principal in the first degree in the commission of the crime of child abuse was clearly erroneous and must be set aside

the mental or emotional state of the mother whereby at times she held herself out as god does not change the result we see no basis in the statute for an interpretation that a person has responsibility for the supervision of a child if that person believes or may have reason to believe that a parent is not capable of caring for the child there is no right to make such a subjective judgment in order to divest parents of their rights and obligations with respect to their minor children and therefore no obligation to do so15principal in the second degreepope was actually present when the felony was committed but we have determined she was not a perpetrating actor she would be a principal in the second degree if she aided or abetted in the commission of the crime the principal in the second degree differs from the principal in the first degree in that he does not do the deed himself or through an innocent agent but in some way participates in the commission of the felony by aiding commanding counseling or encouraging the actual perpetrator16 r perkins criminal law 658659 2d ed 1969 clark  marshall a treatise on the law of crimes § 802 7th ed 1967 unless he contributed actual aid it is necessary that his approval should be manifested by some word or act in such a way that it operated on the mind of the perpetrator even the secret acquiescence or approval of the bystander is not sufficient to taint him with the guilt of the crime counsel command or encouragement may be in the form of words or gestures such a purpose may be manifested by acts words signs motions or any conduct which unmistakably evinces a design to encourage incite or approve of the crime promises or threats are very effective for this purpose but much less will meet the legal requirement as where a bystander merely emboldened the perpetrator to kill the deceased one may also encourage a crime by merely standing by for the purpose of giving aid to the perpetrator if necessary provided the latter is aware of this purpose guilt or innocence of the abettor  is not determined by the quantum of his advice or encouragement if it is rendered to induce another to commit the crime and actually has this effect no more is required perkins at 659 to be guilty as a principal in the second degree a criminal intent is necessary clark  marshall § 802 aid or encouragement to another who is actually perpetrating a felony will not make the aider or encourager guilty of the crime if it is rendered without mens rea it is without mens rea if the giver does not know or have reason to know of the criminal intention of the other in general it is the abettors state of mind rather than the state of mind of the perpetrator which determines the abettors guilt or innocence intention includes not only the purpose in mind but also such results as are known to be substantially certain to follow perkins at 662663

when the evidence here is viewed in the light of these criteria it is patent that it was not legally sufficient to prove that pope was a principal in the second degree she neither actually aided the mother in the acts of abuse nor did she counsel command or encourage her the court of special appeals pointed out the facts relied on by the trial court — that the events took place in popes home that pope responded to the commands of the mother namely that she looked when told to look and came when called that she voluntarily opened the door to her sons room so melissa could reach him and that she failed to interfere or question the mothers activity even when the mother appeared rational — were simply not enough to meet the test pope 38 md app at 538541

the state concludes the argument in its briefas is obvious from the evidence presented in this case pope witnessed a terrible event she stood by while melissa norris killed her threemonth old son popes conduct during the beating  should be held to be culpablethe evidence certainly showed that pope witnessed a terrible event and that she stood by while the mother killed the child but the culpability for her conduct during the abuse of the child must be determined strictly within the law or else the basic tenets of our system of justice are prostituted there is an understandable feeling of outrage at what occurred intensified by the fact that the mother who actually beat the child to death was held to be not responsible for her criminal acts but it is the law not indignation which governs the law requires that popes conviction of the felony of child abuse be set aside as clearly erroneous due to evidentiary insufficiencyiithe crime of misprision of felonyas we have indicated a person may be convicted of a felony upon proof establishing that he committed the offense as a perpetrating actor principal in the first degree or that being actually or constructively present he did not himself commit the offense but aided and abetted in the commission of it principal in the second degree if he be present said sir matthew hale and not aiding or abetting to the felony he is neither principal nor accessory if a and b be fighting and c a man of full age comes by chance and is a looker on only and assists neither he is not guilty of murder or homicide as principal in the second degree but is a misprision for which he shall be fined unless he use means to apprehend the felon17 in the case before us both the trial court and the court of special appeals believed that the misdemeanor of misprision of felony exists in maryland today the court of special appeals expressly held that misprision of felony was a crime at common law given life in maryland by art 5 of the declaration of rights18 it rejected the contention that the crime has become obsolete or abandoned by disuse as without merit pope 38 md app at 52719
there is no maryland legislative enactment which is declarative of the common law crime of misprision of felony or which may be deemed to have created a comparable offense therefore if misprision of felony is a crime in this state it is only because it was part of the common law of england to which the inhabitants of maryland were constitutionally entitled and has survived to the present time

we assume arguendo that misprision of felony was a crime under the common law of england and that it became the law of this state pursuant to art 5 of the declaration of rights the question is whether it is to be deemed an indictable offense in maryland today in determining the question we look first to what misprision of felony is according to blackstone the crime at common law consisted merely in the concealment of a felony which a man knows but never assented to for if he assented this makes him either principal or accessory 4 w blackstone commentaries 121 see clark  marshall a treatise on the law of crimes § 814 7th ed 1967 r perkins criminal law 512 2d ed 1969 l hochheimer crimes and criminal procedure § 39 1st ed 1897there is reason to believe that misprision of felony as defined by blackstone is merely one phase of the system of communal responsibility for the apprehension of criminals which received its original impetus from william i under pressure of the need to protect the invading normans in hostile country and which endured up to the seventeenth century in england in order to secure vigilant prosecution of criminal conduct the vill or hundred in which such conduct occurred was subject to fine as was the tithing to which the criminal belonged and every person who knew of the felony and failed to make report thereof was subject to punishment for misprision of felony compulsory membership in the tithing group the obligation to pursue criminals when the hue and cry was raised broad powers of private arrest and the periodic visitations of the general eyre for the purpose of penalizing laxity in regard to crime are all suggestive of the administrative background against which misprision of felony developed with the appearance of specialized and paid law enforcement officers such as constables and justices of the peace in the seventeenth century there was a movement away from strict communal responsibility and a growing tendency to rely on professional police 8 u chi l rev 338 340341 1941 footnotes omittedglazebrook misprision of felony — shadow or phantom 8 am j of legal history 189 and 283 1964 cites eminent authority that in england the offense fell into desuetude id at 300 according to glazebrook there was no reported decision during the four hundred years since the offence first crept into a book and no book before j chitty a practical treatise on the criminal law 2d ed london 1826 contained a precedent of an indictment for misprision of felony id in any event if the crime had died it was resurrected by the house of lords in hl sykes v director of public prosecution 1961 3 all er 33 lord denning stated that it is plain that there is and always has been an offence of misprision of felony and that it is not obsolete20id at 40 sykes acknowledged only two necessary elements knowledge and concealment misprision requires nothing active the failure or refusal to disclose the felony is enough id at 41 this followed the blackstone definition

the revival in england of the crime of misprision of felony was not generally welcomed resistance to the crime culminated in the seventh report of the criminal law revision committee which recommended the abolition of the crime of misprision by eliminating all distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors misprision was replaced in the report by a new crime of withholding information with regard to certain offenses for a consideration other than restitution an agreement not to prosecute a felon in consideration of the return or compensation for goods stolen constitutes the common law offense of compounding a felony the criminal law act of 1967 c 58 §§ 1 and 5 adopted these two recommendations and has been interpreted as eliminating the crime of misprision of felony in england comment misprision of felony a reappraisal 23 emory lj 1095 11001101 1974 see w wade and b lilliwhite annual survey of commonwealth law 179 1965 10 halsburys law of england ¶ 1201 supp 1978

maryland has been in line with the practically universal view of the other states we find no case prior to the case sub judice in which a conviction of misprision of felony has reached an appellate court of this state and insofar as can be ascertained from appellate dockets there is only one other state v shaw 282 md 231 383 a2d 1104 1978 see note 19 supra in which the crime was charged it is true as observed by the trial court in the case at hand that a dearth of appellate cases is not proof that the crime is not charged at trial level but in view of the numerous appeals in criminal causes spawned by present day procedures and rights afforded an accused it is remarkable indeed that if convictions upon charge of the crime have occurred the present case was the first in which an appeal was filed we think that it is a fair inference that the crime has been seldom charged and if charged has resulted in very few if any convictions furthermore we observe that misprision of felony was not proposed as an offense by marylands commission on criminal law23

as it seems that misprision of felony has been virtually unused in maryland since the revolution gave birth to the united states our inquiry turns to the effect of nonuse of a common law crime early on in state v buchanan 5 h  j 317 1821 buchanan j for the court announced that no part of the common law of england to which the inhabitants of maryland were constitutionally entitled should be excluded merely because it had not been introduced and used in the courts here id at 358 see mcgraw v state 234 md 273 275276 199 a2d 229 cert denied 379 us 862 1964 judge buchanan explainedunlike a positive or statute law the occasion or necessity for which may long since have passed away if there has been no necessity before for instituting a prosecution for conspiracy no argument can be drawn from the nonuser for resting on principles which cannot become obsolete it has always potentially existed to be applied as occasion should arise if there had never been in maryland since the original settlement of the colony by our ancestors a prosecution for murder arson assault and battery libel with many other common law offenses and consequently no judicial adoption of either of these branches of the common law could it therefore be contended that there was now no law in the state for the punishment of such offenses 5 h  j at 358this principle was affirmed by us implicitly at least in harris v jones 281 md 560 380 a2d 611 1977 when we recognized for the first time in maryland the common law tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress a tort previously unacknowledged or arguably abandoned by nonuse pope 38 md app at 527 it does not follow however that because a common law crime does not become obsolete from mere nonuse that it will always be viable the opinion of the court in buchanan asserted that the provision in art 5 of the declaration of rights regarding entitlement to the common law of england without any restrictive words being used had reference to the common law in mass as it existed here either potentially or practically and as it prevailed in england at the time except such portions of it as are inconsistent with the spirit of that instrument and the nature of our new political institutions 5 h  j at 358 emphasis added we have repeated that statement on a number of occasions dashiell v attorney general 5 h  j 392 401 1822 state v bank of maryland 6 g  j 205 226 1834 lickle v boone 187 md 579 582 51 a2d 162 1947 mcgraw v state supra 234 md at 275276 gladden v state 273 md 383 389 330 a2d 176 1974 we put it this way in denison v denison 35 md 361 378 1872

      it is true the common law of england has been adopted by the       people of this state but only so far as it could be made to fit       and adjust itself to our local circumstances and peculiar       institutions

what this means is that the common law is subject to change this is clearly apparent from its derivation and its very naturethe common law of england is derived from immemorial usage and custom originating from acts of parliament not recorded or which are lost or have been destroyed it is a system of jurisprudence founded on the immutable principles of justice and denominated by the great luminary of the law of england the perfection of reason the evidence of it are treatises of the sages of the law the judicial records and adjudications of the courts of justice of england buchanan 5 h  j at 365 opinion of chase cjit may be changed by legislative act as art 5 of the declaration of rights expressly provides see state v canova 278 md 483 486 365 a2d 988 1976 lutz v state 167 md 12 15 172 a 354 1934 harrison v state 22 md 468 487488 1864 coomes v clements 4 h  j 480 481 it may also be changed by judicial decision chase cj in his opinion in buchanan observed whether particular parts of the common law are applicable to our local circumstances and situation and our general code of laws and jurisprudence is a question that comes within the province of the courts of justice and is to be decided by them 5 h  j at 365366 he gave this rationale

      the common law like our acts of assembly are subject to the       control and modification of the legislature and may be       abrogated or changed as the general assembly may think most       conducive to the general welfare so that no great       inconvenience if any can result from the power being       deposited with the judiciary to decide what the common law       is and its applicability to the circumstances of the state id       at 36624

we said in gilbert v findlay college 195 md 508 513 74 a2d 36 1950 that this interpretation has been continuously adopted in this state and was reaffirmed in the case of price v hitaffer 164 md 505 510 165 a 470 1933 we asserted in assn of taxi oprs v yellow cab co 198 md 181 204 82 a2d 106 1951 we have frequently held that it is our duty to determine the common law as it exists in this state25 the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude the exercise of this duty we declared in white v king 244 md 348 354 223 a2d 763 1966 the doctrine of stare decisis important as it is is not to be construed as preventing us from changing a rule of law if we are convinced that the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life accord hearst corp v st dept of a  t 269 md 625 643644 308 a2d 679 1973

parts of the common law have been found by judicial mandate to be inapplicable or obsolete in other states for example flores v flores 84 nm 601 506 p2d 345 347 nm app cert denied 84 nm 592 506 p2d 336 1973 found that liability free intentional injury to ones spouse does not reflect the circumstances in new mexico swartz v united states steel 293 ala 493 304 so2d 881 885 1974 held that the common law rule that a wife has no cause of action for loss of her consortium is inconsistent with the institutions of alabama morganthaler v first atlantic national bank 80 so2d 446 fla 1955 rejected the english rule that a legatee may elect to receive cash when a testator directs his executor to purchase an annuity because it dethrones a principle that the intent of the testator controls which is sacred to our way of life and fundamental in our concepts of right and justice id at 452

in exercising our duty to determine whether a common law crime presently exists in this state mere nonuse is not sufficient as we have indicated to conclude that the offense has become obsolete but nonuse we believe is not without significance when an offense has lain virtually dormant for over two hundred years it is difficult to argue that the preservation of society and the maintenance of law and order demand recognition of it see glazebrook how long then is the arm of the law to be 25 mod l rev 301 307311 1962 perkins points outthe notion that misprision is needed to prevent one who knows about anothers felony from intentionally misleading investigating officers is unfounded if when being questioned by officers who are investigating a felony one who knows the facts intentionally misleads the officers by false statements and thereby covers up for the felon he thereby makes himself an accessory to that felony after the fact if he impedes the investigation by falsely saying he does not know about it or by refusing to talk he should be held to be guilty of obstructing justice there is a wide difference between a mere failure to hunt up an officer and tell about a felony on the one hand and a refusal to cooperate with an investigating officer on the other r perkins criminal law 517 2d ed 1969even more relevant however to a consideration of whether a common law crime is applicable as compatible with our local circumstances and situation and our general codes of law and jurisprudence is the nature of the crime the reason for the failure of common law misprision of felony to survive in the united states was well expressed by chief justice marshall over a hundred and fifty years ago in marbury v brooks 20 us 7 wheat 556 575576 1822 and thereafter noted by many commentators text book authors and other authoritiesit may be the duty of a citizen to accuse every offender and to proclaim every offence which comes to his knowledge but the law which would punish him in every case for not performing this duty is too harsh for manin england according to glazebrook in his critical consideration of sykes v director of public prosecutions supra in 25 mod l rev 301 the criminal law commissioners in their fifth report in 1840 repeated and elaborated this criticism and observedthe necessity of making such disclosures extends perhaps with greater force to the knowledge of a meditated crime the perpetration of which may by means of such disclosure be prevented than it does to the knowledge of one already committed id at 301 citing n 3 parl pap 1840 xx p 32 quoted williams the criminal law the general part 2nd ed london 1961 p 423glazebrook opined that for more than a century misprision of felony has been an embarrassment to common lawyers and feared that the decisions and speeches in the house of lords in sykes afford only increased cause for this embarrassment id at 301 the court of special appeals relied on sykes in holding that misprision of felony as sykes found it existed at common law was currently an indictable crime in maryland26 glazebrook ably refuted sykes and we borrow extensively from him in the discussion which follows

misprision of felony at common law is an impractically wide crime a longstanding criticism which remains unanswered in sykes it has an undesirable and indiscriminating widththe real harshness lies in the fact that the duty to disclose arises when a person acquires knowledge of an offence and this he may do quite involuntarily a says to b did you know that x stole a book from the library last week adding appropriate circumstantial details or x says to b i stole some money yesterday will you help me to repay it b is a friend of x he wished to know nothing of xs misdeeds and yet he is to be a criminal if he does not betray him it is furthermore particularly difficult to defend a law which indiscriminately adds to the injuries of the victim of a crime the penalties of the criminal law should he or she wish to forgive and forget 25 mod l rev at 311misprision differs from almost all other common law offenses of omissionthe duty to act arises not because of the willing assumption of responsibility the occupation of an office or the ownership of property but because of the mere possession of certain knowledge — knowledge possessed accidentally and undesired — knowledge which may indeed have been acquired through some malevolent person idglazebrook observes that although there may be crimes where the protection of the public requires that each offender be brought to justice however reluctant his victims his friends or those who have him in their care may be to do so  the line which separates them from all other offences is not the line which separates felonies from misdemeanors id at 312 this is particularly true with respect to maryland where the distinction between felony and misdemeanor is a hodgepodge following neither rhyme nor reason

under sykes no active step need be taken to conceal the felony it is only thus that it remains quite distinct from the crime of accessory after the fact and the concealment need bring no benefit to the accused27 but three fundamental questions remained when does the duty to reveal a felony arise how is that duty discharged and does a relationship with the felon prevent the duty arising28

it seems that the duty arises when a man knows of the commission of a felony when then can a man be said to know and what is it that he must know lord goddard held that there must be disclosure when the knowledge a man has is so definite that it ought to be disclosed a man is neither bound nor would he be wise to disclose rumours or mere

gossip but if facts are within his knowledge that would materially assist in the detection and arrest of a felon he must disclose them as it is a duty he owes to the state sykes at 46 lord goddard left the matter to the jury as a question of fact glazebrook suggests that unless the jury is to be entirely uncontrolled it has to be told how precise and certain the accuseds knowledge must have been before he can be convicted 25 mod l rev at 313 is the duty to be confined to felonies committed in the presence of the accused and if not is hearsay sufficient should the felons own admission standing alone be enough knowledge of the commission of a crime is an ingredient of the offenses of accessory after the fact and receiving stolen goods but unlike misprision they require a positive act it is reasonable in such circumstance to require a person who has reason to believe something is wrong to inquire further before embarking on some course of conduct and to hold that he fails to do so at his peril if this rule is applied to misprision two duties are imposed a duty to disclose knowledge of a felony and a duty also to make inquiries to resolve a suspicion concerning the commission of a felony id to paraphrase glazebrook must the inhabitants of maryland become detectives as well as informers

sykes fails to provide a working rule for what the accused must know there was a direct conflict between lord denning and lord morton into which their brethren did not enter discussing knowledge lord denning saidthe accused man must know that a felony has been committed by someone else his knowledge must be proved in the way in which the prosecution have been accustomed in other crimes when knowledge is an ingredient such as receiving accessory after the fact compounding a felony and so forth that is to say there must be evidence that a reasonable man in his place with such facts and information before him as the accused had would have known that a felony had been committed from such evidence the jury may infer that the accused man himself had knowledge of it he need not know the difference between felony and misdemeanour — many a lawyer has to look in the books for the purpose  sykes at 41glazebrook comments this leaves it largely a matter of chance whether misprision is committed or not 25 mod l rev at 314 that is on the one hand it must have been a felony of which the accused knew but on the other hand he need not know whether the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor according to lord denning it would be enough that the accused knew that a serious offense had been committed if it turns out to be a felony — a lawyer on turning up the books sees it is a felonythis requirement that it must be a serious offence disposes of many of the supposed absurdities such 348348 as boys stealing apples which many laymen would rank as a misdemeanour and no one would think he was bound to report to the police it means that misprision comprehends an offence which is of so serious a character that an ordinary lawabiding citizen would realise he ought to report it to the police sykes at 42this rationale was based on the view that what distinguishes a felony from a misdemeanor is that a felony is a serious offense an offence of an aggravated complexion felonies are the serious offences misdemeanours are the less serious id this introduced a limitation lord morton was not willing to accept id at 4647 in any event the limitation added the further uncertainty of a trier of facts view of the gravity of the crime to be reported 25 mod l rev at 314 and we observe the foundation for the limitation is weak indeed when considered in light of the categories of felonies and misdemeanors adopted in this state sykes avoids what account is to be taken of excuses offered by an apparent felon for example in cases of larceny may the citizen be satisfied by any claim of right that is made or must it be weighed and where suspicion remains this communicated to the police  the sykes recognition of misprision means therefore the imposition not of a duty to disclose knowledge of the commission of a felony but of a duty to disclose suspicions of the commission of a felony id at 314315 there are no criteria for determining which suspicions are to give rise to a duty and so to criminal liability

when the duty to disclose has arisen it is not clear how it is discharged it would be logical that once the authorities are in possession of all the information concerning a felony a citizens duty to disclose his own knowledge ceases so there is an added element of chance — the chance that the police already know id at 315 lord denning saw the duty as requiring a citizen to disclose to proper authority all material facts known to him relative to the offence it is not sufficient to tell the police that a felony has been committed he must tell the name of the man who did it if he knows it29 the place and so forth all material facts known to him if he fails or refuses to perform this duty when there is a reasonable opportunity available to him to do so then he is guilty of misprision sykes at 42 this was not sufficient for lord goddard he thought that facts  within his knowledge that would materially assist in the detection and arrest of a felon must be disclosed as a duty owed to the state id at 46 thus if a man disclosed all he knew about the commission of a felony and yet did not disclose the whereabouts of the felon he would be acquitted by lord denning and convicted by lord goddard 25 mod l rev at 315

their lordships agreed that the questions of when the knowledge must be revealed and how much trouble must be taken to reveal it were for the jury glazebrook is critical of this as assigning unsuitably vague questions to the trier of factif a man is to be punished for not doing something he ought to know precisely what is expected of him the standard which he fails at his peril to attain ought not to be left to be fixed after the event by the whim of a particular jury formulae that pass muster in determining the liability of one who engages in a dangerous course of conduct are not always suited to crimes of pure omission id at 316only lord denning considered relationship with the felon with respect to the duty to disclosenondisclosure may be due to a claim of right made in good faith for instance if a lawyer is told by his client that he has committed a felony it would be no misprision in the lawyer not to report it to the police for he might in good faith claim that he was under a duty to keep it confidential likewise with doctor 350350 and patient and clergyman and parishioner there are other relationships which may give rise to a claim in good faith that it is in the public interest not to disclose it for instance if an employer discovers that his servant has been stealing from the till he might well be justified in giving him another chance rather than reporting him to the police likewise with the master of a college and a student but close family or personal ties will not suffice where the offence is of so serious a character that it ought to be reported sykes at 42glazebrook finds this to be a singularly unhappy instance of creative judicial activity for a defence grounded on a claim of right made in good faith is in this context inapt and the choice of relationship perverse 25 mod lr at 317 he explainsa person advancing a defence of claim of right pleads that he mistakenly thought that the law recognised in him a right to act in the way he did if his defence is accepted his mistake will be benevolently viewed and he is excepted from criminal liability the defence is thus founded on the mistake on the claim not the right and disappears when the mistake is corrected in short if the crime is to be limited there must be a categorical rule that doctors and the like are under no duty to disclose their patients felonies idas to the choice of exempt relationshipsthe exclusion in misprision of close family or personal ties is utterly callous and certainly futile how can the relation between doctor and patient an employer and his servant be thought more sacred more deserving of respect and consideration — even by the law — than that between husband and wife between father and son by what standard is it unreasonable to expect an employer to report his servants crimes to the police and yet proper that a son should betray his father  id at 318we observe that common law misprision is not only beset with practical defects but may implicate constitutional privileges to sustain the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination sup it need only be evident from the implications of the question in the setting in which it is asked that a responsive answer  might be dangerous because injurious disclosure might result hoffman v united states 341 us 479 486487 71 sct 814 1951 the privilege extends not only to information that would itself support a conviction but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence to prosecute the claimant id at 486 see united states v king 402 f2d 694 9th cir1968 reversing conviction of federal misprision on fifth amendment grounds we note also that it has been suggested that the federal misprision statute may involve the right of privacy in united states v worcester 190 f supp 548 566 d mass 1961 judge wyzanski discussing the federal statute saidto suppose that congress reached every failure to disclose a known federal crime in this day of myriad federal tax statutes and regulatory laws would impose a vast and unmeasurable obligation it would do violence to the unspoken principle of the criminal law that as far as possible privacy should be respected there is a strong reluctance on the part of judges and legislators to sanction invasion of privacy in the detection of crime there is a general sentiment that the right to privacy is something to be put in balance against the enforcement of the law sir patrick devlin the enforcement of morals p 19see shannonhouse misprision of a federal felony dangerous relic or scourge of malfeasance 4 u balt l rev 59 1974 calling for excisement from the criminal code of the federal crime compare goldberg misprision of felony an old concept in new context 52 abaj 148 1966 and comment misprision of felony a crime whose time has come again 28 u fla l rev 199 1975

we have proceeded on the assumption that the house of lords was correct in concluding in sykes that there is and always has been an offense of misprision of felony sykes at 40 we are persuaded finding no sound reason not to be that their lordships definition of the offense and the composition of its elements properly reflected the crime as it existed at common law we are satisfied considering its origin the impractical and indiscriminate width of its scope its other obvious deficiencies and its long nonuse that it is not now compatible with our local circumstances and situation and our general code of laws and jurisprudence maintenance of law and order does not demand its application and overall the welfare of the inhabitants of maryland and society as enjoyed by us today would not be served by it if the legislature finds it advisable that the people be obligated under peril of criminal penalty to disclose knowledge of criminal acts it is of course free to create an offense to that end within constitutional limitations and hopefully with adequate safeguards31 we believe that the common law offense is not acceptable by todays standards and we are not free to usurp the power of the general assembly by attempting to fashion one that would be we hold that misprision of felony is not a chargeable offense in marylandiiiwe have reversed popes conviction of the felony of child abuse because the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict she may not be tried again for that crime burks v united states 437 us 1 98 sct 2141 1978 greene v massey 437 us 19 98 sct 2151 1978 mackall v state 283 md 100 387 a2d 762 1978

eldridge j concurring in part and dissenting in part

i concur in that portion of the courts opinion relating to the crime of misprision of a felony i also agree with the majority that pope was not guilty of child abuse as a principal in the second degree however i cannot agree with the majoritys restrictive interpretation of the child abuse statute which interpretation furnishes the basis for the majoritys conclusion that pope was not guilty of child abuse as a principal in the first degree

the child abuse statute maryland code 1957 1976 repl vol art 27 § 35a a reaches any parent adoptive parent or other person who has the permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor child the court today takes the position that the statutory phrase has responsibility for the supervision of is ambiguous thereby allowing the court to give effect to the real intention of the legislature the majority then states that with regard to persons other than parents legal custodians or individuals in loco parentis only those persons who have assumed responsibility for a child with the consent of the parent or guardian are covered by the statute the majority finds it selfevident that a third person may not assume such responsibility unless the parent grants it

thus we are told by the majority opinion that a person taking a lost child into his home while an attempt is made to locate his or her parents is beyond the reach of the child abuse statute in other words in the courts view such a person may voluntarily assume full responsibility for the care of a small child for a lengthy period of time while an effort is being made to find the parents and during that time may batter the child unmercifully but he would not be guilty of child abuse under art 27 § 35a in my view this is a totally unwarranted narrowing of an important piece of legislation

in addition to parents the child abuse statute applies to any  other person who has  responsibility for the supervision of a minor child the language is clear everyone who has responsibility is covered regardless of how he obtained such responsibility

it is wellestablished in the law that one may by his own actions voluntarily assume a particular responsibility that the legislature intended to cover such a person is shown by the language any other person who has responsibility there is no ambiguity here consequently there is no need to go further in attempting to ascertain the legislative intent the majority opinion today flatly violates settled principles of statutory construction recently summarized by judge orth for the court as follows wheeler v state 281 md 593 596 380 a2d 1052 10541055 1977 cert denied 435 us 997 98 sct 1650 56 led2d 86 1978

      the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and       carry out the real legislative intention balto gas  elect co v       board 278 md 26 31 358 a2d 241 1976 a statute should be       construed according to the ordinary and natural import of the       language used without resorting to subtle or forced       interpretations for the purpose of limiting or extending its       operation burch v state 278 md 426 429 365 a2d 577       1976 cearfoss v state 42 md 403 407 1875 that is we       must confine ourselves to the statute as written and may not       attempt under the guise of construction to supply omissions       or remedy possible defects in the statute in re appeals nos       1022  1081 278 md 174 178 359 a2d 556 1976 thus if       there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute       there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the       intent of the legislature maryland auto ins fund v stith 277       md 595 597 356 a2d 272 1976 as we said in purifoy v       mercsafe dep  trust 273 md 58 66 327 a2d 483       1974 where statutory language is plain and free from       ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning       courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of       words with a view toward making the statute express an       intention which is different from its plain meaning

furthermore even if there existed some ambiguity in the statute i am at a loss to know why the majority finds it selfevident that only those persons who have been granted responsibility by a parent or guardian should be covered nothing in the statutory language indicates such a legislative purpose i know of no public policy justifying this differentiation between a person who assumes responsibility for a child with parental consent and one who assumes just as complete a responsibility without the parents consent if either abuses the child he should be held accountable under § 35a

the majority appears to be concerned about the good samaritans who watch a lost child or allow neighbors children to play in their yards and exercise supervision or perform functions of a maternal nature from concern for the welfare comfort or health of a child however such good samaritans have nothing to fear from the child abuse statute but if one of these same individuals assumes responsibility for the child and batters it sexually molests it locks it for a long period of time in a dark closet etc that person should be held just as accountable under the child abuse statute as someone else having responsibility for the child

my concern in this case is not so much with the decision that the evidence was insufficient to convict pope of child abuse the evidence may not have been sufficient instead what is troublesome in this case is the damage which the majority has done to the child abuse statute

9 in bowers v state 283 md 115 389 a2d 341 1978 we rejected the contention that the definition of abuse was so indefinite as not to comport with the established standards of due process we opined that the definition of abuse  represents a most suitable compromise between the constitutionally mandated requirements of specificity and the practical need to devise language flexible enough to combat a social evil of truly inestimable proportions id at 129

10 habeas corpus was refused by the united states district court for the district of maryland to the convicted mother on appeal the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit by a majority of a three judge panel haynsworth cj dissenting vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the district court to grant the writ fabritz v superintendent 583 f2d 697 1978 in so doing the court accepted the statute as valid as did the court of appeals of maryland and the district court and accepted too their clear exposition of the critical words of the law 583 f2d at 700 it held that the statute simply was unconstitutionally applied id it viewed the conviction void for denial of fourteenth amendment due process because the conviction is based on a record lacking any relevant evidence as to a crucial element of the offense charged ie that the mother had knowledge of the critical gravity of her daughters condition when she deferred resort to medical advice for the little girl 583 f2d at 698

we had found it to be manifest from the evidence that the mother knew of the childs severely beaten condition and had failed for some eight hours to seek or obtain any medical assistance although as the evidence plainly indicated the need therefor was obviously compelling and urgent we observed that there was evidence that the mothers failure to seek assistance was based upon her realization that the bruises covering the childs body would become known were the child examined or treated by a physician state v fabritz 276 md 416 425 348 a2d 275 1975 cert denied 425 us 942 1976 chief judge haynsworth was in accord he did not agree with the majority of the panel that the record was devoid of evidentiary support he found therein evidence sufficient to support a conclusion that the mother though generally loving and protective of her daughter consciously refrained from seeking medical help to protect her lover the person who beat the child from possible criminal charges and to support her own ego a conscious indulgence of such a preference he thought is in violation of marylands child abuse law 583 f2d 701 haynsworth cj dissenting

13 we have observed in maryland as in many other states there is little practical difference between a principal in the first and second degree and we characterized such difference as a shadowy distinction vincent v state 220 md 232 239 n 1 151 a2d 898 1959 clark  marshall a treatise on the law of crimes 7th ed 1967 elaborated the point

the common law recognizes no difference in the punishment between principals in the first and second degree but regards them as equally guilty and subject to the same punishment in practice the distinction is immaterial and on an indictment charging one as principal in the first degree he may be convicted on evidence showing that he was present aiding and abetting and conversely

and at common law a principal in the second degree may be indicted and convicted before trial of the principal in the first degree and even after he has been acquitted or convicted of an offense of lesser degree though the commission of the act by the principal in the first degree must be proved in order to convict one as aiding and abetting id at § 805 p 521

see hochheimer §§ 3738 and unless it is plain from the nature of an offense made a felony by statute that the provisions of the statute were intended to affect only the party actually committing the offense aiders and abettors are punishable clark  marshall at § 804 p 520

14 before the court of special appeals the state explained the mothers continual presence and exercise of supervision from time to time while she was awake as conduct permitted by pope but manifesting no indication whatsoever that pope intended to relinquish her responsibility as the court of special appeals correctly observed that puts the cart before the horse it is the mother whose responsibility was not relinquished or absolved pope v state 38 md app 520 537538 382 a2d 880 1978 before us the state has apparently abandoned the notion it suggested before the intermediate court

15 this state has enacted a comprehensive scheme surrounded by safeguards for determining whether a person is suffering from a mental illness or mental disorder so as to make it necessary or advisable for the welfare of the person so suffering or for the safety of the persons or property of others that the mentally ill person receive care and treatment maryland code 1957 1972 repl vol 1978 cum supp art 59 § 1 et seq it would be unthinkable to impose such a determination on an ordinary individual at the risk of criminal prosecution not even the reasonable man so often called upon by the law has the expertise to make such a judgment

16 the principal in the second degree differs from the accessory before the fact only in the requirement of presence the principal in the second degree must be present at the perpetration of the felony either actually or constructively whereas the accessory before the fact must be absent in other words although neither presence nor absence is of itself a determinant of guilt yet if the mens rea is found to exist the same aid command counsel or encouragement which will make a principal in the second degree of one who is present actually or constructively at the time a felony is committed will make him an accessory before the fact if he is absent r perkins criminal law 658659 2d ed 1969

20 there was further recognition of the crime of misprision of felony in rex v king 1965 1 all er 1053 crimapp it was held that after being cautioned against selfincrimination the defendants silence can not possibly constitute misprision when an accused is questioned about an offense he is not bound to answer if his reply would incriminate him regarding that offense or any other offense on the other hand if after caution he chooses to say something which conceals the felony then this will amount to active concealment not protected by the right against selfincrimination and may constitute misprision id at 1055 see comment misprision of felony a reappraisal 23 emory lj 1095 1100 1974

26 the court of special appeals recognized that it was not bound by current opinion of the house of lords but noted that its view of what comprised the elements of its common law prior to 1776 is hard to gainsay pope v state 38 md app 520 530 382 a2d 880 1978 it continued if in the application of that common law active concealment is found to be more contemporarily compatible to a determination of criminal culpability than is indifference such policy is for our legislature or court of appeals to say id

27 the question whether the offense extended to concealing knowledge of an intended felony was left open

28 glazebrook observed that the absence of substantial authority by way of reported cases seriously handicapped their lordships in justifying the law not only in freeing it from the criticism that it was impossibly wide in scope but also in determining its ingredients 25 mod l rev 301 307  lord denning was driven to the curious position of stating that the ingredients of the offence can best be seen by comparing it with offences of like degree which have other ingredients his lordship might with equal logic have postulated crimes of fornication or adultery and then determined their elements by examining the offences of rape incest and buggery id at 312
