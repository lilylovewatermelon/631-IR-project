dont want nobody no not this time
find me a place where i can park my truck
hop on the hood gonna light one up
oooh oooh oh oh um

ill check the sights on my 22
take a couple pot shots at the moon
now that youre gone theres nothing to lose
ill think its time i forget about you
oooh oooh oh oh um

im gonna say goodbye to you tonight
so long old friend
im gonna fly again

pour me a shot of my real good friend
take me a breath and ill do it again
count all my smoke rings in the dark
aint gonna worry bout where you are
oooh oooh oh oh um

once ive finally caught my buzz
i wont give a damn and ill roll one up
grab my guitar pick a song or two
one of them song where i forget about you
oooh oooh oh oh um

oooh oooh oh oh um

im gonna say goodbye to you tonight
so long old friend

so long old friend
