it was painted red the stripe was white
it was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
secondhand from a dealer in atlanta
i rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
we put on a shine put on a motor
built out of love and made for the water
ran her for years til the transom got rotten
a piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

chorus
it was just an old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson and electric choke
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i cant replace the way it made me feel
and i would turn her sharp
and i would make it whine
hed say you cant beat the way an old wood boat rides
just a little lake cross the alabama line
but i was king of the ocean
when daddy let me drive

verse 2
just an old half ton short bed ford
my uncle bought new in 64
daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
a couple of burnt valves and he had it going
hed let me drive her when wed haul off a load
down a dirt strip where wed dump trash off of thigpen road
id sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
smiling like a hero that just received his medal
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
it was just an old hand me down ford
with three speed on the column and a dent in the door
a young boy two hands on the wheel
i cant replace the way it made me feel and
i would press that clutch
and id keep it right
hed say a little slower son youre doing just fine
just a dirt road with trash on each side
but i was mario andretti
when daddy let me drive

bridge
im grown up now three daughters of my own
i let them drive my old jeep
across the pasture at our home
maybe one day theyll reach back in their file
and pull out that old memory
and think of me and smile and say

chorus
it was just an old worn out jeep
with rusty old floorboards hot on my feet
a young girl two hands on the wheel
i cant replace the way it made me feel
and hed say turn it left and steer it right
straighten up girl now youre doing just fine
just a little valley by the river where wed ride
but i was high on a mountain
when daddy let me drive
when daddy let me drive
oh he let me drive
outro
it was just an old plywood boat
with a 75 johnson and electric chokeembed"
