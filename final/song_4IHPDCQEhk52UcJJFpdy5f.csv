sometimes i cant help feeling that im
living a life of illusion
and oh why cant we let it be
and see through the hole in this wall of confusion
i just cant help the feeling im
living a life of illusion

verse 2
pow right between the eyes
oh how nature loves her little surprises
wow it all seems so logical now
its just one of her better disguises
and it comes with no warning
nature loves her little surprises
continual crisis

guitar solo

verse 3
hey dont you know its a waste of your day
caught up in endless solutions
that have no meaning just another hunch
based upon jumping conclusions
endless solutions
backed up against a wall of confusion
living a life of illusion
living a life of illusion
living a life of illusionsee foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeembed"
