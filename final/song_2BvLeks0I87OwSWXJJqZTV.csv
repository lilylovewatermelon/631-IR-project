i didnt ask your opinion whatcha talkin bout
so quick to jump to conclusions cause were hangin out
there aint no issues aint no fuss
when its just you and me you and me
what makes you think that you can know
whats gonna stick whats gonna blow
so get em boy

chorus
let them pull at the seams
dont they know what it means
to be young and in love like that
who are they to decide
if its wrong if its right
to be young and in love like that
like that like that
like that like that
to be young and in love

verse 2
if people offering answers sounds like breaking glass
i cant remember the questions whatever asked
its a free road you came down
but you dont bother me bother me
one of those days when were old
ill stop and say i told you so
so get em boy

let them pull at the seams
dont they know what it means
to be young and in love like that

bridge
it dont matter what they say too late to walk away
cause i need him much too strong
ive waited for so long to feel all the things that i feel
so i gotta get that boy

chorus
let them pull at the seams
dont they know what it means
to be young and in love like that
who are they to decide
if its wrong if its right
to be young and in love like that
like that like that

to be young and in love like that
like that like that
like that like that
to be young and in loveembed"
