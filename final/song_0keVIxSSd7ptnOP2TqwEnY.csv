well love can be an uphill climb
im gonna meet a lot of resistance
it takes every ounce of strenght weve got
if were gonna go the distance
we can get discouraged and lose our courage
worrying bout the daily grind
but lifes a journey no need to hurry
its one day at a time

chorus
one foot in front of the other
take one step and then take another
keep on walking were headed in the right direction
putting one foot in front of the other
little by little gets a whole lot further
hitting our stride one foot in front of the other

verse 2
whats down the road we cant say
and the road behind dont matter
but every mile along the way
is just another mile together
unconcerned about the twists and turns
were taking it nice and slow
safe and sound covering ground
steady as she goes

bridge
yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow takes care of itself
well just keep on keeping on
cause we aint stumbled yet

verse 3
one foot in front of the toher
take one step and then take another
just awalking and atalkin and amovin in the same direction
putting one foot in front of the other
little by little gets a whole lot further
hitting our stride one foot in front of the toher

outro
well just ahitting our stride
one foot in front of the toherembed"
