its some twitter pussy i met on the internet
on my latenight thirsty cause it was latenight and i was thirsty
girl i been to that county girl i aint tellin
handcuff me to the bed girl it aint no bailin
i keep a stack of hundreds i can keep a secret
if anything you was explorin you wasnt cheating
she got my number stored under fake names
her nigga think she faithful but she runnin game
yolo so take me out these polos
and we can fuck from uno to ocho
