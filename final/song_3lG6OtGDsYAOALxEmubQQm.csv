do you want me or do you not
i heard one thing now im hearing another
dropped a pin to my parking spot
the bar was hot its 2 am it feels like summer

refrain 1
happiness is a butterfly
try to catch it like every night
it escapes from my hands into moonlight
every day is a lullaby
hum it on the phone like every night
sing it for my babies on the tour life ah

prechorus
if hes a serial killer then whats the worst
that can happen to a girl whos already hurt
im already hurt
if hes as bad as they say then i guess im cursed
looking into his eyes i think hes already hurt
hes already hurt

chorus
i said dont be a jerk dont call me a taxi
sitting in your sweatshirt crying in the backseat ooh
i just wanna dance with you
hollywood and vine black rabbit in the alley
i just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
i just wanna dance with you
i just wanna dance with you

verse 2
left the canyon drove to the club
i was one thing now im being another
laurel down to sunset in the truck
ill pick you up if youre in town on the corner ah

refrain 2
happiness is a butterfly
we should catch it while dancing
i lose myself in the music baby
every day is a lullaby
try to catch it like lightning
i sing it into my music im crazy

prechorus
if hes a serial killer then whats the worst
that can happen to a girl whos already hurt

if hes as bad as they say then i guess im cursed
looking into his eyes i think hes already hurt
hes already hurt
