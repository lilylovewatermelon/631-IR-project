vampires never have to complain
of living a dull circumstance
so lets all pretend that we are undead
in turn of the century france
i want the love on your wrist
oh give me the heart on your neck
and it would be fine
to spend my whole life
with you together

chorus
parlez vous or something like that
le velo pour deux or something like that
and thats what ill say to get you to ride away with me
hey

bridge
oh it would be fine to spend my whole life
with you on a bicycle built for two

outro
ahhh ahhh whoah oh oh
ahhh ahhh whoah oh oh
oh it would be so oh fine to spend my whole life
with you on a bicycle built for twoyou might also like12embed"
