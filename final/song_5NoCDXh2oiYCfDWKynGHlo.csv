he left his heart at the counter met a stranger in a foreign town
they say the city was pretty they say what goes around comes back around
and then theres a sound whats that sound that thats panic
a schizophrenic psychopathic lover

chorus
but through his eyes she looks so beautiful
but through his eyes she looks so harmless
and out of the sky pain starts falling down
and out of the sky his eyes go blind blind
his eyes go blind blind blind
his eyes go blind blind blind

verse 2
he left his face on the table put his nose smack dead on the line
and you can check at the bar hes the talk of the town now now now now
his new love can no longer be found hey whats that sound
listen out for the sound of paramedics just forget it he should have seen it

chorus
but through his eyes she looks so beautiful
but through his eyes she looks so harmless
and out of the sky pain starts falling down
and out of the sky his eyes go blind blind
but through his eyes she looks so beautiful
but through his eyes she looks so harmless
and out of the sky pain starts falling down
and there aint no way to run aint no way to hide6886226
but through his eyes she looks so beautiful
but through his eyes she looks so harmless6886217
and out of the sky pain starts falling down
and out of the sky his eyes go blind blind
