i wanna get some steady bitches and hoes
and some candy for my nose
some diamond stones to roll with my chrome and—
hey genius you even know what that means
uhuh what does it mean
wheres the keyboards and the tambourine and the guitar
and you know i mean the stuff that like white people like
we had a piano
somethin badass like uhh i dont know
like uhh reo speedwagon or somethin
hell yeah

verse mf doom
aiyyo i know this dude right
carl he wore tight blue sweats but wasnt glued too tight
all he had upstairs was a crude light
you think thats weird he lived next door to a food fight
howdy danger much obliged for the beat god
even though you still eat lard by the meatwad
mesquite charred speakin of which or who
voice all squeaky like they tuned it up a pitch or two
a chunk of burned up witchs brew get your crew
see if they cant get past the stench of the stew
it stank like a septic tank full of pig poo
he mostly only turned into a frank or a igloo
switch your view to the brother with the fried dreads
not to be confused with the incense selling thai heads
his name rhymes with mike hawk
you could call him livewire eye sockets frylock
able to shoot electricity through his eyeballs
and blast all through your single sided brick and drywall
more interesting than professional wrestling
when hes online you can find him on instant pestering
whats up with your boy hes not a soft or hot drink
whoever dont like it could suck his straw its hot pink
on some junk like gucci on a classy ho
might splash you in the face with nuclear pistachio
make a fast break or thatll be the last mistake
that assll make is what you get for messin with master shake
look out dont block the screen son lunge across
tryin to watch adult swim aqua teen hunger force
rock this cult hymn sock your mean younger boss
psht  adult swim aqua teen hunger force
he often wondered should he get the logo tatted to his woody
he could be 1 in the hood g
easily
you might also likeoutro master shake
shake callin heheh you know i waahhhhh
id just got off the phone with somebody else and uh
that wasnt about you
that was about me being upset about something else
i shouldnt have called you but i did
cause i just i like you so much
im really looking forward to us working together
and just as of now that im calm
and after ive apologized profusely  probably too much
i am available call me doggie  woof2embed"
