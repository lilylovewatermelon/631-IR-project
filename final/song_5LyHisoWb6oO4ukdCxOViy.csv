watch it blow my mind
its something i am illprepared to remedy
but let it slow the time
it takes to die
and close your eyes to your enemy
defy

verse 2
selfmade millionaires wont take ideas
from all the little plebeians
just suffocate with smiles
and force fed lies
and close your mind to reality
deny

chorus
it feels like im losing again
when ive lost everything
im sure i will see more clearly
lose what im feeling to them
and not feel anything
im sure i will bleed sincerely
tonight

verse 3
watch it blow my mind
its something i am illprepared to remedy
but let it slow the time
it takes to die
and close your eyes to your enemy
defy

so you make the simplest mistake
so you make the simplest mistake
and fearlessly you deny your involvement in my demise
but give me your open hand
die

chorus
it feels like im losing again
when ive lost everything
im sure i will see more clearly
lose what im feeling to them
and not feel anything
im sure i will bleed sincerely
feels like im losing again
when ive lost everything
im sure i will see more clearly
lose what im feeling to them
and not feel anything
im sure i will bleed sincerely
