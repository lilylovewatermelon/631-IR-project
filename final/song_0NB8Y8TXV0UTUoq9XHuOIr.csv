sarabeth is scared to death
to hear what the doctor will say
she hasnt been well
since the day that she fell
and the bruise it just wont go away
so she sits and she waits with her mother and dad
and flips through an old magazine
til the nurse with a smile
stands at the door
and says will you please come with me

verse 2
sarabeth is scared to death
cause the doctor just told her the news
between the red cells and white
somethings not right
but were gonna take care of you
six chances in ten it wont come back again
with the therapy were gonna try
its just been approved
its the strongest there is
and i think we caught it in time

chorus
sarabeth closes her eyes
and she dreams shes dancin
around and around without any cares
and her very first love is holding her close
and the soft wind is blowing her hair

sarabeth is scared to death
as she sits holding her mom
says it would be a mistake
for someone to take
a girl with no hair to the prom
for just this mornin right there on her pillow
was the cruelest of any surprise
and she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
the proof that she couldnt deny

chorus
sarabeth closes her eyes
and she dreams shes dancing
around and around without any cares
and her very first love was holding her close
and the soft wind is blowing her hair

bridge
its quarter to seven that boys at the door
and her daddy ushers him in
when he takes off his cap they all start to cry
cause this morning where his hair had been
softly she touches just skin

outro
they go dancin
around and around without any cares
and her very first true love is holding her close
and for a moment she isnt scaredembed"
