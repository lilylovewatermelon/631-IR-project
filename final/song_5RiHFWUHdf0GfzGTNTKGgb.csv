pressed my lips on your sunburnt skin
on a road by the river bend
standing underneath the dead end sign
we swam around underneath the moon
and danced around a bob seger tune
and finished up a bottle of homemade wine

prechorus
i never had to write a girl a song
had a woman stay this long
and now youre moving in
and im alright with that

chorus
i aint got a pot of gold
girl i aint even got a rainbow
but ive heard that love is where
treasure can be found
dont expect too much from me
and i wont let you down

verse 2
never been ashamed of the clothes i wear
ive never been a nickel millionaire
never even bought myself a truck
you might also likei spent most of my life in a smoky bar
playing country blues on box guitar
and ive done alright
you can call that luck

prechorus
never had to write a girl a song
or had a woman stay this long
and now youre moving in
and im alright with that

chorus
i aint got a pot of gold
girl i aint even got a rainbow
but ive heard that love is where
treasure can be found
dont expect too much from me
and i wont let you down

prechorus
never had to write a girl a song
had a woman stay this long
and now youre moving in
and im alright with that

chorus
i aint got a pot of gold
girl i aint even got a rainbow
but ive heard that love is where
treasure can be found
dont expect too much from me
and i wont let you down
dont expect too much from me
and i wont let you down
outro
i wont let you down
i wont let you down

i wont let you down
i wont let you down babyembed"
