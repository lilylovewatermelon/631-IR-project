you tell me you made it
but i can see that you’re fakin’
you’re like a ship lost out at sea
the cash that you’re fronting
can only pay for so much
and then it’s gone

all the shit you say
a paralleled story
burn the bridge you made
ignited by a flame

broken heart this could be deja vu

torn apart
can’t find my way out of a broken heart
this could be deja vu

drowning in the shapes
so tired of the snakes
infecting my veins
a tidal wave

so tired of the snakes
you might also likedon’t fucking want the life you lead
you’re just as fake as the crown you’re wearing
fake as the pain and the stories you sing
you can’t shine brighter than the gold on your hands
yeah
how many scars on your skin
what do you really know about everything it takes
how many wounds and sleepless nights
got everything on a plate
you know nothing of the vows i take
you know nothing you know nothing

this might be deja vu
feels like i’ve seen it all before

torn apart
can’t find my way out of a broken heart
this could be deja vu

drowning in the shapes
so tired of the snakes
infecting my veins
a tidal wave

torn apart
can’t find my way out of a broken heart
this could be deja vu
mortal enemy
you tell me you made it
but i can see that you’re fakin’
you’re like a ship lost out at sea
the cash that you’re fronting
can only pay for so much
and then it’s gone
and then it’s goneembed"
