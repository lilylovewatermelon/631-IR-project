i know youre smart
you spin me round like a knot
you know the pieces pieces of my heart
sometimes its fun you pull my strings one by one
until you get me get me onto one

prechorus alunageorge
lately ive been thinking if you wanna get tough
then lets play rough
lately ive been thinking if you wanna get tough
then lets play rough
i dont need you
giving it straight to me giving it straight to me
youre just gonna get knocked back
i dont need you
telling me how to be telling me how to be
just gonna get knocked back
just gonna get knocked back
just gonna get knocked back
just gonna get knocked back
just gonna get knocked back
back back back back

you always tint me tint me black and blue
such a shame you frame me with such disdain
you got me washed out washed out colour drained
