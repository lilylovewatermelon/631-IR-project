hey old man sittin on a stool
i’ve seen you in here for a while
your best days are now in your rearview
but you still find a way to smile
i know theres no secret to life
it seems like you got it down to a t
got any longneck advice for a good ol boy like me
and he said

chorus
call your mama see the world
get the tattoo kiss the girl
count your blessings thank your stars
learn your lesson earn your scars
life’s a sunset from the porch
as beautiful as it is short
so drink it up but make it last son
cause every beer could be your last one
oh yeah every beer could bе your last one

verse 2
he orderеd us both a pbr
said take this with a grain of salt
life aint like a soldout bar
we dont know when its our last call
so make i cant and ’i regret’
a couple words that you dont use
and one day you might be right here
tellin’ somebody like you
see cole swindell liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
call your mama see the world
get the tattoo kiss the girl
count your blessings thank your stars
learn your lesson earn your scars
lifes a sunset from the porch
as beautiful as it is short
so drink it up but make it last son
cause every beer could be your last one
oh yeah your last one

bridge
he paid his tab then he was gone
i dont know where that old man went
coulda been heaven coulda been home
either way i ain’t seen him since
since he said

chorus
call your mama see the world
get the tattoo kiss the girl
count your blessings thank your stars
learn your lesson earn your scars
lifes a sunset from the porch
as beautiful as it is short
so drink it up but make it last son
cause every beer could be your last one
outro
you never know no you never know
oh yeah every beer could be your last one
you never know no you never know
you never know no you never know
you never know no you never know
every beer could be your last one make it last son
every beer could be your last oneembed"
