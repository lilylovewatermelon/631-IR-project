verse 3
its cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
and from my hands to my brothers grave
you took his side you took his gift
feel the power of a fallen man
crestfallen man

refrain
far away in this land i must go
out of the sight of the one
a punishment sent from his hands
a hardship that no one should know
now go out of the sight of the one
away in this land you must go

verse 4
where has he gone what have you done
a voice commands from high above this earth
from the soil his blood cries out to me
murder liar vengeance deceit
outro
far away in this land i must go
out of the sight of the one
a punishment sent from his hands
a hardship that no one should know
now go out of the sight of the one
away in this land you must go7embed"
