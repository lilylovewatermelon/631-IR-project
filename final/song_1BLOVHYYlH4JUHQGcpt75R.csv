up on his horse up on his horse
not gonna wake up here anymore
listen one time its not the truth
its just a story i tell to you
easy to say easy to do
but its not easy well maybe for you
hope that you find it hope that its good
hope that you read it think that you should
cuts you some slack as he sits back
sizes you up plans his attack

spoken
dadada
drums please fab

prechorus
and i got it all i got it all
waitin for me down on the street
but now you gotta do somethin special for me
im gonna say whats on my mind
then ill walk out then ill feel fine

chorus
yeah im under his thumb im on his back
i will not show my teeth too quick
i needed you there i needed you there
but i didnt know i didnt know
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likebreak
go alone
ill go alone
well go alone
ill go alone

verse 2
back from his trip hes at the door
when he gets back hes on the phone
innocent eye innocent heart
no its not wrong but its not right
innocent time out on his own
not gonna do that fuck im out of control
i was just bored playin the guitar
learned all your tricks wasnt too hard

chorus
its the last one now i can promise you that
im gonna find out the truth when i get back

outro
gone now are the old times
forgotten time to hold on the railing
the rubiks cube isnt solving for us
old friends long forgotten
the old ways at the bottom of
the ocean now has swallowed
the only thing thats left is us
so pardon the silence that youre hearing
its turnin into a deafening painful shameful roar53embed"
