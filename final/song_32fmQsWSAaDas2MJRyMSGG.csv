she sold her love to a modern man
good solid currencyâ€™s the hardest to land
all of that money helps you cover your ass
dont let the ladyfinger blow in your hands

chorus
did it all for that dollar
shes a star tonight
without warning
she gave up the ghost inside

verse 2
just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
she got no future just a life to endure
this good samaritan is shaking her hand
too late to leave here now the songs in the can

chorus
give it up for that dollar
shes a star tonight
without warning
she gave up the ghost inside

verse 3
you call it chivalry
never pull a punch for free
you ever wonder why they had to move on
this phony honor code
that put you on your throne
a doublestandard you invoke when you want
you might also likechorus
for that dollar
shes a star tonight
without warning
she gave up the ghost inside

bridge
was it all for show
dont turn into one of them
turning another page
trust me darling
im carving a moat through the dust in your town
crawling over the rubble
just to serve you
tend to wonder why
