i didnt want to know
i just didnt want to know
best to keep things in the shallow end
cause i never quite learned how to swim
i just didnt want to know
didnt want didnt want

prechorus
close my eyes just to look at you
taken by this seamless vision
i close my eyes
ignore the smoke
ignore the smoke
ignore the smoke

chorus
call an optimist shes turning blue
such a lovely color for you
call an optimist shes turning blue
while i just sit and stare at you

verse 2
because i dont want to know
i didnt want to know
i just didnt want to know
i just didnt want

mistook the nods for an approval
just ignore the smoke and smile

chorus
call an optimist shes turning blue
such a lovely color for you
call an optimist shes turning blue
such a perfect color for your eyes
call an optimist shes turning blue
such a lovely color for you
call an optimist shes turning blue
while i just sit and stare at you
