ive fallen out of favor
and ive fallen from grace
fallen out of trees
and ive fallen on my face
fallen out of taxis
out of windows too
fell in your opinion
when i fell in love with you

prechorus
ohooh ohoooooooh
ohooh ohoooooooh

chorus
sometimes i wish for falling
wish for the release
wish for falling through the air
to give me some relief
because falling is not the problem
when im falling im at peace
its only when i hit the ground
it causes all the grief

prechorus
ohooh ohoooooooh
ohooh ohoooooooh

ill dance myself up
drunk myself down
found people to love
left people to drown
im not scared to jump
im not scared to fall
if there was nowhere to land
i wouldnt be scared
at all
at all
at all
at all
fall
fall

chorus
sometimes i wish for falling
wish for the release
wish for falling through the air
to give me some relief
because falling is not the problem
when im falling im at peace
its only when i hit the ground
it causes all the grief14embed"
