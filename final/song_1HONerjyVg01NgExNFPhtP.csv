jack d theres a seven on the label
one glass on the living room table
phone face down church up loud
was tryna drown you out tonight
but first sip i could feel you on my shoulder
the tennessee heat had me feelin colder
thought a drink would get you off my mind

chorus
but this bottle tastes like 8654091021
yeah one last time dont think twice
girl just pick it up and come over
give the bedroom door a little closure
i know i told you i wouldnt call and i tried
but this bottle tastes like 865 4091021
this bottle tastes like 865 4091021

verse 2
you might think i dont really want you with me
you might tell me to empty out my whiskey
or try changin what im holdin in my hand
try another liquor try another brand
but it dont matter if i got my lips on a different drink on a different night
yeah the second that i take a sip all im gonna think
