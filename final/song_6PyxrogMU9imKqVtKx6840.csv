crazy to think that a man cant hurt
love takes its toll every time it dont work yeah
one door closes and another opens
but its hard to let go when your hearts broken
ill give you my trust can you give me your word

come take my heart of glass
and give me your love
i hope youll still be there
to pick the pieces up
cause baby im fragile fragile fragile
cause baby im fragile fragile fragile

verse 2 labrinth
after he left you in ten times ten
could i put you back together again yeah
one door closes and another opens
but i wont let go cause im not like him
baby just say the words let the love begin

chorus labrinth
come take my heart of glass
and give me your love
i hope youll still be there
to pick the pieces up
cause baby im fragile fragile fragile
