yeah we dont wanna do anything to scare your children
thats the last thing we wanna do
we dont wanna scare anybody

verse 1
never said it was fair but still i never knew fear
not in a million years could you tell me that id be here
i just hopped off that lear my life on another tier
lifting glasses for cheers keep that hating out my ear
from country living to country skipping this would drive you crazy
check the rate that they pay me a giant could never slay me
money never a maybe but never forgot my roots
i heard that the top is lonely i wonder if its the truth
so im just climbing paid off rhyming now im shining could be blinding
aint too much real left but right here is where you could find it
this that new classic aint this what you needed
im what amazing look like now recognize it when you see it

chorus
not where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

ive been counted out and been stepped on
i was wide awake and got slept on
i had everything and then lost it
worked my ass off im exhausted
all this talkin bout me just talk about me
im here now they cant walk around me
im dedicated flow elevated
tell every hater i hope you never play it
said id never make it
now im celebrating and im never quitting no resignation
took desperate measures outta desperation
im the fresh face with no expiration
i know pressure make diamonds so i threw em off in this chain
when its all on the line im who you want in the game
cause im gon get it and thats fasho
cant be like yall thats a nogo
international while yall local
got this locked up just like popo
every beat get ate thats ocho
wont lose oh no thats yoko
been up and down like lowlows
still make my own on my solo
had to be here to believe it
think like winners to perceive it
had to let cha know that i mean it
if i speak it and say keep it
this flow thats genius
just think about it what i think about it
if i didnt live it wont ink about it
married to the money put a ring around it what
chorus
not where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone

bridge
and everything aint the way i planned it
but when the smoke clears im the last standing
this lifestyle can be so demanding
but i take off like a plane and aint never landing

chorus
not where i wanna be but im far from home
just tryna make it on my own
and unless destiny calls i dont answer phones
this is the line and i walk alone
aint no going back now
dont know where im at now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone
outro
aint no going back now
aint no going back now
this is the line and i walk alone46embed"
