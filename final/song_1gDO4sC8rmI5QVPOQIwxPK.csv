intro jayz  bobby byrd
im not trying to be no big thing no no
you gotta let this one breathe just
just let it breathe for a second
im not trying to give you no advice

i dont claim to be no philosopher
the blueprint 2 is on its way
i know yall hear my footsteps out there im coming
but i sure know this is life baby baby
lets go get em just

interlude lil fame  bobby byrd
time to dump fire
dump fire dump fire dump fire dump fire
you dont know what youre doing doing doing doing

verse 1 lil fame  billy danze
its the mop yes
and the zip code is 1 1 2 3 3
and motherfucker we coming 100 miles and gunning owwww
im still running with cats that rob
from the era of eggshell 80s and hatchback saabs same game
operation for this industry lockdown
we still tote hammers that go blakow run up if you wanna
believe me dog these hammers with they owners
fuck your g up have you in blue pampers in a coma
and your family now mourn—look seventy pounds gone
a little fuck shriveled up with a hospital gown on
we holding it down homes keep pushing we fell bastards
to get over we grind with slippery shell tactics
chippetyfrail bastards your tracks need tuneups
lil niglet what the fuck you recording for nick jr
the game aint changed it just got harder
plus we sponsored by laze dame dash and mr sdot carter
brownsville yep we stomp through this bitch all day oh
rock with my cock out face the crowd and piss on stage uh uh uh

im from the g side of things oh where we ride and bang
with a heat thatll flame thats how we got the name
warriors embedded in your brains
and someone should be telling em the veterans have came
and were better in the game you better make it rain
twentyseven a gram my man its better than cocaine
now everything will change and this family will rule the world
and you haters can eat a dick up til you hiccup and url
a decade on the grind uh nigga i paid mine
so its my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
i wont sit back and rap like these dumbass kids
i been around i put it down i aint these young ass kids mop
the ogs repped and survived around this motherfucker
first family we kept it live around this motherfucker oh
when its crunch time we do it our wizzay
fo shizzle my nigga learned to grip pistols in bk

interlude jayz

turn my music high high high higher

verse 3 jayz
more fire more rocawear attire
more money more murder now that mops hired
more further for the roc empire yall wont serve us
yall nervous know them guns on full service ready to fire
one body two body three body four
young sitting on paper im above the law
young shitting on haters i aint fucking with yall
for my brownsville neighbors—how about some hardcore
and it just get worser every time i sign my signature in cursive
just add another million to these verses
one million two million three million four
and the moneys really worthless im pissing you off on purpose
my nephews situated and my mama is straight
so im ready for whatever drama should come my way
and you niggas rapping to me so your drama is fake
you dudes is noodles i got more ziti to bake
you dudes is cake i keep two biscuits on the waist
razor blades under the tongue i will eat your face
appetite for destruction i am starving today
got a moneyhungry lawyer thatll eat the case
and thats just food for thought dont let it go to waste
nigga bite the bullet until you stuffing your face ha
i done forgot more than you ever learned
what you dont knowll make your home a permanent urn nigga
outro
