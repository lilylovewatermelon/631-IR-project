a man tries to get me down
i just cant see your face
im blinded by the sun
living on the run
and i cant remember this place

take me to the other side
let me go when im high
take me to the other side pretty mama
and on the wind wont you let me ride

i better slow down before i wreck
driving on the rivers edge
my momma says come back home
but i cant keep em running fast
burning up the years grass
another sands dirt road

wont you take me to the other side
let me go when im high
wont you take me to the other side pretty mama
and on the wind wont you let me ride

cowboys your given name
nothing ever stays the same
cept the rain falling down
you cant keep from goin
no the wind is always damn cold
its time to put the hammer down

let me go when im high
wont you take me to the other side pretty mama
and on the wind wont you let me ride

wont you take me to the other side
on the wind wont you let me ride
wont you take me to the other side pretty mama
and on the wind wont you let me rideembed"
