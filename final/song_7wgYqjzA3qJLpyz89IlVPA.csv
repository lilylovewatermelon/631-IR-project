dont let it get you dont let it get you down
for this fine old world keeps on spinning round

verse 1
thats life
thats what all the people say
youre riding high in april
youre shot down in may
i know im gonna change that tune
when im back on top in june
i say thats life
and as funny as it may seem
some people get their kicks
stompin on your dreams
but i dont let it let it get me down
cause this fine ol world keeps spinning round

chorus
ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate
a poet a pawn  a king
ive been up  down  over  out
but i know one thing
each time i find myself flat on this face
i pick myself up  get back in the race

thats life
i cant deny it
i thought of quitting baby
this heart wasnt gonna buy it
and if i didnt think it was worth one single try
id jump right on a big bird and then id fly

chorus
ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate
a poet a pawn  a king
ive been up  down  over  out
and i know one thing
each time i find myself flat on my face
i pick myself up and get back in the race

verse 3
thats life
thats life  i cant deny it
many times i thought of cutting out
but my heart wont buy it
but if theres nothing shakin come this here july
im gonna roll
im gonna roll
im gonna roll myself up in a big ball  die
i cant deny it
thats lifeembed"
