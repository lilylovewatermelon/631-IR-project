say it all
just get it all off your chest
shake it up
500000 times
say no more
we dont believe anything
teenage angst
come all ages

chorus
baby show me where to go
some things i dont wanna know
baby tell me if youre sure
out all the time

verse 2
say it all
im not awake anymore
change my mind
2000 times before
seen a knight
dance on the side of the road
teenage angst
come all ages
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
baby show me where to go
some things i dont wanna know
baby tell me if youre sure
out all the time

bridge
feeling dizzy now
in the running show
all i want to see
all i want to know
watch you as you stay
faces at your door
waiting for your piece
pull the trigger please

chorus
baby show me where to go
somethings i dont wanna know
baby tell me if youre sure
out all the time
cause i dont wanna see everybody get together
leave these dreams alone
you dont wanna have to tell me that i wanted you go
everybody needs a shadow oh1embed"
