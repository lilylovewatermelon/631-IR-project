all the boats ive missed
all the hell ive caused
all the lips ive kissed
all the love ive lost
i got kicked around
ive been black and blue
on my way to you

verse 2
all the stars ive seen
all the songs ive sung
all the beers ive drank
all the damage done
i was just passin time
kinda just passin through
on my way to you

chorus
every curve every ditch
every turn every bridge
i left behind me up in smoke
every fork in the road
it was all worth the while
when i finally saw your smile
every highway every heartbreak
every mountain every mile

i got the radio up
sun is going down
i’ll take a left at the bank
and i’ll head straight through town
so baby put on that dress
a little sweet perfume
‘cause i’m on my way to you

instrumental break

chorus
yeah every curve every ditch
every turn every bridge
i left behind me up in smoke
every fork in the road
it was all worth the while
when i finally saw your smile
every highway every heartbreak
every mountain every mile

verse 4
all the boats i’ve missed
all the hell i’ve caused
all the lips i’ve kissed
all the love i’ve lost
i thank god for that
i guess he always knew
i was on my way to you
outro
on my way to you
on my way to you2embed"
