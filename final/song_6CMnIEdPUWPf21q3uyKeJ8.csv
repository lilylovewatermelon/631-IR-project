but the moon is slowly rising
so this old world must still be spinning round
and i still love you

so close your eyes
you can close your eyes its all right
i dont know no love songs
and i cant sing the blues anymore
but i can sing this song
and you can sing this song
when im gone

it wont be long before another day
we gonna have a good time
and no ones gonna take that time away
you can stay as long as you like

so close your eyes
you can close your eyes its all right
i dont know no love songs
and i cant sing the blues anymore
but i can sing this song
and you can sing this song
when im goneyou might also likeembed"
