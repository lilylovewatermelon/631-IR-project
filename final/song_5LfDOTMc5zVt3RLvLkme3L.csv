in a whiskey saloon
it comes through my window
like a favorite tune

i can walk down the stairway
i can walk down the street
and lay down my money
but its not what i need

chorus
let me fly on your wings
rise above these earthly things
make it all be alright
angel of the night angel of the night
theres a weight on my shoulder
that wont let me be
like something left over
between you and me
i know theres a danger
whenever we touch
its always the last time
but its never enough
