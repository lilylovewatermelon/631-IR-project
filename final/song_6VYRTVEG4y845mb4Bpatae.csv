tonight well fly away so high
our first full moon sky

verse 1 jt woodruff with casey calvert
ill breathe you in i wont let you down
i wont hold you back i wont make a sound
i know what scares you the most
being alone or just like them
being alive while feeling so dead

prechorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
at least you’ll have my heart
you know you shine so bright

chorus jt woodruff
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive without you
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive without you

verse 2 jt woodruff with casey calvert
can you sleep at night if i hold you tight
i wont let you go this feels so right
please dont leave this time

at least you’ll have my heart
you know you shine so bright

chorus jt woodruff
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive without you
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive without you
