have you ever slashed a soul to ribbons
have you ever believed in a mirage

verse 1
my ears are ringing with a sound
feel the vibrations my heart starts to pound pound pound
give in to darkness bodies melt
how do we play the cards weve been dealt dealt dealt
beauty its humanitys greatest sin
beauty hiding the beast that lies within

prechorus
for all our righteous crimes we compensate
but as for me its far too late
i cant deny the voices inside my brain
its not a dream were one and the same

chorus
you should know that a soul cant be cut cant be cut
no matter what blade you wield
if you follow your own path to justice path to justice
the brutal truth will be revealed yeah

outro
the sounds getting louder and louder and louder and louder and louder
you should knowyou might also like1embed"
