i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i remember your little laugh
race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
i love you to the moon and back
i remember your blue eyes lookin into mine
like we had our own secret club
i remember you dancin before bedtime
then jumpin on me waking me up
i can still feel you hold my hand little man
and even the moment i knew
you fought it hard like an army guy
remember i leaned in and whispered to you

chorus
come on baby with me
were gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years

verse 2
i remember the drive home when the blind hope
turned to cryin and screamin why
flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
about a beautiful boy who died
and its about to be halloween you could be anything
you wanted if you were still here
i remember the last day when i kissed your face
and whispered in your ear

come on baby with me
were gonna fly away from here
out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
well just disappear
come on baby with me
were gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years

bridge
what if im standin in your closet trying to talk to you
and what if i kept the handmedowns you wont grow into
and what if i really thought some miracle would see us through
and what if the miracle was even gettin one moment with you

chorus
come on baby with me
were gonna fly away from here
come on baby with me
were gonna fly away from here
you were my best four years

outro
i remember your bare feet down the hallway
i love you to the moon and back14embed"
