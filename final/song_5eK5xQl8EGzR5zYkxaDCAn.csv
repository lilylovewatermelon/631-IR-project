ive given up on giving up slowly
im blending in so you wont even know me
apart from this whole world that shares my fate
this one last bullet you mention
is my one last shot at redemption
cause i know to live you must give your life away

prechorus
and ive been housing all this doubt and insecurity
and ive been locked inside that house
all the while you hold the key
and ive been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
and even though theres no way of knowing where to go
i promise im going because

chorus
ooh i gotta get outta here
im stuck inside this rut that i fell into by mistake
ooh i gotta get outta here
and im begging you im begging you
im begging you to be my escape

verse 2
im given up on doing this alone now
cause ive failed and im ready to be shown how
youve told me the way and now im trying to get there
and this life sentence that im serving
i admit that im every bit deserving
but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

cause im afraid that this complacency is something i cant shake yeah

im begging you to be my escape

i am a hostage to my own humanity
selfdetained and forced to live in this mess ive made
and all im asking is for you to do what you can with me
but i cant ask you to give what you already gave

prechorus

and im begging you im begging you
iâ€™m begging you to be my escape

outro
i fought you for so long i should have let you win
oh how we regret those things we do
and all i was trying to do was save my own skin oh
but so were you
so were you10embed"
