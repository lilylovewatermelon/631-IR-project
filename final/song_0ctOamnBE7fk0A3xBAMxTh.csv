i cant believe im still doing this
i told myself a month ago that id be through with this
im looking at my phone and wondering if youre home
im kinda tipsy i aint tryna sleep alone
somebody told me that some other girl was hugging you
baby you know im the one that should be loving you
you know we had a thing baby its such a shame
i still get crazy every time i hear your name

prechorus 1
and i know its complicated
but you know im impatient

chorus
3 am
yo im texting you once again
even though im hanging with my friends
i cant help it i cant help myself no
3 am
i might be looking for a late night friend
and baby i cant get you out my head
i cant help it i cant help myself no

verse 2
kinda stressing like im gonna have a heart attack
