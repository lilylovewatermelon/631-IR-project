josie youre my
source of most frustration
forget when i
dont meet expectations
everything you wished came true
in the end we all blamed you
even though as they all know
you werent the only one two
three four

verse 1 mark hoppus
why do you still keep it around
when you know it brings me down im hating everything
and i know that you dated other guys
but i got to wonder why youd leave it out for me shit

verse 2 mark hoppus
why am i still hanging around
when i know it brings me down im hating everything
and you are getting rides home in his car
youre making out in his front yard im hating everything

chorus mark hoppus
please dont remind me put your past behind me
it shines so bright it blinds me i wish that this would end
and i am not fine last night i saw you online
your screen name used to be mine why cant we just pretend

and if we can have another day
ive got so much left to say id tell you everything
and ill laugh when i think about the past
when i see you after class youre hating everything

chorus mark hoppus
please dont remind me put your past behind me
it shines so bright it blinds me i wish that this would end
and i am not fine last night i saw you online
your screen name used to be mine why cant we just pretend
please dont remind me put your past behind me
it shines so bright it blinds me i wish that this would end
and i am not fine last night i saw you online
your screen name used to be mine why cant we just pretend
