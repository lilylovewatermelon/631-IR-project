kiss me dangerous
been so lost without you all around me
get anxious
lead me dont look back
its all about you

prechorus
in the dark right now
feelin lost but i like it
comfort in my sins and all about me
all i got right now
feel the taste of resentment
simmer in my skin its all about

chorus
bloodstain on my shirt
new bitch on my nerves
old nigga got curved
goin back on my word
damn bitch you so thirsty
still dont know my worth
still stressin perfection
let you all in my mental
got me lookin too desperate
damn you aint deserve
