and the hardest part was letting go not taking part
was the hardest part
and the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring
it was the strangest start

chorus 1
i could feel it go down
bittersweet i could taste in my mouth
silver lining the clouds
oh and i
i wish that i could work it out

verse 2
and the hardest part was letting go not taking part
you really broke my heart oh
and i tried to sing but i couldnt think of anything
and that was the hardest part oh oh

chorus 2
i can feel it go down
you left the sweetest taste in my mouth
youre a silver lining the clouds
oh and i
oh and i i wonder what its all about
i wonder what its all about
