i still remember
that hazy september
ive been waitin for somebody like you
to come back around

verse 1
we would walk in the park
every saturday
brand new all in love kissin time away
you was all up on me it was plain to see
that i was your girl
way back when it was the simple things
anklets name plates that you gave to me
sweet tarts ring pops
had that candy bling
and you were my world

prechorus
now i wish i could go back
and make time stop
i would take this love
throw back from the top
go dj play my song
and im gon think about you
all night long

back in the day we were in love
were not in love any more
but some days i sit and wish
we was in love again i wanna go back back
back in the day we were in love
were not in love anymore
but some days i sit and wish
we was in love again i wanna go back back
irresponsible things we would do like
fall asleep on the phone
and skippin school
now im back to the future missin you like candy bling
my sweet baby
my sweet thing like candy
felt like real love not just play play like candy bling
missin you my sweet baby
i cant delete your picture from my mind like candy bling

verse 2
it was everything that i could do
to stay away
and i often reminisce about
the games we played
oh yeah it was tag chase spin the bottle
them butterflies would last
till tomorrow
then the lights came on
i had to run right home
prechorus
and now i wish i could go back
and make time stop
and i would take this love
throw back from the top
go dj play my song
and im gon think about you
all night long

chorus
back in the day we were in love
were not in love any more
but some days i sit and wish boy i wish
we were in love again i wanna go back back
back in the day we were in love
were not in love anymore
but some days i sit and wish
we were in love again i wanna go back back
irresponsible things we would do like
fall asleep on the phone
and skippin school
now im back to the future missin you like candy bling
my sweet baby
my sweet thing like candy
felt like real love not just play play like candy bling
missin you my sweet baby my sweet sweet ooh
i cant delete your picture from my mind like candy bling
bridge
im the same mimi
fame aint changed me
butterfly flow like muhammad ali
wish i can bring you back like the odb
thinkin about the whirlpools
me you and jack
no matter what i do
all the memories are stacked
thinkin bout 10th grade
thinkin bout 11th
then you went dougie fresh
all the way to heaven

chorus
back in the day we were in love
were not in love any more
back in the day
but some days i sit and wish
we were in love again i wanna go back back
i sit and wish we was
back in the day we were in love
were not in love anymore
i wish we was just like back in the day
but some days i sit and wish
we were in love again i wanna go back back
irresponsible things we would do like
still remember
fall asleep on the phone
and skippin school
now im back to the future missin you like candy bling
now im back in the now im stuck in the future missing you
