and show me the way to get home
well im bluecollar branded and stuck in a mill
hard work is a way of life for me
well im too young to live like im over the hills
and too old to be wild and free

my heart is onward bound
im rolling with the feeling and i cant slow down
i need a guiding light
shining down to lead me through the night
oh southern star how i wish you would shine
and show me the way to get home

oh hey my dj friend would you play me one more song
and let my mind just go and drift away
now we all have a dreamand a place where we belong
somewhere we can go and escape

my heart is onward bound
im rolling with the feeling and i cant slow down
i need a guiding light
shining down to lead me throught the night
oh southern star how i wish you would shine
and show me the way to get home

and show me the way to get homeembed"
