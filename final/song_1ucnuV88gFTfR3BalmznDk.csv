time changed were different
but my mind still says redundant things can i not think
will you love this part of me
my lover is a day i cant forget
furthering my distance from you
realistically i cant leave now
but im okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
keep me from going crazy

verse 1
straight up ahead youll find a sign
that says you cant get by with a lie
but if i stayed away by a thread from the glory path
and made my life harder lying bout the stupid shit i say
then you wouldnt know a single thing about
how i feel about you and those really dumb things people feel
ill take the bumpy road itll probably break my legs
as long as i dont show you whats ruining my head
funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
but you havent found me yet at the bottom of the well
annoying you with smoke signals asking you for help
cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell
me and mr heart we say the cutest things about you
how you seem unreal and wed probably die so quick without you
suffocated from the radiated air around us
full of happiness we dont have brightness gone
so dark without you girl

will you love this part of me
my lover is a day i cant forget
furthering my distance from you
realistically i cant leave now
but im okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
keep me from going crazy

verse 2
family calls me crazy and my friends say im degenerate
but you tell me im so generous and my selfworth isnt hideous
this psychedelic canvas of the person im becoming
went from horror movie on tv to happyendingprincess me
processing the information transferred from your mind to me
at light speed like the falcon from the original star wars trilogy
feeling like a free ol me when i was six and no worries
would stop me from reaching the stars
a million miles away from me
sick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered
like a plague hitting my body except if i fall im just fallin for you
conscious beyond knowledge alterations are acknowledged
and the beauty youve inflicted is always in its action
lovely day today perfect time to open up to you
but i know that youre having fun
wouldnt wanna mess this up for you
but im happy that youre happy at least i do that much for you
always glad youre with me
this emotion will be gone before you know
chorus
time changed were different
but my mind still says redundant things can i not think
will you love this part of me
my lover is a day i cant forget
furthering my distance from you
realistically i cant leave now
but im okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
keep me from going crazy girl
time changed were different
but my mind still says redundant things can i not think
will you love this part of me
my lover is a day i cant forget
furthering my distance from you
realistically i cant leave now
but im okay as long as you keep me from going crazy
keep me from going crazy
