its in time with it

verse 1
in your brown eyes i walked away
in your brown eyes i couldnt stay
in your brown eyes youll watch her go
then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
what went wrong

chorus 1
if everything was everything but everything is over
everything could be everything if only we were older
i guess its just a silly song about you
and how i lost you and your brown eyes

verse 2
in your brown eyes i was feeling low
cause theyre brown eyes and you never know
got some brown eyes but i saw her face
i knew that it was wrong so baby turn the record on
play that song

chorus 1
where everything was everything but everything is over
everything could be everything if only we were older
i guess its just a silly song about you
and how i lost you and your brown eyes
