yeah you really tried boy
i was blind to all the lies you told me oh
all the shit youve done
you cant outrun the way you undersold me hey

prechorus
you acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
you dont even care
you focused your frustration on a small detail
blew it out of scale like my ponytail

chorus
well if you dont want to see the girl i want to be
then why then why should i listen
if you dont want to do the things i need from you
goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye
cause i gave it away i gave it away i gave it away
im taking it right back hey

verse 2
im no blow up doll no freeforall
no slave to your decision ahah hey
gotta find a way to break the spell
to get the hell away from those who block my vision
