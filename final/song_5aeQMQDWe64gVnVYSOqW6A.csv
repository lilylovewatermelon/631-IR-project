im sailin away to a place im afraid of
the dawn isnt here the sun hasnt rose
im drinkin my days with the coastal longshoreman
they got money to make and children back home
the last that i heard you were down in new orleans
workin your days at the print
i drink til i drown and i smoke til im burnin
your hands are all over my scent
i worry for you you worry for me
and its fine if we know we wont change
collect every dream in these old empty pockets
in hope that ill need them some day

chorus
but the wreckage of you i no longer reside in
and the bridges have long since been burnt
the ash of the home that i started the fire in
it starts to return to the earth
im leavin this town and im changin my address
i know that youll come if you want
its not halloween but the ghost you dressed up as
sure knows how to haunt yes it knows how to haunt

postchorus
mmhmmmm
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
its an ode to the hole that i found myself stuck in
a song for the grave that i dug
theres a murder of crows in the low light off boston
and i see your face in each one
im losin myself in the tiniest objects
im seein my life on a screen
im hearin your voice in a strange foreign language
if only i learned how to speak

chorus
but the wreckage of you i no longer reside in
the bridges have long since been burned
and the ash of the home that i started the fire in
it starts to return to the earth
im leavin this town and im changin my address
i know that youll come if you want
its not halloween but the ghost you dressed up as
sure knows how to haunt yeah you know how to haunt

postchorus
mmhmmmm ahooh ooh
know how to haunt
know how to haunt
mmhmmmm ahooh ooh
mmhmmmm ahooh ooh ooh
ah ooh
mmhmmmm ahoohooh oohooh
outro
i know that you fear that im wicked and weary
i know that youâ€™re fearin the end
but i only tell the truth when im sure that im lyin
so im settin sail once againembed"
