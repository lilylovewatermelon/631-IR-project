verse 4
juicy j
now it is time to get rough with the drama
bitches you cannot escape from the hearta
evil scarecrow
devil spells go
deep in my soul
put on my clothes
i scrip little hands and i must squeeze the whelpin
listen to sounds of the lit when we step in
f from us comes from the south territory
listen to some of my dmoney poetry
circles a trip plus its me smokin ganja
rich almost ripped tear by these on the furniture
so many soldiers are coming to destroy you
six million sinister satanic warriors
ill still feel drill will kill ninnimilli flama philly
i will fill the enemy with up by twenty slugs
to the mug four more tricks in the mud quick
i want all my tear da club thugs to rip this shit
chorus fades outembed"
