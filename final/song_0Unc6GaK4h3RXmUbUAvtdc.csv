its the tearing sound of love notes
drowning out these graystained windows
and the view outside is sterile
and im only two cubes down
id photocopy all the things that we could be
if you took the time to notice me
but you cant now i dont blame you
and its not your fault that no one ever does

chorus
but you dont work here anymore
its just a vacant threebyfour
and they might fill your place
a temporary standin for your face

postchorus
this happens all the time
and i cant help but think ill die alone

verse 2
so ill spend my time with strangers
a condition and its terminal
in this watercooler romance
and its coming to a close
we could be in the park and dancing by a tree
kicking over blades we see
or a dark beach with a black view
and pinpricks in the velvet catch our fall
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likechorus
but you dont work here anymore

i know you dont work here anymore
i know you dont work here anymore
i know you dont work here anymore
i know you dont work here anymore
i know you dont work here anymore anymore
i know you dont work here anymore anymore
sometimes i think ill die alone
sometimes i think ill die alone
sometimes i think ill die alone
live and breathe and die alone
sometimes i think ill die alone
sometimes i think ill die alone
sometimes i think ill die alone
i think id love to die alone
just just take take i think id love to die
me me down down i think id love to die
just just take take i think id love to die
me me down down i think id love to die alone
i think id love to die alone
i think id love to die alone
i think id love to die alone
live and breathe and die alone
i think id love to die alone
i think id love to die
