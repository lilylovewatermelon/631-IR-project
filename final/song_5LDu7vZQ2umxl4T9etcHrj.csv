around the curve come a passenger train
heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
jimmy hes dead hes been a long time gone
been a long time gone a long time gone

if you want to get to heaven gotta die
you gotta put on your coat and tie
want to get the rabbit out of the log
you gotta make a commotion like dog
like dog like dog yeah

well i got a good woman whats the matter with me
what makes me want to love every woman i see
i was trifling when i met her now im trifling again
and every woman she sees looks like the place i came in
looks like the place i came in place i came in

i got my name painted on my shirt
i aint no ordinary dude
i dont have to work
