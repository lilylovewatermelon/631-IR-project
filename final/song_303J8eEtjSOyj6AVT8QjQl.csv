let me feel you

verse 1
its been about a month and twenty days
and were going round and round playing silly games
now youre saying slow it down not right now
then you wink at me and walk away

prechorus
let it be let it be let it be known
hold on dont go
touching and teasing me telling me no
but this time i need to feel you

chorus
ride it were all alone
ride it just lose control
ride it ride it come touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you
ride it turn the lights down low
ride it from head to toe
ride it ride it touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you

verse 2
movida was the club on the saturday
you actin like a diva sayin you dont wanna pay
its gotta be ya feisty style raised eyebrow
i love it when you look at me that way
now were in you order a mojito at the bar
you reapply lippy cause it came off on the glass
the dj plays your favourite song kanyes on
now ya beckoning for me to dance

mmm pullin me pullin me pullin me close
just close your eyes girl close your eyes
whispering tellin me we gotta go
wont you take me home i wanna ride it

chorus
ride it were all alone
ride it just lose control
ride it ride it come touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you baby let me feel you
ride it turn the lights down low
ride it from head to toe
ride it ride it touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you

verse 3
everything was right until her phone began to ring
she takes it to the corner thats when i start wondering
i can hear her shouting banging fists against the door
yelling yo its over i cant take it anymore
then i walk away and act all nonchalant and chill
i aint tryna get all caught up in her mess for real
but she came on out and backed me up against the wall
she said i know youre hurt but ill make you forget it all
chorus
baby let me feel you
ride it were all alone oohooh
ride it just lose control lose control
ride it ride it come touch my soul come touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you let me feel you
ride it turn the lights down low turn the lights down low
ride it from head to toe from head to toe
ride it ride it touch my soul
ride it ride it let me feel you6embed"
