burn all the candles out
make a wish but not aloud
relive the here and now
to see you now and then
im a revolvin door
ive seen it all before
i will begin again
but i cant start until ive seen the end

verse 2
i took a look around
i believe in handmedowns
the treasures that we found
when we were brand new
now that were old and worn
a little ripped and torn
one day well be reborn
one day i will meet you right back here

prechorus
once again
wait
stop me so i can begin

im feelin out of luck
maybe i just feel too much
that old familiar touch
will always sting my skin
the good in everyone
the ties weve left undone
the heart that moves your blood
all the things that bring me right back here

wait
stop me so i can begin
