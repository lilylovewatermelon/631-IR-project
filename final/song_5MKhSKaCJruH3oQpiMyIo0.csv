theres a stranger in my bed
theres a pounding in my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingos in the pool
i smell like a mini bar
djs passed out in the yard
barbies on the barbecue
is this a hickey or a bruise

prechorus
pictures of last night ended up online
im screwed oh well
its a blacked out blur but im pretty sure it ruled

chorus
last friday night
yeah we danced on table tops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed but i forgot
last friday night
yeah we maxed our crеdit cards
and got kicked out of the bar
so we hit thе boulevard
last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny dipping in the dark
then had a ménage à trois
last friday night
yeah i think we broke the law
always say were going to stop woah

this friday night
do it all again
but this friday night
do it all again

verse 2
trying to connect the dots
dont know what to tell my boss
think the city towed my car
chandelier is on the floor
ripped my favorite party dress
warrants out for my arrest
think i need a ginger ale
this was such an epic fail

prechorus
pictures of last night ended up online
im screwed oh well
its a blacked out blur but im pretty sure it ruled

chorus
last friday night
yeah we danced on table tops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed but i forgot
last friday night
yeah we maxed our credit cards
and got kicked out of the bar
so we hit the boulevard
last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny dipping in the dark
then had a ménage à trois
last friday night
yeah i think we broke the law
always say were going to stop
postchorus
