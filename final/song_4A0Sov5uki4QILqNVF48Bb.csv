you fall through the trees
and you pray with your knees on the ground
for those things that you need
with your lust and your greed weighing down
and you weaken your love
and you hold it above your head
success is a song of the heart not a song of your head

chorus
and we all still die
yeah we all still die
what will you leave behind
oh we all still die

you fall through the trees
and you pray with your knees on the ground
for those things that you need

and you weaken your love
and you hold it above your head
success is a song of the heart not a song of your bed

and we all still die
yeah we all still die
what will you leave behind
