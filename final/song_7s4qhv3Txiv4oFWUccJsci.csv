i feel sorrow for the fear
and everything it brings
wonder if it will ever sleep
i know you understand
because you briefly look away
focusing on nothing
so now everything is clear

because theres no one to blame
you got no place to hide
its only in your mind
and i saw you in amazement
stumbling through the day
you told me time never waits
what is that supposed to mean

prechorus
all of life
is in one drop of the ocean
waiting to go home
just waiting to go home
and if the moon
can turn the tides it can pull the tears
and take them from our eyes
and make them into monsoons
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
and turn them into monsooner or later
theyll weave their way back to the sea
going to finally be free
yeah free for a while
until they break
like waves of sorrow
always do all into time
because time never waits

verse 2
daddy dont daydream again
just help me to believe and then
show me that theres more than the meantime

sonny do you hear the sound
you will feel it when it breaks
you will know it when its gone
how else can i explain

because its only the pain
its coming straight through
come into a mind
cross cut to you in amazement
stumbling through the day
you tell me that time never waits
thats okay because i dont wait for time
prechorus
when all of life
is in one drop of the ocean
waiting to go home
just waiting to go home
and if the moon
can turn the tides it can pull the tears
and take them from our eyes
and turn them into monsoons

chorus
and make them into monsooner or later
theyll weave their way back to the sea
going to finally be free
yeah free for a while
until they break
like waves of sorrow
always do all break all into time
because time never waits3embed"
