its a little too late
im a little too gone
a little too tired of this hanging on
so im letting go while im still strong enough to

im a little too blue
its a little too bad
you were too good to be true
im big time over you baby
its a little too late

only time you and me wasting is the time it takes to walk right out that door
yeah talk about water under the bridge

im letting go while im still strong enough to
its got a little too sad

its a little too bad
you were too good to be true
im big time over you baby

there was a time this heart of mine
would take you back every time
dont you know
its been two packs of cigarettes
a sleepless night a nervous wreck a day ago
now you aint got no business coming around
im closing up shop
shutting us down

chorus
its a little too late
im a little too gone
im a little too tired of just hanging on
so im letting go while im still strong enough to
its got a little too sad
im a little too blue
its a little too bad
you were too good to be true
im big time over you baby
its a little too late
im big time over you baby
its a little too lateembed"
