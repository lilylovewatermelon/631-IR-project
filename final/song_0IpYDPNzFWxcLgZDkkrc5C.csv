its crowded in worship today
as she slips in trying to fade into the faces
the girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than they know
farther than they know

chorus
but if we are the body
why arent his arms reaching
why arent his hands healing
why arent his words teaching
and if we are the body
why arent his feet going
why is his love not showing them there is a way
there is a way

verse 2
a traveler is far away from home
he sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row
the weight of their judgmental glances
tells him that his chances are better out on the road

chorus
but if we are the body
why arent his arms reaching
why arent his hands healing
why arent his words teaching
and if we are the body
why arent his feet going
why is his love not showing them there is a way
there is a way
see casting crowns liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likebridge
jesus paid much too high a price
for us to pick and choose who should come
and we are the body of christ

chorus
if we are the body
why arent his arms reaching
why arent his hands healing
why arent his words teaching
and if we are the body
why arent his feet going
why is his love not showing them there is a way
there is a way
if we are the body
why arent his arms reaching
why arent his hands healing
why arent his words teaching
and if we are the body
why arent his feet going
why is his love not showing them there is a way
jesus is the wayembed"
