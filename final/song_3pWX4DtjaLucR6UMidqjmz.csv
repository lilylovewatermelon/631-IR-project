ive been so many places
ive seen so many things
ive seen so many faces
been called so many names
kept getting into fights
just for staying in the lane
lifes full of adversities
you will if you stay the same

verse 1
never though a million years i would blow up
be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
and im the ceo call me the owner
and i can do anything that i wanna
and i rather be flying high
and id be gone
you can call me hollywood
and tip my heart and see my home
and you see

chorus

and all my fans are going out to buy my magazine

never though a million years i would blow up
be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
and im the ceo call me the owner
and i can do anything that i wanna
