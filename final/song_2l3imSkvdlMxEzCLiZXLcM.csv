lush hit me to pass the torch like a non smoker
heres calm closure im the dude who sends garbage to composters
this battle is cause your win streak is mince meat i felt like pissingall over
offer me a word of thanks i put you here
i didnt come to trust fall into your suburban gang
you in the bay curb your enthusiasm or get sent to the curb to plank
you and flex squabble you running red with a neck wobble like merton hanks
fuck a john cena before pic
me and him we was cool before this thats been changed
dont rinse face where i keep corpses
if this battle is not judged on shitty multi fads and high school musical swag then he forfeits
youve worn chicken scratch cursive shirts your last four fits
on a scale of 1 to 10 when it comes to you then 4 fits
call in reinforcements
drop any mac dre or heiro reference you can google to sway this crowd im calling horseshit
i steal on you its still on you horseshoes when a horse kick
blood disfigure youre formless til the floor slick
ima multi like youclears throatno i wont id force it
fuck a no name take this live action role play to your fortress in the forest
you dont win today
shit call me out shit me early duke game
stay on point i will make bobby hurley
will i beat psycoses
for fuck sake is dolly curvy
i brought a gurney spit just this round and sit down you would not be worth me
one hard hit psycoses seeing darkness like charlie murphy
this ass whooping lets stop itearly
you might also likeround 1 psycoses
its battle of the bay 6
and ive been waiting patiently to beset it
this kind of an event and they gave me flex to behead
and although hes a friend i know its time to grind
cause theres no button in life you can push for a reset
well fuck it
since its grind time i guess that means i need to be drect
that gun got a reflex thatll read flex and reflects the depression he gets
when he flex see less in his deflects reflection
so pretty much anything in his defense that he says with each breath at me just beat left
so in other words it deflects
im trying to see how far i can stretch flex ability
until the bars stiffen up in flex ability
stretch out flexibility stiffen up inflexibility ill bring it back in the third round in case yall aint feeling me
so if you thought i blew my load prematurely then youve been fucked since the match was set
my battle careers just getting started i havent climaxed it yet
but you think the tables turned and youre spinning back but youve already passed your best
so ill leave you back spinning when i turn tables cause youre not the real funkmaster flex
sick of this kid i get sick of this living when this clip is in
im hitting this kid and split him as quick as the dividend
they ask me how i feel about killing kids
not guilty like zimmerman so in a sense i get an inner sense of innocence
i was hitting your bitch from the beginning of winter
hidden ive been in her since
we dont have to bring in hoffa faggot you can do the math
you aint got bars like that
youre gonna have to live with this the rest of your life like herpes
you get close to the action but never fight for yourself irv dean
now hes just a bitch rapper getting fucked on cam germ free
faggot you cant handle these bars
someone tell chilla jones his opponent aint the only deadman on this card
you know what hes afraid to fight he wont throw knucks
hes afraid to get aktive so he acts cocky and wont show up
round 2 madflex
you got a lot of energy to match good
i went into this shit with high stress
think wild west at high noon
fucking tumbleweed blows by
feels like someone could die soon
type of stress that excites you all boss tycoons
battles that spark a fight moods
that round you spitam i in the fucking right room
if theres a prove yourself nearby youre lost and someone here can drive you
psychotic delusions misguide you
you are depressed off your meds or youve been lied to
you fruity you the food that my food eats
no way i take a standing  from channing tatum dude please
between you and me is authenticity missing when you speaking
my roots in the shit deeper than a 2002 movie
but lets pretend you fit in
i heard aspect said you winning
thats forgiven cause thats two events that motherfucker tripping
youngin listen
this next submission fit with the constriction of neck submissions
ill stand here since its your fantasy to be in flex position
now youre psychotic
why the fuck you calm now that you close to me
whats ironic is both sides im staring at a nobody
you a slow study hold it down and head back like your nose bloody
i can quote buddy to take away your credit like you owe money
i swear you said this shit
a retired flow is all i see in your senior citizen
shit bobby thats real as hell
youre known for occasional gun bar use one to kill yourself
what are we still talking for
i will excel youve lost the war
i dont care you got more white contacts than hopsins worn
this shit will put an end to your fucking streak like boxer shorts
thats a quadruple entente
youtube rewind i hope you caught all four
now check it out mc endomorphing act like yall not bored
you feel me
round 2 psycoses
so he quoted one of my lines from my last battle
ow who knew
well thats okay cause i got a quote from you too
you said in your battle with sindro
you want a hood pass but the hood pass dude trust me
you wont slump me one swing and i can teach you how to dougie

madflex
thats dope

psycoses
are you fucking serious
you think hes raw like eddie murphy but from the first time he stands up hes clearly delirious
you probably think its cool to say some shit like
ill leave you with a stanky leg youll get one of your knees clipped
all gold everything on the side of the piece sit
im different so im coming for those 2 chainz
you better find the police quick
or youre sure to die when the bullets fly like a g6
yoooou are a fucking fag and a damn actor
and since you have swag references and your raps plastered
ill dead this kid and spin his cap backwards
and leave his body in the closet like swag rappers
youre a jerk i know you cant spit bars like that and think its truly just fine
cause your bars are all ass and nothing else looney divine
and the reason why these veterans diss you and the rest will forget you
is because your set ups to punches take forever to get to
but youre madflex so i guess stretching a scheme is never an issue
see charismatic performance is all you have
but me i got freestyles rebuttals multis wordplay with bars stacked in schemes
so youll get jonesd if you act serius in this match with me
cause my punches shut shit down like summer madness 3

round 3 madflex
you taking up worthless space with this bullshit game of your charades
the truth is that i dont really think that youre to blame
i think the upper class did it its bad business
dont dabble in the role of a rap gimmick if you come from a town with the word ranch in it
man bobby here real familiar with them land limits
boy im from pittsburgh dont question thats mob figaz and jacka home
you raised in tall wilderness with dogs sniffing for jackalopes
its havoc on them ranches all tuna fish not ludicrous
sheep throwing up gang signs with they hooves and shit
cmon bobby his nickname is cool ranch never half stepping
rocking his dads stetson put that shit on everythinglike ranch dressing
look bobby this aint a rivalry
this shit contrived over hyped i barely even know this guy
i give a fuck you in the cobra ky
say shit i put this frame kick into overdrive
step up you get decked like a no comply
tell psycoses my emotion immobilize
rhymes
you bout to see paul blarts cadaver squirt
you will get massacred
get the big picture click the  i will beat your ass until your fuck you shirt is backwards

chokes and starts freestyling
quick spit what i might say some shit
maybe if i busted on your head with your umpire fucking look i might create a baby
for somebody fuck it im spitting shitting
kick your ass and your fucking second face
and then ill send em to replace a motherfucking
malathion calls time

round 3 psycoses
now at this point in the battle im feeling a little provoked
we had a month to prepare for this and you fucking choked
well now lets talk about why you suck
its because you dont rap at all
you have no tracks on bandcamp or numbers on soundscan to draw
you just battle mid tier opponents for no cash at all
your battle careers a train wreck and thats your flaw
wait a minutethat wasnt a choke i just had to pause
cause this is the first time ive seen a train wreck without tracks involved
and thats why in the industry youll be tied in a contract
but ill stretch the sin in him for flex
tie contract stretch synonyms for flex
to him im a great friend a straight 10 thatll extend a helping hand to stiffen up the ant in him for flex
straighten extend stiffen up antonyms for flex
do you understand who the fuck you went to war with yet
cause the poorest shit rapport within the metaphors you spit
are an informative torturous course you ensure the kids are informed of what boredom is
ill form a grip thatll contort your spinal cord from the form its in
with the centrifugal force of an orbit spin
no reforce more horribly morbid than a sorta quip and a george foreman fist
for the tip your organs just disordered him in storage bin as ornaments
and if youre ever restored again and wanna bring war well then fuck it
a fricking mortar hits im storming the shores of it
ill even make a movie for the shit and narrate the story script
for thinking youre a freeman like morgan is
and when i hit him up for this battle he was like i dont know i think the cards locked in and its all done
maybe you can get a spot if you call lush
so what did i do i called lush
he was like psycoses vs madflex cali is active its all done
then i hit this bitch back up
i was like its me and you on the card son
he was still like i don know were both undefeated and on a roll acting all shook and all starstruck
bitch act like an mc stop whining and put your fucking bars up
little homo fuck
malathion hold that mobile son i got eight bars left im almost done
so all that wordplay shit you got wont amount to shit
attention youtubers youre gonna need to rewind the fuck outta this
this guys been ducking so ill leave him undercover and thats for dodging
not even chuck clark would get you a new voicebox if you dont watch that tongue in your mouth
ill rip your vocal cords out and thats for talking
lush this fraud you lent is fake time for this cyclone to unwind cause thats a copy
ill head towards him when i shoulder arms
clip off ten then tendon thats a body
no disguise ducking undercover thats for dodging
voice box tongue in your mouth vocal cords thats for talking
fraudulent fake cyclone thats a copy
head shoulder arms tendons thats a bodyembed"
