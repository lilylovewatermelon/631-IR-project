bridge kendrick lamar
pick my daughter up she need all the love
i need all the love i mean all of us
its like six oclock bitch you talk too much
you makin it awkward love
i mean its hard enough i mean its—

verse 2 kodak black
they dont fuck with me even if they could
pull out the stick hit a bitch with the wood
first to park rolls royce vert in the hood
dont worry about us over here we good
the ap roman numeral everywhere i go i need pharmaceuticals
i ran my whole conglomerate i was just mappin shit out in the cubicle
suicide coupe was a funeral trackhawk launch like a slingshot
big ol ruby diamond on my pinky finger that bitch look like a ring pop
money on my mind money on your head
cant ride three times while you comin through the jects
red cross kept a nigga fed
in the studio with k dot fresh out the feds
yeah you niggas cant stand the rain you niggas dont stand a chance
yeah chevrolet candy paint i spin the bend in the benz
i caught a bale off a google app
im the type to get my shooter whacked
i had to survive off a tuna pack
five percent tint on the whip like who was that
coupe take off like its mad
beat the dope with a fork im whippin up sudafed im doin scams in the lab
every thursday girls day spendin time with my daughter make me go harder
every sundays sons day teach my boy to be a man i aint had no father
fell in the love with the block i aint have no pop just a sawedoff shotgun mossberg
we stackin that money up proper awkward diamonds look like marbles
audemars water aqua beatin the block up til we spot em
i dont want your ice boy i want your life but fuck it i still might rob em
chorus kendrick lamar
