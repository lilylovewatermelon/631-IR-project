eye on the tv cause tragedy thrills me
whatever flavor it happens to be like
killed by the husband
drowned by the ocean
shot by his own son
she used a poison in his tea
then kissed him goodbye
thats my kind of story
its no fun til someone dies
dont look at me like i am a monster
frown out your one face but with the other
stare like a junkie into the tv
stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
watches him die
hands to the sky cryin why oh why

chorus
cause i need to watch things die
from a distance
vicariously i live while the whole world dies
you all need it too dont lie

verse 2
why cant we just admit it
why cant we just admit it
we wont give pause until the blood is flowin
neither the brave nor bold
nor brightest of stories told
we wont give pause until the blood is flowin
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
i need to watch things die
from a good safe distance
vicariously i live while the whole world dies
you all feel the same so
why cant we just admit it

bridge
blood like rain come down
drum on grave and ground
part vampire part warrior
carnivore and voyeur
stare at the transmittal
sing to the death rattle
lalalalalalalalie
lalalalalalalalie
lalalalalalalalie
lalalalalalalalie

verse 3
credulous at best your desire to believe in
angels in the hearts of men
pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen
shouldnt have to say it all again
the universe is hostile so impersonal
devour to survive so it is so its always been
outro
we all feed on tragedy
its like blood to a vampire
vicariously i live while the whole world dies
much better you than i42embed"
