you want it out so just take my spawn
feel complete after its gone
dont sleep by my side sleep on the lawn
its not too late you wanted it gone

chorus alice glass
through the hosiery
to the armory
to the nothing
how does it feel when you cant feel nothing

verse 2 alice glass
give that guilt you shed a newborn
to your feet it falls to the floor
itching inside you still want more
stillborn fawn throw it to the door

chorus alice glass
through the hosiery
to the armory
to the nothing
how does it feel when you cant feel nothing

refrain alice glass
fifteen years youve waited for me
through preteen years of deficiency
cuts on my hands but you cant feel nothing
blood on my hands you can wipe up something
you might also likechorus alice glass
through the hosiery
to the armory
to the nothing
how does it feel when you cant feel nothing

verse 3 alice glass
drink sulfur spill it in my lap
my onus is the time that you lack
borrowed your womb you cant have it back
drink sulfur spit it all right back

refrain alice glass
fifteen years youve waited for me
through preteen years of deficiency
cuts on my hands but you cant feel nothing
blood on my hands you can wipe—4embed"
