im not a fortune teller i wont be bringing news
of what tomorrow brings ill leave that up to you
im not a fortune teller dont have a crystal ball
i cant predict the future cant see nothing at all
it doesnt mean im afraid of all the things that you say
but i just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
and as the seasons roll by no matter how hard i try
summer will end and the leaves will turn again

prechorus
i dont know why youre acting like this
i dont know why you had to do it again
whyd you have to go and ruin the night
dont worry about tomorrows mess

chorus
ill never know how the future will go
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller
ill never change but i want you to stay
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller

verse 2
i dont like watching tv i dont know what it all means
and your american dream baby it just isnt me
i know what im thinking may not be on your mind
i know the song im singing is not your favorite kind
it doesnt mean im afraid of all the things that you say
but i just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
and as the seasons roll back no matter how hard i try
summer will end and the leaves will turn again

chorus
ill never know how the future will go
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller
ill never change but i want you to stay
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller

this feeling keeps growing
these rivers keep flowing
how can i have answers
when you drown me in questions

chorus
ill never know how the future will go
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller
ill never change but i want you to stay
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller
ill never know how the future will go
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller
ill never change but i want you to stay
i dont know what to tell you im not a fortune teller3embed"
