hello you long shots
you dark horse runners
hairbrush singers dashboard drummers
hello you wild magnolias
just waiting to bloom
theres a little bit of all that inside of me and you
thank god even crazy dreams come true

verse 1
i stood at the bottom of some walls i thought i couldnt climb
i felt like cinderella at the ball just running out of time
so i know how it feels to be afraid
and think that its all gonna slip away
hold on hold on

chorus 2
heres to you free souls you firefly chasers
tree climbers porch swingers air guitar players
heres to you fearless dancers shaking walls in your bedrooms
theres a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
thank god even crazy dreams come true

verse 3
never let a bad day be enough
to go and talk you into giving up
sometimes everybody feels like you
oh feels like you just like you
yeah

ive met some gogetters
some difference makers
small town heroes and big chance takers
ive met some young hearts with something to prove
oh yeah

chorus
heres to you long shots
you dark horse runners
hairbrush singers and dashboard drummers
heres to you wild magnolias
just waiting to bloom
theres a little bit of all that inside of me and you
