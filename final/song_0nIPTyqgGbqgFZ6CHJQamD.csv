verse 1 pontius pilate
on my deathbed with like four bitches
every time i smoke i gotta light four swishers
how many times i gotta fucking say it
i dont fuck with motherfuckers less they talking payment
im in the basement and im choppin up a fuckboy
body bags in the back of da truck boy
soulja rag wearin i dont give a fuck boy
needle sharin with my cousin in the cut boy
blood spiller its the killer straight up outta hades
satans son ridin round in a new mercedes
everywhere i go these bitches tryna have my baby
everywhere i go the mottos always fuck you pay me

break john milton
let me give you a little inside information about god hes a sadist hes an absentee landlord worship that never

verse 2 oddy nuff da now leopard
leopard print on all my body lookin like a fuckin punk
between the middle and my triggerfingers where i hold the blunt
in my other hand i hold my nuts and then let out a grunt
throw a flame upon that chevy no it aint a fucking stunt
the money the money the money is all i want
lick breaks in the back while i hold up the front
i break in her back while i hold her and pump
im slumped like a monk yeah my trunk is vacant
ruby da cherry is very impatient
i aint got no time for no motherfuckin waitin
59 grey devil bitch we blazin up the basement
keep fuckboys locked up in cages they aint seen the sun in ages
countin cash im turning pages
constantly fucked up life is wasted yuhsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like3embed"
