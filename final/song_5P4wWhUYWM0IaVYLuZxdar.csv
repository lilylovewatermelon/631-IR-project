he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and its like
i couldnt ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine

chorus
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and its 2am and im cursing your name
youre so in love that you act insane
and thats the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
its a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and thats the way i loved you

verse 2
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
hes close to my mother
talks business with my father
hes charming and endearing
and im comfortable

bridge
he cant see the smile im faking
and my hearts not breaking
cause im not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating
intoxicating complicated
got away by some mistake and now

chorus
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
its 2am and im cursing your name
im so in love that i acted insane
and thats the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
its a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and thats the way i loved you oh oh
outro
and thats the way i loved you oh oh
never knew i could feel that much
and thats the way i loved you16embed"
