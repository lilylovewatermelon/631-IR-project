you know im back like i never left i never left
another sprint another step another step
another day another breath another breath
been chasing dreams but i never slept i never slept
i got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
seek and i find i can sleep when i die
want a piece of the pie grab the keys to the ride
and shit im straight im on my wave im on my wave
get out my wake im running late what can i say
i heard you die twice once when they bury you in the grave
and the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
so when i leave here on this earth did i take more than i gave
did i look out for the people or did i do it all for fame
legend its exodus searching for euphoria
trudging through the mud to find the present no ignoring us
got 20000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
my mama told me never bow your head woo

chorus skylar grey
i feel glorious glorious
got a chance to start again
i was born for this born for this
its who i am how could i forget
i made it through the darkest part of the night
and now i see the sunrise
now i feel glorious glorious
i feel glorious glorious

im feeling glorious
the crib looking victorian oh yes it is
you know that we been going in been going in
since we hopped out that delorean delorean yeah we win
en garde things are just things they dont make you who you are
cant pack up a uhaul and take it with you when youre gone
we posted on the porch my familys glasses to the stars
my grandma smiling down on me like woo that boy got bars
okay okay yes i do
i said amen and hallelujah let me testify too
another morning a morning wont let self get in my way
i got my breath i got my faith and i remember why i came woo

chorus skylar grey
i feel glorious glorious
got a chance to start again
i was born for this born for this
its who i am how could i forget
i made it through the darkest part of the night
and now i see the sunrise
now i feel glorious glorious
i feel glorious glorious

bridge skylar grey
we gon be alright put that on my life
when i open my eyes hope i see you shine
were planting a flag they dont understand
the world is up for grabs hey hey hey
we gon be alright put that on my life
when i open my eyes hope i see you shine
were planting a flag they dont understand
the world is up for grabs hey hey hey
chorus skylar grey
i feel glorious glorious
got a chance to start again
i was born for this born for this
its who i am how could i forget
i made it through the darkest part of the night
and now i see the sunrise
now i feel glorious glorious
