theres a cold feeling
running up and down my spine
it seems to say were just wasting time
its like a bad movie
one i wish id never seen
the plot gets old do you know what i mean
don’t try to tell me it aint what it is

chorus
im good
im good at seeing the signs
im good at reading between the lines
no use in hanging on
because youre good to go
and baby im good as gone

verse 2
on a lost highway
i dont know how i got where i am
take the next splitsville exit ramp
its like a cheap vacation
one we thought we planned very well
now weve checked out the lovely love hotel
don’t try to tell me it aint what it is

im good
im good at seeing the signs
im good at reading between the lines
no use in hanging on
because youre good to go
and baby im good as goneembed"
