naked truth lies only if you realize
appearing in nobodys eyes till they sterilize
stop the guerrilla warfare to keep it fair
bro change your rage to a smarter greater cause
you know the stake is high stardom is near
those who sympathized you die killers pass you by
do not waste your time in hating flirting guys
use your might to ais do justice to them all

now i face out i hold out
i reach out to the truth of my life
seeking to seize on the whole moment to now break away

oh god let me out
can you let me out
can you set me free from this dark inner world
save me now

last beat in the soul

yeah
naked truth lies only if you realize
appearing in nobodys eyes till they sterilize
stop the guerrilla warfare to keep it fair
bro change your rage to a smarter greater cause
you know the stake is high stardom is near
those who sympathized you die killers pass you by
do not waste your time in hating flirting guys
use your might to ais do justice to them all
you might also likenow i face out i hold out
i reach out to the truth of my life
seeking to seize on the whole moment to now break away

oh god let me out
can you let me out
can you set me free from this dark inner world
save me now

last beat in the soulembed"
