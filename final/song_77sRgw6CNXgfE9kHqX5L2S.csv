she said ive seen you in here before
i said ive been here a time or two
she said hello my name is bobby jo
meet my twin sister betty lou
and were both feeling kinda wild tonight
youre the only cowboy in this place
and if youre up for a rodeo
ill put a big texas smile on your face
i said girls

chorus
i aint as good as i once was
i got a few years on me now
but there was a time back in my prime
when i could really lay it down
and if you need some love tonight
then i might have just enough
i aint as good as i once was
but im as good once as i ever was

verse 2
i still hang out with my best friend dave
ive known him since we were kids at school
last night he had a few shots
got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
with a couple of redneck boys
one great big bad biker man
i heard david yell across the room
hey buddy how bout a helping hand
i said dave

i aint as good as i once was
my how the years have flown
but there was a time back in my prime
when i could really hold my own
but if you wanna fight tonight
guess those boys dont look all that tough
i aint as good as i once was
but im as good once as i ever was

bridge
i used to be hell on wheels
back when i was a younger man
now my body says you cant do this boy
but my pride says oh yes you can

chorus
i aint as good as i once was
thats just the cold hard truth
i still throw a few back talk a little smack
when im feeling bullet proof
so dont double dog dare me now
cause id have to call your bluff
i aint as good as i once was
but im as good once as i ever was
may not be good as i once was
but im as good once as i ever was2embed"
