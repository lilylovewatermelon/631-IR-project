i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right
but i gotta make sure its right for me
i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right
but you gotta work the thing right for me

verse 1 justin timberlake
little baby with the sun dress on
youre looking so damn right youre wrong
make me wanna write my own little song for you
the way the thing just wiggle in the air
turn around and then you flip your hair
i could think of a couple positions for you
youre wasting no time talking to me
must be something you want me to see
well baby girl dont mind me if i do
so take the stage and show me what you got
feeling lucky let me touch your spot
might be leaving with me before the night is through

chorus justin timberlake
i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right
but i gotta make sure its right for me
i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right
but you gotta work the thing right for me

your bodys saying things i aint never heard
you did the shakeshake and i kinda went berserk
gotta give it to you girl youre one of a kind
when you took my hand up so calm
touched it to your cherry lip balm
a million nasty things went through my mind
so baby tell me what youre doing later on
cause im thinking me and you could get along
baby girl dont mind me if i do
so take the stage and show me what you got
feeling lucky let me touch your spot
might be leaving with me before the night is through

chorus justin timberlake
i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right
but i gotta make sure its right for me
i got plans tonight
and you you know what i like
and youre approaching me right

verse 3 bubba sparxxx
yeah bubba come stumblin in
get up huntin betty with justin and them
we must be the flyest of southerner men
thats your girl well buddy dont fumble it then
you better get her im totally into my zone
come on girl close your eyes pretend that youre home
i will be puttin my signature on
that thing i dont even wan finish the song lets go
im gettin discouraged with her
too late now were friends i surely prefer
listen to every word that i slur
other dudes be huggin and nourishin her
not me i bet you remember the night

test the water let me know if the temperature right
thank you maam its certainly been a delight uhhuh
