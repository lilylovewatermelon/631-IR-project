you remember sittin there
one rainy night in a wellused chair
tellin me how well you used to dance
the western wind will come again
and make you feel like you did
when all those cowboys didnt stand a chance

verse 2
said his life took most of you gave you twice and the day was through
you said it all turned out awfully fair
so tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by
breathin in that cold november air

refrain
when no one was there
no one was there
when no one was there

verse 3
two kids bout twentythree
and the sunsets youll never see
you were yellin supper from the yard
and they grew old and sailed away
called you on phones from far away
wrote you novels on postcards
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 4
and all you ever wanted
was to see your children fly
maybe one day theyre a star
but there aint no leavin
this small town this evenin
you cant even drive your own car

refrain
through november air
through november air
through november air

chorus
dear ma hows it goin
was the weather fair last week
dear ma they were wonderful
all the sights youll never see
and dear ma if i could hold you id grab you by the arms
tell you what it means
you could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
and make him mean something

verse 5
tell us what you wanted to
in all we did we needed you
your dreams were too small to care
but im always reminded
if you look hard youll find it
memory gives warmth to right here
refrain
through november air
through november air
through november air

chorus
dear ma hows it goin
was the weather fair last week
dear ma they were wonderful
all the sights youll never see
and dear ma if i could hold you id grab you by the arms
tell you what it means
you could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
and make him mean something

outro
you remember sittin there
one rainy night in a wellused chair
tellin me how well you used to dance
the western wind will come again
and make you feel like you did
when all those cowboys didnt stand a chance1embed"
