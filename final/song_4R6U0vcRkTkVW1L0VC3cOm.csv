so you tell me that everything just isnt going well
well first off

verse 1
my only problem is death
fuck heaven i aint showin no religion respect
brain damage therapys the only thing i regret
talking to me is like a fucking body missin a neck
but im surprised i aint pop off my top off
life is a bitch and my cocks soft the glocks cocked
my hands tremble my finger slipped the walls red
her life is fucked shes sad now her son is dead
chorus
i told her im her worst nightmare nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air night air
or in your day dreams thats how death seems death
i told her im her worst nightmare nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air night air
or in your daydreams thats how death seems death

verse 2
when i was younger i would smile a lot
im gettin older gettin bolder but a wiser top
now im drunk drivin laps full of budweiser tops
life is a movie and youre just a prop
they begged me to stop but i listen like deaf drums
love i dont get none thats why im so hostile to the kids that get some
my father called me to tell me he loved me—
id have a better chance of gettin taylor swift to fuck me
annoying and im ugly most niggas wanna punch me
im surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
feel like humpty you hoping that ill fall fuck yall
im ace im parentless odd kinda arrogant
ignorant as fuck offend people for the hell of it
because i am the devil fucker get on my level
doughnuts and keys and kickflips supremes and markers
my life is ms monunique parker but a lil darker
ill see you in a couple of
see tyler the creator liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likehook
i told her im her worst nightmare nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air night air
or in your day dreams thats how death seems death
i told her im her worst nightmare nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air night air
or in your daydreams thats how death seems death

interlude dr tc
tyler heres some water man you you seem a little tense hows uh hows thebe

verse 3
all because a nigga just dont give a fuck
parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
but fuck that youre a shitty parent face it suck it up
thats what you shouldve did before that nigga bust huh
feel like i missed my lil brother growin up
feel like my lil brother missed his brother growin up
but this is golf wang like he missed his family growin up
i got a lil taller since the last time you seen me bruh
now im emo so fuck it im pourin up
but i never had a drink— sydney tylers throwin up
my nigga jasper said if i drink and get drunk enough
i wont feel the feelings i be feelin when im sobered up
but thats a fucking lie why would he say that im
as emotionally straight as travis when he—tyler calm down
dont look at me im 65 about to fucking cry
about another guy but this is golf wang do or die
i finally had a family
domos in another state and where the fuck is riley
now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
but before the cosigning and you fuckers couldnt find me
fuck that i hope you die in a fiery death
one ear i got kids screaming of is the best
the other ear i got tron cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
so i can kill these levels of stress shit
they say that im shock value
how about you hop off cock and turn volume down
i havent got around to tellin my mom shit why
cause i dont know how to whoa
all i want is her support but no but no its the fights at home
when mommy cusses out cousin some knifes get shown
now shes really fuckin pissed now shes really fucking pissed so the knives get thrown
and hit her in her fucking neck now her throats all gone
looking like a fucking monster from the twilight zone
then they wonder why i stay at travis pad with a backpack
for the whole week full of plasticwrapped black tees
and deodorant like his house is my home
i could live with the same hat
and the same flatscreen tv watchin flapjack
and the same bacon and waffles on a nice saturday
where i skate with the same fucking friends that
didnt give a fuck about fame or a name oh
message from the gza oh another one from plain pat
email full of emails i never write back
aint kill myself yet and i already want my life back
hook
i told her im her worst nightmare nightmare
this is hell you dont ever gotta fight fair fight fair
my spirit floats around in the night air night air
or in your day dreams thats how death seems death

verse 4
one shot two shots one gun two cops
im goin in flu shots couldnt kill me with two top rockers
youre on the side of faggots and cock blockers
im on the side of badass kids and the top notches
