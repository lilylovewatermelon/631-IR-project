anywhere i go anything i try
anyone i love is compromised
everyone i see staring on back at me
why cant you let me be

chorus
oh so far from home being shallow and alone
and why cant you see its tearing away what i used to be
im a shadow of a soul

verse 2
i dont know how to run i dont know where to hide
the old me is dead and gone inside
what will you think of me when all that youll ever see
is only a part of the other me

chorus
oh so far from home being shallow and alone
and why cant you see its tearing away what i used to be
im a shadow of a soul

chorus
oh so far from home being shallow and alone
and why cant you see its tearing away what i used to be
im a shadow of a soul

you can tear away the layers on the outside
but what lies underneath youll never find
to many people take it up on my faith
to many faces pressing up against my face

chorus
oh so far from home being shallow and alone
and why cant you see its tearing away what i used to be
im a shadow of a soul

chorus
oh so far from home being shallow and alone
and why cant you see its tearing away what i used to be
im a shadow of a soul

outro
oh so far from home im a shadow im a shadow of a soul
oh im so far from home im a shadow im a shadow of a soul
oh so far from home im a shadow im a shadow of a soul
oh im so far from home im a shadow im a shadow of a soulembed"
