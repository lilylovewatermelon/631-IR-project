tell me where am i supposed to go
and who am i supposed to believe
if only you knew what i knew
then you could see just what i see
ooh ooh ooh ooh

hook
so i grab my bags and go
as far away as i can go
cause everything aint what i used to know
and i try to hide
but i just cant hide no more
theres nothin worse than feelin like a ghost

verse 1
you say i look fine
if only you knew what was on my mind
youd see a whole different side
i couldnt show you even if i tried
i must have got lost in time
when i found out i was solely free to be
wherever i want to be

some say im out of sight
how ironic that were all so blind
if you could open up your eyes
you could see what i couldnt describe
and then youd see the signs
and then your soul would be set free
and then youd be released
you might also likehook
so i grab my bags and go
as far away as i can go
cause everything aint what i used to know
and i try to hide
but i just cant hide no more
theres nothin worse than feelin like a ghost

chorus
tell me where am i supposed to go
and who am i supposed to believe
if only you knew what i knew
then you could see hey yeah

hook
so i grab my bags and go i go
as far away as i can go which way to go
cause everything aint what i used to know
it aint what i used to know
and i try to hide hide hide
but i just cant hide no more no no no
theres nothin worse than feelin like a ghost
theres nothin worse

hook

cause everything aint what i used to know
