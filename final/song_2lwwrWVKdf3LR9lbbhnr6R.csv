i backed my car into a cop car the other day
well he just drove off sometimes lifes okay
i ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did i say
well you just laughed it off it was all okay

and well all float on okay
and well all float on okay
and well all float on okay

verse 2
a fake jamaican took every last dime with that scam
it was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
bad news comes dont you worry even when it lands
good news will work its way to all them plans
we both got fired on exactly the same day
well well float on good news is on the way
bring it on here we are win or lose win or lose
win or lose win or lose win or lose win or lose
win or lose win or lose i cant say

chorus
and well all float on okay
and well all float on okay
and well all float on okay
and well all float on alright
