stay away from me
build a fortress and shield your beliefs
touch the divine
as we fall in line

verse 2
can i believe when i dont trust
all your theories turn to dust
i choose to hide
from the allseeing eye

chorus
destroy this city of delusion
and break these walls down
and i will avenge
and justify my reasons with your blood

verse 3
you will not rest or settle for less
until you guzzle and squander whats left
do not deny
that you live and let die

chorus
destroy this city of delusion
and break these walls down
and i will avenge
and justify my reasons with your blood
