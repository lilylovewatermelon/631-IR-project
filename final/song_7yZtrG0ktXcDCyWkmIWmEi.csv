my conviction is stronger today
as i fight to uncover your sacred lie
and the fear isnt going away
as the soldiers still die
let your followers know
that their lives have been sold
for the good of your sacred lie
for the truth to be told
and the plan to unfold
we must start asking why

chorus
dont you know the war is far from over now
what a stumbling block weve fallen over now
as our brothers die defending no one
the war is far from over now

verse 2
liberation a moral charade
for the cause is a part of your sacred lie
damnation a moment away
in all the worlds eyes
its the doom of us all
we give in to control
for the sake of your sacred lie
complications abound
youll get used to the sound
of alarms in your life
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
dont you know the war is far from over now
what a stumbling block weve fallen over now
as our brothers die defending no one
the war is far from over now

bridge
give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
a moment of peace in our lifetime
give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
a moment of peace in our lifetime
give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
a moment of peace in our lifetime
give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
a moment of peace right now

chorus
dont you know the war is far from over now
what a stumbling block weve fallen over now
as our brothers die defending no one
the war is far from over now

dont you know the war is far from over now
what a stumbling block weve fallen over now
as our brothers die defending no one
the war is far from over nowembed"
