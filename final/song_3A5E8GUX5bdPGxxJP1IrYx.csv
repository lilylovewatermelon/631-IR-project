flaunt your will at every wheel
perish it your chocolate soul
cobblestones under your wheels

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind

verse 2 serj tankian
circumvent your thick ego
when in fights theyre on the go
you cant tell me that im real

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind

bridge serj tankian  daron malakian
fear waits fear waits
for us for us
when the present cant be sealed
away away
gold dust gold dust
now the dishes can be cleared
fear waits fear waits
for us for us
until the moment is revealed revealed
then turns then turns
to rust to rust
for the mighty conquered meal

cant you look at my shaved ass
ounce is gone and god is once
you cant see me suddenly

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
i got pictures on my mind
