for the love id fallen on
in the swampy august dawn
what a mischief you would bring young darling
when the onus is not all your own
when youre up for it before youve grown
woahohohoh ohoh ohoh

verse 2
from the faun forever gone
in the towers of your honeycomb
id a tore your hair out just to climb back darling
when youre filling out your only form
can you tell that its just ceremon’
now youve added up to what youre from
woahohohoh ohoh ohoh

bridge
build your tether rainout from your fragments
break the sailors table on your sacrum
fuck the fiercest fables i’m with hagen

verse 3
for the love comes the burning young
from the liver sweating through your tongue
well youre standing on my sternum
dont you climb down darling
oh the sermons are the first to rest
smoke on sundays when youre drunk and dressed
out the hollows where the swallow nests
woahohohoh ohoh ohohyou might also like8embed"
