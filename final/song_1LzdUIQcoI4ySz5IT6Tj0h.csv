what im feeling my heart is as numb as my taste
but it keeps beating watching as nights turn to days
cant feel my face cant shake this pain
stuck in my ways staring in space
so please dont leave me heaven is so far away
so far away

verse 1 jelly roll
call someone you love ever cry yourself to sleep
had a puddle on your pillow and still didnt find no peace
ive made mistakes out of desperation
im in a place of hate and selfdeprecation
sleepdeprivation ive been on a threeday bender
from the other side i can find my peace amongst the sinnеrs
ive been tryna stay sane put my sorrows in that cup
i been drowning all my pain with a bottle and a bud
now my hеarts racing and i feel the pain draining
and its like the suns blazing and i think the rains fading
ive learned that happiness is really only temporary
reading your obituary smoking at the cemetery

chorus jelly roll
what im feeling my heart is as numb as my taste
but it keeps beating watching as nights turn to days
cant feel my face cant shake this pain
stuck in my ways staring in space
so please dont leave me heaven is so far away
so far away
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 lex top dollar
i live in this depression a sadness i cant shake
when every conversations forced every smiles faked
unless we talking chloe i aint felt shit since 03 nah
and just to be clear shes the only thing keeping me here
cause home wont be here i promise you
i hear everything they say about me
dont already hate everything about me

chorus jelly roll
what im feeling my heart is as numb as my taste
but it keeps beating watching as nights turn to days
cant feel my face cant shake this pain
stuck in my ways staring in space
so please dont leave me heaven is so far away
so far awayembed"
