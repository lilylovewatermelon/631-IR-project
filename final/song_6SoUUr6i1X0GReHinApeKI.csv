when you were standing in the wake of devastation
when you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
and with the cataclysm raining down insides crying save me now
you were there impossibly alone
chorus chester bennington chester bennington  mike shinoda
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up hope but failures all youve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go let it go
verse 2 mike shinoda  chester bennington
and in a burst of light that blinded every angel
as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
you felt the gravity of tempered grace falling into empty space
no one there to catch you in their arms

chorus chester bennington chester bennington  mike shinoda
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up hope but failures all youve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go let it go

bridge band without chester whole band
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up hope but failures all youve known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
let it go
