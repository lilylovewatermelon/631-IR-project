motherfather before i forget
thank you for all that you have been to me
and just just in case you are wondering i love you
yeah oh

verse 1
i know that our differences caused us
to waste so much of our time
we could have used getting to know each and one another
but now that ive grown into my own
and learned some things about life
i now can see that it wasnt easy to raise someone like me yeah

chorus
motherfather oh before i forget
thank you for all that you have been to me yeah
and just in case you are wondering i love you
yes i do

verse 2
now see i remember those days when you used to sit me down
and try to school me about the plenty opportunities in life
hoping and wishing and praying that something would stick
and somehow click within this mind of mine
see you used to say if you throw enough on the wall
something is bound to rub off
and im here to tell you
that you dont have to really worry about me at all

listen now see
there was no limit to all the things that youve done
and would have for me my sisters and brothers
and ill never understand how you would talk all day long
and just as you said in one ear and out the other
isnt it funny how things change when you get older
and you start to see the things for yourself
and now i know that ill never find another love like yours inside anyone else
