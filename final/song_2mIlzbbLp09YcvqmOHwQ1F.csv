politics and evil
all one in the same
satan hides behind a different name

chorus
take these chains away
free my hands from bondage
cant explain our way
avarice will kill you in time

verse 2
violent upheaval
cities drenched in flame
wickedness we know we can contain

chorus
take these chains away
free my hands from bondage
cant explain our way
avarice will kill you in time

bridge
who will we murder now
see what we are becoming
an onyx veil that filters out the light
ill savor this anger
my hate makes me stronger
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
free my hands from bondage
take these chains away
running from destruction
avarice will kill you in time
kill you in timeembed"
