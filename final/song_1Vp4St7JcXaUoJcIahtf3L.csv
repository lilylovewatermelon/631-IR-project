man at least a dude with a car
so first of all we gonna work on the stomach
nobody wants a little tight ass

verse 1
one and two and three and four and get them sit ups right and
tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
give head stop breathe get up check your weave
dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
pick up your son dont disrespect your seed
