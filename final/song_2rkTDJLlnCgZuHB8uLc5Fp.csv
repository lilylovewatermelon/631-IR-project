ayo bans what you cookin
its malik on the track

khris james what the fuck

verse 1
street nigga and she got a real possessive body
youngin dont you want your life dont be stupid this aint kamikaze
how you posed to hustle you cant focus you out here takin roxies
knowin i got the trick like hocus pocus for to drop the boxes

chorus
hold your own young man
hold
and remember no love
inside these streets you roam

verse 2
go new york in a peacoat catch me jumpin out of taxis
just paid ten million for my taxes no time for flashin
transaction active he too flashy
whats the worse perhaps could happen
result in him tied up on the other sidе of the bed stuffed undеr the mattress
tryna twist my world around like she a rubiks cube
tryna bring some love around to stop my hustle ill murder cupid
she say you dont deserve me stupid you fuckin jerk let go of my shirt
since grandma died i aint go to church she a gospel woman the past hurt
in the 8atlanticsection hand in a pot im with vl
been a chef before a rapper i was tryna show em that my recipes still good still
duckin from a line of steel they done pried eight through the car
tell the bosses in my time im on the line hold your cigar
shots fired we send em back the neighbors say they saw us
and they knowin we cant control it but try protectin they lil boy
feelin insecure i could work you good but feel like a lil boy
thats just me im thinkin out loud but your bitchll tell you i go hard
i done jumped up out my sleep im on k2 its not that boy
no direction aint no plans just tell khris to just press record
just bought a new house for my girl my daughters and my lil boys
six million bitch im sittin on top the mountain like costello nigga

hold your own young man
hold
and remember no love
inside these streets you roam

verse 3
just did time became a hustler tryna turn it from backwards what that mean
he been tryna make the money keep on stackin
education out the streets dont need no lecture pastor
run from police they dont like me cause im a rich fuckin bastard
turn it up go faster i come from stolen cars to my own whip
got a shooter inside with me aint got no name they like who own him
told youngin dont leave the backside of that nawf they like who zoned him
finally rich i came home and turned around they said they cloned him
mathematics gon switch my whole position we play with numbers here
start it end it puttin shit in the grave this be them diggers yeah
green flag tattoos all on they face and they be quick to kill
from the environment holdin my bitch body it was an attempt to get me drilled
the art of water art of murder look who standin still
audemars came stainless steel
portrait painter cant even paint the kid
da tryna paint the picture
a lie i cant the truths i bid
signed a gentle bond still set the bid
dreamed of contract business as a kid
chorus
hold your own young man
hold
and remember no love
inside these streets you roamembed"
