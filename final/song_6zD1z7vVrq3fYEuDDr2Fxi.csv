tonights story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
a monster had arrived in the village
the major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
and this person or thing is soon to be met
he knows every thought he can feel every emotion
oh yes i did forget something didnt i i forgot to introduce you to the monster

verse 1
youre fearing me cause you know im a beast
watching you when you sleep when youre in bed im underneath
youre trapped in halls and my face is the walls
im the floor when you fall and when you scream its cause of me
im the living dead the dark thoughts in your head
i heard just what you said
thats why youve got to be threatened by me

chorus
you should be watching me you should feel threatened
while you sleep while you creep you should be threatened
every time your lady speaks she speaks to me threatened
half of me youll never be so you should feel threatened by me

verse 2
you think youre by yourself but its my touch you felt
im not a ghost from hell but ive got a spell on you
your worst nightmare its me im everywhere everywhere
in one blink ill disappear and then ill come back to haunt you
im telling you when you lie under tomb
im the one watching you
thats why you got to be threatened by me

verse 3 rod serling
the unknown monster is about to embark
from a far corner out of the dark
a nightmare thats the case
neverneverland thats the place
this particular monster can read minds
be in two places at the same time
this is judgment night execution slaughter
the devil ghosts this monster is torture
you can be sure of one thing thats fate
a human presence that you feel is strange
a monster that you can see disappear
a monster the worst thing to fear
