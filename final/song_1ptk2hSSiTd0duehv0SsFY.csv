slave away its just another day
its just another day without meaning
blue to gray another bill to pay
until you die under a glass ceiling
gas prices rise
we numb our feelings
monetized and bipolarized
by the drugs that theyve been dealing

chorus
staring awake at the ceiling
you promised never to forgive
tearing apart at the seams baby
you better learn to fucking live

postchorus
because this world dont give a shit

verse 2
run the track and fucking play it back
and ask yourself where you stopped believing
look inside you can no longer hide
the discontentment that youve been feeling
theres so much more
this life can hold
if you ignored the fucking broken record
of a dream youve bought and sold
you might also likechorus
staring awake at the ceiling
you promised never to forgive
tearing apart at the seams baby
you better learn to fucking
staring awake at the ceiling
you promised never to forgive
tearing apart at the seams baby
you better learn to fucking live

instrumental break

chorus
staring awake at the ceiling
you promised never to forgive
tearing apart at the seams baby
you better learn to fucking
staring awake at the ceiling
you promised never to forgive
tearing apart at the seams baby
you better learn to fucking live

outro
you better learn to fucking live
you better learn to fucking live live live live
you better learn to fucking live live live live
because this world dont give a shitembed"
