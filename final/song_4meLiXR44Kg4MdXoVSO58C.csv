could this be love at first sight or should i walk by again
youre photogenically dressed the conversation begins
oh god now what did i say let me start over again
could this be love at first sight oh wait i said that before
i need a place for the night happy to sleep on the floor
but dont go out of your way and i wont talk anymore

chorus
turn the lights off im in love
wouldnt you like to wouldnt you like to kiss her
wouldnt you like to wouldnt you like to dance with her
darkened nights and violent things vaudevillian girls and violin strings
all of these are the prettiest things when im in love

chorus
turn the lights off im falling in love with you
wouldnt you like to wouldnt you like to kiss her
wouldnt you like to wouldnt you like to dance with her
dark dark nights and violent things vaudevillian girls and violin strings
all of these are the prettiest things when im in loveyou might also like15embed"
