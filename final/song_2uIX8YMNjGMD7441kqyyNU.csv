ive been watchin you for some time
cant stop starin at those ocean eyes
burning cities and napalm skies
fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
your ocean eyes

chorus
no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you give me those ocean eyes
im scared
ive never fallen from quite this high
fallin into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes

verse 2
ive been walkin through a world gone blind
cant stop thinkin of your diamond mind
careful creature made friends with time
he left her lonely with a diamond mind
and those ocean eyes

chorus
no fair no fair
you really know how to make me cry
when you give me those ocean eyes those ocean eyes
im scared im scared
ive never fallen from quite this high
fallin into your ocean eyes
those ocean eyes
