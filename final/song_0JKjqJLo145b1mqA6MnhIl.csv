maybe this decision was a mistake
you probably dont care what i have to say
but its been heavy on my mind for months now
guess im trying to clear some mental space
i would love to talk to you in person
but i understand why that cant be
ill leave you alone for good i promise
if you answer this one question for me

hook
i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore
do you

verse 2
first off let me say congratulations
heard that you just had a baby girl
if she looks anything like her mother
shes the prettiest thing in the world
swear that im not trying to start no trouble
tell your fiance he can relax
ill leave you alone for good i promise
theres a question i just got to ask
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likehook
i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore
do you

bridge
i know what we have is dead and gone
too many times i made you cry
and i dont mean to interrupt your life
i just wonder do i ever cross your mind

hook
i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore
do you
i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore
do you
i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore

i just wonder
do you ever
think of me anymore
