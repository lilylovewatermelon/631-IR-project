and i would lie here in the trenches with your picture next to me
and when i told you its forever then its how its gonna be
dont wont let him just take the place of me no

does he really know you like i know you all the little things
does he really love you like i love you how can he compete
if he makes me fight for you die for you would he do the same
this is turning into way more than a game

now it feels like soldiers in a war and none of us are backing down
and i will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
cause he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna go
and i know just how this battle goes
he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna fight this kind of war

you know hes not the man you think he is hes hiding all his flaws
so tell me whats the point of fighting because well all end up with scars
but girl if thats what i must go through then im not prepared to lose
cause ive already bled so much for you no

does he really know you like i know you all the little things
does he really love you like i love you how can he compete
if he makes me fight for you i die for you would he do the same
baby this is turning into way more than a game
see jay sean liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likebaby cause were soldiers in a war and none of us are backing down
and i will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
cause he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna go
and i know just how this battle goes
he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna fight this kind of war no no

getting kind of sick of this battle
wish i could take it back to when i had you
im always thinking that i can have you just let him have you
its getting kinda hard to convince you

after all the shit that weve been through
why would you let all this happen
you gotta choice to make it stop
its already going too far

girl were soldiers in a war and none of us are backing down
and i will show you victory is mine before we leave this battleground
cause he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna go
and i know just how this battle goes
he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna fight this kind of war

cause he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna go
and i know just how this battle goes
he dont wanna leave and i dont wanna fight this kind of war2embed"
