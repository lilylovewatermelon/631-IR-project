verse 1
hey hey hey hey
i got my cup filled bitches all around me on some bachelor shit
eyes half closed heavy like they was attached to bricks
around the world i use my atlas make a map of it
globe trotter ho hopper superstar asterisk
people always wonder so they ask us who we are are
rollin up to clubs when we too young to hit the bar bar
wanna be on top and tryna get there by tomorrow
see the money bitches bubbly designer clothes foreign cars
but i i aint never gonna change different city every day
you hear these people scream my name
they think im underage and dont know shit about the game
til im drunk as fuck on the couch pourin out champagne
livin life like its my job and i dont ever take a day off
shit aint been the same since i seen my music take off
i be on some i dont give a fuck shit
still with my homies i came up with
so celebrate the fact that we young rich and famous

verse 2
