verse 1 post malone
im tryna see you from my own perspective
you all in my section tryna come to my session
we rollin up pressure you know that we flexin
we bought all the bottles we came with the models
girl this a confession im not like your exes
i came up from texas and now that we textin
you can fly in whenever now you undressin
panties on the dresser your hair gettin messed up
the feelin we catchin my love is a blessin
made love in a lexus made love in a lexus
i know you remember i know you remember
