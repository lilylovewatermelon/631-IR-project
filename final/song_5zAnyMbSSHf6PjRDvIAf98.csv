hello
theres a place
ive been going
theres a place ive been going
now im clean
it would seem
lets go somewhere ill be seen
as sad as it seems
i seen greg and he was like
i seen your friends at the birthday party
they were kinda fucked up before it even started
they were gonna go to the pinegrove show
they didnt know about all the weird stuff
so they just left it so they just left it
i was wasted i was wasted
and cold
and minding my business

verse 2
and i seen the girls and they were all like
do you wanna come and get fucked up
listen i got myself a missus says there cant be any kissing
no dont be a fridge you better wise up kid
its all adderall now it doesnt make you wanna do it
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeverse 3
this aint going well
i thought that i was stuck in hell
in a boring conversation with a girl called mel
about her friend in cincinnati called matty as well
you pulled away when i went in for the kiss
no it wasnt a diss
you put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss
after four years dont you think im over all this
thats rich from a man who cant shit in a hotel room
hes gotta share for a bit
you make a little hobby out of going to the lobby
to get things that they dont have

verse 4
does it go through ya when im talking to ya
you know that i could sue ya if were married
and you fuck up again
impress myself with stealth and bad health
and my wealth and progressive causes
then drink your kombucha and buy an ed ruscha
surely its a print cause im not made of it
look the fucking state of it
i came pretty late to it
we can still be mates cause its only a picture
outro
all your friends
in one place
oh were a scene
whatever that means
i depend
on my friends
to stay clean
as sad as it seems
as sad as it seems alright
as sad as it seems come on32embed"
