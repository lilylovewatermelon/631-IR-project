verse 1
its a beautiful state were in
but how can we love in isolation
think how happy we can be when we just try
were nothing like we seem
passionate words are never spoken
you dont know how i bleed when i leave your side

chorus
in your eyes loves alive
youve come untied
cause were flashin by
like satellites
satellites

verse 2
take all the rules away
how can we live if we dont change
were always on display
lets run and hide

chorus
in our eyes loves alive
weve come untied
cause were flashin by
like satellites
satellites
you might also likebridge
if we dont communicate
well exist in our own space space
we have all the love we need
while were apart i cannot breathe
