do you wanna make a deal
theres nothing i cant steal
its just about living
so make it strong but make it quiet
about living
its just about living

life on an iou
i see hope between us too
i borrowed it from someone new
something old for something blue
its just about living

what means lots and lots to you may mean
nothing much to me
but ask me why im here
or forget it for a year
its just about living
so make it strong but make it quiet
about living
its just about living
