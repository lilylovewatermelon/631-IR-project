breathing deeply walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
roller coaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time
verse 1 mark hoppus
leave me standing here act like im not around
the coast will probably never clear can i please go home now

prechorus 1 mark hoppus
i had that dream about you again
where i wait outside until you let me in
and there i stayed

verse 2 mark hoppus
lay beside me and listen at the wall
well keep on lying until the summer comes

prechorus 2 mark hoppus
i had that dream about you again
where you drive my car right off a fucking cliff

chorus mark hoppus
and now im breathing deeply walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
roller coaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time

verse 3 mark hoppus
make me promise that i will never tell
all i remember is the way her bedroom smelled

prechorus 1 mark hoppus
i had that dream about you again
where i wait outside until you let me in

chorus mark hoppus
and now im breathing deeply walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
roller coaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time goodnight
