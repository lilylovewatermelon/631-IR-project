1U5wqqEATmbCpSqADvSqy9,A Far Green Country,Howard Shore,2Re6RMBEfD8iv1HMxLMdzI,"1 contributori go to styles lyricsthe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “the styles case” has now somewhat subsided nevertheless in view of the worldwide notoriety which attended it i have been asked both by my friend poirot and the family themselves to write an account of the whole story this we trust will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist

i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair

i had been invalided home from the front and after spending some months in a rather depressing convalescent home was given a month’s sick leave having no near relations or friends i was trying to make up my mind what to do when i ran across john cavendish i had seen very little of him for some years indeed i had never known him particularly well he was a good fifteen years my senior for one thing though he hardly looked his fortyfive years as a boy though i had often stayed at styles his mother’s place in essex

we had a good yarn about old times and it ended in his inviting me down to styles to spend my leave there

“the mater will be delighted to see you again—after all those years” he added

“your mother keeps well” i asked

“oh yes i suppose you know that she has married again”

i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly mrs cavendish who had married john’s father when he was a widower with two sons had been a handsome woman of middleage as i remembered her she certainly could not be a day less than seventy now i recalled her as an energetic autocratic personality somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady bountiful she was a most generous woman and possessed a considerable fortune of her own

their countryplace styles court had been purchased by mr cavendish early in their married life he had been completely under his wife’s ascendancy so much so that on dying he left the place to her for her lifetime as well as the larger part of his income an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons their stepmother however had always been most generous to them indeed they were so young at the time of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother

lawrence the younger had been a delicate youth he had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions though his verses never had any marked success

john practised for some time as a barrister but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire he had married two years ago and had taken his wife to live at styles though i entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance which would have enabled him to have a home of his own mrs cavendish however was a lady who liked to make her own plans and expected other people to fall in with them and in this case she certainly had the whip hand namely the purse strings

john noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and smiled rather ruefully

“rotten little bounder too” he said savagely “i can tell you hastings it’s making life jolly difficult for us as for evie—you remember evie”
“no”

“oh i suppose she was after your time she’s the mater’s factotum companion jack of all trades a great sport—old evie not precisely young and beautiful but as game as they make them”

“you were going to say——”

“oh this fellow he turned up from nowhere on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of evie’s though she didn’t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship the fellow is an absolute outsider anyone can see that he’s got a great black beard and wears patent leather boots in all weathers but the mater cottoned to him at once took him on as secretary—you know how she’s always running a hundred societies”

i nodded

“well of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands no doubt the fellow was very useful to her but you could have knocked us all down with a feather when three months ago she suddenly announced that she and alfred were engaged the fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is it’s simply barefaced fortune hunting but there you are—she is her own mistress and she’s married him”

“it must be a difficult situation for you all”

“difficult it’s damnable”

thus it came about that three days later i descended from the train at styles st mary an absurd little station with no apparent reason for existence perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes john cavendish was waiting on the platform and piloted me out to the car

“got a drop or two of petrol still you see” he remarked “mainly owing to the mater’s activities”

the village of styles st mary was situated about two miles from the little station and styles court lay a mile the other side of it it was a still warm day in early july as one looked out over the flat essex country lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun it seemed almost impossible to believe that not so very far away a great war was running its appointed course i felt i had suddenly strayed into another world as we turned in at the lodge gates john said

“i’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here hastings”

“my dear fellow that’s just what i want”
“oh it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life i drill with the volunteers twice a week and lend a hand at the farms my wife works regularly ‘on the land’ she is up at five every morning to milk and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime it’s a jolly good life taking it all round—if it weren’t for that fellow alfred inglethorp” he checked the car suddenly and glanced at his watch “i wonder if we’ve time to pick up cynthia no she’ll have started from the hospital by now”

“cynthia that’s not your wife”

“no cynthia is a protégée of my mother’s the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor he came a cropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless my mother came to the rescue and cynthia has been with us nearly two years now she works in the red cross hospital at tadminster seven miles away”

as he spoke the last words we drew up in front of the fine old house a lady in a stout tweed skirt who was bending over a flower bed straightened herself at our approach

“hullo evie here’s our wounded hero mr hastings—miss howard”

miss howard shook hands with a hearty almost painful grip i had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face she was a pleasantlooking woman of about forty with a deep voice almost manly in its stentorian tones and had a large sensible square body with feet to match—these last encased in good thick boots her conversation i soon found was couched in the telegraphic style

“weeds grow like house afire can’t keep even with ’em shall press you in better be careful”

“i’m sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful” i responded

“don’t say it never does wish you hadn’t later”

“you’re a cynic evie” said john laughing “where’s tea today—inside or out”

“out too fine a day to be cooped up in the house”

“come on then you’ve done enough gardening for today ‘the labourer is worthy of his hire’ you know come and be refreshed”

“well” said miss howard drawing off her gardening gloves “i’m inclined to agree with you”
she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore

a figure rose from one of the basket chairs and came a few steps to meet us

“my wife hastings” said john

i shall never forget my first sight of mary cavendish her tall slender form outlined against the bright light the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers remarkable eyes different from any other woman’s that i have ever known the intense power of stillness she possessed which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body—all these things are burnt into my memory i shall never forget them

she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i had accepted john’s invitation mrs cavendish gave me some tea and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman an appreciative listener is always stimulating and i described in a humorous manner certain incidents of my convalescent home in a way which i flatter myself greatly amused my hostess john of course good fellow though he is could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist

at that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french window near at hand

“then you’ll write to the princess after tea alfred i’ll write to lady tadminster for the second day myself or shall we wait until we hear from the princess in case of a refusal lady tadminster might open it the first day and mrs crosbie the second then there’s the duchess—about the school fête”

there was the murmur of a man’s voice and then mrs inglethorp’s rose in reply

“yes certainly after tea will do quite well you are so thoughtful alfred dear”

the french window swung open a little wider and a handsome whitehaired old lady with a somewhat masterful cast of features stepped out of it on to the lawn a man followed her a suggestion of deference in his manner

mrs inglethorp greeted me with effusion

“why if it isn’t too delightful to see you again mr hastings after all these years alfred darling mr hastings—my husband”

i looked with some curiosity at “alfred darling” he certainly struck a rather alien note i did not wonder at john objecting to his beard it was one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen he wore goldrimmed pincenez and had a curious impassivity of feature it struck me that he might look natural on a stage but was strangely out of place in real life his voice was rather deep and unctuous he placed a wooden hand in mine and said

“this is a pleasure mr hastings” then turning to his wife “emily dearest i think that cushion is a little damp”

she beamed fondly on him as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman

with the presence of mr inglethorp a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company miss howard in particular took no pains to conceal her feelings mrs inglethorp however seemed to notice nothing unusual her volubility which i remembered of old had lost nothing in the intervening years and she poured out a steady flood of conversation mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates his watchful and attentive manner never varied from the very first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him and i flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd

presently mrs inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to evelyn howard and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice

“is soldiering your regular profession mr hastings”

“no before the war i was in lloyd’s”

“and you will return there after it is over”

“perhaps either that or a fresh start altogether”

mary cavendish leant forward

“what would you really choose as a profession if you could just consult your inclination”

“well that depends”

“no secret hobby” she asked “tell me—you’re drawn to something everyone is—usually something absurd”

“you’ll laugh at me”

she smiled

“perhaps”

“well i’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective”

“the real thing—scotland yard or sherlock holmes”

“oh sherlock holmes by all means but really seriously i am awfully drawn to it i came across a man in belgium once a very famous detective and he quite inflamed me he was a marvellous little fellow he used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method my system is based on his—though of course i have progressed rather further he was a funny little man a great dandy but wonderfully clever”

“like a good detective story myself” remarked miss howard “lots of nonsense written though criminal discovered in last chapter everyone dumbfounded real crime—you’d know at once”

“there have been a great number of undiscovered crimes” i argued

“don’t mean the police but the people that are right in it the family you couldn’t really hoodwink them they’d know”

“then” i said much amused “you think that if you were mixed up in a crime say a murder you’d be able to spot the murderer right off”

“of course i should mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers but i’m certain i’d know i’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me”

“it might be a ‘she’” i suggested

“might but murder’s a violent crime associate it more with a man”

“not in a case of poisoning” mrs cavendish’s clear voice startled me “dr bauerstein was saying yesterday that owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected”

“why mary what a gruesome conversation” cried mrs inglethorp “it makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave oh there’s cynthia”

a young girl in vad uniform ran lightly across the lawn

“why cynthia you are late today this is mr hastings—miss murdoch”

cynthia murdoch was a freshlooking young creature full of life and vigour she tossed off her little vad cap and i admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea with dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty

she flung herself down on the ground beside john and as i handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me

“sit down here on the grass do it’s ever so much nicer”

i dropped down obediently

“you work at tadminster don’t you miss murdoch”

she nodded

“for my sins”

“do they bully you then” i asked smiling

“i should like to see them” cried cynthia with dignity

“i have got a cousin who is nursing” i remarked “and she is terrified of ‘sisters’”

“i don’t wonder sisters are you know mr hastings they simply are you’ve no idea but i’m not a nurse thank heaven i work in the dispensary”

“how many people do you poison” i asked smiling

cynthia smiled too

“oh hundreds” she said

“cynthia” called mrs inglethorp “do you think you could write a few notes for me”

“certainly aunt emily”

she jumped up promptly and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one and that mrs inglethorp kind as she might be in the main did not allow her to forget it

my hostess turned to me

“john will show you your room supper is at halfpast seven we have given up late dinner for some time now lady tadminster our member’s wife—she was the late lord abbotsbury’s daughter—does the same she agrees with me that one must set an example of economy we are quite a war household nothing is wasted here—every scrap of waste paper even is saved and sent away in sacks”

i expressed my appreciation and john took me into the house and up the broad staircase which forked right and left halfway to different wings of the building my room was in the left wing and looked out over the park

john left me and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with cynthia murdoch i heard mrs inglethorp call “cynthia” impatiently and the girl started and ran back to the house at the same moment a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction he looked about forty very dark with a melancholy cleanshaven face some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him he looked up at my window as he passed and i recognized him though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met it was john’s younger brother lawrence cavendish i wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face

then i dismissed him from my mind and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs

the evening passed pleasantly enough and i dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman mary cavendish

the next morning dawned bright and sunny and i was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit

i did not see mrs cavendish until lunchtime when she volunteered to take me for a walk and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods returning to the house about five

as we entered the large hall john beckoned us both into the smokingroom i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred we followed him in and he shut the door after us

“look here mary there’s the deuce of a mess evie’s had a row with alfred inglethorp and she’s off”

“evie off”

john nodded gloomily

“yes you see she went to the mater and—oh—here’s evie herself”

miss howard entered her lips were set grimly together and she carried a small suitcase she looked excited and determined and slightly on the defensive

“at any rate” she burst out “i’ve spoken my mind”

“my dear evelyn” cried mrs cavendish “this can’t be true”

miss howard nodded grimly

“true enough afraid i said some things to emily she won’t forget or forgive in a hurry don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit probably water off a duck’s back though i said right out ‘you’re an old woman emily and there’s no fool like an old fool the man’s twenty years younger than you and don’t you fool yourself as to what he married you for money well don’t let him have too much of it farmer raikes has got a very pretty young wife just ask your alfred how much time he spends over there’ she was very angry natural i went on ‘i’m going to warn you whether you like it or not that man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you he’s a bad lot you can say what you like to me but remember what i’ve told you he’s a bad lot’”

“what did she say”

miss howard made an extremely expressive grimace

“‘darling alfred’—‘dearest alfred’—‘wicked calumnies’ —‘wicked lies’—‘wicked woman’—to accuse her ‘dear husband’ the sooner i left her house the better so i’m off”

“but not now”

“this minute”

for a moment we sat and stared at her finally john cavendish finding his persuasions of no avail went off to look up the trains his wife followed him murmuring something about persuading mrs inglethorp to think better of it

as she left the room miss howard’s face changed she leant towards me eagerly

“mr hastings you’re honest i can trust you”

i was a little startled she laid her hand on my arm and sank her voice to a whisper

“look after her mr hastings my poor emily they’re a lot of sharks—all of them oh i know what i’m talking about there isn’t one of them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her i’ve protected her as much as i could now i’m out of the way they’ll impose upon her”

“of course miss howard” i said “i’ll do everything i can but i’m sure you’re excited and overwrought”

she interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger

“young man trust me i’ve lived in the world rather longer than you have all i ask you is to keep your eyes open you’ll see what i mean”

the throb of the motor came through the open window and miss howard rose and moved to the door john’s voice sounded outside with her hand on the handle she turned her head over her shoulder and beckoned to me

“above all mr hastings watch that devil—her husband”

there was no time for more miss howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and goodbyes the inglethorps did not appear

as the motor drove away mrs cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house the colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him

“who is that” i asked sharply for instinctively i distrusted the man

“that’s dr bauerstein” said john shortly

“and who is dr bauerstein”

“he’s staying in the village doing a rest cure after a bad nervous breakdown he’s a london specialist a very clever man—one of the greatest living experts on poisons i believe”

“and he’s a great friend of mary’s” put in cynthia the irrepressible

john cavendish frowned and changed the subject

“come for a stroll hastings this has been a most rotten business she always had a rough tongue but there is no stauncher friend in england than evelyn howard”

he took the path through the plantation and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate

as we passed through one of the gates on our way home again a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled

“that’s a pretty girl” i remarked appreciatively

john’s face hardened

“that is mrs raikes”

“the one that miss howard——”

“exactly” said john with rather unnecessary abruptness

i thought of the whitehaired old lady in the big house and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me i brushed it aside

“styles is really a glorious old place” i said to john

he nodded rather gloomily

“yes it’s a fine property it’ll be mine some day—should be mine now by rights if my father had only made a decent will and then i shouldn’t be so damned hard up as i am now”

“hard up are you”

“my dear hastings i don’t mind telling you that i’m at my wits’ end for money”

“couldn’t your brother help you”

“lawrence he’s gone through every penny he ever had publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings no we’re an impecunious lot my mother’s always been awfully good to us i must say that is up to now since her marriage of course——” he broke off frowning

for the first time i felt that with evelyn howard something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere her presence had spelt security now that security was removed—and the air seemed rife with suspicion the sinister face of dr bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly a vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evilembed"
