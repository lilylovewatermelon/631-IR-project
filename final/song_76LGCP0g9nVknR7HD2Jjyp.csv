one two three four
all the things that you said was it all in my head

verse 1 danny worsnop
come on baby keep it down
honey hush your lips
clothes trailing from the backdoor
to the bedroom and i dont even know your name hoe
give me all youve got make this night worth my time
make this worth my time oh
what id give to live this night again
i knew when i first saw you youd fuck like a whore
youd fuck like a whore
hope they hear you scream for more yeah

chorus danny worsnop
your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
my lips your poison they bring you to your knees
your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
my lips your poison they bring you to your knees
ah come on

verse 2 danny worsnop
and after all of all my dreaming being only you
youre standing there baby oh the things that i could do
back to the wall with a drink in my hand

bridge ben bruce
and one step too late and i never told you never told you
that i cant take another disappointment
breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending

outro danny worsnop ben bruce

with your back against the wall
with your face buried in the pillow
i see you cold i feel you heartless
bitch you stupid fucking bitch you stupid fucking bitch
