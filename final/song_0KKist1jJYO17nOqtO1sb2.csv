mother mary heard us approaching her door
though we didnt make a sound
theres nothing like finding gold
within the rocks hard and cold
im so surprised to find more
always surprised to find more
i wont look back anymore
i left the people that do
its not the chase that i love
its me following you

my my heart like a kick drum
my my heart like a kick drum
my my heart like a kick drum
my my love like a voice
