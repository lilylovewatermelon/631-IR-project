how i let everything i cherish lay to waste
i am lost in greed this time its definitely me
i point fingers but theres no one there to blame

a need for something now let me break it down again
a need for something but not more medicine

i am sick of wanting and its evil how its got me
and every day is worse than the one before
the more i have the more i think im almost where i need to be
if only i could get a little more

a need for something now let me break it down again
a need for something but not more medicine

something has me oh something has me
acting like someone i dont wanna be
something has me oh something has me
acting like someone i know isnt me
ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed

temporary is my time aint nothing on this world thats mine
except the will i found to carry on
free is not your right to chose
its answering whats asked of you
to give the love you find until its gone
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likea need for something now let me break it down again
a need for something but not more medicine

something has me oh something has me
acting like someone i dont wanna be
something has me oh something has me
acting like someone i know isnt me
ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed1embed"
