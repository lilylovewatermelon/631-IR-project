theres gotta be a reason that im here on earth
gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
the changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
so whats it worth whats it worth
worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
another drop of poison that is slowly sinking in
if were going down together better take another hit
we wont be here forever so lets make the best of it

verse 1
walking down to the burial ground
with a sad song in his brain
general cloud is an old man now
but it feels like yesterday
he was on the front lines stranded on the beach
crawling to his best friend floating in the sea
but he didnt make it he still cant believe
how arbitrary fate is he says

verse 2
she went down to her job in town
with a sad song in her heart
33 with a wasted dream to become a movie star
living out a suitcase serving at a bar
saving up some pennies working after dark
is she gonna make it she still cant believe
how arbitrary fate is she says
