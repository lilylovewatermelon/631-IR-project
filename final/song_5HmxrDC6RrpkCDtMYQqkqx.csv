take a hit of anything
to escape it all im suffocating
a sharpened blade of reality
sometimes i wanna hurt me
i know its hard to hear but im
waitin for the new year
dont wanna waste my life chasin white
try to swim towards the light

chorus
comin up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
i thought i learned it all but boom the plot thickens
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety
lalalalalalala
got so tired of feelin numb
lalalalalalala
well take a look what ive become
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety

verse 2
wanna make you proud of me
but slowly i am killing me
playing with chemistry
floating to thе ceiling
always rock n roll til you die you know you been flyin
now im shaking at night sweating thе sheets out
grinding my teeth out
but still the world will glamorize it all
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likechorus
comin up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
i thought i learned it all but boom the plot thickens
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety
lalalalalalala
got so tired of feelin numb
lalalalalalala
well take a look what ive become
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety

bridge
if i could leave one thing for you
its exactly what not to do
im so proud of you
take a look what ive become
oh take a look what ive

chorus
comin up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
i thought i learned it all but boom the plot thickens
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety
lalalalalalala
got so tired of feelin numb
lalalalalalala
well take a look what ive become
sleepin with giants im tiptoein quietly
feelin it all its sobriety10embed"
