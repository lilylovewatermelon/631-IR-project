shes got a pretty smile
it covers up the poison that she hides
she walks around in circles in my head
waiting for a chance to break me chance to take me down
now i see the burden you gave me
is too much to carry too much to bury inside

prechorus
i guess youre the only one that nobody changes
i guess youre the only one left standing

chorus
when everything else goes down
youre still the only one
yeah youre still the only one

verse 2
its all shallow and all so appealing now
im up to my ankles and im drowning anyway
in a sea of sarcastic faces familiar places
everything looks quite the same here
its all confusingly amusing
bitter and tainted the picture you painted to me

prechorus
i guess youre the only one that nobody changes
i guess youre the only one left standing

when everything else goes down
youre still the only one
who hasnt changed faces
i guess youre the only one left standing
when everything else goes down

verse 3
just because its all in your head
doesnt mean it has to be in mine
dont believe what you said
still cant get it out of my mind
ive tried to find myself in approval
ive already been there already done that
it got me nowhere it brought me nothing
but a good place to hide and no one to confide in now

outro
i guess youre the only one that nobody changes
i guess youre the only one that will never change faces
i guess youre the only one1embed"
