i miss you i miss you girl

maybe just maybe
i need you i need you here

sundays on mondays
ill see you and calm you

till that guy with the money
with no heart you still love him why

drowning in the river where my heart was once a quiver
to the cupid in san pedro by the high cliffs near your lovers building
drowning in the river where my heart was once a quiver
to the cupid in san pedro by the high cliffs near your lovers building

lost in dimensions
with no one to guide me

from the utopia to europa
to europe back to your place dear

im at your front door
but im dead cant knock now dear
you might also likewill you still open
to say bye i miss you mel

drowning in the river where my heart was once a quiver
to the cupid in san pedro by the high cliffs near your lovers building
drowning in the river where my heart was once a quiver
to the cupid in san pedro by the high cliffs near your lovers building3embed"
