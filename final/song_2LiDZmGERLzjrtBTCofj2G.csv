pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist
pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist

verse 1
that first friend you had that worst thing you said
that perfect moment that last tear you shed
all youve done in bed all on memorex
all roundround your head all roundround your head
chorus
pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist
pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist

verse 2
youve had too much of the digital love
you want everything live you want things you can touch
make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
make it feel like that song that just unopened you
you were ten years old holdin hands in the classroom
he had a gun on the first day of high school
you want something bizarre old conceptual cars
you want girls dressed in drag you want boys with guitars
you might also likechorus
pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist
pullin down backstreets deep in your head
slippin through dreamland like a tourist

verse 3
you see kodachrome you see pink and gold
you see mulholland glow you see in airplane mode
all roundround your head all roundround your head
all roundround your head all roundround your head

outro
you float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
you go ask your questions like what makes a man
oh its 2020 so its time to change that
so you go make an album and call it dreamland13embed"
