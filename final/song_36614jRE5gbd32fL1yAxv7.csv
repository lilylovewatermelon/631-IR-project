im lost and alone
though i said id go before us
and show the way back home
is there a light up ahead
i cant hold on very long
forgive me pretty baby
but i always take the long way home

moneys just something you throw
off the back of a train
i got a head full of lightning
and a hat full of rain
and i know that i said
id never do it again
oh and i love you sweet baby
but i always take the long way home

i put food on the table
and a roof overhead
but id trade it all tomorrow
for the highway instead
watch your back if i should tell you
loves the only thing ive ever known
one thing for sure sweet baby
i always take the long way home
see norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeyou know i love you baby
more than the whole wide world
im your woman
you know you are my pearl
so lets go out past the party lights
where we can finally be alone
come with me
and we can take the long way home

come with me
together we can take the long way home
come with me
together we can take the long way homeembed"
