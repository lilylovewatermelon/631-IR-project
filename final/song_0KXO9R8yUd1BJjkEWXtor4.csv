verse 1 juicy j
nose all runny found a snow bunny
take her to the crib make her drink cummy
im from the hood i aint never did this
but now i can say that i done done it

i called him up to house this slut
we gon fuck her in the back of the bus
and fill her nose up full of that dust
three 6 mafia wild on tour
whoopin these niggas and fuckin these whores
in the bathroom bout two whole hours
gettin real high passed out on the floor
fuck that shit niggas out the frame
take a oneonone back in the game
back on the street back on the strip

verse 3 dj paul
my nostrils so stopped up i cant even smell the weed smoke
the green man done got locked up so i better make the best out this dro
i sniff i choke i really enjoy myself
it might seem like im sick but that done kicked in and got me there
i got a couple of chocolate thangs i got me a couple of white thangs
i got me a couple of chinese bitches that pussy really sideways
a gallon bag ziploc filled to the brim with a pound in it
me and scarecrow gon fuck these hoes mane and put a dent in it
verse 4 crunchy black

we break down walls like king kong
any nigga roll up i pass me the raw

aint no shame in my game
give your boy that cococaine
