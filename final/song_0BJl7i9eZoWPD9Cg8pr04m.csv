its going home after working all day long and i see a bunch of bad news on
that make it sound like the good life is up and gone away
and that gets me down i believe these are still the good ole days

yeah these are still the good ole days
no matter what the teachers neighbors or the preachers say
and i dont have to long for yesterday oh no
cause these are still the good ole days

oh i can still go outside and find me an old shade tree
and i still got time with a line in the middle of little pond creek
then i could catch a nap lord catch a cat either one would be okay
and that proves me right i believe these are still the good ole days

yeah these are still the good ole days
no matter what the teachers neighbors or the preachers say
and i dont have to long for yesterday oh no
cause these are still the good ole days

come on baby

yeah these are still the good ole days
no matter what the teachers neighbors or the preachers say
and i dont have to long for yesterday oh no
cause these are still the good ole days
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likeoh i can still catch all of the ranger games no man
oh these are still the good ole daysembed"
