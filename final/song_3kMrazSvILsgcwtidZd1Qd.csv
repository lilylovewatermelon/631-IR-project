been there done that messed around
im having fun dont put me down
ill never let you sweep me off my feet
i wont let you in again
the messages ive tried to send
my informations just not going in
burning bridges shore to shore
i break away from something more
im not turned on to love until its cheap
been there done that messed around
im having fun dont put me down
ill never let you sweep me off my feet

chorus
this time baby ill be bulletproof
this time baby ill be bulletproof

verse 2
i wont let you turn around
and tell me now im much too proud
to walk away from something when its dead
dododo your dirty words
come out to play when you are hurt
theres certain things that should be left unsaid
tick tick tick tick on the watch
and lifes too short for me to stop
oh baby your time is running out
i wont let you turn around
and tell me now im much too proud
all you do is fill me up with doubt
