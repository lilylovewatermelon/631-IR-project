i have grown up i am a father now
everything has changed but i am still the same somehow
you know ive never been afraid of death
but now i wanna see the things that havent happened yet
i still love getting out of my mind i should cut it down
i still know people i dont like and i should cut them out
i feel embarrassed bout the things that i did in my youth
cause now i have a child i know one day that shell go through it

prechorus
freight cargo dot stops and aeroplanes
latenight calls signal is in and out again
feelin low on serotonin and better days
go go go but every moment youre here with mе

chorus
time stops to still
when you are in my arms it always will
and lifе life is changin tides

verse 2
i lost the confidence in who i was
too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
i have the same dream every night
a bullet through my brain the moment that i close my eyes
i still have to lean on a shoulder when ive broken down
and i have people that depend on me to sort them out
i sometimes fantasise i disappear without a trace
ive no regrets but wish i did things in a different way

low fly zone lawsuits and film stars
headline wrote princess and the face scar
broken bones breakins and babylon
go go go but every moment youre here with me

chorus
time stops to still
when you are in my arms it always will
and life life is changin tides
time stops to still
when you are in my arms it always will
and life life is changin tides8embed"
