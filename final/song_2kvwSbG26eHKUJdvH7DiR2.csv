im coming up slowly
im high on emotion
with waves of this feeling
as light as the ocean
and then i see you
when i feel like im drowning

take me to that place where you always go
when youre sleeping or your day takes you low so low
when im on and off again on and off again on and off again oh
take me to that place when i need someone
when im shaking or my mind starts coming undone
when im on and off again on and off again on and off again
you turn me on like
