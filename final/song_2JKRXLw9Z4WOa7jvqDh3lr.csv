bandit was a black lab daddy brought home
he said son hes yours from now on
bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
slept at night on the foot of my bed
all that year i can see him still
chasing after me nipping at my heels
down to the bus stop my new best friend
still waiting right there when i got home again

chorus
and i thought we would be together
go on and on just like that forever
but i was young back then
i guess i just didnt know
little boys grow up and dogs get old

verse 2
he was my sidekick through thick and thin
and hed bark at my fish when id reel em in
summers came and went and we grew like weeds
and i dont know if i raised him or he raised me

chorus
and i thought we would be together
go on and on just like that forever
but i was young back then
how was i supposed to know
little boys grow up and dogs get old
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
he was fourteen when i left for tennessee
and he came down the front porch steps a little slow
i got down to hug his neck
said you take care of mom and dad til i get home
and be a good boy
now you be a good boy

chorus
and i thought we would be together
go on and on just like that forever
but i was young back then
god i wish i didnt know
little boys grow up and dogs get oldembed"
