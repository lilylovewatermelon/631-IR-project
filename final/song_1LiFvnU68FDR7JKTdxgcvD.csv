where will you go
before the regret you hold in your heart
will start to show

if you leave
how will you know
if our ever after ever had a chance to grow
do you dream or do you sleep
do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep
do you wish upon a star
or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away

nothin seems to change
let alone you wont forget my name
just dont lose what you know
just dont lose what you know
when youre so far away

so deep you say
and no matter where you go
it all ends up the same
do you wish upon a star
or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away

nothin seems to change
let alone you wont forget my name
just dont lose what you know
just dont lose what you know
when youre so far away
you might also likewhat you lose is what you know
where you go is where you grow
how near weve come is yet to show
weve come so close yet so far away
so far away

what did i do to you
what did i do to you
what did i do to you
what did i do to you

nothin seems to change
let alone you wont forget my name
just dont lose what you know
just dont lose what you know
when im so far away

what did i do to you
so far away
what did i do to you
so far away
what did i do to you
so far away
what did i do to you
so far away
what did i do to you
so far awayembed"
