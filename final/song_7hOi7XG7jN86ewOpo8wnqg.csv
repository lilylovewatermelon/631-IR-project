lights flicked on and housedoors opened all down the street to watch the carnival set up
montag and beatty stared one with dry satisfaction the other with disbelief at the house before them this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten
well said beatty now you did it old montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that hes burnt his damn wings he wonders why didnt i hint enough when i sent the hound around your place
montags face was entirely numb and featureless he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door set in its bright borders of flowers
beatty snorted oh no you werent fooled by that little idiots routine now were you flowers butterflies leaves sunsets oh hell its all in her file ill be damned ive hit the bullseye look at the sick look on your face a few grassblades and the quarters of the moon what trash what good did she ever do with all that
montag sat on the cold fender of the dragon moving his head half an inch to the left half an inch to the right left right left right left 
she saw everything she didnt do anything to anyone she just let them alone
alone hell  she chewed around you didnt she one of those damn dogooders with their shocked holierthanthou silences their one talent making others feel guilty god damn they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed
the front door opened mildred came down the steps running one suitcase held with a dreamlike clenching rigidity in her fist as a beetletaxi hissed to the curb
mildred 
she ran past with her body stiff her face floured with powder her mouth gone without lipstick
mildred you didnt put in the alarm
she shoved the valise in the waiting beetle climbed in and sat mumbling poor family poor family oh everything gone everything everything gone now 
beatty grabbed montags shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour far down the street gone
there was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass mirrors and crystal prisms montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him to see stoneman and black wielding axes shattering windowpanes to provide crossventilation
the brush of a deathshead moth against a cold black screen montag this is faber do you hear me whats happening
this is happening to me said montag
what a dreadful surprise said beatty for everyone nowadays knows absolutely is certain that nothing will ever happen to me others die i go on there are no consequences and no responsibilities except that there are but lets not talk about them eh by the time the consequences catch up with you its too late isnt it montag
montag can you get away run asked faber
montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze
what is there about fire thats so lovely no matter what age we are what draws us to it
beatty blew out the flame and lit it again its perpetual motion the thing man wanted to invent but never did or almost perpetual motion if you let it go on itd burn our lifetimes out what is
fire its a mystery scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules but they dont
really know its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences a problem gets
too burdensome then into the furnace with it now montag youre a burden and fire will lift
you off my shoulders clean quick sure nothing to rot later antibiotic aesthetic practical
montag stood looking in now at this queer house made strange by the hour of the night by
murmuring neighbour voices by littered glass and there on the floor their covers torn off and
spilled out like swanfeathers the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth
bothering with for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper and ravelled binding
mildred of course she must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them
back in mildred mildred
i want you to do this job all by your lonesome montag not with kerosene and a match but
piecework with a flamethrower your house your cleanup
montag cant you run get away
no cried montag helplessly the hound because of the hound
faber heard and beatty thinking it was meant for him heard yes the hounds somewhere
about the neighbourhood so dont try anything ready
ready montag snapped the safetycatch on the flamethrower
fire
a great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall he
stepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering
whisper with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain he
burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything the
chairs the tables and in the diningroom the silverware and plastic dishes everything that
showed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him
tomorrow who had gone and quite forgotten him already listening to her seashell radio pour in
on her and in on her as she rode across town alone and as before it was good to burn he felt
himself gush out in the fire snatch rend rip in half with flame and put away the senseless
problem if there was no solution well then now there was no problem either fire was best for
everything
the books montag
the books leapt and danced like roasted birds their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers
and then he came to the parlour where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white
thoughts and their snowy dreams and he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the
vacuum hissed out at him the emptiness made an even emptier whistle a senseless scream he
tried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed but he could not he
held his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs he cut off its terrible emptiness drew
back and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning the fireproof
plastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame
when youre quite finished said beatty behind him youre under arrest
the house fell in red coals and black ash it bedded itself down in sleepy pinkgrey cinders and a
smoke plume blew over it rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky it was threethirty
in the morning the crowd drew back into the houses the great tents of the circus had slumped
into charcoal and rubble and the show was well over
montag stood with the flamethrower in his limp hands great islands of perspiration drenching
his armpits his face smeared with soot the other firemen waited behind him in the darkness
their faces illuminated faintly by the smouldering foundation
montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together
was it my wife turned in the alarm
beatty nodded but her friends turned in an alarm earlier that i let ride one way or the other
youd have got it it was pretty silly quoting poetry around free and easy like that it was the act
of a silly damn snob give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks hes the lord of all creation
you think you can walk on water with your books well the world can get by just fine without
them look where they got you in slime up to your lip if i stir the slime with my little finger
youll drown  
montag could not move a great earthquake had come with fire and levelled the house and
mildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move the
earthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there his knees
halfbent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage letting beatty hit him
without raising a hand
montag you idiot montag you damn fool why did you really do it
montag did not hear he was far away he was running with his mind he was gone leaving this
dead sootcovered body to sway in front of another raving fool
montag get out of there  said faber
montag listened
beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back the green bullet in which
fabers voice whispered and cried fell to the sidewalk beatty snatched it up grinning he held it
half in half out of his ear
montag heard the distant voice calling montag you all right
beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket wellso theres more here than i
thought i saw you tilt your head listening first i thought you had a seashell but when you
turned clever later i wondered well trace this and drop it on your friend
no  said montag
he twitched the safety catch on the flamethrower beatty glanced instantly at montags fingers
and his eyes widened the faintest bit montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his
hands to see what new thing they had done thinking back later he could never decide whether
the hands or beattys reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder the last
rolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears not touching him
beatty grinned his most charming grin well thats one way to get an audience hold a gun on a
man and force him to listen to your speech speech away whatll it be this time why dont you
belch shakespeare at me you fumbling snob there is no terror cassius in your threats for i
am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind which i respect not hows
that go ahead now you secondhand litterateur pull the trigger he took one step toward
montag
montag only said we never burned right
hand it over guy said beatty with a fixed smile
and then he was a shrieking blaze a jumping sprawling gibbering mannikin no longer human
or known all writhing flame on the lawn as montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on
him there was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove a bubbling and
frothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction
and a boiling over of yellow foam montag shut his eyes shouted shouted and fought to get his
hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound beatty flopped over and over and over and
at last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent
the other two firemen did not move
montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flamethrower turn around
they turned their faces like blanched meat streaming sweat he beat their heads knocking off
their helmets and bringing them down on themselves they fell and lay without moving
the blowing of a single autumn leaf
he turned and the mechanical hound was there
it was half across the lawn coming from the shadows moving with such drifting ease that it was
like a single solid cloud of blackgrey smoke blown at him in silence
it made a single last leap into the air coming down at montag from a good three feet over his
head its spidered legs reaching the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth montag
caught it with a bloom of fire a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue
and orange about the metal dog clad it in a new covering as it slammed into montag and threw
him ten feet back against the bole of a tree taking the flamegun with him he felt it scrabble and
seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the hound up in the air
burst its metal bones at the joints and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour
like a skyrocket fastened to the street montag lay watching the deadalive thing fiddle the air
and die even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now
working through the flesh of his leg he felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled
back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles
an hour he was afraid to
get up afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all with an anaesthetized leg a numbness
in a numbness hollowed into a numbness
and now
the street empty the house burnt like an ancient bit of stagescenery the other homes dark the
hound here beatty there the three other firemen another place and the salamander     he
gazed at the immense engine that would have to go too
well he thought lets see how badly off you are on your feet now easy easy    there
he stood and he had only one leg the other was like a chunk of burnt pinelog he was carrying
along as a penance for some obscure sin when he put his weight on it a shower of silver
needles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee he wept come on come on
you you cant stay here
a few houselights were going on again down the street whether from the incidents just passed
or because of the abnormal silence following the fight montag did not know he hobbled around
the ruins seizing at his bad leg when it lagged talking and whimpering and shouting directions
at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital he heard a
number of people crying out in the darkness and shouting he reached the back yard and the
alley beatty he thought youre not a problem now you always said dont face a problem bum
it well now ive done both goodbye captain
and he stumbled along the alley in the dark
a shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought youre a fool a
damn fool an awful fool an idiot an awful idiot a damn idiot and a fool a damn fool look at
the mess and wheres the mop look at the mess and what do you do pride damn it and temper
and youve junked it all at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself but everything
at once but everything one on top of another beatty the women mildred clarisse everything
no excuse though no excuse a fool a damn fool go give yourself up
no well save what we can well do what there is left to do if we have to burn lets take a few
more with us here
he remembered the books and turned back just on the off chance
he found a few books where he had left them near the garden fence mildred god bless her had
missed a few four books still lay hidden where he had put them voices were wailing in the
night and flashbeams swirled about other salamanders were roaring their engines far away and
police sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens
montag took the four remaining books and hopped jolted hopped his way down the alley and
suddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there something inside had
jerked him to a halt and flopped him down he lay where he had fallen and sobbed his legs
folded his face pressed blindly to the gravel
beatty wanted to die
in the middle of the crying montag knew it for the truth beatty had wanted to die he had just
stood there not really trying to save himself just stood there joking needling thought montag
and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air how strange strange
to want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and
staying alive you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad and
then 
at a distance running feet
montag sat up lets get out of here come on get up get up you just cant sit but he was still
crying and that had to be finished it was going away now he hadnt wanted to kill anyone not
even beatty his flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid he gagged he
saw beatty a torch not moving fluttering out on the grass he bit at his knuckles im sorry im
sorry oh god sorry 
he tried to piece it all together to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago
before the sieve and the sand denhams dentifrice mothvoices fireflies the alarms and
excursions too much for a few short days too much indeed for a lifetime
feet ran in the far end of the alley
get up he told himself damn it get up he said to the leg and stood the pains were spikes
driven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common ordinary safety pins
and after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps filling his hand with slivers from the
board fence the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg and
the leg was at last his own leg again he had been afraid that running might break the loose
ankle now sucking all the night into his open mouth and blowing it out pale with all the
blackness left heavily inside himself he set out in a steady jogging pace he carried the books in
his hands
he thought of faber
faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now he had burnt
faber too he felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt faber was really dead baked like a
roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing
but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons
you must remember burn them or theyll burn you he thought right now its as simple as that
he searched his pockets the money was there and in his other pocket he found the usual
seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning
police alert wanted fugitive in city has committed murder and crimes against the state
name guy montag occupation fireman last seen   
he ran steadily for six blocks in the alley and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty
thoroughfare ten lanes wide it seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the
high white arclamps you could drown trying to cross it he felt it was too wide it was too open
it was a vast stage without scenery inviting him to run across easily seen in the blazing
illumination easily caught easily shot down
the seashell hummed in his ear
 watch for a man running  watch for the running man    watch for a man alone on foot   
watch
montag pulled back into the shadows directly ahead lay a gas station a great chunk of porcelain
snow shining there and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up now he must be clean and
presentable if he wished to walk not run stroll calmly across that wide boulevard it would give
him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to
get where    
yes he thought where am i running
nowhere there was nowhere to go no friend to turn to really except faber and then he
realized that he was indeed running toward fabers house instinctively but faber couldnt hide
him it would be suicide even to try but he knew that he would go to see faber anyway for a
few short minutes fabers would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in
his own ability to survive he just wanted to know that there was a man like faber in the world
he wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body
and some of the money must be left with faber of course to be spent after montag ran on his
way perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the
highways in the fields and hills
a great whirling whisper made him look to the sky
the police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head
off a dry dandelion flower two dozen of them flurried wavering indecisive three miles off
like butterflies puzzled by autumn and then they were plummeting down to land one by one
here there softly kneading the streets where turned back to beetles they shrieked along the
boulevards or as suddenly leapt back into the sir continuing their search
and here was the gas station its attendants busy now with customers approaching from the
rear montag entered the mens washroom through the aluminium wall he heard a radio voice
saying war has been declared the gas was being pumped outside the men in the beetles
were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines the gas the money owed montag
stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio but nothing
would happen the war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file an hour
two hours from now
he washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry making little sound he came out of the
washroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the
edge of the empty boulevard
there it lay a game for him to win a vast bowling alley in the cool morning the boulevard was
as clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims
and certain unknown killers the air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the
warmth of montags body alone it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the
whole immediate world to vibrate he was a phosphorescent target he knew it he felt it and
now he must begin his little walk
three blocks away a few headlights glared montag drew a deep breath his lungs were like
burning brooms in his chest his mouth was sucked dry from running his throat tasted of bloody
iron and there was rusted steel in his feet
what about those lights there once you started walking youd have to gauge how fast those
beetles could make it down here well how far was it to the other curb it seemed like a hundred
yards probably not a hundred but figure for that anyway figure that with him going very
slowly at a nice stroll it might take as much as thirty seconds forty seconds to walk all the way
the beetles once started they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds
so even if halfway across he started to run    
he put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right he walked on the empty avenue
even if the street were entirely empty of course you couldnt be sure of a safe crossing for a car
could appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had
taken a dozen breaths
he decided not to count his steps he looked neither to left nor right the light from the overhead
lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot
he listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right its movable
headlights jerked back and forth suddenly and caught at montag
keep going
montag faltered got a grip on the books and forced himself not to freeze instinctively he took a
few quick running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again he was
now half across the street but the roar from the beetles engines whined higher as it put on speed
the police of course they see me but slow now slow quiet dont turn dont look dont seem
concerned walk thats it walls walk
the beetle was rushing the beetle was roaring the beetle raised its speed the beetle was
whining the beetle was in high thunder the beetle came skimming the beetle came in a single
whistling trajectory fired from an invisible rifle it was up to 120 mph it was up to 130 at least
montag clamped his jaws the heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks it seemed and
jittered his eyelids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body
he began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran he put out his
legs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and
down and back god  god he dropped a book broke pace almost turned changed his mind
plunged on yelling in concrete emptiness the beetle scuttling after its running food two
hundred one hundred feet away ninety eighty seventy montag gasping flailing his hands legs
up down out up down out closer closer hooting calling his eyes burnt white now as his head
jerked about to confront the flashing glare now the beetle was swallowed in its own light now it
was nothing but a torch hurtling upon him all sound all blare nowalmost on top of him 
he stumbled and fell
im done its over
but the falling made a difference an instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and
swerved out it was gone montag lay flat his head down wisps of laughter trailed back to him
with the blue exhaust from the beetle
his right hand was extended above him flat across the extreme tip of his middle finger he saw
now as he lifted that hand a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tyre had touched in
passing he looked at that black line with disbelief getting to his feet
that wasnt the police he thought
he looked down the boulevard it was clear now a carful of children all ages god knew from
twelve to sixteen out whistling yelling hurrahing had seen a man a very extraordinary sight a man strolling a rarity
and simply said lets get him not knowing he was the fugitive mr montag simply anumber
of children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours their
faces icy with wind and coming home or not coming at dawn alive or not alive that made the
adventure
they would have killed me thought montag swaying the air still torn and stirring about him in
dust touching his bruised cheek for no reason at all in the world they would have killed me
he walked toward the far kerb telling each foot to go and keep going somehow he had picked
up the spilled books he didnt remember bending or touching them he kept moving them from
hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure
i wonder if they were the ones who killed clarisse
he stopped and his mind said it again very loud
i wonder if they were the ones who killed clarisse
he wanted to run after them yelling
his eyes watered
the thing that had saved him was falling flat the driver of that car seeing montag down
instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car
upside down and spill them out if montag had remained an upright target   
montag gasped
far down the boulevard four blocks away the beetle had slowed spun about on two wheels and
was now racing back slanting over on the wrong side of the street picking up speed
but montag was gone hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long
journey an hour or was it a minute ago he stood shivering in the night looking back out as the
beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue whirling laughter in the air all about
it gone
further on as montag moved in darkness he could see the helicopters falling falling like the
first flakes of snow in the long winter to come
the house was silent
montag approached from the rear creeping through a thick nightmoistened scent of daffodils
and roses and wet grass he touched the screen door in back found it open slipped in moved
across the porch listening
mrs black are you asleep in there he thought this isnt good but your husband did it to others
and never asked and never wondered and never worried and now since youre a firemans wife
its your house and your turn for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt
without thinking 
the house did not reply
he hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back
and the house was still dark and quiet sleeping
on his way across town with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky he
phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night then he
stood in the cold night air waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run and
the salamanders coming coming to bum mr blacks house while he was away at work to make
his wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire but
now she was still asleep
good night mrs black he thought 
faber 
another rap a whisper and a long waiting then after a minute a small light flickered inside
fabers small house after another pause the back door opened
they stood looking at each other in the halflight faber and montag as if each did not believe in
the others existence then faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed montag and moved
him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door listening the sirens were wailing
off in the morning distance he came in and shut the door
montag said ive been a fool all down the line i cant stay long im on my way god knows
where
at least you were a fool about the right things said faber i thought you were dead the
audiocapsule i gave you
burnt
i heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing i almost came out looking for
you
the captains dead he found the audiocapsule he heard your voice he was going to trace it i
killed him with the flamethrower
faber sat down and did not speak for a time
my god how did this happen said montag it was only the other night everything was fine
and the next thing i know im drowning how many times can a man go down and still be alive
i cant breathe theres beatty dead and he was my friend once and theres millie gone i
thought she was my wife but now i dont know and the house all burnt and my job gone and
myself on the run and i planted a book in a firemans house on the way good christ the things
ive done in a single week 
you did what you had to do it was coming on for a long time
yes i believe that if theres nothing else i believe it saved itself up to happen i could feel it
for a long time i was saving something up i went around doing one thing and feeling another
god it was all there its a wonder it didnt show on me like fat and now here i am messing up
your life they might follow me here
i feel alive for the first time in years said faber i feel im doing what i should have done a
lifetime ago for a little while im not afraid maybe its because im doing the right thing at last
maybe its because ive done a rash thing and dont want to look the coward to you i suppose ill
have to do even more violent things exposing myself so i wont fall down on the job and turn
scared again what are your plans
to keep running
you know the wars on
i heard
god isnt it funny said the old man it seems so remote because we have our own troubles
i havent had time to think montag drew out a hundred dollars i want this to stay with you
use it any way thatll help when im gone
but 
i might be dead by noon use this
faber nodded youd better head for the river if you can follow along it and if you can hit the
old railroad lines going out into the country follow them even though practically everythings
airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned the rails are still there rusting ive
heard there are still hobo camps all across the country here and there walking camps they call
them and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled they say theres lots of old
harvard degrees on the tracks between here and los angeles most of them are wanted and
hunted in the cities they survive i guess there arent many of them and i guess the
governments never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down you
might hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in st louis im leaving on the five
am bus this morning to see a retired printer there im getting out into the open myself at last
the money will be put to good use thanks and god bless you do you want to sleep a few
minutes
id better run
lets check
he took montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside revealing a television
screen the size of a postal card i always wanted something very small something i could talk
to something i could blot out with the palm of my hand if necessary nothing that could shout
me down nothing monstrous big so you see he snapped it on montag the tv set said and
lit up montag the name was spelled out by the voice guy montag still running
police helicopters are up a new mechanical hound has been brought from another district 
montag and faber looked at each other
   mechanical hound never fails never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible
invention made a mistake tonight this network is proud to have the opportunity to follow the
hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target
faber poured two glasses of whisky well need these
they drank
   nose so sensitive the mechanical hound can remember and identify ten thousand odourindexes
on ten thousand men without resetting 
faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house at the walls the door the doorknob
and the chair where montag now sat montag saw the look they both looked quickly about the
house and montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his
nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the
sweat of his hand hung from the doorknob invisible but as numerous as the jewels of a small
chandelier he was everywhere in and on and about everything he was a luminous cloud a ghost
that made breathing once more impossible he saw faber stop up his own breath for fear of
drawing that ghost into his own body perhaps being contaminated with the phantom exhalations
and odours of a running man
the mechanical hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the burning
and there on the small screen was the burnt house and the crowd and something with a sheet
over it and out of the sky fluttering came the helicopter like a grotesque flower
so they must have their game out thought montag the circus must go on even with war
beginning within the hour
he watched the scene fascinated not wanting to move it seemed so remote and no part of him
it was a play apart and separate wondrous to watch not without its strange pleasure thats all
for me you thought thats all taking place just for me by god
if he wished he could linger here in comfort and follow the entire hunt on through its swift
phases down alleys across streets over empty running avenues crossing lots and playgrounds
with pauses here or there for the necessary commercials up other alleys to the burning house of
mr and mrs black and so on finally to this house with faber and himself seated drinking
while the electric hound snuffed down the last trail silent as a drift of death itself skidded to a
halt outside that window there then if he wished montag might rise walk to the window keep
one eye on the tv screen open the window lean out look back and see himself dramatized
described made over standing there limned in the bright small television screen from outside a
drama to be watched objectively knowing that in other parlours he was large as life in full
colour dimensionally perfect and if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself an
instant before oblivion being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parloursitters who
had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their livingroom
walls to come watch the big game the hunt the oneman carnival
would he have time for a speech as the hound seized him in view of ten or twenty or thirty
million people mightnt he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word
that would stay with them long after the hound had turned clenching him in its metalplier
jaws and trotted off in darkness while the camera remained stationary watching the creature
dwindle in the distancea splendid fadeout what could he say in a single word a few words
that would sear all their faces and wake them up
there whispered faber
out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine not animal not dead not alive
glowing with a pale green luminosity it stood near the smoking ruins of montags house and the
men brought his discarded flamethrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the hound
there was a whirring clicking humming
montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink its time im sorry about
this
about what me my house i deserve everything run for gods sake perhaps i can delay
them here

one last thing quick a suitcase get it fill it with your dirtiest clothes an old suit the dirtier

faber was gone and back in a minute they sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape to keep
the ancient odour of mr faber in of course said faber sweating at the job
montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky i dont want that hound picking up two
odours at once may i take this whisky ill need it later christ i hope this works
they shook hands again and going out of the door they glanced at the tv the hound was on
its way followed by hovering helicopter cameras silently silently sniffing the great night wind
it was running down the first alley
goodbye  
and montag was out the back door lightly running with the halfempty valise behind him he
heard the lawnsprinkling system jump up filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then
with a steady pour all about washing on the sidewalks and draining into the alley he carried a
few drops of this rain with him on his face he thought he heard the old man call goodbye but
hewasnt certain
he ran very fast away from the house down toward the river
montag ran
he could feel the hound like autumn come cold and dry and swift like a wind that didnt stir
grass that didnt jar windows or disturb leafshadows on the white sidewalks as it passed the
hound did not touch the world it carried its silence with it so you could feel the silence building
up a pressure behind you all across town montag felt the pressure rising and ran
he stopped for breath on his way to the river to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened
houses and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlour walls and there on the
walls the mechanical hound a breath of neon vapour spidered along here and gone here and
gone now at elm terrace lincoln oak park and up the alley toward fabers house
go past thought montag dont stop go on dont turn in
on the parlour wall fabers house with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air
the hound paused quivering
no montag held to the window sill this way here
the procaine needle flicked out and in out and in a single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell
from the needle as it vanished in the hounds muzzle
montag held his breath like a doubled fist in his chest
the mechanical hound turned and plunged away from fabers house down the alley again
montag snapped his gaze to the sky the helicopters were closer a great blowing of insects to a
single light source
with an effort montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched
on his run to the river it was in actuality his own chessgame he was witnessing move by move
he shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window and the
fascinating seance going on in there hell and he was away and gone the alley a street the
alley a street and the smell of the river leg out leg down leg out and down twenty million
montags running soon if the cameras caught him twenty million montags running running
like an ancient flickery keystone comedy cops robbers chasers and the chased hunters and
hunted he had seen it a thousand times behind him now twenty million silently baying hounds
ricocheted across parlours threecushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall
gone right wall centre wall left wall gone 
montag jammed his seashell to his ear
police suggest entire population in the elm terrace area do as follows everyone in every house
in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows the fugitive cannot escape if
everyone in the next minute looks from his house ready 
of course why hadnt they done it before why in all the years hadnt this game been tried
everyone up everyone out he couldnt be missed the only man running alone in the night city
the only man proving his legs
at the count of ten now one two
he felt the city rise three 
he felt the city turn to its thousands of doors
faster leg up leg down 
four  
the people sleepwalking in their hallways
five 
he felt their hands on the doorknobs
the smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain his throat was burnt rust and his eyes were
wept dry with running he yelled as if this yell would jet him on fling him the last hundred
yards
six seven eight  
the doorknobs turned on five thousand doors nine
he ran out away from the last row of houses on a slope leading down to a solid moving
blackness ten
the doors opened
he imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards into alleys and into the sky
faces hid by curtains pale nightfrightened faces like grey animals peering from electric caves
faces with grey colourless eyes grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb
flesh of the face
but he was at the river
he touched it just to be sure it was real he waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin
splashed his body arms legs and head with raw liquor drank it and snuffed some up his nose
then he dressed in fabers old clothes and shoes he tossed his own clothing into the river and
watched it swept away then holding the suitcase he walked out in the river until there was no
bottom and he was swept away in the dark
he was three hundred yards downstream when the hound reached the river overhead the great
racketing fans of the helicopters hovered a storm of light fell upon the river and montag dived
under the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds he felt the river pull him further
on its way into darkness then the lights switched back to the land the helicopters swerved over
the city again as if they had picked up another trail they were gone the hound was gone now
there was only the cold river and montag floating in a sudden peacefulness away from the city
and the lights and the chase away from everything
he felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors he felt as if he had left the great seance
and all the murmuring ghosts he was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a
reality that was unreal because it was new
the black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills for the first time in a
dozen years the stars were coming out above him in great processions of wheeling fire he saw a
great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him
he floated on his back when the valise filled and sank the river was mild and leisurely going
away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper
the river was very real it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last the leisure to
consider this month this year and a lifetime of years he listened to his heart slow his thoughts
stopped rushing with his blood
he saw the moon low in the sky now the moon there and the light of the moon caused by
what by the sun of course and what lights the sun its own fire and the sun goes on day
after day burning and burning the sun and time the sun and time and burning burning the
river bobbled him along gently burning the sun and every clock on the earth it all came
together and became a single thing in his mind after a long time of floating on the land and a
short time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life
the sun burned every day it burned time the world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis
and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway without any help from him so if he
burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt time that meantthat everything burned
one of them had to stop burning the sun wouldnt certainly so it looked as if it had to be
montag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago somewhere the saving
and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping one way or
another in books in records in peoples heads any way at all so long as it was safe free from
moths silverfish rust and dryrot and men with matches the world was full of burning of all
types and sizes now the guild of the asbestosweaver must open shop very soon
he felt his heel bump land touch pebbles and rocks scrape sand the river had moved him
toward shore
he looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light without shape with only a size that
went a thousand miles without wanting to stop with its grass hills and forests that were waiting
for him
he hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water he expected the hound there suddenly
the trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters
but there was only the normal autumn wind high up going by like another river why wasnt the
hound running why had the search veered inland montag listened nothing nothing
millie he thought all this country here listen to it nothing and nothing so much silence
millie i wonder how youd take it would you shout shut up shut up millie millie and he
was sad
millie was not here and the hound was not here but the dry smell of hay blowing from some
distant field put montag on the land he remembered a farm he had visited when he was very
young one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of
unreality beyond the walls of parlours and beyond the tin moat of the city cows chewed grass
and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill
now the dry smell of hay the motion of the waters made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a
lonely barn away from the loud highways behind a quiet farmhouse and under an ancient
windmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead he lay in the high barn loft
all night listening to distant animals and insects and trees the little motions and stirrings
during the night he thought below the loft he would hear a sound like feet moving perhaps he
would tense and sit up the sound would move away he would lie back and look out of the loft
window very late in the night and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself until a very
young and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window braiding her hair it would be hard to
see her but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now so very long
ago the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fireflies the girl who
had known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin then she would be gone from the
warm window and appear again upstairs in her moonwhitened room and then to the sound of
death the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon he would lie
in the loft hidden and safe watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth fleeing
from the soft colour of dawn
in the morning he would not have needed sleep for all the warm odours and sights of a complete
country night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth when he
thought to test it was half a smile
and there at the bottom of the hayloft stair waiting for him would be the incredible thing he
would step carefully down in the pink light of early morning so fully aware of the world that he
would be afraid and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it
a cool glass of fresh milk and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps
this was all he wanted now some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him
the long time needed to think all the things that must be thought
a glass of milk an apple a pear
he stepped from the river
the land rushed at him a tidal wave he was crushed by darkness and the look of the country
and the million odours on a wind that iced his body he fell back under the breaking curve of
darkness and sound and smell his ears roaring he whirled the stars poured over his sight like
flaming meteors he wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down
somewhere this dark land rising was like that day in his childhood swimming when from
nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and
green darkness water burning mouth and nose retching his stomach screaming too much
water
too much land
out of the black wall before him a whisper a shape in the shape two eyes the night looking
at him the forest seeing him
the hound
after all the running and rushing and sweating it out and halfdrowning to come this far work
this hard and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find
  
the hound
montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man
the shape exploded away the eyes vanished the leafpiles flew up in a dry shower
montag was alone in the wilderness
a deer he smelled the heavy musklike perfume mingled with blood and the gummed
exhalation of the animals breath all cardamon and moss and ragweed odour in this huge night
where the trees ran at him pulled away ran pulled away to the pulse of the heart behind his
eyes
there must have been a billion leaves on the land he waded in them a dry river smelling of hot
cloves and warm dust and the other smells there was a smell like a cut potato from all the
land raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night there was a smell
like pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home there was a faint yellow
odour like mustard from a jar there was a smell like carnations from the yard next door he put
down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him his fingers smelled of liquorice
he stood breathing and the more he breathed the land in the more he was filled up with all the
details of the land he was not empty there was more than enough here to fill him there would
always be more than enough
he walked in the shallow tide of leaves stumbling
and in the middle of the strangeness a familiarity
his foot hit something that rang dully
he moved his hand on the ground a yard this way a yard that
the railroad track
the track that came out of the city and rusted across the land through forests and woods
deserted now by the river
here was the path to wherever he was going here was the single familiar thing the magic charm
he might need a little while to touch to feel beneath his feet as he moved on into the bramble
bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching among the whispers and the blowing
down of leaves
he walked on the track
and he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove
once long ago clarisse had walked here where he was walking now
half an hour later cold and moving carefully on the tracks fully aware of his entire body his
face his mouth his eyes stuffed with blackness his ears stuffed with sound his legs prickled
with burrs and nettles he saw the fire ahead
the fire was gone then back again like a winking eye he stopped afraid he might blow the fire
out with a single breath but the fire was there and he approached warily from a long way off it
took the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it and then he stood
looking at it from cover that small motion the white and red colour a strange fire because it
meant a different thing to him
it was not burning it was warming
he saw many hands held to its warmth hands without arms hidden in darkness above the
hands motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight he hadnt
known fire could look this way he had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take
even its smell was different
how long he stood he did not know but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing
himself as an animal come from the forest drawn by the fire he was a thing of brush and liquid
eye of fur and muzzle and hoof he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn
if you bled it out on the ground he stood a long long time listening to the warm crackle of the
flames
there was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the mens faces and time
was there time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees and look at the world and turn
it over with the eyes as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire a piece of steel these men
were all shaping it was not only the fire that was different it was the silence montag moved
toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world
and then the voices began and they were talking and he could hear nothing of what the voices
said but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking
at it the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river
the voices talked of everything there was nothing they could not talk about he knew from the
very cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them
and then one of the men looked up and saw him for the first or perhaps the seventh time and a
voice called to montag
all right you can come out now  
montag stepped back into the shadows
its all right the voice said youre welcome here
montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue
denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits he did not know what to say to them
sit down said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group have some coffee
he watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup which was handed him
straight off he sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity his lips were
scalded but that was good the faces around him were bearded but the beards were clean neat
and their hands were clean they had stood up as if to welcome a guest and now they sat down
again montag sipped thanks he said thanks very much
youre welcome montag my names granger he held out a small bottle of colourless fluid
drink this too itll change the chemical index of your perspiration half an hour from now
youll smell like two other people with the hound after you the best thing is bottoms up
montag drank the bitter fluid
youll stink like a bobcat but thats all right said granger
you know my name said montag
granger nodded to a portable battery tv set by the fire
weve watched the chase figured youd wind up south along the river when we heard you
plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk we didnt hide as we usually do we figured
you were in the river when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city something funny
there the chase is still running the other way though
the other way
lets have a look
granger snapped the portable viewer on the picture was a nightmare condensed easily passed
from hand to hand in the forest all whirring colour and flight a voice cried
the chase continues north in the city police helicopters are converging on avenue 87 and elm
grove park
granger nodded theyre faking you threw them off at the river they cant admit it they
know they can hold their audience only so long the shows got to have a snap ending quick if
they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night so theyre sniffing for a
scapegoat to end things with a bang watch theyll catch montag in the next five minutes 
but how
watch
the camera hovering in the belly of a helicopter now swung down at an empty street
see that whispered granger itll be you right up at the end of that street is our victim see
how our camera is coming in building the scene suspense long shot right now some poor
fellow is out for a walk a rarity an odd one dont think the police dont know the habits of
queer ducks like that men who walk mornings for the hell of it or for reasons of insomnia
anyway the police have had him charted for months years never know when that sort of
information might be handy and today it turns out its very usable indeed it saves face oh
god look there
the men at the fire bent forward
on the screen a man turned a corner the mechanical hound rushed forward into the viewer
suddenly the helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the
man
a voice cried theres montag  the search is done
the innocent man stood bewildered a cigarette burning in his hand he stared at the hound not
knowing what it was he probably never knew he glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens
the cameras rushed down the hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing
that was incredibly beautiful its needle shot out it was suspended for a moment in their gaze as
if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything the raw look of the victims face the
empty street the steel animal a bullet nosing the target
montag dont move said a voice from the sky
the camera fell upon the victim even as did the hound both reached him simultaneously the
victim was seized by hound and camera in a great spidering clenching grip he screamed he
screamed he screamed
blackout
silence
darkness
montag cried out in the silence and turned away
silence
and then after a time of the men sitting around the fire their faces expressionless an announcer
on the dark screen said the search is over montag is dead a crime against society has been
avenged
darkness
we now take you to the sky room of the hotel lux for a halfhour of justbeforedawn a
programme of
granger turned it off
they didnt show the mans face in focus did you notice
even your best friends couldnt tell if it was you they scrambled it just enough to let the
imagination take over hell he whispered hell
montag said nothing but now looking back sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen
trembling
granger touched montags arm welcome back from the dead montag nodded granger went
on you might as well know all of us now this is fred clement former occupant of the
thomas hardy chair at cambridge in the years before it became an atomic engineering school
this other is dr simmons from ucla a specialist in ortega y gasset professor west here
did quite a bit for ethics an ancient study now for columbia university quite some years ago
reverend padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one
sunday and the next for his views hes been bumming with us some time now myself i wrote a
book called the fingers in the glove the proper relationship between the individual and
society and here i am welcome montag 
i dont belong with you said montag at last slowly ive been an idiot all the way
were used to that we all made the right kind of mistakes or we wouldnt be here when we
were separate individuals all we had was rage i struck a fireman when he came to burn my
library years ago ive been running ever since you want to join us montag
yes
what have you to offer
nothing i thought i had part of the book of ecclesiastes and maybe a little of revelation but i
havent even that now
the book of ecclesiastes would be fine where was it
here montag touched his head
ah granger smiled and nodded
whats wrong isnt that all right said montag
better than all right perfect granger turned to the reverend do we have a book of
ecclesiastes
one a man named harris of youngstown
montag granger took montags shoulder firmly walk carefully guard your health if
anything should happen to harris you are the book of ecclesiastes see how important youve
become in the last minute
but ive forgotten
no nothings ever lost we have ways to shake down your clinkers for you
but ive tried to remember
dont try itll come when we need it all of us have photographic memories but spend a
lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there simmons here has worked
on it for twenty years and now weve got the method down to where we can recall anything thats
been read once would you like some day montag to read platos republic
of course
i am platos republic like to read marcus aurelius mr simmons is marcus
how do you do said mr simmons
hello said montag
i want you to meet jonathan swift the author of that evil political book gullivers travels and
this other fellow is charles darwin andthis one is schopenhauer and this one is einstein and
this one here at my elbow is mr albert schweitzer a very kind philosopher indeed here we all
are montag aristophanes and mahatma gandhi and gautama buddha and confucius and
thomas love peacock and thomas jefferson and mr lincoln if you please we are also
matthew mark luke and john
everyone laughed quietly
it cant be said montag
it is replied granger smiling  were bookburners too we read the books and burnt them
afraid theyd be found microfilming didnt pay off we were always travelling we didnt want to
bury the film and come back later always the chance of discovery better to keep it in the old
heads where no one can see it or suspect it we are all bits and pieces of history and literature
and international law byron tom paine machiavelli or christ its here and the hour is late
and the wars begun and we are out here and the city is there all wrapped up in its own coat of
a thousand colours what do you think montag
i think i was blind trying to do things my way planting books in firemens houses and sending
in alarms
you did what you had to do carried out on a national scale it might have worked beautifully
but our way is simpler and we think better all we want to do is keep the knowledge we think
we will need intact and safe were not out to incite or anger anyone yet for if we are destroyed
the knowledge is dead perhaps for good we are model citizens in our own special way we
walk the old tracks we lie in the hills at night and the city people let us be were stopped and
searched occasionally but theres nothing on our persons to incriminate us the organization is
flexible very loose and fragmentary some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and
fingerprints right now we have a horrible job were waiting for the war to begin and as
quickly end its not pleasant but then were not in control were the odd minority crying in the
wilderness when the wars over perhaps we can be of some use in the world
do you really think theyll listen then
if not well just have to wait well pass the books on to our children by word of mouth and let
our children wait in turn on the other people a lot will be lost that way of course
but you cant make people listen they have to come round in their own time wondering what
happened and why the world blew up under them it cant last
how many of you are there
thousands on the roads the abandoned railtracks tonight bums on the outside libraries inside
it wasnt planned at first each man had a book he wanted to remember and did then over a
period of twenty years or so we met each other travelling and got the loose network together
and set out a plan the most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we
were not important we mustnt be pedants we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the
world were nothing more than dustjackets for books of no significance otherwise some of us
live in small towns chapter one of thoreaus walden in green river chapter two in willow
farm maine why theres one town in maryland only twentyseven people no bombll ever
touch that town is the complete essays of a man named bertrand russell pick up that town
almost and flip the pages so many pages to a person and when the wars over some day some
year the books can be written again the people will be called in one by one to recite what they
know and well set it up in type until another dark age when we might have to do the whole
damn thing over again but thats the wonderful thing about man he never gets so discouraged or
disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again because he knows very well it is important and
worth the doing
what do we do tonight asked montag
wait said granger and move downstream a little way just in case
he began throwing dust and dirt on the fire
the other men helped and montag helped and there in the wilderness the men all moved their
hands putting out the fire together
they stood by the river in the starlight
montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof five five oclock in the morning another year
ticked by in a single hour and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river
why do you trust me said montag
a man moved in the darkness
the look of yous enough you havent seen yourself in a mirror lately beyond that the city has
never cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us a few
crackpots with verses in their heads cant touch them and they know it and we know it everyone
knows it so long as the vast population doesnt wander about quoting the magna charta and the
constitution its all right the firemen were enough to check that now and then no the cities
dont bother us and you look like hell
they moved along the bank of the river going south montag tried to see the mens faces the old
faces he remembered from the firelight lined and tired he was looking for a brightness a
resolve a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there perhaps he had expected their
faces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried to glow as lanterns glow with the light
in them but all the light had come from the camp fire and these men had seemed no different
from any others who had run a long race searched a long search seen good things destroyed
and now very late were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the
lamps they werent at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every
future dawn glow with a purer light they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file
behind their quiet eyes the books were waiting with their pages uncut for the customers who
might come by in later years some with clean and some with dirty fingers
montag squinted from one face to another as they walked
dont judge a book by its cover someone said
and they all laughed quietly moving downstream
there was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up
montag stared back at the city far down the river only a faint glow now
my wifes back there
im sorry to hear that the cities wont do well in the next few days said granger
its strange i dont miss her its strange i dont feel much of anything said montag even if
she dies i realized a moment ago i dont think ill feel sad it isnt right something must be
wrong with me
listen said granger taking his arm and walking with him holding aside the bushes to let him
pass when i was a boy my grandfather died and he was a sculptor he was also a very kind
man who had a lot of love to give the world and he helped clean up the slum in our town and he
made toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime he was always busy with his hands
and when he died i suddenly realized i wasnt crying for him at all but for the things he did i
cried because he would never do them again he would never carve another piece of wood or
help us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did or tell us jokes
the way he did he was part of us and when he died all the actions stopped dead and there was
no one to do them just the way he did he was individual he was an important man ive never
gotten over his death often i think what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he
died how many jokes are missing from the world and how many homing pigeons untouched by
his hands he shaped the world he did things to the world the world was bankrupted of ten
million fine actions the night he passed on
montag walked in silence millie millie he whispered millie
what
my wife my wife poor millie poor millie i cant remember anything i think of her hands but
i dont see them doing anything at all they just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her
lap or theres a cigarette in them but thats all
montag turned and glanced back
what did you give to the city montag
ashes
what did the others give to each other
nothingness
granger stood looking back with montag everyone must leave something behind when he dies
my grandfather said a child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes
made or a garden planted something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere
to go when you die and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted youre there it
doesnt matter what you do he said so long as you change something from the way it was before
you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away the difference
between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching he said the lawncutter
might just as well not have been there at all the gardener will be there a lifetime
granger moved his hand my grandfather showed me some v2 rocket films once fifty years
ago have you ever seen the atombomb mushroom from two hundred miles up its a pinprick
its nothing with the wilderness all around it
my grandfather ran off the v2 rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our
cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more to remind people
that were allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back
what it has given as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so
big when we forget how close the wilderness is in the night my grandpa said some day it will
come in and get us for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be you see granger
turned to montag grandfathers been dead for all these years but if you lifted my skull by
god in the convolutions of my brain youd find the big ridges of his thumbprint he touched me
as i said earlier he was a sculptor i hate a roman named status quo he said to me stuff your
eyes with wonder he said live as if youd drop dead in ten seconds see the world its more
fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories ask no guarantees ask for no security
there never was such an animal and if there were it would be related to the great sloth which
hangs upside down in a tree all day every day sleeping its life away to hell with that he said
shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass
look cried montag
and the war began and ended in that instant
later the men around montag could not say if they had really seen anything perhaps the merest
flourish of light and motion in the sky perhaps the bombs were there and the jets ten miles five
miles one mile up for the merest instant like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing
hand and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness yet sudden slowness down upon the
morning city they had left behind the bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished
once the jets had sighted their target alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour as
quick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished once the bombrelease was yanked it was
over now a full three seconds all of the time in history before the bombs struck the enemy
ships themselves were gone half around the visible world like bullets in which a savage islander
might not believe because they were invisible yet the heart is suddenly shattered the body falls
in separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air the brain squanders its few
precious memories and puzzled dies
this was not to be believed it was merely a gesture montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist
over the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow would say after the deed
disintegrate leave no stone on another perish die
montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment with his mind and his hands reaching
helplessly up at them run he cried to faber to clarisse run to mildred get out get
out of there  but clarisse he remembered was dead and faber was out there in the deep
valleys of the country somewhere the five am bus was on its way from one desolation to
another though the desolation had not yet arrived was still in the air it was certain as man
could make it before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway its destination would
be meaningless and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard
and mildred   
get out run
he saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a
yard a foot an inch from her building he saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of
colour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her where the family prattled
and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch
now a halfinch now a quarterinch from the top of the hotel leaning into the wall as if all of
the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there mildred leaning
anxiously nervously as if to plunge drop fall into that swarming immensity of colour to drown
in its bright happiness
the first bomb struck
mildred 
perhaps who would ever know perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of
colour and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion
montag falling flat going down saw or felt or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in
millies face heard her screaming because in the millionth part of time left she saw her own
face reflected there in a mirror instead of a crystal ball and it was such a wildly empty face all
by itself in the room touching nothing starved and eating of itself that at last she recognized it
as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted
down upon her carrying her with a million pounds of brick metal plaster and wood to meet
other people in the hives below all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid
itself of them in its own unreasonable way
i remember montag clung to the earth i remember chicago chicago a long time ago millie
and i thats where we met i remember now chicago a long time ago
the concussion knocked the air across and down the river turned the men over like dominoes in
a line blew the water in lifting sprays and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn
with a great wind passing away south montag crushed himself down squeezing himself small
eyes tight he blinked once and in that instant saw the city instead of the bombs in the air
they had displaced each other for another of those impossible instants the city stood rebuilt
and unrecognizable taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be taller than man had built it
erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a
reversed avalanche a million colours a million oddities a door where a window should be a top
for a bottom a side for a back and then the city rolled over and fell down dead
montag lying there eyes gritted shut with dust a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth
gasping and crying now thought again i remember i remember i remember something else
what is it yes yes part of the ecclesiastes and revelation part of that book part of it quick
now quick before it gets away before the shock wears off before the wind dies book of
ecclesiastes here he said it over to himself silently lying flat to the trembling earth he said the
words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no denhams
dentifrice anywhere it was just the preacher by himself standing there in his mind looking at
him 
there said a voice
the men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass they held to the earth as children hold to
familiar things no matter how cold or dead no matter what has happened or will happen their
fingers were clawed into the dirt and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from
bursting to keep their sanity from bursting mouths open montag shouting with them a protest
against the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips making their noses bleed
montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world and
lying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he
heard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now silence fell down in the
sifting dust and all the leisure they might need to look around to gather the reality of this day
into their senses
montag looked at the river well go on the river he looked at the old railroad tracks or well go
that way or well walk on the highways now and well have time to put things into ourselves
and some day after it sets in us a long time itll come out of our hands and our mouths and a
lot of it will be wrong but just enough of it will be right well just start walking today and see
the world and the way the world walks around and talks the way it really looks i want to see
everything now and while none of it will be me when it goes in after a while itll all gather
together inside and itll be me look at the world out there my god my god look at it out there
outside me out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where its
finally me where its in the blood where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day i
get hold of it so itll never run off ill hold on to the world tight some day ive got one finger on
it now thats a beginning
the wind died
the other men lay a while on the dawn edge of sleep not yet ready to rise up and begin the days
obligations its fires and foods its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand
they lay blinking their dusty eyelids you could hear them breathing fast then slower then slow

montag sat up
he did not move any further however the other men did likewise the sun was touching the
black horizon with a faint red tip the air was cold and smelled of a coming rain
silently granger arose felt his arms and legs swearing swearing incessantly under his breath
tears dripping from his face he shuffled down to the river to look upstream
its flat he said a long time later city looks like a heap of bakingpowder its gone and a
long time after that i wonder how many knew it was coming i wonder how many were
surprised
and across the world thought montag how many other cities dead and here in our country
how many a hundred a thousand
someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket and
shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet
and sputtered but finally caught and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up
and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire awkwardly with
nothing to say and the sun coloured the backs of their necks as they bent down
granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it well have a bite then well turn around
and walk upstream theyll be needing us up that way
someone produced a small fryingpan and the bacon went into it and the fryingpan was set on
the fire after a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it
filled the morning air with its aroma the men watched this ritual silently
granger looked into the fire phoenix
what
there was a silly damn bird called a phoenix back before christ every few hundred years he
built a pyre and burned himself up he must have been first cousin to man but every time he
burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes he got himself born all over again and it looks like
were doing the same thing over and over but weve got one damn thing the phoenix never had
we know the damn silly thing we just did we know all the damn silly things weve done for a
thousand years and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it
some day well stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them we
pick up a few more people that remember every generation
he took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it slowly thoughtfully
now lets get on upstream said granger and hold on to one thought youre not important
youre not anything some day the load were carrying with us may help someone but even
when we had the books on hand a long time ago we didnt use what we got out of them we
went right on insulting the dead we went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who
died before us were going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month
and the next year and when they ask us what were doing you can say were remembering
thats where well win out in the long run and some day well remember so much that well
build the biggest goddam steamshovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove
war in and cover it up come on now were going to go build a mirrorfactory first and put out
nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them
they finished eating and put out the fire the day was brightening all about them as if a pink
lamp had been given more wick in the trees the birds that had flown away now came back and
settled down
montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him going
north he was surprised and moved aside to let granger pass but granger looked at him and
nodded him on montag went ahead he looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track
going back down to where the farms lay where the barns stood full of hay where a lot of people
had walked by in the night on their way from the city later in a month or six months and
certainly not more than a year he would walk along here again alone and keep right on going
until he caught up with the people
but now there was a long mornings walk until noon and if the men were silent it was because
there was everything to think about and much to remember perhaps later in the morning when
the sun was up and had warmed them they would begin to talk or just say the things they
remembered to be sure they were there to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them
montag felt the slow stir of words the slow simmer and when it came to his turn what could he
say what could he offer on a day like this to make the trip a little easier to everything there is
a season yes a time to break down and a time to build up yes a time to keep silence and a
time to speak yes all that but what else what else something something   
and on either side of the river was there a tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and
yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations
yes thought montag thats the one ill save for noon for noon
when we reach the cityembed"
