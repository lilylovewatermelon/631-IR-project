you can call me a sinner
you can call me a saint
celebrate me for who i am
dislike me for what i aint
put me up on a pedestal or drag me down in the dirt
sticks and stones will break my bones
but your names will never hurt

prechorus
ill be the garden youll be the snake
all of my fruit is yours to take
better the devil that you know
your love for me will grow because

chorus
this is who i am you can
like it or not you can
love me or leave me
cause im never gonna stop
no no

verse 2

whether they were good or bad

cant have the femme without the fatale
please dont take offense
