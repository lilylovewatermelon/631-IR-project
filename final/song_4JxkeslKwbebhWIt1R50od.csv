come on in boy said the skeletons sitting by her closet door
dirty secrets empty memories and broken hearts across the floor
i was knocked out heels over head
so you dragged me by my feet to a ghost town where you buried me
no wonder no one heard my screams
loves so alive but it died in its sleep
and now that its dead i live in your head and i will haunt your fucking dreams

chorus
no one will love you like i did will treat you like i did
so go on wear that scarlet letter
no one will love you like i did will touch you like i did
so good luck finding something better

verse 2
run away boy if you couldnt tell babys got a thirst for blood
a subtle system wicked melodies craving bullets from her gun
so entranced they follow every word little spirals in their eyes
catch a lover turn an enemy just to watch them burn alive

chorus
no one will love you like i did will treat you like i did
so go on wear that scarlet letter
no one will love you like i did will touch you like i did
so good luck finding something better
you might also likebridge
someday you may find that picture perfect guy
and ill chase my words with poison
until that day arrives and swine take to the sky
fill your void with open thighs so

chorus
no one will love you like i did will treat you like i did
so go on wear that scarlet letter
no one will love you like i did will touch you like i did
so good luck finding something better
no one will love you like i did will treat you like i did
so go on wear that scarlet letter
no one will love you like i did will fuck you like i did
so good luck finding something better10embed"
