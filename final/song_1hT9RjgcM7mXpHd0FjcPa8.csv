you hear my cry lover of mine
no tear in the eye or fear in my mind
the forest is thick and we dont recognize
we parted our lips and we reached from inside

chorus
in a wide open field we know we can feel
awake and unreal
off to nowhere off to nowhere
off to nowhere

verse 2
need more people to be satisfied
with no fear of a god and a prayer for the night
you come into our minds and you rush through our lives
we parted our lips and we reached from inside

chorus
in a wide open field we know we can feel
awake and unreal
off to nowhere off to nowhere
off to nowhere

bridge
the only thing youve got off to nowhere
you know youre better off without it
the only thing youve got off to nowhere
you know youre better off without it
the only thing youve got off to nowhere
you know youre better off without it
the only thing youve got off to nowhere
you know youre better off without it

youngest fire you decide
you decide what is right
youngest fire who decides
we decide what is right

near yet so far isnt it
the only thing youve got
you know youre better off without it
near yet so far isnt it
the only thing youve got
you know youre better off without it
near yet so far isnt it
the only thing youve got
you know youre better off without it
near yet so far isnt it
the only thing youve got
you know youre better off without it
near yet so far isnt it
the only thing youve got
you know youre better off without it8embed"
