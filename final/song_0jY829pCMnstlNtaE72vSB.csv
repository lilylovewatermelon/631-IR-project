refrain
say yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
dont they know that youre full of pain already
yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
decadence isnt easy is it
yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
dont they know that youre full of pain already
yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
decadence isnt easy

then you slowly recall all your mind
why your souls gone cold
and all hope has run dry
dead inside
never enough to forget that
youre one of the lonely
slowly recall all your mind

refrain
say yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time

yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
dont they know that youre full of pain already
yes they know that youve hurt yourself another time
decadence isnt easy
