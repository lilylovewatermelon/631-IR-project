eternally on the run
from everyone
dont wanna live too fast
or die too young
but now that im buzzed
and soon to be fucked
i just want to live it up
with the ones i love

verse 2
simple minds
lead to simple lives
and simple lives
make more sense sometimes
cause i dont want
any stress in mine
thats why i push it all
to the side
