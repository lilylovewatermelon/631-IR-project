too many things are never spoken
im not feeling fine
i never told you what to do
i never made you a promise
that you couldnt hold me to
thatll be the day you see me crying

chorus
every day i still say youre dead and broken
every day i still say youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken

verse 2
how many different faces can you show me
how many times can you be right
another world of fantasy
another reason for dramatizing everything
taking it all in just one more time
im dying

chorus
every day i still say youre dead and broken
every day i still say youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likebridge
sorry to see
that youre underestimated lately
id rather be dead and broken
than living in your grace

chorus
every day i still say youre dead and broken
every day i still say youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken

outro
youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken
youre dead and broken
youre dead and brokenembed"
