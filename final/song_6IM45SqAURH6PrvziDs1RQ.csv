out of the zone trying to see
im so alone nothing for me
i guess ill go home try to be sane
try to pretend none of it happened
oh this old tree lonely old me
whoopsadaisy i thought i was happy oh
out of this zone now that i see
i dont need them and they dont need me
i guess ill go home try to be sane
try to pretend none of it happened
destined to be lonely old me
whoopsadaisy i thought i was happy oh

they just talk about themselves all day
one day ill be a star and theyll be sorry
