all them members got they own money you can challenge us
how you spend a hundredthirty thousand on a challenger
this a demon i done turned my partner to my manager
close another deal for twenty mill that laferrari comin
i put glue on both sides of the ball i know ill never fumble
im alive and aint doin no time so im forever humble
different kind im one of them guys she gon forever love me
he a child im lеttin him slide could get him whacked for nothin
i’m thе boss the one who they call when they lackin somethin
i’m in charge i’ll stand for it can’t go back for nothin
big dawg i’m a real problem you niggas little puppies
big swag a bag mask we be all lovey dovey

chorus
she kneel to my feet but bitches sneaky you would never know
he didnt put the people in the beef i still cant let it go
aint losin no sleep but if i did i aint gon let it show
i planted my seeds in the streets and i just let it grow
had to double down a hundred rounds im super cautious
i preach to the streets they play me cash im takin off then
im on all they ass im sittin back im takin off
so much hermès i can tell you if they fake or nah

verse 2
good relationships with all the plugs i try to never owe em
had to switch it up give up my phone so they can keep it goin
blicky kinda shot ill take it off you know i keep it on
watch me shake the world and wake up everyone who sleepin on me
had to cut my blood off too many people leechin on me
paranoid i see strange cars and get to reachin for it
i’m from where you turn into the plug if you get a decent number
disappointed they actin disloyal i keep it a hundred
its a process long as im in charge just know you comin home
rock hella stones used to come up short but now my money long
wont tell em wrong this shit aint no game you cant get back
marlo forever gone too many dead contacts in my telephone

i done beat the odds but puttin my people on my fav by far
soon as we catch dawg he gon get robbed he duck he gettin popped
people say im hot as fuck i told em im just gettin started
went from hangin on the corner im tryna buy my whole apartment
money comin in it make you fall out with your closest partners
everyone come to me with they pity story they know i got it
you did what i did and you aint have shit and you supposed to pop it
couldve moved to la and left everybody
spent a quartermilli on a richard since they all watchin
i come from the projects i got money stuffed in all pockets
icebox lick got my chain hittin like a water faucet
if i ever told you i love you then we forever locked in
