so i said this once before
im never gonna give you in
no not again
cause ive wasted all ive known
to watch it fade and slip away now
from my hands

prechorus
and what i have i have in mind
and i think about you all the time

chorus
im feeling miles away
you think ive got it made
i dont belong here
im feeling like a candle
burning at both ends
i dont belong here

verse 2
now i hide myself away
i never want to feel again
no not again
cause i faced this all alone
i let it seep and wash away now
its all the same
see seether liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeprechorus
and what i have i have in mind
and i think about you all the time

chorus
im feeling miles away
you think ive got it made
i dont belong here
im feeling like a candle
burning at both ends
i dont belong here

bridge

never run away this soon
never run away son
never run away son

prechorus
cause what i have i have in mind
and i think about you all the time

im feeling miles away
