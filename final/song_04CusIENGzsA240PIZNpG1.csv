so this was not how you planned it
no oh you dont understand it
why is it so misleading
when all you really wanted became so defeating
time well it only got harder
thought you had one but it was another
then you believed in a breakthrough
but it took you by surprise when you came out a fool

chorus
you gotta fail a thousand times before you see it through
you gotta spend your last dime before you ever make a million
you gotta know what brought you here and you gotta lose to persevere
but its the way the sun will rise through the darkest night
yeah its always been worth the fight

verse 2
hope it can make you courageous
it started out small but now its contagious
strength its an honor you earn
when you look back and see all the lessons youve learned

chorus
you gotta fail a thousand times before you see it through
you gotta spend your last dime before you ever make a million
you gotta know what brought you here and you gotta lose to persevere
but its the way the sun will rise through the darkest night
yeah its always been worth the fight
