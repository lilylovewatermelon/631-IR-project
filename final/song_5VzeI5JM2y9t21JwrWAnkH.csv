verse 1 kanye west  etta james
whats your addiction is it money is it girls is it weed
ive been afflicted by not one not two but all three
shes got the same thing about me but more about us
shes coming over so i guess that means im her drugs

shes got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush
times of the essence i need you to be spontaneous
roll up the doja henny and cocococacola
you make me smile with my heart ohh

chorus kanye west  etta james
why everything thats supposed to be bad make me feel so good

i see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
we get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blown
so i pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go
then ill get the lotion and do somethin to me when your thighs is exposed you make me smile
theres no turning back now i mean i dont mean to impose
not now but right now i need you to undress and then pose
im into that now catch a vibe when the doors get closed
roll up the doja henny and cocococa cola
you make me smile with my heart
and i keep cocoming over cause its nenever over
