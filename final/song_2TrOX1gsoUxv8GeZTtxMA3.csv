moves to how you live and learn how to die
another phase in this world that brings death to life
so don’t believe in everything you see

because what you want might not be what you need
hold your breath jump with me and we’ll survive
cause you are the sun that leads me to the light

hope is just a ray of what everyone should see
alone is the street where you found me
scared of what’s behind you
scared of what’s in front
live with what you have now and make the best of what’s to come

tell me a story long and true
we aren’t what we say
we are what we do
just pieces of a puzzle to find where we stand
just confused
so you are the moon that pulls me through the night

hope is just a ray of what everyone should see
alone is the street where you found me
scared of what’s behind you
scared of what’s in front
live with what you have now and make the best of what’s to come
