were finally alone at last
oh how ive waited for this day to come
theres just something about you that rubs me wrong
youre not worth my attention
i built this with
my own two hands
if you could spare me the time
stop using me as your next misconception

chorus jeremy mckinnon
i dont believe that everything
youve known about me is gone forever
and i wont forget the days that we spent forever
it haunts me
i dont believe that everything
youve known about me is gone forever
and i wont forget the days that we spent forever
it haunts me

verse 2 jeremy mckinnon
it wont be long before you meet your end
youre nothing more than a passing trend
so keep those cameras
rolling
you think i wouldnt remember
you thought that i would lose faith in myself
you can spare me the lies you dont believe in me
your lifes a contradiction
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus jeremy mckinnon
i dont believe that everything
youve known about me is gone forever
and i wont forget the days that we spent forever
it haunts me
i dont believe that everything
youve known about me is gone forever
and i wont forget the days that we spent forever
it haunts me
