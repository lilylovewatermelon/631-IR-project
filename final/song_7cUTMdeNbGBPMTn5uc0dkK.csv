welcome to the planet
welcome to existence
everyones here
everyones here
everybodys watching you now
everybody waits for you now
what happens next
what happens next

chorus
i dare you to move
i dare you to move
i dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
i dare you to move
i dare you to move
like today never happened
today never happened before

verse 2
welcome to the fallout
welcome to resistance
the tension is here
tension is here
between who you are and who you could be
between how it is and how it should be

maybe redemption has stories to tell
maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
where can you run to escape from yourself
where youa gonna go
where you gonna go
salvation is here

chorus
i dare you to move
i dare you to move
i dare you to lift yourself
lift yourself up off the floor
i dare you to move
i dare you to move
like today never happened
today never happened
today never happened
today never happened beforeembed"
