im sippin coffee at a quarter to two
i wake and im dialin and my minds runnin to you
no wonder im a one woman man
she keeps my heart in a jar on her nightstand
i should tell her that she couldnt be more
opposite than a foot in a door
theres no one else i would rather go out with
its hell when i see them standing there
me and my mouth we dont mean to be rushin
we talk about deep freely cause we crushin
im onna shake both sides of the butt yeah
theoretically yes aint we lucky

prechorus
and when the coyotes they sing in the park
thats when the city life starts falling for the sea
winding roads are winding down and the flying menll hit the ground
every notion is closer to touchin
the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin

chorus
hello
were comin back for more
you know why were comin for you
you know we should be we should be together
cause once we rock we wont wanna stop
not today or tomorrow
ah not today or tomorrow oh no
you better lock your doors
you know why cause we want you
cause we like you a lot
mmm mmm mmm

verse 2
i wish the world was alive like you
i wish the wind would blow me through
another opportunity to approach you
another telepathic rendezvous
i wish you well with your weapon of jargon
youve got a doublesided lexicon
i got to try to keep your attention
gotta write using less emoticons
gotta figure out the snooze alarm
i wanna lay in your place till dawn
i wanna play in the park come on now
let me see your other upper echelon
mmm mmm

prechorus
and when the coyotes escape to new york
then the city life has crumbled to the sea
and the girls all fall to the lost and found
the flying menll hit the ground
every notion is closer to touching
the coyotes sing when they feast on your lovin mhm
im a coyote and i got a taste for your lovin
chorus
comin back for more
you know why were comin for you
you know we should be we should be together
because once we rock we wont wanna stop
not today or tomorrow
not today or tomorrow oh no
because once we rock we wont wanna stop
not today or tomorrow oh mmm

were comin back for more
you know why were comin for you
you know we should be we should be together
cause once we rock we wont wanna stop
not today or tomorrow

can you get a little closer to the mic
