i was the young girl i was the dumb girl
i was the one who could never be your one girl
you were the fly guy never ask why guy
running around making all of the girls cry guy
laying in your bed it gets so cold
you wonder why
you were such the man damn
what happened its just so sad
they say…

he wanted things that he didnt need
and i was the one who was tryna make him see that
he had it all cause he had my all
but hes a lost cause guess you cannot save them all
and now hes at my show standing front row
he dont know how
he messed up such a good thing look whos popular now
