we were supposed to be just friends
you dont live in my part of town but maybe ill see you out some weekend
depending on what kind of mood and situationship im in
and whats in my system

chorus
i think theres been a glitch oh yeah
five seconds later im fastening myself to you with a stitch oh yeah
and im not even sorry nights are so starry
blood moonlit
it must be counterfeit
i think theres been a glitch oh yeah

verse 2
i was supposed to sweat you out
in search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone elses playground
but its been twothousand onehundred ninety days of our love blackout
our love is blacking out
the systems breaking down
the systems breaking down

chorus
i think theres been a glitch oh yeah
five seconds later im fastening myself to you with a stitch oh yeah
and im not even sorry nights are so starry
blood moonlit
it must be counterfeit
i think theres been a glitch
