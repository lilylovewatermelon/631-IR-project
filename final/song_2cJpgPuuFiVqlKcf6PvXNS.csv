hear me

verse 1
remember all the times
you bent our truth and crossed our lines
all things considered
it was just our normal way of life
but somewhere in the middle
we got caught and dragged away
so my tribunal brings us here
so i can fall today

prechorus
all you want is soulless
all you got to break us
all i have to do is
stop your fucking nonsense

chorus
i cant betray
i cant betray myself
myself

verse 2
i stand before you
as a victim as the system rots
i couldnt focus
so i staggered when i heard the shots
there are no labels
and no rehabilitation here
you are surrounded
by the very fucking thoughts you fear
you might also likeprechorus
all you want is soulless
all you got to break us
all i have to do is
stop your fucking nonsense

chorus
i cant betray
i cant betray myself
myself myself myself

verse 3
i watch the hope i had
disintegrate before my eyes
i take a minute
and reflect on all your fucking lies
behind the door you have two choices
but you dont get to choose
you can survive or you can die
either way you lose

prechorus
all you want is soulless
all you got to break us
all i have to do is
stop your fucking nonsense
chorus
i cant betray
i cant betray myself
myself myself myself

outro
