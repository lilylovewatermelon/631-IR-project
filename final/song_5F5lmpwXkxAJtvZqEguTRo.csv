you cant find it sitting on a shelf in a store
if you try to hide it its gonna shine even more

prechorus 1
even if you lose it it will find you
theres no way to stop it but theyll try to

chorus
running like a river tryna find the ocean
flowers in the concrete
climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
places that you cant see
coming through the melody when the night bird sings
love is a wild thing

verse 2
oh i can feel it magic in your fingertips
and i can hear it in the words coming off your lips

prechorus 2
even if you lose me i will find you
theres no way to stop it so dont try to

chorus
running like a river tryna find the ocean
flowers in the concrete
climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
places that you cant see
coming through the melody when the night bird sings
love is a wild thing
you might also likebridge
i used to be scared of the wilderness of the dark
but not anymore anymore no

chorus
running like a river tryna find the ocean
flowers in the concrete
climbing over fences blooming in the shadows
places that you cant see
coming through the melody when the night bird sings
love is a wild thing
love is a wild thing
love is a wild thing yeah9embed"
