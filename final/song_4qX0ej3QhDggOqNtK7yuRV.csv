were losing daylight but i cant work any faster
under the veil of dusk we go on
dont close your eyes
what if it all disappears in the shadows
that reach from the stars

chorus
if i held my ground would you ask me to change
this drought bleeds on now were dancing for rain
drink the air but its still not the same
these worlds collide but the distance remains
we point the finger never accept the blame
and i know oh and i know

main riff
lets go

verse 2
the waters gone but the fire still rages on here
the men all shrugged their shoulders and left
we sleep so sound in rooms just up the stairs
will you save us like you saved them

chorus
if i held my ground would you ask me to change
this drought bleeds on now were dancing for rain
drink the air but its still not the same
these worlds collide but the distance remains
we point the finger never accept the blame
and i know oh and i know
you might also likebridge
youve bled me dry but im still breathing
i swear im sucking dry the sky
and you wont ever find us kneeling
or swallowing your lies

chorus
if i held my ground would you ask me to change
this drought bleeds on now were dancing for rain
drink the air but its still not the same
these worlds collide but the distance remains
we point the finger never accept the blame
and i know oh and i know

outro
this drought bleeds on
this drought bleeds on3embed"
