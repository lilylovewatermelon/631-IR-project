nobody with no one
and bein me
aint really all that fun
and leavin her wasnt very smart
admitting i was wrong wouldnt be so hard

if it was cool to be a fool
id be the hippest guy around
if heartache made you famous
id be known from town to town
if tears were made of pennys and a cold beer brought her back
my bank account and self esteem would both be in the black
if some hollywood producer made a movie that was sad
about some guy who lost
the best thing he ever had
hey i could be a star
if it was cool to be a fool

but we all know
the way it really is
you dont get recoginized
for doin things like this
you spend a lot of time
feelin sorry for yourself
it doesnt really mean that much to anybody else
