verse 1 adam levine
no dont ask me if i love you
cause im sure as the night is long
and dont ask me if i need you
cause im sure that the time will come

just wait a couple lifetimes and ask me again

ya
kiss you kiss you kiss you
hug ya hug ya hug ya
look into your eyes and i see the ocean
i aint got no wings but you got me floating on a cloud
looking down its emotion
champagne flutes everybody toasting
heart beat fast on this roller coaster
love you up and down spin you round and round
can you hear me now
