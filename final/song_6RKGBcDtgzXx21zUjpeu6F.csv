oh my love
i know i am a cold cold man
quite slow to pay you compliments
or public displayed affections

prechorus
but baby dont you go overanalyze
no need to theorize
i can put your doubts to rest

chorus
youre the only one worth seeing
the only place worth being
the only bed worth sleepings the one right next to you
youre the only one worth seeing
the only place worth being
the only bed worth sleepings the one right next to you

verse 2
oh my love
i know youre used to desperate men
who say the words that others said
for too long and for too often

prechorus
but baby you can lay off a little bit
no need to smother it
i can put your doubts to rest

the only bed worth sleepings the one right next to you
youre the only one worth seeing
the only place worth being
the only bed worth sleepings the one right next to you
