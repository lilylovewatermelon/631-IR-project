and diamonds in your fingertips
youd waste it
if shining wisdom passed your lips
and traveled to the ears of god
youd waste it

and so i hate that youre overrated
most revered and celebrated
bcause youll waste it

then again
its good to get a call
now and then
just to say hello
have i said
i hate to see you go
i hate to see you go

but every time you close a door
and nothing opens in its place
youve wasted
and when you speak the words you know
to those who know the words themselves
youre wasted
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likeyoure such a classic waste of cool
so afraid to break the rules
in all the wrong places

but then again
its good to get a call
now and then
just to say hello
have i said
oh i hate to see you go
i hate to see you go

but then again
its good to get a call
now and then
just to say hello
have i said
i hate to see you go
i hate to see you go
