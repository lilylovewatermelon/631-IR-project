you’re good for nothing it’s what they always say
i cant say no different look at me today
always in and out of trouble an enemy of the state
why i can’t i get my act together dollar short a day late

chorus
and they say why you don’t quit drinkin’
you’re always acting like a clown
we all see your ships been sinkin’
just slowly goin’ down
youve been runnin’ for so long
you ain’t got no time to lose
you better right in all your wrongs
last call for the blues

verse 2
yeah the first step its admitting then it’s one day at a time
don’t you dare deny it youre way past your prime
you better start to look ahead what’s done is dead and gone
there ain’t no wisdom in that whiskey there’s only sadness in your song

chorus
and they say why you don’t quit drinkin’
you’re always acting like a clown
we all see your ships been sinkin’
just slowly goin’ down
youve been runnin’ for so long
you ain’t got no time to lose
you better right in all your wrongs
last call for the blues

chorus
and they say why you don’t quit drinkin’

you better right in all your wrongs
