verse 1 johnny 3 tears
coming straight outta cali the 818 valley
323 fucking horse nut alley
and from highland to clayton all these bitches are hating
cause the shit that were saying but its our shit that theyre playing
if we dont make it well take it if it aint real then well fake it
open your mouth and ill break it dont give a fuck if you hate it
were looking for the six chicks down with the six dicks
rolling on tens getting buzzed its ridiculous
horny like a sickness quickies with the quickness
pussy like its business work it like its fitness
listen while i spit this game at all these bitches
now im gonna hit this and fuck it till im dickless

verse 2 jdog
lets get the girls to the front lets put the sluts in the back
lets push em all together now lets put em on our laps
alcohol and drugs and california love
they got me ready to party all this weed and bacardi
from the north to the south this states all about
silicone lips and all the fake tits
california girls best in the world
best in the backseat so lets get fucking nasty
im a pirate on the streets of cacalifornia
moving and cruising were boozing all night till the morning
so from dusk till dawn you know undead is always on
hit it once like a bong hit it twice and then im gone
