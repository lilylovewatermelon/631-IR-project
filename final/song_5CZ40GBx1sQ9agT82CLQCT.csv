oohoohooh
ahahahahah

verse 1
brown guilty eyes and little white lies yeah
i played dumb but i always knew
that you talked to her maybe did even worse
i kept quiet so i could keep you

prechorus
and aint it funny how you ran to her
the second that we called it quits
and aint it funny how you said you were friends
now it sure as hell dont look like it

chorus
you betrayed me
and i know that youll never feel sorry
for the way i hurt yeah
you talked to her when we were together
loved you at your worst but that didnt matter
it took you two weeks to go off and date her
guess you didnt cheat but youre still a traitor

verse 2
now you bring her around just to shut me down
show her off like shes a new trophy
and i know if you were true theres no damn way that you
could fall in love with somebody that quickly

and you told me i was paranoid

chorus
