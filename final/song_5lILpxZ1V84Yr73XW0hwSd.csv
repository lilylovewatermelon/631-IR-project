verse 1 dj paul
its the return of the gangsta like my niggas outkast
smokin on the danka shut ya mouth i might pass
niggas off the heezy fuck all at the fuckin bar
on the floor or in the parking lot they throw it out the car
if they throw the wrong sign niggas better handle it
fuck goin outside right here you gettin wet
i bled for this here all i know is this here
and you thinkin imma let you disrespect this shit here
before i blow a nigga ass off  him and his ho

verse 2 juicy j
we up all night we smokin that shit
somebody run they mouth and then we bop on the bitch
they called us niggas we run in packs
some playa hate this skin because the color is black
we sag our jeans the ride be clean
them twankytwintwins make them rims be mean
we bracing ahead we trust in the lead
the fool we dont like is police and the feds
and if you violate get that tone to the head
and if ya girl approach us well see her in bed
ill probably own her flick cause she aint nothin to us
a neighborhood chewerhut hoodrat slut
we people on the left and we folks on the right
we throwin up them thangs and we startin them fights
the swinging we be doin is a ugly site
we sleep in the morning and we come out at night

verse 3 project pat
fuck around and get gun end straight up out the pen
from the mane with the sawedoff lay up off the gin
you can win if you squeeze first hollow points disperse
you may leave in an ambulance or inside a hearse
niggas curse when they get caught then they go to jail
took a purse with the gold watch but i cant make bail
yeah its sad but i did the crime i accept the time
just another broke hood nigga cheese up on my mind
grab the nine wanna make change suckers lay it down
project pat and them three 6 niggas who get down
bout that loot let the bullets shoot get across your grill
im a north memphis dinner thief all about a meal
and i will still retaliate all you ones that hate
im a rider for hypnotize move or wrapped in tape
a survivor so realize catchin you on late
in the bushes dont be surprised you gon meet your fate
