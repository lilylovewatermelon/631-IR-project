and youve forgotten me
for not forgiving you
i wonder if its right
to feel the way i do
cause i feel so empty
i wonder what went wrong
when all i did was right
when all i did was right
i wonder where you are
nothing seems so far
but it feels so empty
and you let it slip away
were getting older now you say
were getting older now
were getting older now
driving by your house
the windows all blacked out
the lights are all down low

i wonder where you are
nothing seems so far
but it seems so empty
then you let it slip away
were getting older now you say
were getting older now
were getting older now
were getting older now
standing at your grave
theres no one left to save
but i feel so empty
try and take it back
im trying to take it back
and i feel so empty
and you let it slip away
were getting older now you say
weve gotten older now
weve gotten older nowyou might also likeembed"
