it’s the only way that i might grow
a secret’s safe behind a pretty smile
and it’s mine mine mine

what’s with all the latenight liquored phone calls
i don’t think your lover likes me at all
a secrets safe behind a pretty smile
but its mine mine mine

what what might you do
to find out why i can’t love you
i can’t love you

and who said it was cool
to be asking me these questions
your who what and when where and why
are making my head spin
and when was it an option to put your lips upon my lips
and how did this happen and
why are you laughing and how do i get back together again

what what might you do
what what might you do
to find out why
to find out why
i can’t love you
i can’t love you
i can’t love youyou might also like2embed"
