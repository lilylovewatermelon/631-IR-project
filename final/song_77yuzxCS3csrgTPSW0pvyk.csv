piano intro

verse 1
a flock of birds hovering above
just a flock of birds thats how you think of love
and i always look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly away
sometimes they arrive
sometimes they are gone
they fly on

verse 2
a flock of birds hovering above
into smoke im turned and rise following em up
still i always look up to the sky
pray before the dawn
cause they fly away
one minute they arrive
next you know theyre gone
they fly on
fly on on

outro
so fly on ride through
maybe one day ill fly next to you
fly on ride through
maybe one day i can fly with you
fly on
fly on
fly on
