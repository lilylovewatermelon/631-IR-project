this is the place where all the junkies go
where time gets fast but everything gets slow
can i get some vaseline step into a modern scene
take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
i dont wanna do it like my daddy did
i dont wanna give it to my babys kid

chorus
this is my calling i said darling
shocking appalling all i can do to you
hammers are falling i said darling
shocking appalling all i can do to you

verse 2
this is the place where all the devils plead
their case to take from you what they need
can i isolate your gene can i kiss your dopamine
in a way i wonder if shes living in a magazine
i dont wanna say it if it isnt so
i dont wanna weigh it but ive gotta know

chorus
this is my calling i said darling
shocking appalling all i can do to you
hammers are falling i said darling
shocking appalling all i can do to you

i saw you out there yesterday what did you wanna say
a perfect piece of dna caught in a flashing ray
i caught you out there in the fray what did you wanna say
a masterpiece of dna caught in a flashing ray

verse 3
can i smell your gasoline
can i pet your wolverine
on the day my best friend died i could not get my copper clean

prechorus anthony kiedis
i dont wanna take it up with little joe
i dont wanna fake it but ive gotta know

chorus
this is my calling i said darling
shocking appalling all i can do to you
hammers are falling i said darling
shocking appalling  all i can do to you

outro
i am a misfit im born with all of it
the fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
im in a flash ray a mash of dna
another popinjay who thinks hes got something to say7embed"
