ol johnnys got a heart of gold
ask anyone around here
but some nights his eyes are far away
and filled with tears
sweet mary lous just as good as they come
with a weakness for all the wrong men
from the look on her face tonight
shes been wrong again
bartenders thinkin to himself
as he rubs his towel round a glass

chorus
now theres a man with a memory
theres a woman with a past
lost souls on lifes highway
forever lookin back
when youre living for the love
and the love doesnt last
you get a man with a memory
a woman with a past

verse 2
bartender turns the tv down
cranks that old jukebox up
carefully selects which buttons to push
for what each song does
c23 after j19
its a tonic for a broken heart
a little stardust in the mix
its a fine fine art
dim the lights a notch or two
the next round is on the house
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
for the man with a memory
and the woman with a past
lost souls on lifes highway
forever lookin back
when youre livin for the love
and the love doesnt last
you get a man with a memory
a woman with a past

bridge
oh weve all got something
weve got to get around
now and then you get the chance
to help the lost get found
stacking chairs and sweeping up
he cant help a little smile

chorus
thinking bout the man with a memory
and the woman with a past
lost souls on lifes highway
forever looking back
when youre living for the love
and the love doesnt last
you get a man with a memory
a woman with a past
postchorus
you get a man with a memory
a woman with a pastembed"
