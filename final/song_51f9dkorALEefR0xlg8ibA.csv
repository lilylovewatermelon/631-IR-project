dennis takes off sunglasses in another one sesame seed
floyd hey mister does that hat take ten gallons
the gas station attendants smack their knees and laugh more dennis very annoyed stomps up to them and tears their lips off the hillbillies looks at each other as dennis drives away

spongebob the key
patrick where do you think it is
a fish is kicked through one of the thug tug windows and lands next to spongebob and patrick with many broken bones his leg twitches the two look through the broken window and see thugs fighting becoming drunk and playing pool the inside is a disaster everything is cracked or splintered and the dim lights make everything look red rip is written in spray paint on a wall with a dead or knocked out fish below it they see the boat jacker playing pool with the key hooked onto his belt
spongebob there it is pat the key now how are we gonna get it

boat jacker confusingly its uh right over there he points behind him and notices spongebob reaching for his key spongebob looks up at him for a second before scuffing around on the ground searching for something
spongebob stupid contacts he holds up an imaginary contact oh there it is i better go wash it off runs away
inside the restroom patrick is going to the bathroom he finishes as spongebob comes in
spongebob angry patrick you call that a distraction
patrick jolts up he flushes the toilet turns to spongebob after realizing his error well i had to go to the bathroom
spongebob well i got my hands dirty for nothing he pumps the soap dispenser and the top is pushed off by pressure from bubbles forming inside of it patrick check it out he pumps more
patrick wow
both hooray bubble party bubbles float all around the bathroom and ragtime music plays as spongebob and patrick dance with bubbles patrick juggles them as spongebob gives him more to juggle then spongebob lays on his side and balances one on his foot patrick balances one on his head but one bubble drifts out the door and into the pub victor the bartender sees it
victor hey who blew this bubble victor punches it and it pops you all know the rules
everybody in the main area of the thug tug in unison all bubbleblowing babies will be beaten senseless by every ablebodied patron in the bar
one patron falling behind bar
victor thats right so who blew it
