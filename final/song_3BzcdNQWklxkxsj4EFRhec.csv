theres some kind of light at the end
when touching the edge of her skin

verse 1
once so hard to speak
now so easy to play around
catching your eye you know
that eye that slapped you in your face
calls you a puppy
well how do you say i was hypnotized
hypnotized

prechorus
my words they pour
like children to the playground
children to the playground
you make me smile

chorus
theres some kind of light at the end
stoned forgetful and then
im drinking what used to be sin
and touching the edge of her skin

verse 2
and could you be the one thats not afraid
to look me in the eye
i swear i would collapse
if i would tell how i think you fell
from the sky
see blue october liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus
my words they pour
like children to the playground
children to the playground
you make me smile

chorus x2
theres some kind of light at the end
stoned forgetful and then
im drinking what used to be sin
and touching the edge of her skin

bridge x2
its the feeling i get my palms with sweat
like some kind of daydream ill never forget
im stuck in this spin why does it begin
by touching the edge of her skin

chorus x2
theres some kind of light at the end
stoned forgetful and then
im drinking what used to be sin
and touching the edge of her skin

outro
you make me smile
woah woah woah ah
woah woah woah ah2embed"
