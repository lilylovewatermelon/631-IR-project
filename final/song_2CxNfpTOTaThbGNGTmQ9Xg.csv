all alone wishing on stars waiting for you to find me
one sweet night i knew i would see a stranger whod be my friend

chorus
when someone in the dark reaches out to you and touches off a spark that comes shining through
it tells you never be afraid
then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
a light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
like it was written in the stars i knew
my friend my someone in the dark was you
thank you

verse 2
promise me well always be walking the world together
hand in hand where dreams never end
my star secret friend and me

chorus
when someone in the dark reaches out to you and touches off a spark that comes shining through
it tells you never be afraid
then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
a light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
look for the rainbow in the sky
oh i believe you and i could never really say goodbye
wherever you may be ill look up and see
someone in the dark for me
wherever you may be ill look up and see
someone in the dark for me

though you are gone star far away
each time i see a rainbow
i will remember being with you
smiles coming through my tears

chorus
when someone in the dark reaches out to you
and touches off a spark that comes shining through
it tells you never be afraid
then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
a light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
look for the rainbow in the sky
i believe you and i
could never really say goodbye
wherever you may be
i will look up and see
someone in the dark for me
wherever you may be
i will look up and see
someone in the dark for me3embed"
