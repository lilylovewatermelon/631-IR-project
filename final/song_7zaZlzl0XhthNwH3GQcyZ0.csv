goddamn this dusty room this hazy afternoon
im breathin in this silence like never before
this feelin that i get this one last cigarette
as i lay awake and wait for you to come through that door
oh maybe maybe maybe i can share it with you
ill behave ill behave ill behave so i can share it with you

chorus
you are not alone dear loneliness
you forgot but i remember this
oh stranger stranger
stranger things have happened i know
im not alone dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
so stranger stranger
stranger things have happened i know
ohoh ohoh

verse 2
and i dream about somewhere a smoke will fill the air
as i lay awake and wait for you to walk out that door
i can change i can change i can change but who you want me to be
im the same im the same im the same oh do you want me to be

chorus
you are not alone dear loneliness
you forgot but i remember this
oh stranger stranger
stranger things have happened i know
ohoh ohoh
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
i am not alone dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
you are not alone dear loneliness
you forgot but i remember this
oh stranger stranger
stranger things have happened i know
i am not alone dear loneliness
i forgot that i remember this
oh stranger stranger
stranger things have happened i know
ohoh ohoh13embed"
