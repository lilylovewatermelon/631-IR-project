some days when im down just a little bit i drop myself to the floor
its not a problem if it hurts because i cant feel ache anymore
i only came back home because i wanted to see whats changed
and when i realise everyones gone but i still feel the same

chorus
i wasnt meant to be
this bored at nineteen
my friend lived next to me
now she wont wanna see
me look differently
now that im nineteen

verse 2
and i wish that i could tell all my exjobs in retail
that i shouldve stayed at work cause of the alevels i failed
my cousin just told me that my favourite shop shut down
and the other one just told me that ive always got a frown

bridge
my my minds alone because im alone
my minds alone because im alone
enough the lot ive had enough
my minds alone because im alone the gore the pain
ive had so much i love to hate
my minds alone because im alone the way i shaped because im hurt
and living rough
