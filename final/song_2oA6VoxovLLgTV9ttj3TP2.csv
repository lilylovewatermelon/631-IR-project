in the name of the witch i cut the head off a mule
i gutted it out put it on and then i wore it to school
that aint the only thing i wore i wore a clip and some rounds
a fuckin killa with this mule head and im clippin em down
because im all out of choices and my voice is unheard
you and your boys get the worst i aim your forehead and burst
im evil fires in my sky i see no diamonds its true
aim for your guts and blow your breakfast out behind you
im one with the darkness

chorus violent j
walk into the darkness
a place for those who chose to give a fuck less
wicked dark and heartless
we keep it nutty and bloody for everybody here

postchorus legz diamond
im goin to hell and im knowin it well
and i got no problem showin it im goin to jail

verse 2 shaggy 2 dope
i see the witch is preaching every night on channel 13
he wants some money with the number on the screen i hit the scene
im shootin up somebodys funeral someone i dont know
my thoughts are fraught with homicide i fire out of control
the preacher tried to reach his caddy in his mink white robe
but now hes like a sheep slaughtered on the side of the road
as for that crooked choir i set that place up on fire
as they came out batted their heads like i was mark mcgwire
im in the darkness

verse 3 violent j
walk til you fall into the darkness of hell
you gettin raped in hell by satans tail
and all you bitches with them pussies believe you gettin fucked
by a 27 foot dragon while chewin your face up
it aint pretty in hell and the only light
be the fire that you squirm in while you burnin all night
and when the wraith take you his grip is hard as a nail
hell turn your world upside down and make it rain hell

chorus violent j
walk into the darkness
hell turn your world upside down and make it rain hell
wicked dark and heartless
hell turn your world upside down and make it rain hell
walk into the darkness
hell turn your world upside down and make it rain hell
wicked dark and heartless
hell turn your world upside down and make it rain hell
