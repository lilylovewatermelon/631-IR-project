hey you bum  yeah you move over
get your ass off that range rover

mark
that attitude toward the homeless is just what
maureen is protesting tonight
close up benjamin coffin the third our ex
roommate who married alison grey of the westport
greys  then bought the building in hopes of starting
a cyberstudio

benny
maureen is protesting
losing her performance space
not my attitude

roger
what happened to benny
what happened to his heart
and the ideals he once pursued

benny
the owner of that lot next door
has a right to do with it as he pleases
you might also likecollins
happy birthday jesus

benny
the rent

mark
youre wasting your time

roger
were broke

mark
and you broke your word  this is absurd

benny
there is one way you wont have to pay

roger
i knew it

benny
next door the home of cyberarts you see
and now that the block is rezoned
our dream can become a reality
youll see boys
youll see boys
a state of the art digital virtual interactive studio
ill forego your rent and on paper guarantee
that you can stay here for free
if you do me one small favor
mark
what

benny
convince maureen to cancel her protest

mark
why not just get an injunction or call the cops

benny
i did and theyre on stand by
but my investors would rather
i handle this quietly

roger
you cant quietly wipe out an entire tent city
then watch its a wonderful life on tv

benny
you want to produce films and write songs
you need somewhere to do it
its what we used to dream about
think twice before you poohpooh it
youll see boys
youll see boys
youll see  the beauty of a studio
that lets us do our work and get paid
with condos on the top
whose rent keeps open our shop
just stop the protest
and youll have it made
youll see  or youll pack
angel
that boy could use some prozac

roger
or heavy drugs

mark
or group hugs

collins
which reminds me 
we have a detour to make tonight
anyone who wants to can come along

angel
life supports a group for people coping with life
you dont have to stay too long

mark
first ive got a protest to save

angel
