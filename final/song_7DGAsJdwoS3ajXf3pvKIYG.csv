why didnt you find me

verse 1
if i was not myself
and you were someone else
id say so much to you
and i would tell the truth
cause i can hardly breathe
when your hands let go of me
the ice is thinning out
and my feet brace themselves

chorus
im there in the water
still looking for ya
im there in the water
cant you see cant you see

verse 2
youve seen this all before
a life left on the shore
but smiling all the same
you sail away again

chorus
im there in the water
still looking for ya
im there in the water
cant you see cant you see

oh still looking for you for you for you oh im dead in the water

im dead in the water
still looking for ya
im dead in the water
cant you see
im dead in the water
still looking for ya
im dead in the water
