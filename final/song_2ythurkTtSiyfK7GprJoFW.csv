now go stand in the corner and think about what you did ha
haha time for a little revenge

verse 1
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
i had it all i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from

chorus
shes not a saint and shes not what you think
shes an actress woah
shes better known for the things that she does
on the mattress woah
soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
on the playground wont make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha

verse 2
she looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
she looks at me like im a trend and shes so over it
i think her everpresent frown is a little troubling and
she thinks im psycho cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
think about what you did
