mmm mmm mmm mmm
something aint right mmm mmm

lord have mercy babe

verse 1
tell me when was the last time
you brought her roses home from work
tell me when was the last time
you rubbed her feet when she said they hurt
tell me when was the last time
you bought a card to tell her how you feel
dont even know when was the last time
you lit a candle for a late night meal

chorus
tell me
how long will it be
before you treat her like your queen
tell me
and how long will it take
before she starts coming home too late
can you tell me
and how long will it be oh yeah
before she starts running in the streets
you better take the time
to treat her like your lady
treat her like your lady

you probably dont know when was the last time
you stopped to open up her car door
and tell me when was the last time
you heard her say baby do it once more
tell me when was the last time
you didnt have an argument
dont even know when was the last time
you told the truth about where youve been

prechorus
now if this dont apply to you
if this dont apply to you
keep doin what you do
keep doin what you do
but if the shoe fits you well oh oh
take a minute just to ask yourself just sixty seconds now

chorus
how long will it be how long
before you treat her like your queen
can you tell me
and how long will it take
lord have mercy babe
before she starts coming home too late

and how long will it be whoa oh oh
before she starts running in the streets
you better take the time

to treat her like your lady

is just like new to the next man thats right
what you dont do for her what you dont do for her
shell find somebody else who can

you better take it from me
you only end up just a lonely man

while youre running out there in the streets
before you treat her like your queen
shes probably out hanging with somebody else
and how long will it take
you dont want that to happen no no
before she starts coming home too late

and how long will it be
you better take the time
before she starts running in the streets
