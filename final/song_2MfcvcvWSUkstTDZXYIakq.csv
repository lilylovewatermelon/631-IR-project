verse 1 future
goin bonkers i fuck with her im her sponsor
go redundant everything i do responsive
off the continent everything is out the country
no assumption hit on the gas start punchin
park my confidence hit the gas barely functionin
aint no consciousness im bout to spaz on this stallion
fuck a casualty everything we did was lavishly
fuck a tragedy all these sticks automatically
