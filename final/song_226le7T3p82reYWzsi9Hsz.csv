well i got a call from rowdy ‘round six oclock
sayin he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
wants an ice cold beer and a country song
but he didnt want to stay out all night long
well i aint the kind to let a buddy drink alone
but i cant turn it off once i turn it on

chorus luke combs
theres no stoppin me once i get goin
put a can in my hand man im wide ass open
the ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
by half past 10 im half past tipsy
and quarter to 12 man i done had plenty
the countdowns on when the first beer hits me
54321 too many

verse 2 luke combs
after five diet millers i was feelin loose
singin karaoke to a tl tune
when a pretty little thing shot me a wink
she said hey cowboy could you buy us a drink
well hey baby doll i will if you want
but i cant turn it off once i turn it on

chorus luke combs
theres no stoppin me once i get goin
put a can in my hand man im wide ass open
the ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
by half past 10 im half past tipsy
and quarter to 12 man i done had plenty
the countdowns on when the first beer hits me
54321 too many
