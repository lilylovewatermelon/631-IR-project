its kinda crazy babe how i remember things
like where you came from and how you had nothin
i went and made you fly put extras on your ride
didnt miss a birthday now you cant even remember mine
you made it clear to me you wasnt down for me
love made me blind baby but now i see
you had things up your sleeve ho dont even lie to me
i even heard it from your family

chorus
how could you let somebody lay where i laid
how could you give him everything that we made
how could you call him all the names that you used to call me
how could you how could you just forget about me
how could you teach him all the things i taught you
how could you put him on to the ghetto kama sutra
how could you put me in the back and give him the front seat
how could you how could you just forget about me

verse 2
you must be out your mind you got a lot of nerve
to think that im gon chill after all the shit i heard
i damn near carried you i couldve married you
good thing i found out fore i bought that sevenkarat for you
i know youre sick about the way i found you out
go head and pack it out i hope hes got room in his house
you should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
damn i cant believe that you did this to me baby
