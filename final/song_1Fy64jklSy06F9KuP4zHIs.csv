verse 1 7th ward charizard
bitch i be that 7th ward dragon make a wish ill fucking grant it
suicide taken for granted burn a fuckboy til he blackened
burn a fuckboy til he charred 7th ward charizard
bitch i break the fucking law pullin over cop cars
fuck a pig tryna cuff my wrist—then they saw the slit
oh shit this that oozing motherfucker from the pit
7th ward lord grabbed his sword sliced a fucking bitch
now im swervin in the vic bout to ride off of a cliff bitch

verse 2 lil half cut
break the law say fuck a pig always on that devil shit
killers from the northside rollin in the 7th bitch
buck em down and bust em baptized in that tuss
half cut getting masked up comin to rush em
passin judgment on a bitchah throw em in the river
suicidal killer better known as lick the ripper
stoned to the bone me and oozing got the throne
all alone with the tone let the bullets take me home yuh
