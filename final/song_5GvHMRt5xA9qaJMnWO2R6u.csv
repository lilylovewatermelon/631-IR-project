i feel like the flowers in this vase
he just brought em home one day
aint they beautiful he said
theyve been here in the kitchen and the waters turning grey
theyre sittin in the vase but now theyre dead
dead flowers

verse 2
i feel like this long string of lights
they lit up our whole house on christmas day
but now its january and the bulbs have all burned out
but still they hang
like dead flowers

chorus
he aint feelin anything
my love my hurt or the sting of this pain
im livin in a hurricane
all he can say is man aint it such a nice day
yeah yeah

verse 2
i feel like the tires on this car
they said we wonâ€™t go far but were still rollin
i look in the rear view and i see dead flowers in the yard
and that string of lights
and it aint glowin
like dead flowers
like dead flowers

my love my hurt or the sting of this pain
and im drivin through a hurricane
