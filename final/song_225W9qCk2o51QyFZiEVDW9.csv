if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and lets all dance
if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

verse 1
i remember down in houston we were puttin on a show
when a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled cotton eye joe
he said we love what youre doing boys dont get us wrong
theres just something missing in your song

chorus
if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and lets all dance
if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band

verse 2
so we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case
you say yall all want to twostep say you wanna dosido
well heres a fiddling song before we go

chorus
if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
that lead guitar is hot but not for louisiana man
so rosin up that bow for faded love and lets all dance
if youre gonna play in texas you gotta have a fiddle in the band
