i can see you running running
running running
every night from the same darkness
its coming coming
coming coming
but you are not alone
if you just say the word
ill be there by your side
you make me more
you make me superhuman
and if you need me to
i will save you

chorus
send out the signal and ill fly low
if it means the death of me i wont let go
and if im lost in the worlds shadows
ill use the light that comes to me
from your halo

verse 2
when youre backed against the wall
i could be the one whos always there to break your fall
you are not alone
youre the sun youre the day
the light that guides me through
never run run away
i will save you
you might also likechorus
send out the signal and ill fly low
if it means the death of me i wont let go
and if im lost in the worlds shadows
ill use the light that comes to me
from your halo

send out the signal and ill fly low
if it means the death of me i wont let go
and if im lost in the worlds shadows
ill use the light that comes to me
from your halo

and if im lost in the worlds shadows
ill use the light that comes to me
from your halo
from your halo
from your halo
i wont let go
i wont let go
i wont let go
i wont let go

and if im lost in the worlds shadows
ill use the light that comes to me
from your halo
halo
your haloembed"
