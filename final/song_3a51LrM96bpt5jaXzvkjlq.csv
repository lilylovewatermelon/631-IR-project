i was saving i was saving i was saving
i was saving myself for you
i was saving myself for you
i waited my whole life for you
without you whats the point
i was saving myself for you

verse 1
tonight well be throwing a party
under the sunset we started to drink
a little faster now
the celebration so many faces
i say the words as the moon painted us blue

chorus
ive been saving myself for you
ive been saving myself for you
i waited my whole life for you
cause i was saving myself for you
now brother bring that beat back

verse 2
now hold on this is innocent blood all the beach boys look like sharks
because without you nothing ever mattered
i scream and wave my arms but you dont understand me
now as i watch them feed on you its over
if i die you die too
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
because im saving myself for you
ive been saving myself for you
i waited my whole life for you
cause i was saving myself for you
i just wanted one dance with you

bridge
and one night under the smoke alarm
every single door in this house is on fire
so melodramatic but it turns me on
i close my eyes it feels just like a movie
im convinced that we dont make sense
but id kill anyone who gets close

chorus
ive been saving myself for you
ive been saving myself for you
the sharpest thing i find for you
cause i was saving myself for you
ive been saving myself for you
i saved myself for you oh
dont you know id die for you
i saved myself for you

without you whats the point12embed"
