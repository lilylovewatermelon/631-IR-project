well i feel pretty good
and i guess that i could get crazy now baby
we all got in tune
when the dressing room got hazy

i know how you want it
when youre hot and tight
the girl cant stand it
when you do it right
when youre up on the stand
let me kick out the jams
kick out the jams were gonna kick em out

and im startin to sweat
you know my shirts all wet
what a feeling now baby
the sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin
you gotta have it baby
you cant do without
you get that feelin gotta kick em out
put that mic in my hand
and let me kick out the jams
kick out the jams we gotta kick em out
you might also likealright alright alright all

gotta give it up
you know you cant get enough miss mckenzie
cause it gets in your brain
and it drives you insane a loopy frenzy
the wigglin guitar and a crash on the drums
we wanna keep on rockin til the mornin comes
let me be who i am
and let me kick out the jams
yeah kick out the jams
i done kicked em outembed"
