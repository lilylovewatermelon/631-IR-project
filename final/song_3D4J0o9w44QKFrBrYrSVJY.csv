they say
the price of my wars not a price that theyre willing to pay
insane
you cheat with the french now im fighting with france and with spain
im so blue
i thought that wed made an arrangement
when you went away
you were mine to subdue
well even despite our estrangement ive got
a small query for you

what comes next
youve been freed
do you know how hard it is to lead

youre on your own
awesome wow
do you have a clue what happens now
oceans rise
empires fall
its much harder when its all your call
all alone across the sea
when your people say they hate you
dont come crawling back to me
