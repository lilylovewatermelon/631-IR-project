ive begun to realize
that im better when i am with you
you delivered me from the pain
in my life
easy now to recognize
all the misery i have been through
it was beating me to submission
till the day you arrived

prechorus
suddenly i felt alive
strength i had lost was revived
and building inside
and we both know why

chorus
cause youre mine
i knew i could be whole
if you were mine
ill vanquish any foe
because youre mine

verse 2
been betrayed too many times
didnt think i would ever recover
that itd haunt me for the rest of my life
then you opened up my eyes
and you helped me rediscover
were the one who resurrected
a man who had died
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeprechorus
your power it gave me new life
made me reborn and refined
rebuilt from inside
and we both know why

chorus
cause youre mine
i knew i could be whole
if you were mine
ill vanquish any foe
because youre mine

bridge
i never thought i would ever escape
at times i wanted to die
feared that it all was just a little too late
thought that i wouldnt survive
i let you in and let go of the hate
my heart recovered now i
owe you a debt that i can never repay
i still believe cause youre mine

prechorus
im burning inside
and we both know why
chorus
cause youre mine
i knew i could be whole
if you were mine
ill vanquish any foe
because youre mine

outro
i can regain control
because youre mine
i can take over the world
because youre mine5embed"
