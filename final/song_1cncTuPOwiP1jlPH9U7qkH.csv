the crowd starts to get a little more restless as 40 and e hart attempt to remember the next bars in their round with a few audience members even shouting 20 in support for jaz and official

e this shitll stop every power you got
both if this engage disengage you
40 itll be showtime at your crib
both and you aint gettin cable

e cmon 40 my nigga

40 gets flustered and forgets her bars again causing the crowd to boo and jeer loudly at her before the crowd chants e harts name in support for getting toq back on track

e aw shit
i said this shitll stop everything that you got if this engage disengage you
its bout to be showtime at your crib you aint gettin cable
40 ill let somethin big pop e
e leave her slumped at the dinner table
40 these hollows play hidden tag wit ya
not your hidden labels

by this point the crowd has become absolutely fed up with 40s stumbling and as they boo 40 and e hart agree to cut their round short

round 3 the bardashians
o when this battle got locked in we was on the phone thinkin of ideas plottin and schemin
j then official told me somethin but i couldnt believe it
i couldnt see it
she said
o 40 a crackhead
j and i died
she told me
o put on her versus couture and go to 1725
j couture said you be sniffin that shit i thought it was another one of her lies
but the whole time she rapped about it you couldnt even look her in her eyes
o im startin to think they booked her cause she got a nice body
this is so tragic
j yall gave us a bitch thats shaped like a coke bottle but got a coke habit

crowd starts chanting 30

o im startin to think they booked her cause she got a nice body
this is so tragic
j yall gave us a bitch thats shaped like a coke bottle but got a coke habit
yall remember i said barrs stands for bitches are residing in real shelters
well heres another flip
barrs stands for
both bitches are relying on raw substances
o and i would tell you suck my dick but i dont have one
and how you go from suckin plastic dick to a glass one

crowd starts chanting leave them alone

j and you just mentioned father right you should cherish that
o we bout to make it all clearer
j cause ive seen a brother die off that caine
both and his father was the pallbearer
j you can easily be a man down
o and ya moms was on drugs too
j i guess the coke dont fall far from the tree
o its in ya background
j you couldve graduated from the 12 step program
o but you back down
j instead you graduated from coke
o cause you on smack now

crowd starts chanting 30 again

o it makes sense why she was in a shelter i guess the coke was her membership
j the side effect must be memory loss cause in our battle she didnt remember shit
i exposed ya living conditions
o and she couldnt handle it shit i felt her
she was eminem in 8 mile
j hows that
o cause she couldnt stop choking while battling in the shelter
whats going on in ya life cracklisa
look me in my eyes right now
j cause we could bitchare you high right now

crowd starts chanting leave her alone

o and i heard she tried to shake it but she keep goin back
j the shit is that bad
o the rock roc keep callin her name
j ill be back ave
o so are you sober nigga
j if they act souped up
o we drawin them cans like pop art
j so many sticks in the whip
o this shit look like a golf cart
j see we spotted e first
o but we got off to an odd start
j cause the bullets went through hart car
o but they came outta car heart
j the desert eag is my fav
o why
j cause it do not miss
and larrys the last time boston seen a bird shoot like this
o we got bars
j what else
o delivery
j uh huh
o performance
j we really great
but they said they gonna beat us bar for bar
o well somethin goin in em since they pen a trait penetrate
j but yall call yall selves the only queens
o the only queens
both yall shut the fuck up
j cause you dont bring in money or views
o and yo biggest fight you got beat the fuck up
now you battle tom dick and harry on nobody gives a fuck battle league
how you a queen
j when you beat nobody that mattered after you battled me
o how you a queen
j you aint seen o qb hustle no one whos stock went up after they battled me
o how you a queen
j eight years to finally get on smack and you had to battle me
o and can you believe she made a song called fuck smack
this shit nutty wheres beasley
j whats up smack
you shouldve made her do a pg off gp
o you once had dedication but no victory lap was in you
you lacked the hustle to motivate the paradigm within you
yall had to double up for this race but we bomb and thats the issue
rip nip too bad we wont see this boston marathon continue
look at me queen
j look at me king
up until our battle you was loyal to one league
now you battlin everywhere else debo let you off the leash
or maybe hes not fuckin witchu
why you wasnt on his comeback card
main event was hustle vs twork
o he fuck with a bitch that aint fuck with him for six years over a bitch thats putting in so much work
he had her battle the hottest nigga out i wouldve made him switch it quick
j shit for makin me miss that shot i wouldve hit debo with a brick
o but your names supposed to reflect you
both but its hart this and hart that
j all this tough shit you be on
o but you dont have the heart to talk back
the only queen you just tucked ya tail like that was cool
j if you put a bitch on this big stage and it aint versus me or official smack im smackin you
o and im smackin you too nigga
and you shouldve stayed over there cause ya views hurtin
j we speakin facts to a king
o in time she worried
j aiesha curry
o you aint get attention after the ring
j and yall in the matrix cause reality shows yall aint in the same class we in
but this is what happens
both when yall try keeping up with the bardashians
