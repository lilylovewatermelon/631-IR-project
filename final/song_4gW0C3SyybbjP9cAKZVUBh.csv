it was more real than any dream he had ever had in his life he could still hear and feel the sharp rippingmetal explosion the violent heave that had tossed him furiously out of bed the searing wave of heat

he sat up convulsively and stared not believing what he saw at the quiet room and the bright sunlight coming in the window

he croaked mary

his wife was not in the bed next to him the covers were tumbled and awry as though she had just left it and the memory of the dream was so strong that instinctively he found himself searching the floor to see if the dream explosion had thrown her down

but she wasnt there of course she wasnt he told himself looking at the familiar vanity and slipper chair the uncracked window the unbuckled wall it had only been a dream

guy his wife was calling him querulously from the foot of the stairs guy dear are you all right

he called weakly sure

there was a pause then mary said doubtfully breakfast is ready are you sure youre all right i thought i heard you yelling

burckhardt said more confidently i had a bad dream honey be right down

in the shower punching the lukewarmandcologne he favored he told himself that it had been a beaut of a dream still bad dreams werent unusual especially bad dreams about explosions in the past thirty years of hbomb jitters who had not dreamed of explosions

even mary had dreamed of them it turned out for he started to tell her about the dream but she cut him off you did her voice was astonished why dear i dreamed the same thing well almost the same thing i didnt actually hear anything i dreamed that something woke me up and then there was a sort of quick bang and then something hit me on the head and that was all was yours like that

burckhardt coughed well no he said mary was not one of these strongasaman braveasatiger women it was not necessary he thought to tell her all the little details of the dream that made it seem so real no need to mention the splintered ribs and the salt bubble in his throat and the agonized knowledge that this was death he said maybe there really was some kind of explosion downtown maybe we heard it and it started us dreaming
mary reached over and patted his hand absently maybe she agreed its almost halfpast eight dear shouldnt you hurry
you dont want to be late to the office

he gulped his food kissed her and rushed outnot so much to be on time as to see if his guess had been right

but downtown tylerton looked as it always had coming in on the bus burckhardt watched critically out the window seeking evidence of an explosion there wasnt any if anything tylerton looked better than it ever had before it was a beautiful crisp day the sky was cloudless the buildings were clean and inviting they had he observed steamblasted the power  light building the towns only skyscraperthat was the penalty of having contro chemicals main plant on the outskirts of town the fumes from the cascade stills left their mark on stone buildings

none of the usual crowd were on the bus so there wasnt anyone burckhardt could ask about the explosion and by the time he got out at the corner of fifth and lehigh and the bus rolled away with a muted diesel moan he had pretty well convinced himself that it was all imagination

he stopped at the cigar stand in the lobby of his office building but ralph wasnt behind the counter the man who sold him his pack of cigarettes was a stranger

wheres mr stebbins burckhardt asked

the man said politely sick sir hell be in tomorrow a pack of marlins today

chesterfields burckhardt corrected

certainly sir the man said but what he took from the rack and slid across the counter was an unfamiliar greenandyellow pack

do try these sir he suggested they contain an anticough factor ever notice how ordinary cigarettes make you choke every once in a while

burckhardt said suspiciously i never heard of this brand

of course not theyre something new burckhardt hesitated and the man said persuasively look try them out at my risk if you dont like them bring back the empty pack and ill refund your money fair enough

burckhardt shrugged how can i lose but give me a pack of chesterfields too will you
he opened the pack and lit one while he waited for the elevator they werent bad he decided though he was suspicious of cigarettes that had the tobacco chemically treated in any way but he didnt think much of ralphs standin it would raise hell with the trade at the cigar stand if the man tried to give every customer the same highpressure sales talk

the elevator door opened with a lowpitched sound of music burckhardt and two or three others got in and he nodded to them as the door closed the thread of music switched off and the speaker in the ceiling of the cab began its usual commercials
no not the  usual  commercials burckhardt realized he had been exposed to the captiveaudience commercials so long that they hardly registered on the outer ear any more but what was coming from the recorded program in the basement of the building caught his attention it wasnt merely that the brands were mostly unfamiliar it was a difference in pattern

there were jingles with an insistent bouncy rhythm about soft drinks he had never tasted there was a rapid patter dialogue between what sounded like two tenyearold boys about a candy bar followed by an authoritative bass rumble go right out and get a delicious chocobite and eat your tangy chocobite all up thats chocobite there was a sobbing female whine i wish i had a feckle freezer id do  anything for a feckle freezer burckhardt reached his floor and left the elevator in the middle of the last one it left him a little uneasy the commercials were not for familiar brands there was no feeling of use and custom to them

but the office was happily normalexcept that mr barth wasnt in miss mitkin yawning at the reception desk didnt know exactly why his home phoned thats all hell be in tomorrow

maybe he went to the plant its right near his house

she looked indifferent yeah

a thought struck burckhardt but today is june 15th its quarterly tax return dayhe has to sign the return

miss mitkin shrugged to indicate that that was burckhardts problem not hers she returned to her nails

thoroughly exasperated burckhardt went to his desk it wasnt that he couldnt sign the tax returns as well as barth he thought resentfully it simply wasnt his job that was all it was a responsibility that barth as office manager for contro chemicals downtown office should have taken

he thought briefly of calling barth at his home or trying to reach him at the factory but he gave up the idea quickly enough he didnt really care much for the people at the factory and the less contact he had with them the better he had been to the factory once with barth it had been a confusing and in a way a frightening experience barring a handful of executives and engineers there wasnt a soul in the factorythat is burckhardt corrected himself remembering what barth had told him not a  living  souljust the machines

according to barth each machine was controlled by a sort of computer which reproduced in its electronic snarl the actual memory and mind of a human being it was an unpleasant thought barth laughing had assured him that there was no frankenstein business of robbing graveyards and implanting brains in machines it was only a matter he said of transferring a mans habit patterns from brain cells to vacuumtube cells it didnt hurt the man and it didnt make the machine into a monster
but they made burckhardt uncomfortable all the same

he put barth and the factory and all his other little irritations out of his mind and tackled the tax returns it took him until noon to verify the figureswhich barth could have done out of his memory and his private ledger in ten minutes burckhardt resentfully reminded himself
he sealed them in an envelope and walked out to miss mitkin since mr barth isnt here wed better go to lunch in shifts he said you can go first

thanks miss mitkin languidly took her bag out of the desk drawer and began to apply makeup
burckhardt offered her the envelope drop this in the mail for me will you uhwait a minute i wonder if i ought to phone mr barth to make sure did his wife say whether he was able to take phone calls

didnt say miss mitkin blotted her lips carefully with a kleenex wasnt his wife anyway it was his daughter who called and left the message

the kid burckhardt frowned i thought she was away at school

she called thats all i know

burckhardt went back to his own office and stared distastefully at the unopened mail on his desk he didnt like nightmares they spoiled his whole day he should have stayed in bed like barth

a funny thing happened on his way home there was a disturbance at the corner where he usually caught his bussomeone was screaming something about a new kind of deepfreezeso he walked an extra block he saw the bus coming and started to trot but behind him someone was calling his name he looked over his shoulder a small harriedlooking man was hurrying toward him

burckhardt hesitated and then recognized him it was a casual acquaintance named swanson burckhardt sourly observed that he had already missed the bus

he said hello

swansons face was desperately eager burckhardt he asked inquiringly with an odd intensity and then he just stood there silently watching burckhardts face with a burning eagerness that dwindled to a faint hope and died to a regret he was searching for something waiting for something burckhardt thought but whatever it was he wanted burckhardt didnt know how to supply it

burckhardt coughed and said again hello swanson

swanson didnt even acknowledge the greeting he merely sighed a very deep sigh

nothing doing he mumbled apparently to himself he nodded abstractedly to burckhardt and turned away
burckhardt watched the slumped shoulders disappear in the crowd it was an  odd  sort of day he thought and one he didnt much like things werent going right

riding home on the next bus he brooded about it it wasnt anything terrible or disastrous it was something out of his experience entirely you live your life like any man and you form a network of impressions and reactions you  expect  things when you open your medicine chest your razor is expected to be on the second shelf when you lock your front door you expect to have to give it a slight extra tug to make it latch

it isnt the things that are right and perfect in your life that make it familiar it is the things that are just a little bit wrongthe sticking latch the light switch at the head of the stairs that needs an extra push because the spring is old and weak the rug that unfailingly skids underfoot

it wasnt just that things were wrong with the pattern of burckhardts life it was that the  wrong  things were wrong for instance barth hadnt come into the office yet barth always came in

burckhardt brooded about it through dinner he brooded about it despite his wifes attempt to interest him in a game of bridge with the neighbors all through the evening the neighbors were people he likedanne and farley dennerman he had known them all their lives but they were odd and brooding too this night and he barely listened to dennermans complaints about not being able to get good phone service or his wifes comments on the disgusting variety of television commercials they had these days
burckhardt was well on the way to setting an alltime record for continuous abstraction when around midnight with a suddenness that surprised himhe was strangely  aware  of it happeninghe turned over in his bed and quickly and completely fell asleep

ii
on the morning of june 15th burckhardt woke up screaming

it was more real than any dream he had ever had in his life he could still hear the explosion feel the blast that crushed him against a wall it did not seem right that he should be sitting bolt upright in bed in an undisturbed room

his wife came pattering up the stairs darling she cried whats the matter

he mumbled nothing bad dream

she relaxed hand on heart in an angry tone she started to say you gave me such a shock

but a noise from outside interrupted her there was a wail of sirens and a clang of bells it was loud and shocking

the burckhardts stared at each other for a heartbeat then hurried fearfully to the window

there were no rumbling fire engines in the street only a small panel truck cruising slowly along flaring loudspeaker horns crowned its top from them issued the screaming sound of sirens growing in intensity mixed with the rumble of heavyduty engines and the sound of bells it was a perfect record of fire engines arriving at a fouralarm blaze

burckhardt said in amazement mary thats against the law do you know what theyre doing theyre playing records of a fire what are they up to

maybe its a practical joke his wife offered

joke waking up the whole neighborhood at six oclock in the morning he shook his head the police will be here in ten minutes he predicted wait and see

but the police werentnot in ten minutes or at all whoever the pranksters in the car were they apparently had a police permit for their games

the car took a position in the middle of the block and stood silent for a few minutes then there was a crackle from the speaker and a giant voice chanted
feckle freezers   feckle freezers   gotta have a   feckle freezer   feckle feckle feckle   feckle feckle feckle
it went on and on every house on the block had faces staring out of windows by then the voice was not merely loud it was nearly deafening

burckhardt shouted to his wife over the uproar what the hell is a feckle freezer

some kind of a freezer i guess dear she shrieked back unhelpfully

abruptly the noise stopped and the truck stood silent it was still misty morning the suns rays came horizontally across the rooftops it was impossible to believe that a moment ago the silent block had been bellowing the name of a freezer

a crazy advertising trick burckhardt said bitterly he yawned and turned away from the window might as well get dressed i guess thats the end of

the bellow caught him from behind it was almost like a hard slap on the ears a harsh sneering voice louder than the archangels trumpet howled

have you got a freezer  it stinks  if it isnt a feckle freezer  it stinks  if its a last years feckle freezer  it stinks  only this years feckle freezer is any good at all you know who owns an ajax freezer fairies own ajax freezers you know who owns a triplecold freezer commies own triplecold freezers every freezer but a brandnew feckle freezer  stinks 
the voice screamed inarticulately with rage im warning you get out and buy a feckle freezer right away hurry up hurry for feckle hurry for feckle hurry hurry hurry feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle

it stopped eventually burckhardt licked his lips he started to say to his wife maybe we ought to call the police about when the speakers erupted again it caught him off guard it was intended to catch him off guard it screamed

feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle cheap freezers ruin your food youll get sick and throw up youll get sick and die buy a feckle feckle feckle feckle ever take a piece of meat out of the freezer youve got and see how rotten and moldy it is buy a feckle feckle feckle feckle feckle do you want to eat rotten stinking food or do you want to wise up and buy a feckle feckle feckle

that did it with fingers that kept stabbing the wrong holes burckhardt finally managed to dial the local police station he got a busy signalit was apparent that he was not the only one with the same ideaand while he was shakingly dialing again the noise outside stopped

he looked out the window the truck was gone

burckhardt loosened his tie and ordered another frostyflip from the waiter if only they wouldnt keep the crystal cafe so  hot the new paint jobsearing reds and blinding yellowswas bad enough but someone seemed to have the delusion that this was january instead of june the place was a good ten degrees warmer than outside

he swallowed the frostyflip in two gulps it had a kind of peculiar flavor he thought but not bad it certainly cooled you off just as the waiter had promised he reminded himself to pick up a carton of them on the way home mary might like them she was always interested in something new

he stood up awkwardly as the girl came across the restaurant toward him she was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in tylerton chinheight honeyblonde hair and a figure thatwell it was all hers there was no doubt in the world that the dress that clung to her was the only thing she wore he felt as if he were blushing as she greeted him

mr burckhardt the voice was like distant tomtoms its wonderful of you to let me see you after this morning

he cleared his throat not at all wont you sit down miss

april horn she murmured sitting downbeside him not where he had pointed on the other side of the table call me april wont you

she was wearing some kind of perfume burckhardt noted with what little of his mind was functioning at all it didnt seem fair that she should be using perfume as well as everything else he came to with a start and realized that the waiter was leaving with an order for  filets mignon  for two

hey he objected

please mr burckhardt her shoulder was against his her face was turned to him her breath was warm her expression was tender and solicitous this is all on the feckle corporation please let themits the  least  they can do

he felt her hand burrowing into his pocket

i put the price of the meal into your pocket she whispered conspiratorially please do that for me wont you i mean id appreciate it if youd pay the waiterim oldfashioned about things like that

she smiled meltingly then became mockbusinesslike but you must take the money she insisted why youre letting feckle off lightly if you do you could sue them for every nickel theyve got disturbing your sleep like that

with a dizzy feeling as though he had just seen someone make a rabbit disappear into a top hat he said why it really wasnt so bad uh april a little noisy maybe but

oh mr burckhardt the blue eyes were wide and admiring i knew youd understand its just thatwell its such a  wonderful  freezer that some of the outside men get carried away so to speak as soon as the main office found out about what happened they sent representatives around to every house on the block to apologize your wife told us where we could phone youand im so very pleased that you were willing to let me have lunch with you so that i could apologize too because truly

mr burckhardt it is a  fine  freezer

i shouldnt tell you this but the blue eyes were shyly loweredid do almost anything for feckle freezers its more than a job to me she looked up she was enchanting i bet you think im silly dont you

burckhardt coughed well i

oh you dont want to be unkind she shook her head no dont pretend you think its silly but really mr burckhardt you wouldnt think so if you knew more about the feckle let me show you this little booklet

burckhardt got back from lunch a full hour late it wasnt only the girl who delayed him there had been a curious interview with a little man named swanson whom he barely knew who had stopped him with desperate urgency on the streetand then left him cold

but it didnt matter much mr barth for the first time since burckhardt had worked there was out for the dayleaving burckhardt stuck with the quarterly tax returns

what did matter though was that somehow he had signed a purchase order for a twelvecubicfoot feckle freezer upright model selfdefrosting list price 625 with a ten per cent courtesy discountbecause of that  horrid  affair this morning mr burckhardt she had said

and he wasnt sure how he could explain it to his wife

he neednt have worried as he walked in the front door his wife said almost immediately i wonder if we cant afford a new freezer dear there was a man here to apologize about that noise andwell we got to talking and
she had signed a purchase order too

it had been the damnedest day burckhardt thought later on his way up to bed but the day wasnt done with him yet at the head of the stairs the weakened spring in the electric light switch refused to click at all he snapped it back and forth angrily and of course succeeded in jarring the tumbler out of its pins the wires shorted and every light in the house went out

damn said guy burckhardt

fuse his wife shrugged sleepily let it go till the morning dear

burckhardt shook his head you go back to bed ill be right along

it wasnt so much that he cared about fixing the fuse but he was too restless for sleep he disconnected the bad switch with a screwdriver stumbled down into the black kitchen found the flashlight and climbed gingerly down the cellar stairs he located a spare fuse pushed an empty trunk over to the fuse box to stand on and twisted out the old fuse

when the new one was in he heard the starting click and steady drone of the refrigerator in the kitchen overhead

he headed back to the steps and stopped

where the old trunk had been the cellar floor gleamed oddly bright he inspected it in the flashlight beam it was metal

son of a gun said guy burckhardt he shook his head unbelievingly he peered closer rubbed the edges of the metallic patch with his thumb and acquired an annoying cutthe edges were  sharp 

the stained cement floor of the cellar was a thin shell he found a hammer and cracked it off in a dozen spotseverywhere was metal the whole cellar was a copper box even the cementbrick walls were false fronts over a metal sheath

baffled he attacked one of the foundation beams that at least was real wood the glass in the cellar windows was real glass
he sucked his bleeding thumb and tried the base of the cellar stairs real wood he chipped at the bricks under the oil burner real bricks the retaining walls the floorthey were faked it was as though someone had shored up the house with a frame of metal and then laboriously concealed the evidence

the biggest surprise was the upsidedown boat hull that blocked the rear half of the cellar relic of a brief home workshop period that burckhardt had gone through a couple of years before from above it looked perfectly normal inside though where there should have been thwarts and seats and lockers there was a mere tangle of braces rough and unfinished

but i  built  that burckhardt exclaimed forgetting his thumb he leaned against the hull dizzily trying to think this thing through for reasons beyond his comprehension someone had taken his boat and his cellar away maybe his whole house and replaced them with a clever mockup of the real thing

thats crazy he said to the empty cellar he stared around in the light of the flash he whispered what in the name of heaven would anybody do that for

reason refused an answer there wasnt any reasonable answer for long minutes burckhardt contemplated the uncertain picture of his own sanity he peered under the boat again hoping to reassure himself that it was a mistake just his imagination but the sloppy unfinished bracing was unchanged he crawled under for a better look feeling the rough wood incredulously utterly impossible he switched off the flashlight and started to wriggle out but he didnt make it in the moment between the command to his legs to move and the crawling out he felt a sudden draining weariness flooding through him

consciousness wentnot easily but as though it were being taken away and guy burckhardt was asleep

iii

on the morning of june 16th guy burckhardt woke up in a cramped position huddled under the hull of the boat in his basementand raced upstairs to find it was june 15th

the first thing he had done was to make a frantic hasty inspection of the boat hull the faked cellar floor the imitation stone
they were all as he had remembered themall completely unbelievable

the kitchen was its placid unexciting self the electric clock was purring soberly around the dial almost six oclock it said his wife would be waking at any moment

burckhardt flung open the front door and stared out into the quiet street the morning paper was tossed carelessly against the stepsand as he retrieved it he noticed that this was the 15th day of june

but that was impossible  yesterday  was the 15th of june it was not a date one would forgetit was quarterly taxreturn day
he went back into the hall and picked up the telephone he dialed for weather information and got a wellmodulated chant and cooler some showers barometric pressure thirty point zero four rising  united states weather bureau forecast for june 15th warm and sunny with high around

he hung the phone up june 15th

holy heaven burckhardt said prayerfully things were very odd indeed he heard the ring of his wifes alarm and bounded up the stairs

mary burckhardt was sitting upright in bed with the terrified uncomprehending stare of someone just waking out of a nightmare

oh she gasped as her husband came in the room darling i just had the most  terrible  dream it was like an explosion and

again burckhardt asked not very sympathetically mary somethings funny i  knew  there was something wrong all day yesterday and

he went on to tell her about the copper box that was the cellar and the odd mockup someone had made of his boat mary looked astonished then alarmed then placatory and uneasy

she said dear are you  sure  because i was cleaning that old trunk out just last week and i didnt notice anything

positive said guy burckhardt i dragged it over to the wall to step on it to put a new fuse in after we blew the lights out and

after we what mary was looking more than merely alarmed

after we blew the lights out you know when the switch at the head of the stairs stuck i went down to the cellar and

mary sat up in bed guy the switch didnt stick i turned out the lights myself last night

burckhardt glared at his wife now i  know  you didnt come here and take a look

he stalked out to the landing and dramatically pointed to the bad switch the one that he had unscrewed and left hanging the night before

only it wasnt it was as it had always been unbelieving burckhardt pressed it and the lights sprang up in both halls

mary looking pale and worried left him to go down to the kitchen and start breakfast burckhardt stood staring at the switch for a long time his mental processes were gone beyond the point of disbelief and shock they simply were not functioning
he shaved and dressed and ate his breakfast in a state of numb introspection mary didnt disturb him she was apprehensive and soothing she kissed him goodby as he hurried out to the bus without another word

miss mitkin at the reception desk greeted him with a yawn morning she said drowsily mr barth wont be in today
burckhardt started to say something but checked himself she would not know that barth hadnt been in yesterday either because she was tearing a june 14th pad off her calendar to make way for the new june 15th sheet

he staggered to his own desk and stared unseeingly at the mornings mail it had not even been opened yet but he knew that the factory distributors envelope contained an order for twenty thousand feet of the new acoustic tile and the one from finebeck  sons was a complaint

after a long while he forced himself to open them they were

by lunchtime driven by a desperate sense of urgency burckhardt made miss mitkin take her lunch hour firstthe junefifteenththatwasyesterday  he  had gone first she went looking vaguely worried about his strained insistence but it made no difference to burckhardts mood

the phone rang and burckhardt picked it up abstractedly contro chemicals downtown burckhardt speaking

the voice said this is swanson and stopped

burckhardt waited expectantly but that was all he said hello

again the pause then swanson asked in sad resignation still nothing eh

nothing what swanson is there something you want you came up to me yesterday and went through this routine you

the voice crackled burckhardt oh my good heavens  you remember  stay right thereill be down in half an hour

whats this all about

never mind the little man said exultantly tell you about it when i see you dont say any more over the phonesomebody may be listening just wait there say hold on a minute will you be alone in the office

well no miss mitkin will probably

hell look burckhardt where do you eat lunch is it good and noisy

why i suppose so the crystal cafe its just about a block

i know where it is meet you in half an hour and the receiver clicked

the crystal cafe was no longer painted red but the temperature was still up and they had added pipedin music interspersed with commercials the advertisements were for frostyflip marlin cigarettestheyre sanitized the announcer purredand something called chocobite candy bars that burckhardt couldnt remember ever having heard of before but he heard more about them quickly enough

while he was waiting for swanson to show up a girl in the cellophane skirt of a nightclub cigarette vendor came through the restaurant with a tray of tiny scarletwrapped candies

chocobites are  tangy  she was murmuring as she came close to his table chocobites are  tangier  than tangy
burckhardt intent on watching for the strange little man who had phoned him paid little attention but as she scattered a handful of the confections over the table next to his smiling at the occupants he caught a glimpse of her and turned to stare

why miss horn he said

the girl dropped her tray of candies

burckhardt rose concerned over the girl is something wrong

but she fled

the manager of the restaurant was staring suspiciously at burckhardt who sank back in his seat and tried to look inconspicuous he hadnt insulted the girl maybe she was just a very strictly reared young lady he thoughtin spite of the long bare legs under the cellophane skirtand when he addressed her she thought he was a masher
ridiculous idea burckhardt scowled uneasily and picked up his menu

burckhardt it was a shrill whisper

burckhardt looked up over the top of his menu startled in the seat across from him the little man named swanson was sitting tensely poised

burckhardt the little man whispered again lets get out of here theyre on to you now if you want to stay alive come on
there was no arguing with the man burckhardt gave the hovering manager a sick apologetic smile and followed swanson out the little man seemed to know where he was going in the street he clutched burckhardt by the elbow and hurried him off down the block

did you see her he demanded that horn woman in the phone booth shell have them here in five minutes believe me so hurry it up

although the street was full of people and cars nobody was paying any attention to burckhardt and swanson the air had a nip in itmore like october than june burckhardt thought in spite of the weather bureau and he felt like a fool following this mad little man down the street running away from some them towardtoward what the little man might be crazy but he was afraid and the fear was infectious

in here panted the little man

it was another restaurantmore of a bar really and a sort of secondrate place that burckhardt had never patronized

right straight through swanson whispered and burckhardt like a biddable boy sidestepped through the mass of tables to the far end of the restaurant

it was lshaped with a front on two streets at right angles to each other they came out on the side street swanson staring coldly back at the questionlooking cashier and crossed to the opposite sidewalk

they were under the marquee of a movie theater swansons expression began to relax

lost them he crowed softly were almost there

he stepped up to the window and bought two tickets burckhardt trailed him in to the theater it was a weekday matinee and the place was almost empty from the screen came sounds of gunfire and horses hoofs a solitary usher leaning against a bright brass rail looked briefly at them and went back to staring boredly at the picture as swanson led burckhardt down a flight of carpeted marble steps

they were in the lounge and it was empty there was a door for men and one for ladies and there was a third door marked manager in gold letters swanson listened at the door and gently opened it and peered inside

okay he said gesturing
burckhardt followed him through an empty office to another doora closet probably because it was unmarked

but it was no closet swanson opened it warily looked inside then motioned burckhardt to follow

it was a tunnel metalwalled brightly lit empty it stretched vacantly away in both directions from them

burckhardt looked wondering around one thing he knew and knew full well

no such tunnel belonged under tylerton

there was a room off the tunnel with chairs and a desk and what looked like television screens swanson slumped in a chair panting

were all right for a while here he wheezed they dont come here much any more if they do well hear them and we can hide

who demanded burckhardt

the little man said martians his voice cracked on the word and the life seemed to go out of him in morose tones he went on well i think theyre martians although you could be right you know ive had plenty of time to think it over these last few weeks after they got you and its possible theyre russians after all still

start from the beginning who got me when

swanson sighed so we have to go through the whole thing again all right it was about two months ago that you banged on my door late at night you were all beat upscared silly you begged me to help you

 i  did

naturally you dont remember any of this listen and youll understand you were talking a blue streak about being captured and threatened and your wife being dead and coming back to life and all kinds of mixedup nonsense i thought you were crazy butwell ive always had a lot of respect for you and you begged me to hide you and i have this darkroom you know it locks from the inside only i put the lock on myself so we went in therejust to humor youand along about midnight which was only fifteen or twenty minutes after we passed out

passed out

swanson nodded both of us it was like being hit with a sandbag look didnt that happen to you again last night

i guess it did burckhardt shook his head uncertainly

sure and then all of a sudden we were awake again and you said you were going to show me something funny and we went out and bought a paper and the date on it was june 15th

june 15th but thats today i mean

you got it friend its  always  today

it took time to penetrate

burckhardt said wonderingly youve hidden out in that darkroom for how many weeks

how can i tell four or five maybe i lost count and every day the samealways the 15th of june always my landlady mrs keefer is sweeping the front steps always the same headline in the papers at the corner it gets monotonous friend

iv

it was burckhardts idea and swanson despised it but he went along he was the type who always went along

its dangerous he grumbled worriedly suppose somebody comes by theyll spot us and

what have we got to lose

swanson shrugged its dangerous he said again but he went along

burckhardts idea was very simple he was sure of only one thingthe tunnel went somewhere martians or russians fantastic plot or crazy hallucination whatever was wrong with tylerton had an explanation and the place to look for it was at the end of the tunnel

they jogged along it was more than a mile before they began to see an end they were in luckat least no one came through the tunnel to spot them but swanson had said that it was only at certain hours that the tunnel seemed to be in use
always the fifteenth of june why burckhardt asked himself never mind the how  why

and falling asleep completely involuntarilyeveryone at the same time it seemed and not remembering never remembering anythingswanson had said how eagerly he saw burckhardt again the morning after burckhardt had incautiously waited five minutes too many before retreating into the darkroom when swanson had come to burckhardt was gone swanson had seen him in the street that afternoon but burckhardt had remembered nothing

and swanson had lived his mouses existence for weeks hiding in the woodwork at night stealing out by day to search for burckhardt in pitiful hope scurrying around the fringe of life trying to keep from the deadly eyes of them 

them one of them was the girl named april horn it was by seeing her walk carelessly into a telephone booth and never come out that swanson had found the tunnel another was the man at the cigar stand in burckhardts office building there were more at least a dozen that swanson knew of or suspected

they were easy enough to spot once you knew where to lookfor they alone in tylerton changed their roles from day to day burckhardt was on that 851 bus every morning of every daythatwasjune15th never different by a hair or a moment but april horn was sometimes gaudy in the cellophane skirt giving away candy or cigarettes sometimes plainly dressed sometimes not seen by swanson at all

russians martians whatever they were what could they be hoping to gain from this mad masquerade burckhardt didnt know the answerbut perhaps it lay beyond the door at the end of the tunnel they listened carefully and heard distant sounds that could not quite be made out but nothing that seemed dangerous they slipped through

and through a wide chamber and up a flight of steps they found they were in what burckhardt recognized as the contro chemicals plant

nobody was in sight by itself that was not so very oddthe automatized factory had never had very many persons in it but burckhardt remembered from his single visit the endless ceaseless busyness of the plant the valves that opened and closed the vats that emptied themselves and filled themselves and stirred and cooked and chemically tasted the bubbling liquids they held inside themselves the plant was never populated but it was never still

onlynow it  was  still except for the distant sounds there was no breath of life in it the captive electronic minds were sending out no commands the coils and relays were at rest

burckhardt said come on swanson reluctantly followed him through the tangled aisles of stainless steel columns and tanks
they walked as though they were in the presence of the dead in a way they were for what were the automatons that once had run the factory if not corpses the machines were controlled by computers that were really not computers at all but the electronic analogues of living brains and if they were turned off were they not dead for each had once been a human mind
take a master petroleum chemist infinitely skilled in the separation of crude oil into its fractions strap him down probe into his brain with searching electronic needles the machine scans the patterns of the mind translates what it sees into charts and sine waves impress these same waves on a robot computer and you have your chemist or a thousand copies of your chemist if you wish with all of his knowledge and skill and no human limitations at all

put a dozen copies of him into a plant and they will run it all twentyfour hours a day seven days of every week never tiring never overlooking anything never forgetting

swanson stepped up closer to burckhardt im scared he said

they were across the room now and the sounds were louder they were not machine sounds but voices burckhardt moved cautiously up to a door and dared to peer around it

it was a smaller room lined with television screens each onea dozen or more at leastwith a man or woman sitting before it staring into the screen and dictating notes into a recorder the viewers dialed from scene to scene no two screens ever showed the same picture

the pictures seemed to have little in common one was a store where a girl dressed like april horn was demonstrating home freezers one was a series of shots of kitchens burckhardt caught a glimpse of what looked like the cigar stand in his office building

it was baffling and burckhardt would have loved to stand there and puzzle it out but it was too busy a place there was the chance that someone would look their way or walk out and find them

they found another room this one was empty it was an office large and sumptuous it had a desk littered with papers burckhardt stared at them briefly at firstthen as the words on one of them caught his attention with incredulous fascination

he snatched up the topmost sheet scanned it and another while swanson was frenziedly searching through the drawers
burckhardt swore unbelievingly and dropped the papers to the desk

swanson hardly noticing yelped with delight look he dragged a gun from the desk and its loaded too

burckhardt stared at him blankly trying to assimilate what he had read then as he realized what swanson had said

burckhardts eyes sparked good man he cried well take it were getting out of here with that gun swanson and were going to the police not the cops in tylerton but the fbi maybe take a look at this

the sheaf he handed swanson was headed test area progress report subject marlin cigarettes campaign it was mostly tabulated figures that made little sense to burckhardt and swanson but at the end was a summary that said  although test 47k3 pulled nearly double the number of new      users of any of the other tests conducted it probably      cannot be used in the field because of local soundtruck  control ordinances

the tests in the 47k12 group were second best and our  recommendation is that retests be conducted in this appeal      testing each of the three best campaigns with and without the addition of sampling techniques

an alternative suggestion might be to proceed directly with the top appeal in the k12 series if the client is unwilling      to go to the expense of additional tests

all of these forecast expectations have an 80 probability of being within onehalf of one per cent of results      forecast and more than 99 probability of coming within 5

swanson looked up from the paper into burckhardts eyes i dont get it he complained

burckhardt said i dont blame you its crazy but it fits the facts swanson  it fits the facts  they arent russians and they arent martians these people are advertising men somehowheaven knows how they did ittheyve taken tylerton over theyve got us all of us you and me and twenty or thirty thousand other people right under their thumbs maybe they hypnotize us and maybe its something else but however they do it what happens is that they let us live a day at a time they pour advertising into us the whole damned day long and at the end of the day they see what happenedand then they wash the day out of our minds and start again the next day with different advertising

swansons jaw was hanging he managed to close it and swallow nuts he said flatly

burckhardt shook his head sure it sounds crazybut this whole thing is crazy how else would you explain it you cant deny that most of tylerton lives the same day over and over again youve  seen  it and thats the crazy part and we have to admit that thats trueunless we are the crazy ones and once you admit that somebody somehow knows how to accomplish that the rest of it makes all kinds of sense

think of it swanson they test every last detail before they spend a nickel on advertising do you have any idea what that means lord knows how much money is involved but i know for a fact that some companies spend twenty or thirty million dollars a year on advertising multiply it say by a hundred companies say that every one of them learns how to cut its advertising cost by only ten per cent and thats peanuts believe me

if they know in advance whats going to work they can cut their costs in halfmaybe to less than half i dont know but thats saving two or three hundred million dollars a yearand if they pay only ten or twenty per cent of that for the use of tylerton its still dirt cheap for them and a fortune for whoever took over tylerton

swanson licked his lips you mean he offered hesitantly that were awell a kind of captive audience

burckhardt frowned not exactly he thought for a minute you know how a doctor tests something like penicillin he sets up a series of little colonies of germs on gelatine disks and he tries the stuff on one after another changing it a little each time
well thats uswere the germs swanson only its even more efficient than that they dont have to test more than one colony because they can use it over and over again

it was too hard for swanson to take in he only said what do we do about it

we go to the police they cant use human beings for guinea pigs

how do we get to the police

burckhardt hesitated i think he began slowly sure this place is the office of somebody important weve got a gun well stay right here until he comes along and hell get us out of here

simple and direct swanson subsided and found a place to sit against the wall out of sight of the door burckhardt took up a position behind the door itself

and waited

the wait was not as long as it might have been half an hour perhaps then burckhardt heard approaching voices and had time for a swift whisper to swanson before he flattened himself against the wall

it was a mans voice and a girls the man was saying reason why you couldnt report on the phone youre ruining your whole days test what the devils the matter with you janet

im sorry mr dorchin she said in a sweet clear tone i thought it was important

the man grumbled important one lousy unit out of twentyone thousand

but its the burckhardt one mr dorchin again and the way he got out of sight he must have had some help

all right all right it doesnt matter janet the chocobite program is ahead of schedule anyhow as long as youre this far come on in the office and make out your worksheet and dont worry about the burckhardt business hes probably just wandering around well pick him up tonight and

they were inside the door burckhardt kicked it shut and pointed the gun

thats what you think he said triumphantly

it was worth the terrified hours the bewildered sense of insanity the confusion and fear it was the most satisfying sensation burckhardt had ever had in his life the expression on the mans face was one he had read about but never actually seen

dorchins mouth fell open and his eyes went wide and though he managed to make a sound that might have been a question it was not in words

the girl was almost as surprised and burckhardt looking at her knew why her voice had been so familiar the girl was the one who had introduced herself to him as april horn

dorchin recovered himself quickly is this the one he asked sharply

the girl said yes

dorchin nodded i take it back you were right uh youburckhardt what do you want

swanson piped up watch him he might have another gun

search him then burckhardt said ill tell you what we want dorchin we want you to come along with us to the fbi and explain to them how you can get away with kidnapping twenty thousand people

kidnapping dorchin snorted thats ridiculous man put that gun awayyou cant get away with this

burckhardt hefted the gun grimly i think i can

dorchin looked furious and sickbut oddly not afraid damn it he started to bellow then closed his mouth and swallowed

listen he said persuasively youre making a big mistake i havent kidnapped anybody believe me

i dont believe you said burckhardt bluntly why should i

but its true take my word for it

burckhardt shook his head the fbi can take your word if they like well find out now how do we get out of here
dorchin opened his mouth to argue

burckhardt blazed dont get in my way im willing to kill you if i have to dont you understand that ive gone through two days of hell and every second of it i blame on you kill you it would be a pleasure and i dont have a thing in the world to lose get us out of here
dorchins face went suddenly opaque he seemed about to move but the blonde girl he had called janet slipped between him and the gun

please she begged burckhardt you dont understand you mustnt shoot

 get out of my way 

but mr burckhardt

she never finished dorchin his face unreadable headed for the door burckhardt had been pushed one degree too far he swung the gun bellowing the girl called out sharply he pulled the trigger closing on him with pity and pleading in her eyes she came again between the gun and the man

burckhardt aimed low instinctively to cripple not to kill but his aim was not good

the pistol bullet caught her in the pit of the stomach

dorchin was out and away the door slamming behind him his footsteps racing into the distance

burckhardt hurled the gun across the room and jumped to the girl

swanson was moaning that finishes us burckhardt oh why did you do it we could have got away we could have gone to the police we were practically out of here we

burckhardt wasnt listening he was kneeling beside the girl she lay flat on her back arms helterskelter there was no blood hardly any sign of the wound but the position in which she lay was one that no living human being could have held

yet she wasnt dead

she wasnt deadand burckhardt frozen beside her thought  she isnt alive either

there was no pulse but there was a rhythmic ticking of the outstretched fingers of one hand

there was no sound of breathing but there was a hissing sizzling noise

the eyes were open and they were looking at burckhardt there was neither fear nor pain in them only a pity deeper than the pit

she said through lips that writhed erratically dontworry mr burckhardt imall right

burckhardt rocked back on his haunches staring where there should have been blood there was a clean break of a substance that was not flesh and a curl of thin goldencopper wire
burckhardt moistened his lips

youre a robot he said

the girl tried to nod the twitching lips said i am and so are you

v

swanson after a single inarticulate sound walked over to the desk and sat staring at the wall burckhardt rocked back and forth beside the shattered puppet on the floor he had no words

the girl managed to say imsorry all this happened the lovely lips twisted into a rictus sneer frightening on that smooth young face until she got them under control sorry she said again thenerve center was right about where the bullet hit makes it difficult tocontrol this body

burckhardt nodded automatically accepting the apology robots it was obvious now that he knew it in hindsight it was inevitable he thought of his mystic notions of hypnosis or martians or something stranger stillidiotic for the simple fact of created robots fitted the facts better and more economically

all the evidence had been before him the automatized factory with its transplanted mindswhy not transplant a mind into a humanoid robot give it its original owners features and form

could it know that it was a robot

all of us burckhardt said hardly aware that he spoke out loud my wife and my secretary and you and the neighbors all of us the same

no the voice was stronger not exactly the same all of us i chose it you see i this time the convulsed lips were not a random contortion of the nervesi was an ugly woman mr burckhardt and nearly sixty years old life had passed me and when mr dorchin offered me the chance to live again as a beautiful girl i jumped at the opportunity believe me i  jumped  in spite of its disadvantages my flesh body is still aliveit is sleeping while i am here i could go back to it but i never do

and the rest of us

different mr burckhardt i work here im carrying out mr dorchins orders mapping the results of the advertising tests watching you and the others live as he makes you live i do it by choice but you have no choice because you see you are dead

dead cried burckhardt it was almost a scream

the blue eyes looked at him unwinkingly and he knew that it was no lie he swallowed marveling at the intricate mechanisms that let him swallow and sweat and eat

he said oh the explosion in my dream

it was no dream you are rightthe explosion that was real and this plant was the cause of it the storage tanks let go and what the blast didnt get the fumes killed a little later but almost everyone died in the blast twentyone thousand persons you died with them and that was dorchins chance

the damned ghoul said burckhardt

the twisted shoulders shrugged with an odd grace why you were gone and you and all the others were what dorchin wanteda whole town a perfect slice of america its as easy to transfer a pattern from a dead brain as a living one easierthe dead cant say no oh it took work and moneythe town was a wreckbut it was possible to rebuild it entirely especially because it wasnt necessary to have all the details exact

there were the homes where even the brains had been utterly destroyed and those are empty inside and the cellars that neednt be too perfect and the streets that hardly matter and anyway it only has to last for one day the same dayjune 15thover and over again and if someone finds something a little wrong somehow the discovery wont have time to snowball wreck the validity of the tests because all errors are canceled out at midnight

the face tried to smile thats the dream mr burckhardt that day of june 15th because you never really lived it its a present from mr dorchin a dream that he gives you and then takes back at the end of the day when he has all his figures on how many of you responded to what variation of which appeal and the maintenance crews go down the tunnel to go through the whole city washing out the new dream with their little electronic drains and then the dream starts all over again on june 15th

always june 15th because june 14th is the last day any of you can remember alive sometimes the crews miss someoneas they missed you because you were under your boat but it doesnt matter the ones who are missed give themselves away if they show itand if they dont it doesnt affect the test but they dont drain us the ones of us who work for dorchin we sleep when the power is turned off just as you do when we wake up though we remember the face contorted wildly if i could only forget

burckhardt said unbelievingly all this to sell merchandise it must have cost millions

the robot called april horn said it did but it has made millions for dorchin too and thats not the end of it once he finds the master words that make people act do you suppose he will stop with that do you suppose

the door opened interrupting her burckhardt whirled belatedly remembering dorchins flight he raised the gun

dont shoot ordered the voice calmly it was not dorchin it was another robot this one not disguised with the clever plastics and cosmetics but shining plain it said metallically forget it burckhardt youre not accomplishing anything give me that gun before you do any more damage give it to me  now 

burckhardt bellowed angrily the gleam on this robot torso was steel burckhardt was not at all sure that his bullets would pierce it or do much harm if they did he would have put it to the test

but from behind him came a whimpering scurrying whirlwind its name was swanson hysterical with fear he catapulted into burckhardt and sent him sprawling the gun flying free

please begged swanson incoherently prostrate before the steel robot he would have shot youplease dont hurt me let me work for you like that girl ill do anything anything you tell me

the robot voice said we dont need your help it took two precise steps and stood over the gunand spurned it left it lying on the floor

the wrecked blonde robot said without emotion i doubt that i can hold out much longer mr dorchin

disconnect if you have to replied the steel robot

burckhardt blinked but youre not dorchin

the steel robot turned deep eyes on him i am it said not in the fleshbut this is the body i am using at the moment i doubt that you can damage this one with the gun the other robot body was more vulnerable now will you stop this nonsense i dont want to have to damage you youre too expensive for that will you just sit down and let the maintenance crews adjust you
swanson groveled youyou wont punish us

the steel robot had no expression but its voice was almost surprised punish you it repeated on a rising note how

swanson quivered as though the word had been a whip but burckhardt flared adjust  him  if hell let youbut not me youre going to have to do me a lot of damage dorchin i dont care what i cost or how much trouble its going to be to put me back together again but im going out of that door if you want to stop me youll have to kill me you wont stop me any other way

the steel robot took a halfstep toward him and burckhardt involuntarily checked his stride he stood poised and shaking ready for death ready for attack ready for anything that might happen

ready for anything except what did happen for dorchins steel body merely stepped aside between burckhardt and the gun but leaving the door free

go ahead invited the steel robot nobodys stopping you

outside the door burckhardt brought up sharp it was insane of dorchin to let him go robot or flesh victim or beneficiary there was nothing to stop him from going to the fbi or whatever law he could find away from dorchins synthetic empire and telling his story surely the corporations who paid dorchin for test results had no notion of the ghouls technique he used dorchin would have to keep it from them for the breath of publicity would put a stop to it walking out meant death perhapsbut at that moment in his pseudolife death was no terror for burckhardt

there was no one in the corridor he found a window and stared out of it there was tylertonan ersatz city but looking so real and familiar that burckhardt almost imagined the whole episode a dream it was no dream though he was certain of that in his heart and equally certain that nothing in tylerton could help him now

it had to be the other direction

it took him a quarter of an hour to find a way but he found itskulking through the corridors dodging the suspicion of footsteps knowing for certain that his hiding was in vain for dorchin was undoubtedly aware of every move he made but no one stopped him and he found another door

it was a simple enough door from the inside but when he opened it and stepped out it was like nothing he had ever seen
first there was lightbrilliant incredible blinding light burckhardt blinked upward unbelieving and afraid

he was standing on a ledge of smooth finished metal not a dozen yards from his feet the ledge dropped sharply away he hardly dared approach the brink but even from where he stood he could see no bottom to the chasm before him and the gulf extended out of sight into the glare on either side of him

no wonder dorchin could so easily give him his freedom from the factory there was nowhere to gobut how incredible this fantastic gulf how impossible the hundred white and blinding suns that hung above

a voice by his side said inquiringly burckhardt and thunder rolled the name mutteringly soft back and forth in the abyss before him

burckhardt wet his lips yyes he croaked

this is dorchin not a robot this time but dorchin in the flesh talking to you on a hand mike now you have seen burckhardt now will you be reasonable and let the maintenance crews take over

burckhardt stood paralyzed one of the moving mountains in the blinding glare came toward him

it towered hundreds of feet over his head he stared up at its top squinting helplessly into the light

it looked like

impossible

the voice in the loudspeaker at the door said burckhardt but he was unable to answer

a heavy rumbling sigh i see said the voice you finally understand theres no place to go you know it now i could have told you but you might not have believed me so it was better for you to see it yourself and after all burckhardt why would i reconstruct a city just the way it was before im a businessman i count costs if a thing has to be fullscale i build it that way but there wasnt any need to in this case

from the mountain before him burckhardt helplessly saw a lesser cliff descend carefully toward him it was long and dark and at the end of it was whiteness fivefingered whiteness

poor little burckhardt crooned the loudspeaker while the echoes rumbled through the enormous chasm that was only a workshop it must have been quite a shock for you to find out you were living in a town built on a table top

vi
it was the morning of june 15th and guy burckhardt woke up screaming out of a dream

it had been a monstrous and incomprehensible dream of explosions and shadowy figures that were not men and terror beyond words

he shuddered and opened his eyes

outside his bedroom window a hugely amplified voice was howling

burckhardt stumbled over to the window and stared outside there was an outofseason chill to the air more like october than june but the scent was normal enoughexcept for the soundtruck that squatted at curbside halfway down the block its speaker horns blared

are you a coward are you a fool are you going to let crooked politicians steal the country from you no are you going to put up with four more years of graft and crime no are you going to vote straight federal party all up and down the ballot yes  you just bet you are 

sometimes he screams sometimes he wheedles threatens begs cajoles  but his voice goes on and on through one june 15th after anotherembed"
