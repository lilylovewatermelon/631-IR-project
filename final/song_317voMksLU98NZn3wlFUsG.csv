precious fingers she knows how to hold the poison
lick it dip it and for no particular reason
she crawls on the floor slides against the door
press your fingers over blossom and its season
doesnt matter shell be doing it her way
doesnt care if its a 10 or a 2way
doesnt matter shell be doing it her way
every night every day

chorus
never meant to show up here anyway
only fucking you till the season change

verse 2
treasure deep between the places that you hold dear
cant it hurt to act as if we are in love here
lie across this chair fingers everywhere
to define all the angels up above here
doesnt matter shell be doing it her way
doesnt care if its a 10 or a 2way
doesnt matter shell be doing it her way
every night every day

chorus
never meant to show up here anyway
only fucking you till the season change
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebrige
when you cum be a good girl
hold your breath make it last long
and its called death
a little death girl

outro
never make a show of fear anyway
only fucking you till the season change
never make a show of fear anyway
only fucking you till the season change5embed"
