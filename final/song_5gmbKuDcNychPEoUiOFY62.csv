yeah its been a while yall
yeah its been a while yall
lately i aint smiled yall
uh

verse
rsb
id never switch crews
flier than a witch broom
mykal in this bi move
my flow is copyrighted you niggas can get sued
i keep getting these only if i was rich blues
tell em to they hearts
they are not important
young nigguh grown talents i aint talking orphan
imma kill em all
like child abortion
at the top like a champagne bottle cork is
you got it but i got it proved
love is not a game
but i follow the rules
magical like sabrina
yall solomon dudes
im aimin at the top
but the top has moved
and what i got to lose
whatever i never won
behind every damaged moon there is a better sun
eclipse ass friends
they the reason why i nod no
they searching for success but they the ones who hide most
ill end up stoppin if you telling me to drive slow
cause there isnt a need to be impatient if the time slow
you gotta have balls if you dribble em
the sky is not the limit
its the minimum
killin em
they hear my sound and they say i tremble em
goodluck finding somebody that resemble him
resemble me to nothing no reflection in the glass
i balled up and throw paper on recession in the trash
i knew recession wouldnt last
left my guesses in the past
no i know how it feels to be the best and finish last
maybe next time my time next
my light and dark side here
blonde brunettes
find a yes
lose the no
even a lucky charm ends up in the loser bowl
i used to flow
now i gag
i used to cry at break ups
now i laugh
even when the bill not paid the power lasts
but thats only when we get poured up hour glass
showered in cash cleaned in it also
cause nowadays emotions only seen in a bar code
and lately i been wearing a lot of dark clothes
but thats to only cover up the fact that my heart gone
and my perspective on life is just a large hole
money and love like the cover of so far gone
those ya friends over there
i seen both of em stare
and they just gasping
like its money smoke in the air
i dont blame em
i cant change em
they still in the past but i cant age em
and if i crave em
then i cant claim em
im different from her man cause
ill front page em
she found in the index and ill just rangring em
and yeah im in the crowd but ill still upstage you
im the rookie but im not an easy target to aim to
and you plain so i cant explain you
and im on frame2
just a bigger angle
you say the game change cause nigguhs just play youlaughs
no tyler perry sh
your heart starts showin and you hide it very quick
and sh i be writing look like an honorary list
so you nigguhs faced down like a solitary click
click click all you want
you can never edit me
copy all you want you will never get a second me
view me all you want its still sh youd never get to see
and i will spread a virus if you ever try to exit me
im going in from killin this game allegedly
so far gone i think the earth is standing next to me
and my dad was never around to lecture me
its cool cause i probably wouldnt of got his blessings see
look
our mindset is different
he runs away from his problems
and swallow and gravel
but me id like to run and shift it
he think a child is a pet i think its what a gift is
and i just spit the bars he used to be behind in prison
plus im fly so does that make me a jail bird
used to watch showtime to find out about the l word
turn it around skip lo and sell third
then add an i no there you have it in male termss
and this how it feels when freddy krueger dreams
and im just a love puppet with looser strings
im anticipate to the sh this life is soon to bring
cause i just take the future and then replace it with newer things
on the outside looking in id rather stay outside most
cause them runnin for fame is far different from my approach
and lifes a tight rope
i never get outta line though
cause thatll give these nigguhs a reason to tell me to drive slow nigguh

drive slow homie
youd never know homie
lifes a rope homie
stay in control homiex2embed"
