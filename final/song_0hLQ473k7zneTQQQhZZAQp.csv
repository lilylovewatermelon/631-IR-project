it was you and me
till there was no more
i promised you love and trust
why wasnt that enough
i kept hanging on
hopin youd stay
i kept blaming myself
for making you lose faith
and i cant believe that youve done this to me

verse 2
now im crying tears
cause you were a lie
i wish that i never let you walk right in my life
my friends say be strong you just be strong
they tell me move on gotta move on
i gave you the best of me
and you threw it all away

chorus
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me oh whoa oh
you might also likebridge
dont tell me that you and i
are better off as friends
i dont believe a word you say
cause you are just pretend oh whoa oh
where did you go
the man that i truly love
you took him away from me
the day you walked away

chorus
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me oh
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me ohoh
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me ohoh
and i cant believe
that youve done this to me ohoh
and i cant believe
that youve done this to meembed"
