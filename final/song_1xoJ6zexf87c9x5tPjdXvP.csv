on the northeast corner of my vineyard in central north carolina and fronting on the lumberton plankroad there stood a small frame house of the simplest construction it was built of pine lumber and contained but one room to which one window gave light and one door admission its weatherbeaten sides revealed a virgin innocence of paint against one end of the house and occupying half its width there stood a huge brick chimney the crumbling mortar had left large cracks between the bricks the bricks themselves had begun to scale off in large flakes leaving the chimney sprinkled with unsightly blotches these evidences of decay were but partially concealed by a creeping vine which extended its slender branches hither and thither in an ambitious but futile attempt to cover the whole chimney the wooden shutter which had once protected the unglazed window had fallen from its hinges and lay rotting in the rank grass and jimsonweeds beneath this building i learned when i bought the place had been used as a schoolhouse for several years prior to the breaking out of the war since which time it had remained unoccupied save when some stray cow or vagrant hog had sought shelter within its walls from the chill rains and nipping winds of winter

one day my wife requested me to build her a new kitchen the house erected by us when we first came to live upon the vineyard contained a very conveniently arranged kitchen but for some occult reason my wife wanted a kitchen in the back yard apart from the dwellinghouse after the usual southern fashion of course i had to build it

to save expense i decided to tear down the old schoolhouse and use the lumber which was in a good state of preservation in the construction of the new kitchen before demolishing the old house however i made an estimate of the amount of material contained in it and found that i would have to buy several hundred feet of lumber additional in order to build the new kitchen according to my wifes plan

one morning old julius mcadoo our colored coachman harnessed the gray mare to the rockaway and drove my wife and me over to the sawmill from which i meant to order the new lumber we drove down the long lane which led from our house to the plankroad following the plankroad for about a mile we turned into a road running through the forest and across the swamp to the sawmill beyond our carriage jolted over the halfrotted corduroy road which traversed the swamp and then climbed the long hill leading to the sawmill when we reached the mill the foreman had gone over to a neighboring farmhouse probably to smoke or gossip and we were compelled to await his return before we could transact our business we remained seated in the carriage a few rods from the mill and watched the leisurely movements of the millhands we had not waited long before a huge pine log was placed in position the machinery of the mill was set in motion and the circular saw began to eat its way through the log with a loud whir which resounded throughout the vicinity of the mill the sound rose and fell in a sort of rhythmic cadence which heard from where we sat was not unpleasing and not loud enough to prevent conversation when the saw started on its second journey through the log julius observed in a lugubrious tone and with a perceptible shudder—

ugh but dat des do cuddle my blood

whats the matter uncle julius inquired my wife who is of a very sympathetic turn of mind does the noise affect your nerves

no mis annie replied the old man with emotion i ain narvous but dat saw acuttin en grindin thoo dat stick er timber en moanin en groanin en sweekin kyars my membance back ter ole times en mins me er po sandy the pathetic intonation with which he lengthened out the po sandy touched a responsive chord in our own hearts

and who was poor sandy asked my wife who takes a deep interest in the stories of plantation life which she hears from the lips of the older colored people some of these stories are quaintly humorous others wildly extravagant revealing the oriental cast of the negros imagination while others poured freely into the sympathetic ear of a northernbred woman disclose many a tragic incident of the darker side of slavery

sandy said julius in reply to my wifes question was a nigger wat useter blong ter ole mars marrabo mcswayne mars marrabos place wuz on de yuther siden de swamp right nex ter yo place sandy wuz a monstus good nigger en could do so many things erbout a plantation en alluz ten ter his wuk so well dat wen mars marrabos chilluns growed up en married off dey all un em wanted dey daddy fer ter gin em sandy fer a weddin present but mars marrabo knowed de res would n be satisfied ef he gin sandy ter aer one un em so wen dey wuz all done married he fix it by lowin one er his chilluns ter take sandy fer a mont er so en den ernudder for a mont er so en so on dat erway tel dey had all had im de same lenk er time en den dey would all take him roun agin cepn oncet in a wile wen mars marrabo would len im ter some er his yuther kinfolks roun de country wen dey wuz short er hans tel bimeby it got so sandy did n hardly knowed whar he wuz gwine ter stay fum one weeks een ter de yuther

annie had listened to this gruesome narrative with strained attention

what a system it was she exclaimed when julius had finished under which such things were possible

what things i asked in amazement are you seriously considering the possibility of a mans being turned into a tree

oh no she replied quickly not that and then she murmured absently and with a dim look in her fine eyes poor tenie

we ordered the lumber and returned home that night after we had gone to bed and my wife had to all appearances been sound asleep for half an hour she startled me out of an incipient doze by exclaiming suddenly—

john i dont believe i want my new kitchen built out of the lumber in that old schoolhouse

you wouldnt for a moment allow yourself i replied with some asperity to be influenced by that absurdly impossible yarn which julius was spinning today

i know the story is absurd she replied dreamily and i am not so silly as to believe it but i dont think i should ever be able to take any pleasure in that kitchen if it were built out of that lumber besides i think the kitchen would look better and last longer if the lumber were all new

of course she had her way i bought the new lumber though not without grumbling a week or two later i was called away from home on business on my return after an absence of several days my wife remarked to me—

john there has been a split in the sandy run colored baptist church on the temperance question about half the members have come out from the main body and set up for themselves uncle julius is one of the seceders and he came to me yesterday and asked if they might not hold their meetings in the old schoolhouse for the present

i hope you didnt let the old rascal have it i returned with some warmth i had just received a bill for the new lumber i had bought

well she replied i couldnt refuse him the use of the house for so good a purpose

and ill venture to say i continued that you subscribed something toward the support of the new church

she did not attempt to deny it

what are they going to do about the ghost i asked somewhat curious to know how julius would get around this obstacle

oh replied annie uncle julius says that ghosts never disturb religious worship but that if sandys spirit should happen to stray into meeting by mistake no doubt the preaching would do it goodembed"
