i walk the streets of japan til i get lost
cause it doesnt remind me of anything
with a graveyard tan carrying a cross
yeah it doesnt remind me of anything
i like studying faces in parking lot
cause it doesnt remind me of anything
i like drivin backwards in the fog
cause it doesnt remind me of anything

chorus 1
the things that ive loved things that ive lost
things ive held sacred that ive dropped
i wont lie no more you can bet
i dont wanna learn what ill need to forget

verse 2
i like gypsy moths and radio talk
cause it doesnt remind me of anything
i like gospel music and canned applause
cause it doesnt remind me of anything
i like colorful clothing in the sun
cause it doesnt remind me of anything
i like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
cause it doesnt remind me of anything

bend and shape me i love the way you are
slow and sweetly like never before
calm and sleeping we wont stir up the past
so discreetly we wont look back

i like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
