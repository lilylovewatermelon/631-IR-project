ive been a beggar and ive been a king
ive been a loner and ive worn the ring
losing myself just to find me again
im a million miles smarter but i aint learned a thing
ive been a teacher and a student of hurt
ive kept my word for whatever thats worth
never been last but ive never been first
oh i may not be the best but im far from the worst
oh i may not be the best but im far from the worst

chorus
oh ive seen trouble more than any man should bear
but ive seen enough joy ive had more than my share
and im still not done im only halfway there
im a million miles ahead of where im from
but theres still another million miles to come

verse 2
i keep on searching for the city of gold
and im gonna follow this yellow brick road
thinking that maybe it might lead me home
im a million miles farther and a long way from home
i know that theres a plan that goes way beyond mine
got to step back just to see the design
the mind fears the heart but the heart doesnt mind
oh i may not be perfect but im loving this life
oh i may not be perfect but im loving this life

oh ive seen trouble more than any man should bear
but ive seen enough joy ive had more than my share
and im still not done im only halfway there
im a million miles ahead of where im from
but theres still another million miles to come
