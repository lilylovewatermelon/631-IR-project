verse 2 damian marley
and politican a drive dem car
tell dem nuh steer come over here
when dem touch down pon the ends
you only hear seh war declare
man a clap it inna town
and man a clap it inna square
and whole heap a skull a bore and then whole heap a flesh a tear
wait
some man a run down grammy fi di gunman fi the year
and a weh mek poor people haffi live it inna fear
one shirt deh pon dem back and dem nuh have nothing more fi wear
and man one desert a done and still cannot afford a pair
cannot find nuh vasoline fi moisturize dem daughter hair
and the bulla price a rise and it nuh dearer than the pear
an a so mi get fi know seh heads a government nuh care
cause the money them a share a crate a guiness crate a beer
cannot pay your little pickney school fee come to end a year
tell the youth dem seh fi get them education and prepare
rastafari nah go give nuh man no more than he can bear
catch a fire it a bun so tell the tican dem beware
hook
flash it flash it flash it dreadlocks
flash it flash it flash it

verse 3 bounty killer
warlord and jr gong
when yuh hear the tune the bomb

but dem waan fi gi we jumped and dem war dem truly man
i an i a nuh fool cau mi side to school di man
