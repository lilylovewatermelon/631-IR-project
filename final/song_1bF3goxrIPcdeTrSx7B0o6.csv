cause youre running through the city rain
living life babe higher dream
its kind of funny how the clouds dont mean a thing now
and i heard youre living on your own
hows it feel to pay for your own phone
you gotta job now honey
yeah you did what you said you would do

chorus
and i never doubted you for a minute
for a minute babe
i just thought that you were meant for more
and with all the years that weve wasted its time for our own lives
cause its gonna rain in the city so you might as well get out babe

verse 2
and now youre crying in the city rain
cause it just doesnt feel the same
as it did when you were young
you were in love and now you work away your days
but aint that all you ever wanted in your life
in your life woah woah
and now youre 60 and all your dreams are so far away
and you hate the way that you lived your life
but at least you made a few bones
and all your kids have left the nest and youre all alone
with your fading memory and youre so lonely
but at least you got a nice home
you might also likechorus
and i never doubted you for a minute
for a minute babe
i just thought that you were meant for more
and with all the years that weve wasted its time for our own lives
cause its gonna rain in the city so you might as well get out babe

bridge
but when you look back at the days
will you forget all the ways that you went wrong
or will you remember all the things that didnt mean a thing at all
or will you say its all in my head all in my head all in my head

outro
oh its in my head in my head in my head
oh its in my head in my head in my head
oh its in my head in my head in my head
oh its in my head in my head in my head
oh its in my head in my head in my headembed"
