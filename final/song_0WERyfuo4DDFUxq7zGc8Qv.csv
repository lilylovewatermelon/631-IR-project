im standing on my own two feet
somewhere hanging in between
my life and the death of me
fate doesnt leave us time to waste
weaving through the human race
til we run out of air to breathe

chorus
but no ones getting out alive
all the gold on earth it wont buy time
so we might as well give up the fight
live it up tonight
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive

verse 2
life a beautiful and fragile thing
floating in the galaxy
im gonna let it set me free
now is all we really ever have
open your eyes and dont look back
now gimme something to believe

chorus
cause no ones getting out alive
all the gold on earth it wont buy time
so we might as well give up the fight
live it up tonight
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive

chorus
so no ones getting out alive
all the gold on earth it wont buy time
so we might as well give up the fight
live it up tonight
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive
no ones getting out alive2embed"
