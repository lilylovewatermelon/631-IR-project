ive got my life laid out in front of me like roads drawn on the map
ive had so many times where i slipped off the beaten path
i took the time to see the picture and for what its worth
id walk a thousand miles without my shoes to make it work
i swore to god that im never coming back kept my faith when i was clapped
staring at the wall through a crack in the floor and these metal doors that got me trapped
i gotta remind myself that my mind is strong so i wont lose my head
ive got my demons that i fight with every little thought and every breath

prechorus
i wear my heart upon my sleeve so my souls exposed
and i carry this disease the weight of the holy ghost
god can you hear me
god is missing

chorus
take it back take it back my friend
all the things that you said about the end
this is it this is me telling you it aint over till its over
give it up give it up my friend
the score is settled even if you wont admit
sun is up final hour without a doubt its over when its over

verse 2
youve got your life laid out in front of you like a car crash
unconscious at the wheel cause you were driving too fast
but if you took the time to check up in your rearview mirror
youd see the things youre driving from are your biggest fears
you gotta get back up from the wreckage above and walk right through the fire
no matter what happens the fact is that the flames keep getting higher
you gotta keep it going keep tiptoeing through the fire and the flames and the pain of knowing
the world is dark gotta keep on glowing gotta give that spark gotta keep on glowing
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeprechorus
i wear my heart upon my sleeve so my souls exposed
and i carry this disease the weight of the holy ghost
god can you hear me
god is missing

chorus
take it back take it back my friend
all the things that you said about the end
this is it this is me telling you it aint over till its over
give it up give it up my friend
the score is settled even if you wont admit
sun is up final hour without a doubt its over when its over

so please please just let me make my peace
i refuse to let your words be the death of me
please please just let me live my life
stop living in my shadow and just make it right
its over its over make it right

chorus
take it back take it back my friend
all the things that you said about the end
this is it this is me telling you it aint over till its over
give it up give it up my friend
the score is settled even if you wont admit
sun is up final hour without a doubt its over when its over its over
