heres my genius plan
make a superior man
anatomically built
this half corpse cant guilt
its hard to find your insect heart
blue blood tear apart
shattered glass shattered rib
now my hand will start to give

verse 2 alice glass
how does your body retain blood
youre my decomposing love
im doctor death mary beth
now i have a hearse to get
silent scream
scissored seams
open you up
drown in kerosene

interlude alice glass
what the fuck is this
oh its the bass

verse 3 alice glass
when i cut deep youll think of me
until your lobotomy
no anesthetic lay your pace
mutilate the human race
this way we can be together
mangled hearts stitched with leather
ive been waiting for so long
your silent screams my favorite songyou might also like9embed"
