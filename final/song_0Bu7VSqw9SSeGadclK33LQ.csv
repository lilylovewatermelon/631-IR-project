john browns body was never found
but the locals see him walkin round

theres a for sale sign on the old farm roads
theres a silo empty and done for
the place just aint the same no more

now its shinin all them different ways
crimson blues and yellow shades
theres snow up in the way
and those clouds still full of rain

theres work in town or so they say
just blessed to fill our hands today
god knows if it will ever pay

and we fill our hands with wood and steel
and grace is a woman we all long to feel
you know someday we will
you know someday we will

theres always the creaks and the strangest sounds
john browns bodys up and walkin round
countin all the riches that hes found
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeand he throws it all in that wishing well
made it home in the morning hail
theres snow up in the way
and those clouds still full of rainembed"
