time aint nothing but time
its a verse with no rhyme
man it all comes down to you
change aint nothing but change
just the faces and the names
but you know were gonna make it through
ill believe
when you dont believe in anything

chorus
im going to hold you til your hurt is gone
be the shoulder that youre leaning on
ill be standing here
for the next 100 years
if it all should end tonight
ill know it was worth the fight
and well be standing here
for the next 100 years

verse 2
i when i think that im losing my mind
it all comes back to you
and you you know that its true
after all weve been through
theres nothing that i wouldnt do
stand by me
and i would gladly give up everything
