you want me here to stay stay
but your situation tells me that it’s a waste of time
but never mind all that mmh

you know you dont have to play
i’m already on the way
you aint gotta say shit
so he set the mood on some love shit
made a couple jokes about fuckin yeah
mightve kissed few times but never made a move on no cut shit
just enjoyed the time that we had laid aside to be numb in

chorus

and you know my nigga dont play shit oh

and you say well have our cake and eat it too

outro
