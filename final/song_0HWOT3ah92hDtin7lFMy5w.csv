yeah yeah yeah
i dont want nobody else
i just want to be a kid
but i hate being all alone
but theres reasons why im by myself
and i know you see me as a tyke
but i know you know im still your type
and i hate playing on the phone
but i love talkin in the night
im too fucking young
and girl i cant say youre the one for me
youre the one youre the one youre the aye
im too fucking young
and girl i cant say youre the one for me
youre the one youre the one youre the oneyeah yeah yeah

verse 1  aaron may 
okay im passin time
in a higher class upper echelon
mastermind things been movin fast
and you last in line
i left all that pain in the past it aint catchin on
fuck the games i gave you a chance but you arrogant
see i do better myself
i want you but its like you bad for my health
it aint your fault i knew better myself
let me better my wealth get a plaque on my shelf
myself cant stand your defiance i hate the silence
you done had the chance after chance i aint lyin
but you must have some bad timing
cause now i dont feel like trying
to keep it alive
when its meant to die
then baby i aint gon stop it
why you stressin me
why the fuck you testin me
comin back to light when you see how this life been blessin me
and you know how i feel i swear that you so used to gettin me
but when you come around i just cant let you get the best of me
you might also likebridge
i wish i could get that time that i spent with you
hate how you left me behind i was missin you
now days i dont even cry i dont mention you
it seem like you doin fine so im distant too
i wish i could get that time that i spent with you
hate how you left me behind i was missin you
now days i dont even cry i dont mention you
it seem like you doin fine so im distant too

chorus
i dont want nobody else
i just want to be a kid
but i hate being all alone
but theres reasons why im by myself
and i know you see me as a tyke
but i know you know im still your type
and i hate playing on the phone
but i love talkin in the night
im too fucking youngim too young
and girl i cant say youre the one for me
youre the one youre the one youre the one
im too fucking youngim too young
and girl i cant say youre the one for me
youre the one youre the one youre the oneyeah yeah yeah2embed"
