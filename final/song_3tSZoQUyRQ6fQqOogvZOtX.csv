after we spoke i had a dream that i broke
the teeth from a mouth of a snake
that i choked on the teeth
they were mine all along
i picked up the pieces when i woke up
put them in a boat made of things that i dont want to see
i blew on the sail
watched it drift out to sea
the further it drifted the closer it came to me
i cant explain

bridge
so i took it apart built a billion boxes
there was only one key

chorus
you might think im your enemy
but that dont make you mine
and all i have now is empathy
i wish that youd stop trying
oh please stop lying
stop la la la la la la la
la la la la la

i put hatred in a box then i locked it
the strongest one i made
i buried it all grew a tree without thorns
and sat beneath the shade

chorus
you might think im your enemy
but that dont make you mine
and all i have now is empathy
i wish that youd stop trying
oh please stop lying
please stop la la la la la la
la la la la la
