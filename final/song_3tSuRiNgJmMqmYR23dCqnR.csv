were driving slow through the snow on fifth avenue
and right now radios all that we can hear
now we aint talked since we left its so overdue
its cold outside but between us its worse in here

prechorus nicole scherzinger
the world slows down
but my heart beats fast right now
i know this is the part
where the end starts

chorus  nicole scherzinger
i cant take it any longer
thought that we were stronger
all we do is linger
slipping through our fingers
i dont wanna try now
all thats lefts goodbye
to find a way that i can tell you

postchorus nicole scherzinger
i hate this part right here
i hate this part right here
i just cant take your tears
i hate this part right here
