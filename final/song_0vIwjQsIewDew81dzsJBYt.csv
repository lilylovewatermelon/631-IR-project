and ill tell you how
the clouds above opened up
and let it out
i was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
when the water filled every hole
and thousands upon thousands made an ocean
making islands where no islands should go
oh no

break

most people were overjoyed
they took to their boats
i thought it less like a lake
and more like a moat
the rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
have been silenced forevermore
the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
it seems farther than ever before
oh no

i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer

i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closer
i need you so much closerembed"
