woke up today with the lay of the land
feather in cap and the sun in the sand
it was easy it was easy to understand
everything suddenly falls out of sight
every attachment is made of the light
that you offered you have offered to give me life

chorus
see the sky and all the land together again
see the way the earth can stay below
who do we think we are everything plays a part
there are some things we are never meant to know

verse 2
having enjoyed all the meat from the bone
is perfectly equal to being alone
it was even but you breathe and i turn to stone
everything suddenly looks like a sign
easy to see from the outermost clime
i believe in what i leave in the way behind

chorus
see the sky and all the land together again
see the way the earth can stay below
who do we think we are everything plays a part
there are some things we are never meant to know
you might also likebridge
and all the parts combine to one
and all of us around the sun
everything will fall away
to order from the disarray
see the sun the shadows cast
from all the times i floated past
see the ocean spinning out
with all the hope and all the doubt

chorus
see the sky and all the land together again
see the way the earth can stay below
who do we think we are everything plays a part
there are some things we dont understand
reasons on the other hand
there are some things we are never meant to know5embed"
