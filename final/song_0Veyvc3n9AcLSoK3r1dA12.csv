monstas gon’ tear it up

verse 1
all she ever wanted was my heart to hurt
no attachments just a gucci purse
she know im mad rich she think im usin’ her
my diamonds mavericks they so blue to her
and the way im actin is all due to her
if i think she thottin im gon do it first
im gon call my side bitch and we gon’ do the work
she know i’m from highbridge my chain show through the shirt
the feds locked my man up free montana
damn all he ever wanted was his bands up
they gave him 10 years for nothin keep your head up
if any niggas start to fret nigga lay ’em out
just listen to all my tracks
cause i dont wanna do no interviews im not into that
and i be feelin’ like im malcolm i got the x on my back
and every nigga in the x can vouch for me thats a fact
i dropped my first mixtape and yeah that shit ran laps
by the time i dropped the bigger artist like seven million in plaques
got too much gold im way too smart to leave my crib without straps
and any nigga run up on us gon get hit like that
and ima be like nigga started what i started
skinny nigga with a patek and a pyrex
any nigga could get embarrassed come and try it
any nigga could get a bad bitch just go and buy shit

verse 2
and i know i know
youre just like all the bitches i know

i think im better off without you
and you think i dont know about the things you do
but i do all the same fuckin things you do
we are both the same i am just like you yeah
i know that you get in your feelings baby me too
sometimes i swear i say some shit that i dont mean to
i make you feel a type of way i make you evil
when i was broke they used to treat me like im seethrough
they killed my nigga quado in the projects
and then they killed beasty free peewee

and if its one of my niggas nigga free meembed"
