you trembled like youd seen a ghost
and i gave in
i lacked the things you need the most
you said where have you been
you wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
i wonder why
i remind you of the days you poured your heart into
but you never tried

prechorus
ive fallen from grace
took a blow to my face
ive loved and ive lost
ive loved and ive lost

chorus
explosions
on the day you wake up needing somebody
and youve learned
its okay to be afraid but it will never be the same
it will never be the same

verse 2
you left my soul bleeding in the dark
so you could be king ah
the rules you set are still untold to me
and ive lost my faith in everything
see ellie goulding liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeprechorus
the nights you could cope
your intentions were gold
but the mountains will shake
i need to know i can still make

chorus
explosions
on the day you wake up needing somebody
and youve learned
its okay to be afraid but it will never be the same

bridge
and as the floods move in
and your body starts to sink
i was the last thing on your mind
i know you better than you think
cause its simple darling
i gave you a warning
now everything you own
is falling from the sky in pieces
so watch them fall with you
in slow motion
i pray that youll find peace of mind
and ill find you another time
ill love you another time
chorus
explosions
on the day you wake up needing somebody
and youve learned
its okay to be afraid but it will never be the same26embed"
