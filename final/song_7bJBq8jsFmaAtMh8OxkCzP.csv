verse 1
i told em wait til four oclock the night too young night too young
i ask em do he got a strap cause ill supply you a gun ill supply you a gun
i told em lay up at his house until your ass out the sun until your ass out the sun
but we aint doin crashin out make sure your ass do it smart brrt brrt
murder genius im probably plottin on bodies wanted dead
she murder semen she suck it sloppy when she give me head
he sending treaties we leave em on read and then we leave em red
we give a fuck about how you feel i said what i said
not wearin a vest they want me dead they shoot above the neck above the neck
couple niggas got killed on this quest im lookin for the rest for the rest
catch a body beat a body i told em that on collect
couple months later my killer on the town we gettin lit
same niggas that left around me they wishin they never switched
same hoes that used to be clownin now they want a nigga dick
guess they see a nigga drippin with this glizzy in my fit
i aint too fresh to shoot a nigga ill pop you in this bitch brrt brrt brrt

prechorus
i changed my lane and switched my side i knew i wasnt living right i wasnt living right

dont say that you good in my hood cause i dont really fuck with niggas
couple niggas changed on me from the hood say i aint fuckin with em
when i needed a helping hand nobody came and helped me out
my bitch more gangsta than these niggas she be sendin me the drops
if we dont get em tonight then we gon try again tomorrow
bitch we livin with murders we never tellin what we saw never tellin what we saw
your new home is the dirt cause we gon put your ass in the coffin
