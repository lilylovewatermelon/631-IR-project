verse 2
i sit back twist the best bud burn and wonder
when gangstas bump my shit can they hear my hunger
when the fifth kick duck quick it sound like thunder
in december ill make your block feel like summer
the rap critics say i can rhyme the fiends say my dope is a nine
every chick i fuck with is a dime
im like patti labelle homie im on my own
where i lay my hats my home im a rolling stone
cross my path ill crush ya thinking i wont touch ya
ill have your ass using a wheelchair cane or crutches
industry hoes fuck us in the hood they love us
stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new chukkas
