hes just a singer
a natural born guitar ringer
kind of a clinger
to sad ol songs
hes not a walk behinder
hes a new note finder
his names a reminder
of a blues man thats already gone

verse 2
so he started drinkin
took some things that messed up his thinkin
he was sure sinkin
when she came along
he was alone in the spotlight
not too much left in sight
she changed all that one night
when she sang him this song

chorus
hey baby i love you
hey baby i need you
hey baby you aint got to prove to me
youre some kind of macho man
youve wasted so much of your life
runnin through the dark nights
let me shine a little love light
down on that blues man
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 3
he got so sick from speedin
all the things they said he was needin
if he is to keep on pleasin
all of his fans
he got cuffed on dirt roads
he got sued over no shows
she came and took all that ol load
down off that blues man
and he said

chorus
hey baby i love you too
hey baby i need you
hey baby i do get tired
of this travellin band
im over 40 years old now
nights would be cold now
if you hadnt stuck it out
with this blues man

outro
hes over 40 years old now
nights would be so cold now
if she hadnt hung around
with that blues man1embed"
