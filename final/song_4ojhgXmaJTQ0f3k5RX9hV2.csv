end of the night looking at me what do you see
wish i could read your mind
dimming the light here in the dark going by feel
only the moon to guide

when were alone i get so close
give me your warmth ive never known
face to face caught in a wild embrace
this is the safest place ive ever known

chorus dinah
put your arms around me baby
put your arms around me baby
and squeeze
only you know how to save me
put your arms around me baby
and squeeze squeeze
