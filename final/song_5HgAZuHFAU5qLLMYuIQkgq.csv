before she hits the ground
shes gonna want to explode
never step aside
never run and hide
she holds it all up under
that pretty head of hers oh
it comes screaming out
in a little electric shout

chorus
shes the worst thing
ive been addicted to
oh no oh no oh no
ill run right back
run right back to her
i wont jump the track
ill run right back im sure
i run right back to her
i run right back to her
i run right back to her
i run right back to her
i run right back to her

verse 2
well shes a special thing
she doesnt read too much oh
but theres no doubt
shes written about
finest exterior
shes so superior oh
but she wont allow
and im wounded now
