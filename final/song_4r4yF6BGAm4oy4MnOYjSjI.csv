verse 1
the smell of cigarettes is always a reminder that youre gone
i smelled it on your breath every time wed sing our songs

now youre gone out of reach
its said and done and i cant sleep
now youre gone gone from me
its so dark i cant see
lost your light that guided me
now youre gone now youre free

verse 2
now i smoke cigarettes so i can feel you in my lungs
i wish i could accept everything we left undone
