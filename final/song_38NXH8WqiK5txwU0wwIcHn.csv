i know i bend and i break all my promises
but now its time for the truth
i keep my head in the clouds and i hope that
i cant just be invisible to you
are you sick are you tired and youre feeling faint
your lips are turning blue
i know you wish you were dead to the world
but theres something you should know

chorus
youre scared i can see you tremble
shaking like a dog shittin razor blades
feel the shadows like a stranger
well join the club yeah join the club
do you wish that you could cut yourself out of your skin
well join the club yeah join the club
whatever the fuck it takes to feel like you fit in
well join the club yeah join the club

verse 2
life is a song with no one to dance to
the same old shit number that nobody knows
my heart is a dead horse theres no point in beating
just let me sink let me sink into the fucking ground
fuck it
