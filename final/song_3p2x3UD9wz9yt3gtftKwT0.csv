intro schoolboy q
this the shit that they need
tell me where are you from
drop your pants to your knees
girl im capital g

verse 1 schoolboy q
might pull up in my bucket
this nine holds a good dozen
might slide up in your cousin
just made a mil and still thuggin
niggas banged on me but they shouldve shot me
see i hit the corner then spot him got him
court date but i skipped the bail
rather wig myself before i sit in jail
need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
got a hat say figg on my gangsta tip
dont trust no ho i might sock the bitch
im apocalypse to your politics
might cop the phantom get ghost
i can pay your bills with this coat
need an extra band for this smoke
i can see for miles with this scope nigga
got an oxyscribed to this dope dealer
misses piggy want a piggyback
rock cremation then called it crack
imma keep on eating til my ankles fat
sell that fix throw it cross the map
push my penis in between her lap
put my semen all down her throat
til tito kilos come off that boat

verse 2 2 chainz
yeah this that four niggas in a regal flow
speeding through the yellow lights
treat my versace belt like its a mistletoe
i put everything over yellow rice
graduated from hella ice
if i stand on my bankroll stand on your bankroll
nigga id be scared of heights
and id be dodging the police
when i was poor with no lights
when i was poor with potential
watch my flow in four inches
oh lord she in christians
all gold for my adventist
pulled it down and she kissed it
all gold where my wrists is
godll judge no conviction
just because i got dreads dont get it twisted
moving my whip down the boulevard
word round town i was selling hard
hard and im talking bout the yayo
hit her on the floor and then i lay low
amigos say que pasa with the pesos
promethazine codeine caseloads tru
and when i pull up to the valet
you know i got the strippers on payroll

verse 3 schoolboy q
100k in my trunk
keep that bitch with that donk

she must heard of my deal
she gon roll on them pills
just dont grab on my hat
this that shit thats iraq
this that make you climax
this that shit you just bought
this that q go hamhawk
this that car that wont park
pedal to floor it wont stop
and just when you thought it wont drop
oxymoron in stores
come in kids lock the door
knockknockknock hit the floor
need my bread off the top
could buy anything off the lot
this that steel not the grill
get them slugs off for real
this that curl with the gel
we gon win smoke the ls
she love my mic rock the bell
leave that punani killed
all them hoes run to q
spit that truth make the loot
expensive whips we hotbox
spent 2 bills on my socks
this that make you cockblock
this that make me pop shot
this that filthy convo
this that must be figueroa
