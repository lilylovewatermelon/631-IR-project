oh no

verse 1
as he came into the window
was a sound of a crescendo
he came into her apartment
he left the bloodstains on the carpet
she was sitting at the table
he could see she was unable
so she ran into the bedroom
she was struck down
it was her doom

a crescendo annie
he came into your apartment
he left the bloodstains on the carpet
then you ran into the bedroom
you were struck down
it was your doom
