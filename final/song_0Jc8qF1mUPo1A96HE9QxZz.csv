verse 1 justin with jc
sick and tired of hearin all these people talk about
whats the deal with this pop life
and when is it gonna fade out
the thing you got to realize what were doin is not a trend
we got the gift of melody
were gonna bring it til the end cmon now

prechorus jc all
it doesnt matter
bout the car i drive or what i wear around my neck
all that matters
is that you recognize that its just about respect
it doesnt matter
bout the clothes i wear and where i go and why
all that matters
is that you get hyped and well do it to you every time
come on now

chorus all jc

this music gets you high
it takes you on a ride
feel it when your body starts to rock
when your body starts to rock
baby you cant stop you cant stop
