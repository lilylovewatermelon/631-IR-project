take my hand tonight
we can run so far
we can change the world to anything we want
we can stop for hours just staring at the stars
they shine down to show us

chorus
you know when the sun forgets to shine
ill be there to hold you through the night
well be running so fast we can fly tonight
and even when were miles and miles apart
youre still holding all of my heart
i promise it will never be dark
i know were inseparable

verse 2
we could run forever if you wanted to
i would not get tired
because id be with you
i keep singing this song until the very end
we have done all these things

chorus
you know when the sun forgets to shine
ill be there to hold you through the night
well be running so fast we can fly tonight
and even when were miles and miles apart
youre still holding all of my heart
i promise it will never be dark
i know were inseparable
see jonas brothers liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
i would give it all
never let you fall
cause you know were inseparable
i would give it all
just to show you im in love
cause you know were inseparable

chorus
you know when the sun forgets to shine
ill be there to hold you through the night
well be running so fast we can fly tonight
and even when were miles and miles apart
youre still holding all of my heart
i promise it will never be dark
i know were inseparable1embed"
