i can hear my baby saying my name
but i dont see my baby in time
without you in here it aint the same
i didnt mean word i said to you last night

prechorus
if you decide to pick up the phone oh baby
ill be waiting for you
tell me whats wrong i didnt mean to ignore you
dont quit me baby i can fix it baby
being by myself is now my biggest fear

chorus
cause i want you here when i come back
there aint nothin i look more forward to than that
and i want you here when i come home
cause i cant stand to be alone you gotta be here
when i come back x4

verse 2
i can hear you telling to come home
but you may not even be there

plus you told me you aint going anywhere
