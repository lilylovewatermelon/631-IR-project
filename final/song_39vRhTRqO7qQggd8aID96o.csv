i dont wanna get over you i dont wanna get over you
i haunt the same places we used to go alone at a table for two
i dont wanna get over you i dont wanna get over you
they ought to give me the wurlitzer prize for all the silver i let slide
down the slot playin those songs sung blue
they help me remember you i dont want to get over you
a fresh roll of quarters same old song missing you through and through
i dont wanna get over you i dont wanna get over you
they ought to give me
i dont wanna get over you i dont wanna get over youyou might also likeembed"
