i know im probably better off on my own
than lovin’ a man who didnt know what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again i just wish i could forget when it was magic

prechorus
i wish it wasnt 4am standin’ in the mirror
saying to myself you know you had to do it
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run

chorus
sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

verse 2
i know im probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
and it was always on your terms i waited on every careless word
hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

prechorus
but your jealousy oh i can hear it now
talking down to me like id always be around
push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
oh you never thought id run

sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man

bridge
i hold onto this pride because these days its all i have
and i gave to you my best
and we both know you cant say that

breakdown
i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we wouldve become if you were a better man
we might still be in love if you were a better man
you wouldve been the one if you were a better man

chorus
sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
sometimes in the middle of the night i can feel you again
we might still be in love if you were a better man
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
i know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
but i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
outro
we might still be in love if you were a better man
you would’ve been the one if you were a better man26embed"
