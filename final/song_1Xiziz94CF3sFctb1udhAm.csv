oh the first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
and i knew that to you and into your life i had to get
oh i felt lightheaded at the touch of this strangers hand
an assault my defenses systematically failed to withstand

prechorus
cause you came at a time
when the pursuit of one true love in which to fall
was the beall and endall

chorus
love is only a feeling drifting away
when im in your arms i start believing its here to stay
but love is only a feeling anyway

verse 2
oh the state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
i had seen i had touched i had tasted and i truly believed

prechorus
that the light of my life
would tear a hole right through each cloud that scudded by
each cloud that scudded by
just to beam on you and i
see the darkness liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likechorus
love is only a feeling drifting away
when im in your arms i start believing its here to stay
but love is only a feeling anyway
anyway

chorus
love is only a feeling drifting away
and weve got to stop ourselves believing its here to stay
cause love is only a feeling anyway
