mother of a soldier
a tree in a forest up in flames
black valley peace beneath the city
where the women hear the washboard rhythm in their bosom when they say
give me good legs
and a japanese car
and show me a road

sing a song for the bodies buried by the riverbank
a welldressed boy
and a pig with a bullet in the brain
black valley peace beneath the city
where the white girls wander the strip mall singing all day
give me a juggernaut heart
and a japanese car
and someone to free

say something for the body buried like a keepsake
mother of million mouths with the very same name
black valley peace beneath the city
where the women tell the weather
but never ever tell you what they pray
they pray
give me a yellow brick road
and a japanese car
