yall bridesmaids catch the garter
on nights when ye romance cameras flash so much

verse 2 kanye west
what im supposed to do now man the game all messed up
how im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
so yeah at the grammys i went ultra travolta
yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
but with my ego i can stand there in a speedo
and be looked at like a fucking hero
the glory the story the chain the polo the night
the grind the empty bottles of nodoz
tank on empty whipping my momma volvo
i spent that gas money on clothes with logos
the fur is hermes shit that you dont floss
the goyard so hard man im hugos boss
why i gotta ask what that tudor cost
house on the hill two doors from tracee ross
and im asking bout her girlfriends yeah the dark skined ones
she asking bout the speed boats yeah i admit we rented em
when you meet me in person what do you feel like
i know i know i look better in real life
i hear people compare themselves to big a lot
you know big and pac you know to get it hot
i guess after i live i wanna be compared to big
any one big pun big l or notorious
till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
and ima stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
