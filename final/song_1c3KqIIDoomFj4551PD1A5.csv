someday at christmas men wont be boys
playing with bombs like kids play with toys
one warm december our hearts will see
a world where men are free
someday at christmas therell be no wars
when we have learned what christmas is for
when we have found what lifes really worth
therell be peace on earth

chorus
someday all our dreams will come to be
someday in a world where men are free
maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at christmas time

verse 2
someday at christmas well see a man
no hungry children and no empty hand
one happy morning people will share
our world where people care
someday at christmas therell be no tears
all men are equal and no men have fears
one shining moment my heart ran away
from our world today

someday all our dreams will come to be
someday in a world where men are free
maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at christmas time

bridge
someday at christmas man will not fail
take hope because your love will prevail
someday a new world that we can start
with hope in every heart

chorus
someday all our dreams will come to be
someday in a world where men are free
maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at christmas time someday at christmas timeembed"
