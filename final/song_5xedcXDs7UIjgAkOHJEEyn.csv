heinz von foerster did one of these around 1930 to test how evenly major historical events would fill it not very evenly and nigel calder did a nice 100page prose version in 1983 called timescale an atlas of the 4th dimension choosing a now point is problematic it keeps changing but i picked 31dec 2001 for convenience

its precisely divided into 1015 lines covering the big bang now minus 101014 years to 31dec 2000 now minus 10000 aka one year if i manage to find one link per line this will make the page about 100k which is the maximum google will index this gratifies my desire for necessary webdesign theory design rationale more
