see how bad it gets
ill settle down and deal with old regrets
you know i i adore you

i cant let you go
cant let you go
youre part of my soul
youre all that i know
i cant let you go

is it better now
do you feel like all is fair
can we work it out
so that its easier for me to bed
because life it can blind you

i cant let you go
cant let you go
youre part of my soul
youre all that i know

i cant let you go

down from the edge i can see you where we end
and id give up all of my days to go back
there was all this wonder
and all this magic
has all this wonder over and done
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likeif love were a whisper
what could i give you to speak
maybe youre out of my reach

i cant let you go
cant let you go
youre part of my soul
youre all that i know
i cant let you go
i cant let you go

youre part of my soul
youre all that i knowembed"
