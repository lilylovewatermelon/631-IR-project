ive been lying here thinking of you
sleeping all over the truth
saying i wanna know
i said that i wanna know
im keeping my head in the room
sinking through colours of you
saying im letting go
when im with you

chorus
when im with you
i lose my head
with you
i cant forget
when im with you
i lose my head
with you

verse 2
and all the time mentioned with you
our fingertips dancing the tune
saying i wanna know
you said that i wanna know
sink into the carpet with you
splitting our body in two
saying im letting go
when im with you
