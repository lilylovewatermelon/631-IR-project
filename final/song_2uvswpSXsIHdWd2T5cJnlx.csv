oh mickey oh you certainly done a lot of interesting things

what you doin in that one mickey

ridin on a rollercoaster
sailing on a boat across the sea
here you are in honolulu
resting by a big palm tree

drove a cart through a raging blizzard
took a steamboat down a river
clean the gears of old big ben
when i had to golf i dressed in spends

won an oscar
climbed a mountain
with a feather in my cap

directed a band with big brass buttons
in a tornado kept conducting

all this opportunity
was lucky for a mouse like me
you were the captain of the space patrol
the driver of a model t
you might also likeaha that was a pretty bumpy ride you know

chased by a grizzly
kicked by kicked by a mule
wandered through the sherwood forest
with a band of merry men

here im a knight in shining armor
wrestled with a rope and didnt win
chased a chicken round the barnyard
havent lost your famous grin
that brave little tailor might be violent
got discouraged and slew the giant

all this opportunity
was lucky for a mouse like me
like he
ill try anything once or twice
thats the kind of kid i am
i dont know what im doin
but your doin real good
youre handsome brave and awfully nice

a mouse like you will always come out smellin like a roast
rode a camel through the desert
i was a soldier was a king
a big game hunter on safari
you did almost everything
i was apprentice to a sorcerer
tried a spell but wouldve been worser
all this opportunity
was lucky for a mouse
who wrote with a quill
and cooked on a grill
i did all that

all this opportunity
was lucky for a mouse like he
was lucky for a mouse like meembed"
