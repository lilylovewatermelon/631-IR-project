my dad chased monsters from the dark
he checked underneath my bed
and he could lift me with one arm
way up over top his head
he could loosen rusty bolts
with a quick turn of his wrench
he pulled splinters from his hand
never even flinched

prechorus
in thirteen years id never seen him cry
but the day that grandpa died i realized

chorus
unsinkable ships sink
unbreakable walls break
sometimes the things you think would never happen
happen just like that
unbendable steel bends
if the fury of the wind is unstoppable
ive learned to never underestimate the impossible

verse 2
then there was my junior year
billy had a brand new car
it was late the road was wet
i guess the curve was just too sharp
i walked away without a scratch
they brought the helicopter in
and billy couldnt feel his legs
said hed never walk again
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeprechorus
but billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
and the day we graduated he stood up to say

chorus
unsinkable ships sink
unbreakable walls break
sometimes the things you think would never happen
happen just like that
unbendable steel bends
if the fury of the wind is unstoppable
ive learned to never underestimate the impossible

bridge
so dont tell me that its over
dont give up on you and me
cause theres no such thing as hopeless
if you believe

chorus
unsinkable ships sink
unbreakable walls break
sometimes the things you think would never happen
happen just like that
unbendable steel bends
if the fury of the wind is unstoppable
ive learned to never underestimate the impossibleembed"
