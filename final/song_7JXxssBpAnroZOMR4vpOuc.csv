i miss you more than you could know
i watch the grass on the back lawn grow
and i will not allow the winds of change to blow
and i hope you decide to come back home

chorus
cause this heavy heart oh how its yearned
cause ive been alone far too long
when are you coming home my love
my love

verse 2
you reach out for me in the night
and an errant finger pokes me in the eye
and i leave your contact lenses on the bedside table
and im hoping you decide to come back home

chorus
cause this heavy heart oh how its yearned
cause ive been alone far too long
when are you coming home my love
my love

bridge
oh you went running with my heart
and its a long long long way back
and this right here well it just aint living
oh i want you to come back

when are you coming home my love
my love

when are you coming home my love
