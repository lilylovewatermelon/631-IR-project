you make me feel like im a whore
like im the one whos there to bore you now
its always gonna be this way

cause i cant seem to show you what you wanna see
i can never give you anything you need
im sick of wasting time on what can never be
i cannot control you into wanting me

verse 2
you always wanna steal the light
by stepping on the ones who fight for you
its always gonna be the same
get the fuck away

chorus
cause i cant seem to show you what you wanna see

im sick of wasting time on what can never be
i cannot control you into wanting me
