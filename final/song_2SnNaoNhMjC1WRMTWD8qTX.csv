mark my words thats all that i have
mark my words give you all i got
in every way i will
youre the only reason why
oh i dont wanna live a lie
mark my words
mark my words

verse
so you heard it all before
falling in and out of trust
trying to rekindle us
only to lose yourself
but i wont let me lose you
and i wont let us just fade away
after all that weve been through
ima show you more than i ever could say

chorus
mark my words thats all that i have
mark my words give you all i got
in every way i will
youre the only reason why
oh i dont wanna live a lie
mark my words
