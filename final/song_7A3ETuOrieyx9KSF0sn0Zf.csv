intro
study long study wrong nigga
hey yall close that front door yall let flies in this motherfucker
close that door
my og up in this motherfucker right now
my pops man with the bottle of hennessy in his hand actin a fool
hey hey babe check it out ima tell you what my mama had said she like
verse 1
i could spot you a mile away
i could see your insecurities written all on your face
so predictable your words i know what you gonna say
who you foolin oh you assuming you can just come and hang
with the homies but your level of realness aint the same
circus acts only attract those that entertain
small talk we know that its all talk
we live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name
refrain
askin where the hoes at to impress me
askin where the moneybags to impress me
say you got the burner stashed to impress me
its all in your head homie
askin where the plug at to impress me
askin where the juug at to impress me
askin where its at only upsets me
you sound like the feds homie

you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
verse 2
and the world dont respect you
and the culture dont accept you
but you think its all love
and the girls gon neglect you once your parody is done
reputation cant protect you if you never had one
jealousy complex emotional complex
selfpity complex under oath complex
the loudest one in the room nigga thats a complex
let me put it back in proper context
chorus
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
refrain
askin where the hoes at to impress me
askin where the moneybags to impress me
say you got the burner stashed to impress me
its all in your head homie
askin where the plug at to impress me
askin where the juug at to impress me
askin where its at only upsets me
you sound like the feds homie
pause
verse 3
what do you got to offer
tell me before we off ya put you deep in the coffin
been allergic to talkin been a virgin to bullshit
and sell a dream in the auction tell me just who your boss is
niggas be fugazi bitches be fugazi
this is for fugazi
niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin babies
bless them little hearts
you can never persuade me
you can never relate me to him to her or that to them
or you the truth you love to bend
in the back in the bed on the floor thats your ho
on the couch in the mouth ill be out really though
see loud rich niggas got low money
and loud broke niggas got no money
the irony behind it is so funny
and i seen it all this past year
pass on some advice we feel
chorus
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta lie you aint gotta lie
you aint gotta lie to kick it my nigga
you aint gotta try so hard
