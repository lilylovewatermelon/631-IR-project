these feelings were overdue
you know that its true
kept out of sight from the foreground
as your heart has found

prechorus
you didnt want this
you never meant this
you didnt want this
you never meant this

chorus
what were you waiting for
you kept yourself on hold for too long
for too long

verse 2
nothing was really there
you just stood and stared
what you were missing not what you had
suddenly it hits and you realise

prechorus
you didnt want this
you never meant this
you didnt want this
you never meant this
you might also likechorus
what were you waiting for
you kept yourself on hold for too long
for too longembed"
