i saw your picture in the paper
and i see youve married good
and i know that he can give you
all the things i never could
but i know that he cant give you
what you need most of all
so the door is always open
and the lights on in the hall

chorus
yes the door is always open
and the lights on in the hall
and you know that ill be waitin
if you ever come to call

verse 2
when night falls on that mansion
and youre lyin in his bed
when he begs you for attention
do you think of me instead
and when he reaches out to touch you
is your face turned to the wall
well the door is always open
and the lights on in the hall
you might also likechorus
yes the door is always open
and the lights on in the hall
and you know that ill be waitin
if you ever come to call

chorus
yes the door is always open
and the lights on in the hall
and you know that ill be waitin
if you ever come to callembed"
