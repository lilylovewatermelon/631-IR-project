one two three four

verse 1 anthony kiedis
waking up dead inside of my head
would never never do there is no med
no medicine to take
ive had a chance to be insane
asylum from the falling rain
ive had a chance to break

verse 2 anthony kiedis with john frusciante
it’s so bad it’s got to be good
mysterious girl misunderstood
dressed like a wedding cake
any other day and i might play
a funeral march for bonnie brae
why try and run away

chorus anthony kiedis  john frusciante
slow cheetah come before my forest
looks like its on today
slow cheetah come its so euphoric
no matter what they say

verse 3 anthony kiedis with john frusciante
i knew a girl she worked in a store
she knew not what her life was for
she barely knew her name
they tried to tell her she would never be
as happy as a girl in a magazine
she bought it with her pay
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus anthony kiedis  john frusciante
slow cheetah come before my forest
looks like its on today
slow cheetah come its so euphoric
no matter what they say

verse 4 anthony kiedis with john frusciante
everyone has so much to say
they talk talk talk their lives away
don’t even hesitate
walkin on down to the burial ground
it’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
looks like its on today

instrumental bridge

chorus anthony kiedis  john frusciante

no matter what they say
