verse 1
sometimes you gotta bleed to know
that youre alive and have a soul
but it takes someone to come around to show you how

chorus
shes the tear in my heart im alive
shes the tear in my heart im on fire
shes the tear in my heart take me higher
than ive ever been

verse 2
the songs on the radio are okay
but my taste in music is your face
and it takes a song to come around to show you how

chorus
shes the tear in my heart im alive
shes the tear in my heart im on fire
shes the tear in my heart take me higher
than ive ever been
than ive ever been
than ive ever been
than ive ever been
