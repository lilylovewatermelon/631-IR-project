oh there was heaven in your eyes
i was not baptized
everythings alright when
she calls me back she calls me back
lost for a long time
two parallel lines
everything’s alright when
she calls me back she calls me back yeah

verse 1
look at me and dont you lie
i could be your sacrifice
but dont you hold your head up high
for bullshit i do not have time
i could be an old tattoo
to remind me when i get bad news
that i do not exist to die
but live to die while saving you

prechorus
does it bite at your edges
do you lie awake restless
why am i so obsessive
hanging on to every sentence
this town’s the same as you left it
your page was blank but i read it
i still dial 822993167

oh there was heaven in your eyes
i was not baptized
everythings alright when
she calls me back she calls me back
lost for a long time
two parallel lines
everythings alright when
she calls me back she calls me back

verse 2
the radio is taunting me
every song a minor key
and i dont get much sleep most nights
im seeing you in every dream
if only i could wake you up
if only i could fall asleep
ill love you when the oceans dry
ill love you when the rivers freeze

prechorus
does it bite at your edges
do you lie awake restless
why am i so obsessive
hanging on to every sentence
this towns the same as you left it
your page is blank but i read it
i still dial 822993167
chorus
oh there was heaven in your eyes
i was not baptized
everything’s alright when
she calls me back she calls me back
lost for a long time
two parallel lines
everything’s alright when
she calls me back she calls me back

postchorus
when she calls me back

bridge
all the pain i should have saved
oh i was too afraid of
living life in your footsteps
in your heart or in your head
oh i was too afraid of
living life in your footsteps
living life in your footsteps
living life in your footsteps

outro
still she calls me back
still she calls meembed"
