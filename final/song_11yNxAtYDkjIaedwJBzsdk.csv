woke up this morning sometime around 3 am
dripping wet beads of sweat rolling down my skin
lately i cant sleep i got hell on my mind
running on empty lord im running dry

verse 2
sometimes the temptation is just too much to bear
its just too much whiskey and girls with long dark hair
i know i should pay my tab and call a cab back home
but i hate to sleep alone

chorus
i hear them coming trying to take my soul away
making deals with the devil now its time to pay
i keep on running pray my heart dont turn to black
cant shake the devil off my back

verse 3
ill fight the good fight til the very end
gonna climb that mountain with all of my friends
when i get to the top gonna turn around and yell
devil go back to hell

chorus
i hear them coming trying to take my soul away
making deals with the devil now its time to pay
i keep on running pray my heart dont turn to black
cant shake the devil off my back
i hear them coming trying to take my soul away
making deals with the devil now its time to pay
i keep on running pray my heart dont turn to black
cant shake the devil off my back
