i im driving black on black
just got my license back
i got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
ill ask polite if the devil needs a ride
because the angel on my right aint hanging out with me tonight
im driving past your house while you were sneaking out
i got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
your mom dont know that you were missing
shed be pissed if she could see the parts of you that ive been kissing
screamin

chorus
no were never gonna quit
aint nothing wrong with it
just acting like were animals animals
no no matter where we go
cause everybody knows
were just a couple of animals animals

postchorus
so come on baby get in
get in just get in
check out the trouble were in

verse 2
youre beside me on the seat
got your hand between my knees
and you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
its hard to steer when youre breathing in my ear
but i got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
by now no doubt that we were heading south
i guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
cause this was it like flicking on a switch
it felt so good i almost drove into the ditch
im screamin

look at the trouble were in

verse 3
we were parked out by the tracks
were sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
when she whispered what was that
the wind i think cause no one else knows where we are
and that was when she started screamin
thats my dad outside the car
oh please the keys theyre not in the ignition
must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
i guess they knew that she was missing
as i tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that i was kissing
screamin
chorus
no were never gonna quit
aint nothing wrong with it
