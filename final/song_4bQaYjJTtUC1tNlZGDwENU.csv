i still freeze when i look at these
faded photographs from february last
twenty second or twenty third
shared some dumplings whispered some words
we had two maybe three bucks saved
between us sat in blankets on the floor
used to wish for money in rain
a west side apartment paper plane

chorus
then you left in may
took the wrong long way back home
wish id known
that i had all i could want
in our tiny apartment
above the chinese restaurant

verse 2
street sounds blistered with neon lights
heard the nеighbors snoring every other night
wеd have dumplings from next door
finish them up theyd give us some more
didnt realize we had it all
even when the roof came caving in that fall
oh i loved you more than you know
covered in the crystal white snow
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
then you left in may
took the wrong long way back home
wish id known
that i had all i could want
in our tiny apartment
above the chinese restaurant
