life change when you famous
i remember back before the chains we was nameless
went through stages just to hop on new stages
open up your eyes man they only entertainers
and i cannot sell my soul soul
and i cannot sell my soul soul
and i cannot sell my soul yeah soul
and i cannot sell my soul jesus saved my soul
and i cannot sell my soul

verse 1 roddy ricch kanye west  both
ive been at the top shinin like a light pole
and im just a product of whatever i was raised in
this money sanctified so i gotta say it again
they said i was mad at the grammys
but im lookin at my grammy right now
pulled up on ye and i said they dont understand me
i just want my dawg to pipe down
cause when you really came from the trenches
you was raised in the trenches mm
you feel like you trailblazed for the trenches mm
i hope god can forgive me for the days that i was sinnin mhm

uh uh well well here goes
well here goes but here goes
i was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
that would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
every color girbauds every cutlass is cold
every cousin that stole every summer was cold
out of all of the moes out of all of the folks
after all of the jokes im the one that was chose
all of my friends love to gangbang
how we in my car and you say we aint in the same lane
when we both had pelles on
and we was scammin for the prom before chief keef was bang bang
always had mob ties
stood on my six points how could i not rise
love truth peace freedom justice but im not five
this southside and we outside
this southside and we outside
this southside and we outside
this southside and we outside
this southside and we outside
and for all the guys that went to the white house and said free the old man
every day i put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
personal worth is not what a person is worth
i can give a dollar to every person on earth
man its gotta be gods plan
man i swear these boys keep playin
we gon have to square up then
