show me a sign show me a reason to give
a solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs
im going blind but one things clear
death is the only salvation youll feel
brick by brick by brick
brick by brick by brick

verse 2
what you call faith i call a sorry excuse
cloak and daggers murder the truth
the bitter taste theres nothing else
ill bow for your king when he shows himself

chorus
brick by brick by brick
these walls begin to cave in
the house of wolves you built
whispers in a thousand tongues

verse 3
show me your face show me a reason to think
my soul can be saved if i sell you my sins
im going blind but one things clear
death is the only salvation for me
