i saw your face in a criminal sketch
dont be alarmed cause you dont know me yet
im on the prowl now sniffing around this town for you
calling all cars theres an officer down
shot to the heart on a night on the town
and the evidence of your fingerprints was found and now

chorus
you got the right to remain right here with me
im on your tail in a hot pursuit
love is a highspeed chase racing down the street
woowoowoo
im coming after you
woowoowoo
im coming after you
woowoowoo
im coming after you

verse 2
oh no here we go once again
we both know youll never turn yourself in
so im driving til its light out
searching for your hideout
driving til its light out
searching for your hideout
pick up the pace as i chase you around
one of these days ill end up tracking you down
but yeah i got the feeling ill be letting you loose when i do
because you

im on your tail in a hot pursuit
love is a highspeed chase racing down the street
