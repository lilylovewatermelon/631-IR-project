see that big blue note over there on the counter
you dont want to read that thing man
its a real getyadowner
but dont you dare say nothing else bad about her
shes gone

verse 2
no no no no dondont throw it away
cause tonight i might need it
it gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
and i have to reread it
besides you can show it to the boys downtown
and they wont believe that
shes gone

chorus
there used to be a time i was all she ever wanted
all the man that shell ever need
i come home to find just like that shes up and vanished
and the only thing she left behind for me

bridge
is this big blue note folded up in my pocket
yeah dont laugh its been two months i still got it
sometimes i have to read the sucker twice
just to make sure i aint forgot that
shes gone

you know my psychiatrist said tell me what do you see
when you look at these ink spots of reds and yellows and green
you know i looked at them all but all they looked to me like
big blue notes

chorus
there used to be a time i was all she ever wanted
all the man that shell ever need
i come home to find just like that shes up and vanished
and the only thing thats left to do for me

verse 4
is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
with my big blue note paper airplane that i just set free
and im gonna wait here a few more minutes
and if it dont come back to me
you guessed it
shes gone

outro
crash landing
bye bye babyembed"
