ive been walking in the same way as i did
missing out the cracks in the pavement
and tutting my heel and strutting my feet
is there anything i can do for you dear
is there anyone i could call
no and thank you please madame
i aint lost just wandering

chorus
round my hometown
memories are fresh
round my hometown
ooh the people ive met
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of my world
are the wonders of this world
are the wonders now

verse 2
i like it in the city
when the air is so thick and opaque
i love it to see everybody in short skirts shorts and shades
i like it in the city when two worlds collide
you get the people and the government
everybody taking different sides
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likerefrain
shows that we aint gonna stand shit
shows that we are united
shows that we aint gonna take it
shows that we aint gonna stand shit
shows that we are united
