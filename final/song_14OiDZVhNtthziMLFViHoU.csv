give me a stone cold george jones whiskey bent barstool night
i wanna fly like a honky tonk moth to that neon light
this highway burnin me up blues been weighin me down
theres a hole in the wall needs fillin on the edge of town
im gonna floorboard that ford straight toward my babys house
shell be shinin like a million dollar diamond second she steps out
shell be slippin me sugar and buddy she aint gonna stop
til we bonnie and clyde slide into that parking lot

chorus
bout to light that fuse on a friday night
get to cuttin loose on this wound up tight
where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin
paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin
all that leads to late night lovin
we aint there yet but we aint far from it

verse 2
that tele rippin mississippi cover bands sure on point
she on the dance floor good lord droppin every jaw in the joint
when she flips that switch im off like a rocket
aint no way to stop it

chorus
when we light that fuse on a friday night
get to cuttin loose on this wound up tight
where twenty bucks buys guitars strumming
paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin
all that leads to late night lovin
we aint there yet but we aint far from it
bout to light that fuse on a friday night
get to cuttin loose on this wound up tight
where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin
paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin
all that leads to late night lovin
we aint there yet but we aint far from it
no we aint there yet but we aint far from itsee luke combs liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeembed"
