verse 1
i should be living the dream
but im livin with a security team
and that aint gonna change no
i got a paranoia in me
and you wouldnt believe
everything that i seen no
comin apart at the seams
and no one around me knows

prechorus

who ive hurt and where theyve gone
i know that ive done some wrong
but im tryna make it right
to the one i love bring me round
get me out right now ohoh
and know that i love you

chorus
but im still learning to love myself
to love my– to love my– to love my–
im still learning to love myself
to love my– to love my– to love my– yeah yeah
