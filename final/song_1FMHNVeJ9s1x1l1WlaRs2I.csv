your subtleties they strangle me
i cant explain myself at all
and all the wants and all the needs
all i dont want to need at all

prechorus
the walls start breathing my minds unweaving
maybe its best you leave me alone
a weight is lifted on this evening
i give the final blow

chorus
when darkness turns to light
it ends tonight it ends tonight

verse 2
a falling star at least i fall alone
i cant explain what you cant explain
youre finding things that you didnt know
i look at you with such disdain

prechorus
the walls start breathing my minds unweaving
maybe its best you leave me alone
a weight is lifted on this evening
i give the final blow

when darkness turns to light
it ends tonight it ends tonight
just a little insight wont make this right
its too late to fight it ends tonight
it ends tonight

bridge
now im on my own side
its better than being on your side
its my fault when youre blind
its better that i see it through your eyes
all these thoughts locked inside
now youre the first to know

chorus
when darkness turns to light
it ends tonight it ends tonight
just a little insight wont make this right
its too late to fight it ends tonight
it ends when darkness turns to light
it ends tonight it ends tonight
just a little insight wont make this right
its too late to fight it ends tonight

outro
it ends tonight
tonight insight
when darkness turns to light
it ends tonight24embed"
