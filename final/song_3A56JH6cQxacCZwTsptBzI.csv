verse
every night i saw it skeletons in my closet
still got all these problems i thought money would solve em
blood all on the walls and tears drop down they fallin
i dont even wanna think about all that but its like i cant help it
you say you cant help me i gotta help myself but
i need help with that cause i feel so helpless
i feel like ive been to hell and back by myself and
there aint nothin in the way no more only myself is

bridge
im in the way im in the way of myself
im in the way im in the way i need help
need it today i wish i could kill this pain
i wish i could kill this pain i wish i could kill these days
