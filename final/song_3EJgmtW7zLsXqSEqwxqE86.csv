run me down in the winter
run me down in the spring
got to the place
cant do a goddamn thing
but after a while
you aint gonna run me down anymore

verse 2
run me down in the city
run me down on the farm
run me with your eyes
and your heavy charm
but after a while
you aint gonna run me down anymore

verse 3
i do for you you dont do for me
you run me down
where you want me to be
but after a while
you aint gonna run me down anymoreyou might also likeembed"
