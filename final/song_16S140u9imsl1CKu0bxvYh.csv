verse 1 britney spears
im ferocious when i see you instantly
so precocious assuming that youre into me
so fierce the way you pierce me with your energy
my hearts on fire boy come on and rescue me

prechorus britney spears
when i see you i need you right away taking me
cant control the way that i am behaving
its got a hold of me grabbing me rapidly
romantic dancing dreams are made of this yeah

everybody come on get to jumping
everybody moving next to something
everybody feel the temperature rising
everybody come on lets keep grinding

verse 2 britney spears
its so real to feel you standing next to me
so intense when your scents in my vicinity
