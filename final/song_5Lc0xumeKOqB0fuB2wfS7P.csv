how you gonna find love at
nights for the one time
see the thing about me its just not the right time
mama says son you cant fight the sunshine

i did not come here tonight
to be struck by your light
but here i stand in your glow
should i stay should i go

i wanna run i wanna run from you
but mama didnt raise no fool
mama didnt raise no fool no fool
i wanna run i wanna run from you
but mama didnt raise no fool
mama didnt raise no fool no fool

mama says lately i dont recognize you
but if this is who you wanna be youve got the right to
you buried your heart so guilt could never find you
but mama says love will find the boy that i knew

i did not come here tonight
to be brought back to life
but here i stand in my grave
second chance is your name

i loved you since i said hello
i need you much more than i know
i did not come here tonight
to be struck by your light
but here i stand in your glow

i wanna run i wanna run from you
but mama didnt raise no fool
mama didnt raise no fool no fool
i wanna run i wanna run from you
but mama didnt raise no fool
