cause size two clothes dont come to those
too lazy to sweat

when you start to cry
if you dont look like you should

you can laugh but shes made tons
off her dvds and book
whip your way to tighter buns
happily married so she swears
to her sixtyyearold stud
till stepdaughter came downstairs
and found brooke all covered in his blood
if brooke took a plea id have her out in 3 to 4
but she claims she did not kill him

warner spoken

callahan spoken

but its more than just a workout
its a defensive weapon too

and pull till he turns blue

to shatter your attackers spine
and all for three small payments of

i want her whipped into shape

spoken
