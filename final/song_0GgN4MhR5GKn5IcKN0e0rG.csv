turn away
if you could get me a drink
of water cause my lips are chapped and faded
call my aunt marie
help her gather all my things
and bury me in all my favorite colors

chorus
my sisters and my brothers still
i will not kiss you
cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

verse 2
now turn away
cause im awful just to see
cause all my hairs abandoned all my body
oh my agony
know that i will never marry
baby im just soggy from the chemo

chorus
but counting down the days to go
it just aint living
and i just hope you know
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likeoutro
that if you say if you say
goodbye today goodbye today
id ask you to be true id ask you to be true
cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
cause the hardest part of this is leaving you90embed"
