i dont even know myself at all
i thought i would be happy by now
the more i try to push it i realize
gotta let go of control

refrain
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
just let it happen

chorus
its just a spark but its enough
to keep me going
and when its dark out no ones around
it keeps glowing

verse 2
every night i try my best to dream
tomorrow makes it better
then i wake up to the cold reality
and not a thing has changed

refrain
but it will happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen

its just a spark but its enough
to keep me going
and when its dark out no ones around
it keeps glowing
its just a spark but its enough
to keep me going
and when its dark out no ones around
it keeps glowing

verse 3
and the salt in my wounds
isnt burning any more than it used to
its not that i dont feel the pain
its just im not afraid of hurting anymore
and the blood in these veins
isnt pumping any less than it ever has
and thats the hope i have
the only thing i know thats keeping me alive
alive

bridge
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
gotta let it happen
chorus
its just a spark but its enough
to keep me going
so if i let go of control now i can be strong
and when its dark out no ones around
it keeps glowing
its just a spark but its enough
to keep me going
so if i keep my eyes closed with the blind hope
and when its dark out no ones around
it keeps glowing
