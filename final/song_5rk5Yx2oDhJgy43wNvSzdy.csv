dont keep me waiting anticipating
treating me like a fool
i got news for you
im turning my back
im dropping a bomb on you
ah

prechorus 1
you want me you need me
believe me youll be calling
you love me you hate me
believe me youll come crawling

chorus
so get down and get off
let me show you what youll be missing
we break up you break down
gonna drag you through this kicking and screaming

verse 2
dont keep me guessing
im your favorite obsession
dont give me that lame excuse
is it me that youre messing
its that same old confession
youre the one with something to lose
