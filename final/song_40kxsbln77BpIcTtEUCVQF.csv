ive got the dynamo of volition
the ppole position
automatic transmission with low emissions
im a brand new addition to the old edition
with the love unconditional
and im a drama abolitionist
damn no opposition to my proposition
half of a man half magician
half a politician holding the mic like ammunition
and my vision is as simple as light
aint no reason we should be in a fight no demolition
get to vote get to say what you like procreation
compositions already written by themselves
heck is for the people not believing in gosh

chorus
good job get em up way high
gimme gimme that high five
good time get em way down low
gimme gimme that low do
good god bring em back again
gimme gimme that high ten
youre the best definition of good intentions

bridge
i do not answer the call if
i do not know who is calling
i guess the whole point of it all is
that we never know really
im trying to keep with the joneses
while waiting for guns and the roses
to finish what we all suppose is
gonna be the shit well sue me
see jason mraz liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeverse 2
oh fist like bumping and wrist lock
twisting up a rizla
kid icarus on the transistor
nintendo be giving me the blister
i bend over take it in the kisser
my best friends are hitting on my sister
try to tell them that they still a wisha
cause she already got herself a mister
and besides thats gross to wanna diss her
deedideedeedididnt i say didnt i say

chorus
good job get em up way high
gimme gimme that high five
good time get em way down low
gimme gimme that low do
good god bring em back again
gimme gimme that high ten
youre the best definition of good versus evil
oh oh

verse 3
i do not keep up with statistics
i do not sleep without a mistress
i do not eat unless its fixed with
some kind of sweet like a licorice
my home is deep inside the mystics
im known to keep digging on existence
im holding in the heat like a fish stick
my phone it beeps because i missed it
bridge
i do not answer the call if
i do not know who is calling
im making no sense of it all
say can i get a witness

verse 4
im only a boy in a story
just a hallucinatory
tripping on nothing there is
living in the wilderness
with a tiger spot on my back
living life of a cat
i just wanna relax here
and write another rap tune
driving off on your blind mans bike
you can say just what you like
oh nothing can stop you oh

chorus
good job get em up way high
gimme gimme that high five
good time get em way down low
gimme gimme that low do
good god bring em back again
gimme gimme that high ten
youre the best youre the best youre the best
youre the best youre the best youre the best
youre the best
good job get em up way high
gimme gimme that high five
good time get em way down low
gimme gimme that low do
good god bring em back again
gimme gimme that high ten

youre the best definition of good intentions
youre the best definition of good intentions
youre the best definition of good intentions
youre the best around6embed"
