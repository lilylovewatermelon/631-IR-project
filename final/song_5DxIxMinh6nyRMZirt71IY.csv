i am just a blank sheet of paper
this fools about to write you a letter
to tell you that hes sorry
for the way he did you wrong
to ask for your forgiveness
for leaving you alone
hes been looking down at me
it seems like forever
he takes the top on and off his pen
its like he cant decide
what he wants to say
if hed just tell the truth
id be on my way

chorus
but he just stares at me
and i just stare at him
he dont know where to start
to say he doesnt want it to end
now it’s one hour later
and im still a blank sheet of paper

verse 2
the sunlight is coming through the curtains
hes almost asleep pen in hand
theres a tear in his eye
that refuses to fall
if it would land on me
that would say it all

but he just stares at me
and i just stare at him
he dont know where to start
to say he doesnt want it to end
now it’s one hour later
and im still a blank sheet of paper

chorus
oh but he just stares at me
and i just stare at him
he dont know where to start
to say he wants you back again
one broken heart later
and im still a blank sheet of paper1embed"
