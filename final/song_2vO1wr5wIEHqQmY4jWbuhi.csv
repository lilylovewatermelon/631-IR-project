ive got an angel
she doesnt wear any wings
she wears a heart that can melt my own
she wears a smile that can make me want to sing
she gives me presents
with her presence alone
she gives me everything i could wish for
she gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
she could make angels
ive seen it with my own eyes
youve got to be careful when youve got good love
because the angels will just keep on multiplying
but youre so busy changing the world
just one smile can change all of mine

outro
we share the same soul
oh oh oh oh oh ohh
we share the same soul
oh oh oh oh oh ohh
we share the same soul
oh oh oh oh oh ohh
oh oh oh oh oh ohh
