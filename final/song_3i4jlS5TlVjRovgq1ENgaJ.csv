pulled into the parking lot parked it
zipped up my parka joined the procession of marchers
in my head like is this awkward
should i even be here marching
thinking if they cant how can i breathe
thinking that they chant what do i sing
i want to take a stance cause we are not free
and then i thought about it we are not we
am i in the outside looking in or am i in the inside looking out
is it my place to give my two cents
or should i stand on the side and shut my mouth
no justice no peace okay im saying that
theyre chanting out black lives matter but i dont say it back
is it okay for me to say i dont know so i watch and stand
in front of a line of police that look the same as me
only separated by a badge a baton a can of mace a mask
a shield a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
in case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9
takes another childs life on sight bam
gunshot

hook
blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free
theres blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free
blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free
theres blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free
blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free
theres blood in the streets no justice no peace
no racist beliefs no rest til were free

verse 2
youve exploited and stolen the music the moment
the magic the passion the fashion you toy with
the culture was never yours to make better
youre miley youre elvis youre iggy azalea
fake and so plastic youve heisted the magic
youve taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
your brand of hiphop its so fascist and backwards
that grandmaster flashd go slap it you bastard
all the money that you made
of the watereddown popbullshit version of the culture pal
go buy a bigass lawn go with your bigass house
get a bigass fence keep people out
its all stolen anyway cant you see that now
theres no way for you to even that out
you can join the march protest scream and shout
get on twitter hashtag and seem like youre down
but they see through it all people believe you now
you said publicly rest in peace mike brown
you speak about equality but do you really mean it
are you marching for freedom or when its convenient
want people to like you want to be accepted
thats probably why you are out here protesting
dont think for a second you dont have incentive
is this about you well then whats your intention
whats the intention whats the intention
interlude 2 protesters

verse 3
pssst i totally get it youre by yourself
and the last thing you wanna do is take a picture
but seriously my little girl loves you
shes always singing im gonna pop some tags
im not kidding my oldest you even got him to go thrifting
and one love oh my god that song brilliant
their aunt is gay when that song came out
my son told his whole class he was actually proud
thats so cool look what youre accomplishing
even an old mom like me likes it cause its positive
youre the only hiphop that i let my kids listen to
cause you get it all that negative stuff it isnt cool
yeah
yeah like all the guns and the drugs
the bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
even the protest outside so sad and so dumb
if a cop pulls you over its your fault if you run
huh
interlude 3 various male and female voices
so they feel that the police are discriminating against the the black people — i have an advantage why cause im white laughs what laughs no — see more people nowadays are just pussies like this is the generation to be offended by everything — black lives matter thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights — im not prejudiced i just — 99 of the time across this country the police are doing their job properly

verse 4
damn a lot of opinions a lot of confusion a lot of resentment
some of us scared some of us defensive
and most of us arent even paying attention
it seems like were more concerned with being called racist
than we actually are with racism
ive heard that silences are action and god knows that ive been passive
what if i actually read a article actually had a dialogue
actually looked at myself actually got involved
if im aware of my privilege and do nothing at all i dont know
hiphop has always been political yes
its the reason why this music connects
so what the fuck has happened to my voice if i stay silent when black people are dying
and im trying to be politically correct
i can book a whole tour sell out the tickets
rap entrepreneur built his own business
if im only in this for my own selfinterest
not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
and this isnt authentic it is just a gimmick
the diy underdog so independent
but the one thing the american dream fails to mention
is i was many steps ahead to begin with
my skin matches the hero likeness the image
america feels safe with my music in their systems
and it suited me perfect the role i fulfilled it
and if im the hero you know who gets cast as the villain
white supremacy isnt just a white dude in idaho
white supremacy protects the privilege i hold
white supremacy is the soil the foundation the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
white supremacy is our countrys lineage designed for us to be indifferent
my success is the product of the same system that let off darren wilson – guilty
we wanna dress like walk like talk like dance like yet we just stand by
we take all we want from black culture but will we show up for black lives
we wanna dress like walk like talk like dance like yet we just stand by
we take all we want from black culture but will we show up for black lives

interlude 4 various male and female voices
black lives matter to use an analogy is like if if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire the fire department wouldnt show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter they would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because thats the house that needs the help the most — my generations taken on the torch of a very ageold fight for black liberation but also liberation for everyone injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere — the best thing white people can do is talk to each other having those very difficult very painful conversations with your parents with your family members — i think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is what are you willing to risk what are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society
