i walk alone think of home
memories of long ago
no one knows i lost my soul long ago

prechorus
lied too much
she said that shes had enough
am i too much
she said that shes had enough

chorus
standing on my own
remembering the one i left at home
forget about the life i used to know
forget about the one i left at home

i need to run far away
cant go back to that place
like she told me
im just a big disgrace

lied too much
she said that she’s had enough
am i too much
she said that she’s had enough

i’m learning how to live life on my own

forget about the one i left at home10embed"
