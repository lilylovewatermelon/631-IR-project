oh we broke on up to hill country the air was thin and sweet
lord the air was thin and sweet

she held onto my coat that night like a kid lost in her sleeves
oh we warmed the ground we hushed our sound
we slept on walking feet
lord we slept on walking feet

oh darlin pardon me
can you help me remember
when we were all flying free
we were dust from our bodies
and we were flicker and flame yeah we burned till the morning
darlin pardon me

off in the night you can hear em bright
the sirens of the sea
oh and city birds and alley girls they all just sing for free
oh they all just sing for free

oh darlin pardon me
but do i look familiar
when we were just larkspur and leaves
we were strung through the tether
and we were all silver and stone
we were the lust of the miners
darlin pardon me
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likethat sky glowed all calico like phosphor in the sea
to the ground we fall she owns us all
kings and boys and beast
kings and boys and beast

oh darlin pardon me
but do i look familiar
when we were just flying free
and we burned from a freight train
and we were some flicker of truth in the smile of a salesman
and we were all buried jewels neath the grass in the suburbs
and we were all living proof
oh darlin pardon meembed"
