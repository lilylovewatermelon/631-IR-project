i might as well admit it
that i still miss you
i know what i said but its
kind of hard for me
and its hurting me
this is bigger than pride
and i wanna give it another try
im still torn in two
but love made me make this decision so

chorus
ill forgive you
but you really hurt me
my heart wants to try us again
i know your only human
but you almost destroyed me
our love was worth it
still i need a little more time

verse 2
i hope you learned a lesson
bout hurting the ones you really love
cause i was a soldier for you
would have done anything to prove it to you
maybe we can get on track
rekindle the love and bring it back
cause theres nobody else for me
my heart just wants to say this to you
you might also likechorus x2
ill forgive you
but you really hurt me
my heart wants to try us again
i know your only human
but you almost destroyed me
our love was worth it
still i need a little more time

hook
i got to figure this out
we need a new start
no more deceitful lies
if someone told me we would be apart
i would say your foolish
cause god brought you to me

chorus x2
ill forgive you
but you really hurt me
my heart wants to try us again
i know your only human
but you almost destroyed me
our love was worth it
still i need a little more timeembed"
