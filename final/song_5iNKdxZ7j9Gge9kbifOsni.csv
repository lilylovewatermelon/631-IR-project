verse 1
close my eyes before i cross the street
car bout to hit me then he oughta beep uhhuh
watchin dawsons creek til i fall asleep
its harder than it seems im underwater in my dreams
im in awe this jigsaw puzzles not complete
im just an idea nothin concerete woah
came to raise limits get higher than plane engines
they tryna change wit us but come to the same difference okay
shut your piehole im dope and i know
my voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
i dont mind those hatin on my style
i tend to take the high road get stoned and fly low
im no god
i dont think that im a human though cause im so odd
people sellin drugs cause they cant find no job
wonder if christ made a million off of sellin the cross
let bygones be bygones my mind strong as pythons
the day that i die on will turn me to an icon
search the world for zion or a shoulder i can cry on
the best of all time im dylan dylan dylan
dylan dylan

verse 2
sippin jameson like i was majored in whiskey flavorin
when im drunk ill cut your head off and leave it danglin woah
flylos still tryna put me onto ableton
asian women love me i look like david duchovny
in kindergarten used to put some condoms in my cubby
in case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
i aint nobody and neither are you nope
been contemplatin if i even still believe in the truth im so stubborn
id rather write my own history book
where the world dont give a fuck bout how you physically look
all your songs are sixteens and a hook
we here to reinvent music its time for the revolution
im dyin for the movement tryin not to lose it
jewish buddhist consumin the views of christianity
wonder if hindus like to eat fish soup
if its true they should hit alaska in a igloo
i hear the fish bitin nice right now
i cant figure out life and feel right right now
boo if i think it i should say it theres a reason that i write it down
spit the shit that leave a diaper brown poo
