and the pin hits the shell
when my souls sinkin slowly
to the warm pits of hell
wont you tell my baby sister
that ill be back in the fall
cause its better to have false hope
than no hope at all

and ill be meetin with my savior
to go over my foolish deeds
when he asks me why i did it
lord ill blame it on the seed
cause it didnt grow in like i planned
and when it did it all went dry and
i couldnt stand to hear the pain
of a small baby cryin

well i remember in the graveyard
well i used to read the names
and i wondered when the good lord
would take my soul away
well i wonder if he planned it to happen
like this at all
with a shot heard halfway cross the world
and my sins on the wall
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeand ill be meetin with my savior
to go over my foolish deeds
when he asks me why i did it
lord ill blame it on the seed
cause it didnt grow in like i planned
and when it did it all went dry and
i couldnt stand to hear the pain
of a small baby cryin

and theyll tell me im a bad man
but theyve never seen the sight
of a baby wailin in his crib
and rippin apart the night
its a small baby cryinembed"
