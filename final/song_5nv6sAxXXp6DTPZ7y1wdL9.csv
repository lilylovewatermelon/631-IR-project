if you lock me out
if you lock me out

postchorus
me out

verse 1
im livin on the wild side
ive never seen a footprint
in the land of rivers
youre my only bridge
and i feel the fear in me
and i dont wanna fall asleep
when i turn into someone else
i know that it gives me peace

chorus
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out
if you lock me out

verse 2
i think ive been prayin
the lights wont go out
my blood is getting colder
as i follow this road down

chorus
if you lock me out there wont be anything to hold
if you lock me out there wont be anything to hold on to
if you lock me out there wont be anyone in the end
if you lock me out there wont be anyone in the end
if you lock me out there wont be anything to hold
if you lock me out there wont be anything to hold on to
if you lock me out there wont be anyone in the end
if you lock me out there wont be anyone in the endembed"
