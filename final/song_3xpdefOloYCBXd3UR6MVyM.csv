don’t go in there you’ll become one
freaky creatures monster party
eyes of yellow scales and feathers
tails and tethers turn the lights off
bend the nightmare you control it
artful dodger easy does it
shut the closet get under the covers
snakes and lovers turn the lights off

chorus joe hawley
everybody likes to get taken for turns
to see how bright the fire inside of us burns
and everybody wants to get evil tonight
but all good devils masquerade under the light

verse 2 zubin sedghi rob cantor joe hawley  rob cantor and joe hawley
here’s the pinky there’s the kinky
everybody complicated
man and woman baby child
calm and wild turn the lights off
don’t remember day’s gone what we look like night’s on
younger holding day’s gone one another light’s passed
paper colors day’s gone tangle streaming night’s on
tangle screaming light’s gone turn the lights off
chorus joe hawley
everybody likes to get taken for turns
to see how bright the fire inside of us burns
and everybody wants to get evil tonight
but all good devils masquerade under the light

verse 3 joe hawley zubin sedghi joe hawley
can’t they take it should be stronger
books abandoned breathe the water
mind distracted bad girls sons and daughters good boys
out for slaughter bad guys turn the lights off

bridge
sparkles and shines on the water
bet you’ve got a bone to pick with me
seeps through the cumulus brume
bet you’ve got a bone to pick with me
tingles and tears while we’re gazing
bet you’ve got a bone to pick with me
vanishes soon after bedtime for good
bet you’ve got a bone to pick with me

verse 4
don’t you like it day’s gone i know i do night’s on
how about you day’s gone what do we know light’s passed
tiny patterns day’s gone hypnotizing night’s on
terrorizing light’s gone turn the lights off
chorus
everybody likes to get taken for turns
to see how bright the fire inside of us burns
and everybody wants to get evil tonight
but all good devils masquerade under the light

outro
chroma diamonds twinkle brightly
dance in darkness blow the nights off
sleepy child spark desire
