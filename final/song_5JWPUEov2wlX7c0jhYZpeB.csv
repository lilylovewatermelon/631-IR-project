when we were livin in squalor wasnt it heaven
back when we used to get on it four out of seven
now even though that was a time i hated from day one
eventually terrible memories turn into great ones

prechorus
so if they call you embrace them
if they hold you erase them

chorus
cause it mightve been somethin whos to say
does it help to get lost in yesterday
and you mightve missed somethin dont say
cause it has to be lost in yesterday
and youre gonna have to let it go someday
youve been diggin it up like groundhog day
cause it mightve been somethin dont say
cause it has to be lost in yesterday

verse 2
matty said life didnt go the way that he planned it
said oh what id give to start over boy id command it
so what was i ever afraid of why did i worry
and why was i ever so brainless head in a flurry
you might also likeprechorus
cause if they call you embrace them
if they stall you erase them

chorus
cause it mightve been somethin whos to say
does it help to get lost in yesterday
and you mightve missed somethin dont say
cause it has to be lost in yesterday
and youre gonna have to let it go someday
youve been diggin it up like groundhog day
cause it mightve been somethin dont say
cause it has to get lost in yesterday

refrain
if it calls you embrace it
if it haunts you face it

bridge
i know its mad i understand
its only snakes and ladders
the myriad you never had
theres only one that matters

outro
and if it calls you embrace it
if it holds you erase it
replace it16embed"
