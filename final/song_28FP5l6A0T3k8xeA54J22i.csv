a loss and need thats on his past
i can hear him humming from the other side of the room
guess hes got rythm cus he hums every time hes blue

oh radio lead me a melody
that will make this boy cry
radio lead me a melody
that will make him wonder why hes so cold

broken glass and a pretty face
silent mourn full of hate
quiet face silent mourn
screaming for consequence
pleading for more

radio lead me a melody
that will make this boy cry
radio lead me a melody
that will make him wonder why he was so cold

write him a song that reminds him of a time
when he wasnt tumbling down down tumbling down

radio lead me a melody
that will make this boy cry
radio lead me a melody
that will make him wonder why he was so cold
