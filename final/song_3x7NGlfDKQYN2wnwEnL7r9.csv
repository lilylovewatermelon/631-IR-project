stuck in the jet wash
a bad trip i couldnt get off
maybe i bit off more than i could chew
overhead of the aqua blue
fall to your knees bring on the rapture
blessed be the boys time cant capture
on film or between the sheets
i always fall from your window to the pitch black street
and with the black banners raised
as the crooked smiles fade
former heroes who quit too late
who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

chorus
and in the end
id do it all again
i think youre my best friend
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright
ill be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright

verse 2
im not passive but aggressive
take note its not impressive
empty your sadness like youre dumping your purse
on my bedroom floor
we put your curse in reverse
and its our time now if you want it to be
maul the world like the carnival bear set free
and your love is anemic and i cant believe
that you couldnt see it coming from me
and i still feel that rush in my veins
it twists my head just a bit to think
all those people in those old photographs ive seen are dead
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
and in the end
id do it all again
i think youre my best friend
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright
ill be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright

bridge
sometimes i just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes yeah
and let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon

chorus
and in the end
id do it all again
i think youre my best friend
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright
ill be yours
when it rains it pours
stay thirsty like before
dont you know that the kids arent al kids arent alright101embed"
