ooh

verse 1
balloons are deflated
guess they look lifeless like me
we miss you on your side of the bed mmm
still got your things here
and they stare at me like souvenirs
dont wanna let you out my head

prechorus
just like the day that i met you the day i thought forever
said that you love me but thatll last for never
its cold outside like when you walked out my life
why you walk out my life

chorus
i get like this every time
on these days that feel like you and me
heartbreak anniversary
cause i remember every time
on these days that feel like you and me
heartbreak anniversary do you ever think of me
ohooh no
ooh no no no
ooh ooh ooh nah ooh

im buildin my hopes up
like presents unopened til this day
i still see the messages you read mmm
im foolishly patient foolishly patient
cant get past the taste of your lips taste of your lips
dont wanna let you out my head

prechorus
just like the day that i met you the day i thought forever
said that you love me but thatll last for never
its cold outside like when you walked out my life
why you walk out my life my life

chorus
i get like this every time
on these days that feel like you and me
heartbreak anniversary
cause i remember every time
