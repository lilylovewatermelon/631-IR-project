aint no cloud up in my sky
i couldnt worry if i tried
i got an open road just daring me
to pick you up and take you for a ride

verse 2
i got a new shine on my car
sun is tannin my left arm
and while im waiting on the red light
im burning up a little air guitar
yeah

chorus
turn it up a little bit louder
turn it up i love this song
come on girl the world is ours
lets do something right or wrong
life is short lets go live it
aint no time for wasting time
days like these they go by way too fast
yeah days like these you wanna make em last

verse 3
rest your feet up on the dash
leave your toe prints on the glass
sing it like you mean it baby
close your eyes and lay your head on back

chorus
turn it up a little bit louder
turn it up i love this song

aint no time for wasting time
days like these they go by way too fast
yeah days like these you wanna make them last
