i was standing there crying in the kitchen
its been one of those mornings thats going to last all day
and he comes in wraps his arms around me
and i dont even have to say a thing

chorus
thats what makes it love
thats what makes it a love song

verse 2
he comes in slams the door behind him
and he cant hide the worry on his face
even though i got a million things to tell him
i know right now he just needs some space

chorus
thats what makes it love
thats what makes it a love song
thats what makes it love
thats what makes it a love song

verse 3
everybody always sings about it
how theyre never gonna live without it
we dont even have to talk about it
cause were living it out

thats what makes it love
thats what makes it a love song
thats what makes it love
thats what makes it a love songembed"
