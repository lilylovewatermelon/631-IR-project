somewhere beyond happiness and sadness
i need to calculate
what creates my own madness
and im addicted to your punishment
and youre the master
and i am waiting for disaster

i feel irrational
so confrontational
to tell the truth i am
getting away with murder
it isnt possible
to never tell the truth
but the reality is im getting away with murder

verse 2
i drink my drink and i dont even want to
i think my thoughts when i dont even need to
i never look back because i dont even want to
and i dont need to
because im getting away with murder
