theres daddy on his john deere brand new in 96
beside me and bandit playing fetch when i was a kid
a save the date best day of my best buddies life
anybody else could walk on by and not blink an eye

chorus
cause theyre just pictures hanging side by side
forgotten memories from another time
just the places that ive been before
couple magnets recipes and polaroids
yeah but thats my life on the frigerator door

verse 2
my first day of kindergarten when i was 5 years old
a postcard that my cousin sent from cancun mexico
a list of what mama needs from the iga today
is just one small part of a work of art signed kenmore in 98

chorus
with all those pictures hanging side by side
forgotten memories from another time
and all the places that ive been before
couple magnets recipes and polaroids
yeah but thats my life on the frigerator door
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
as life flies by it spills onto the side
until its covered top to bottom with the best days of your life

chorus
and all those pictures hanging side by side
forgotten memories from another time
and all the places that youve been before
couple magnets recipes and polaroids
yeah but thats our lives on the frigerator door
on the frigerator doorembed"
