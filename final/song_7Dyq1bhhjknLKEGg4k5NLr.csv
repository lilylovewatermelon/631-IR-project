hey over there
please forgive me if im coming on too strong
hate to stare but youre winning
and theyre playing my favorite song
so come here a little closer
wanna whisper in your ear
make it clear a little question
wanna know just how you feel

chorus
if i said my heart was beating loud
if we could escape the crowd somehow
if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me
cause you feel like paradise and i need a vacation tonight
so if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me

verse 2
hey you might think that im crazy
but you know im just your type
i might be a little hazy
but you just cannot deny
theres a spark inbetween us
when were dancing on the floor
i want more wanna see it
so im asking you tonight
you might also likechorus
if i said my heart was beating loud
if we could escape the crowd somehow
if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me
cause you feel like paradise and i need a vacation tonight
so if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me

spoken interlude
if i said i want your body would you hold it against me

bridge
give me something good
dont wanna wait i want it now nanananow
drop it like a hood
and show me how you work it out
alright

breakdown
if i said my heart was beating loud
if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me

chorus
if i said my heart was beating loud
if we could escape the crowd somehow
if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me
cause you feel like paradise and i need a vacation tonight
so if i said i want your body now would you hold it against me204embed"
