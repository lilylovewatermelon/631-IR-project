verse 1
lot of new chops told my shooters go dumb
grew up on the block you aint from then dont come
mama always told me fight back dont run
she wasnt ever tryna have a pussy ass son
i was in the fields since a young ass age
smart nigga always had some decent lil grades
actin up nutty used to know how to behave
but always had a dream that id grow up and get paid
pray to god time go by shit change
really used to jugg im in the stu i switched lanes
still be with them shooters every day that put in pain
remember lockdown poppin bottles gettin restrained
the shit i been through as a youngin was no game
i know im goin up but still humble i remain
a lot of shit i did as a youngin im to blame
but i just feel the energy theres waitin go insane
i be spittin from the heart off the top like its easy
just was on the block hot pop yes they need me
i be spittin fly every drop its a pd
still ride with chops for the opps fuck the pd
deadies got me wheezy i just dropped with weezy
i just wish them not arounds was here to believe me
baddies on my weewee bitches thats on tv
you aint never turn a blue check to a skeezy
i cant wife an ee i need me a good bitch
someone on my level i aint fiendin for no hood bitch
two years in this industry i still be on my hood shit
but now i know theres more to livin life than bein hood rich
i need me a billy free that nigga gilly
opps straight bitch niggas thinkin that they drilly
lil nigga silly pop em like a wheelie
skate off on the scene on foot like its heelys

i just wanna be great and accomplish something fore i go
but they dont wanna see me accomplish nothing boy i know

verse 2
i just wanna be somethin fore i leave here
i cant sit and watch my people they need care
growing from the block i done had a steep year
headed to the top but the hunger deep there no no
long way from the day a nigga started this
true 2 myself was like a starter kit
and im only nineteen not too many work as hard as this
im just tryna go as far as it is thats the whole reason why i live
i got some shit to prove them niggas runnin out they jibs
at eighteen young nigga bought my mom a crib
i been knew this would happened crazy this the way it is
i was destined destined to succeed
remember bein locked down treated like a peasant next to fleas
i cant fuck with rats they got disease
i know i could achieve anything i want if i believe
anywhere i go i know im good flyin through the hood
and i keep that wishaniggawould
youngin i was so misunderstood
but new times came i pray to god i made it out for good

bridge
and accomplish something fore i go
and accomplish something boy i know
chorus
i just wanna be great and accomplish something fore i go
but they dont wanna see me accomplish something boy i know12embed"
