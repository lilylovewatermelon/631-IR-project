and if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
and if they get me take this spike to my heart and
and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and
you put the spike in my heart
backwards whispering

verse 1
and if the sun comes up
will it tear the skin right off our bones
and then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks
i saw you there
someone get me to the doctor someone get me to a church
where they can pump this venom gaping hole
and you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
and if they come and get me
what if you put the spike in my heart

prechorus
and if they get me and the sun goes down
and if they get me take this spike and
come on
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likechorus
can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away this jet black feeling

verse 2
and now the nightclub sets the stage for this
they come in pairs
she said well shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey
theyre always there

someone get me to the doctor and someone call the nurse
and someone buy me roses and someone burned the church
were hanging out with corpses and driving in this hearse
and someone save my soul tonight please save my soul

chorus
can you take this spike
will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless night time sky
can you take this spike
will it wash away the jet black now
lets go come on

bridge
and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over us
tonight
and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over time
and as these days watch over us
tonight

ill never let them ill never let them
ill never let them hurt you not tonight
ill never let them i cant forget them
ill never let them hurt you i promise

breakdown
struck down before our prime
before you got off the floor

can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
and these thoughts of endless night
bring us back into the light
can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
and this venom from my heart
bring us back into the light
bring us back into the light
can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
bring us back into the light
can you stake my heart can you stake my heart
bring us back into the light
can you stake me before the sun goes down
outro
and as always innocent like roller coasters
fatality is like ghosts in snow
and you have no idea what youre up against
because ive seen what they look like
becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws
