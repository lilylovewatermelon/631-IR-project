now that san franciscos gone
i guess ill just pack it in
wanna wash away my sins
in the presence of my friends
you and i we head back east
to find a town where we can live
even in the half light
we can see that somethings gotta give
when we watched the markets crash
the promises we made were torn
and my parents sent for me
from out west where i was born

bridge
some people say
weve already lost
but theyre afraid to pay the cost
for what weve lost
pay the cost
for what weve lost

verse 2
now that you have left me here
i will never raise my voice
all the diamonds you have here
in this home which has no life
oh this citys changed so much
since i was a little child
pray to god i wont live to see
the death of everything thats wild
though we knew this day would come
still it took us by surprise
in this town where i was born
i now see through a dead mans eyes

one day they will see its long gone1embed"
