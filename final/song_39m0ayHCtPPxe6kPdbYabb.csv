in a bar in toledo across from the depot
on a bars tool she took off her ring
i thought id get closer
so i walked on over
i sat down and asked her her name
when the drinks finally hit her
she said im no quitter
but i finally quit living on dreams
im hungry for laughter
and here ever after
im after whatever the other life brings
in the mirror i saw him
and i closely watched him
i thought how he looked out of place
he came to the woman
who sat there beside me
he had a strange look on his face
the big hands were calloused
he looked like a mountain
for a minute i thought i was dead
but he started shaking
his big heart was breaking
he turned to the woman and said

chorus
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
ive had some bad times
ive lived through some sad times
but this time the hurting wont heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille

after he left us i ordered more whiskey
i thought how shed made him look small
from the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
we walked without talking at all
she was a beauty but when she came to me
she must have thought id lost my mind
i couldnt hold her for the words that he told her
kept coming back time after time

chorus
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
ive had some bad times
ive lived through some sad times
but this time the hurting wont heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucille

you picked a fine time to leave me lucille
with four hungry children and a crop in the field
ive had some bad times
ive lived through some sad times
but this time the hurting wont heal
you picked a fine time to leave me lucilleembed"
