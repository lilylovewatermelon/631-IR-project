i just cant escape its like youre here with me now
but the words you say they always seem to fade out
since youve been away im just a face in the crowd
someday someday i know youre coming back

verse 1 jdog
down in the dirt with your blood on my hands
i blacked out but now i do understand
that you were too good for this world so you left it
everything turned red and then you made an exit
i dont even know if it was your time
but like all good things they pass you by
just like a lost soul in a time of need
it made me grow up fast and put some blood on my knees
and you dont even know its beyond you
thinking you could never die like youre bulletproof
so i guess you had to leave you were born with wings
but you were never happy till the angels sing

chorus danny
i just cant escape its like youre here with me now
but the words you say they always seem to fade out
since youve been away im just a face in the crowd
someday someday i know youre coming back down
someday someday i know youre coming back down

im ashes to ashes im dust to dust
and when a man turns to ash just forget about love
like the feeling inside you with the bottle beside you
you both end up empty like an angel just died too
i look to the heavens to the sky and the rest
i looked inside myself i felt my heart in my chest
some things are born blue theres nothing to say
some hearts can stay true when falling away
come lay down beside me what could one life mean
its only what ive seen its only just one dream
tell my baby i love her and i wish i could hold her
its hard to say goodbye when you know that its over

chorus danny
i just cant escape its like youre here with me now
but the words you say they always seem to fade out
since youve been away im just a face in the crowd
someday someday i know youre coming back down
someday someday i know youre coming back down
one day one day i know youre coming back down

bridge johnny 3 tears  danny
i know youre coming back know youre coming back
i know youre coming back down
i know youre coming back know youre coming back
i know youre coming back down
i know youre coming back know youre coming back
i know youre coming back down
i know youre coming back know youre coming back
i know youre coming back down
i know youre coming back down
chorus danny
i just cant escape its like youre here with me now
but the words you say they always seem to fade out
since youve been away im just a face in the crowd
someday someday i know youre coming back down
someday someday i know youre coming back down
one day one day i know youre coming back down14embed"
