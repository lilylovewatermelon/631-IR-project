lately im not quite myself maybe i do need some help
just my confusion trust my delusion
dont you regret you met me go through these steps to get me
back to where we start fore i fall apart

verse 1
if i could black out itd become so clear
standing facetoface with everything i fear
watch so closely but still i dont see
as bad as it seems a piece of mind i steal
in ordinary life the consequence is real
im past the point of reality

chorus
this isnt me this isnt you but its just everything we do
til you open up your eyes and understand this isnt real
this isnt me this isnt you this is everything but true
til we come to realize its what we put each other through

verse 2
spent days without a trace and
its like a bad dream thats becoming all too true
im lost inside this place now
leaving me with nothing else left to do
now so helpless im not so selfish tell me
how does it feel to have a face like that
how does it feel to be replaced like that
now so faceless do you still feel

this isnt me this isnt you but its just everything we do
til you open up your eyes and understand this isnt real
this isnt me this isnt you this is everything but true
til we come to realize its what we put each other through

bridge

chorus
this isnt me this isnt you but its just everything we do
til you open up your eyes and understand this isnt real
this isnt me this isnt you this is everything but true
