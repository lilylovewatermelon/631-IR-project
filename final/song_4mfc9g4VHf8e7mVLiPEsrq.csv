yall aint never just tripped and pictured
and just looked at the whole situation
‘cause once you look at it
you know really do

hook 2pac
they dont give a fuck about us
they dont give a fuck about us
they dont give a fuck about us
if i choose to ride thuggin til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us
but when i start to rise
a hero in they childrens eyes
now they give a fuck about us

verse 1 2pac
some say niggas is hardheaded cause we love to trip
equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
i see you tryin to hide hopin that nobody dont notice
you must always remember youre still a member of the hopeless
see youre black like me so you snap like me
when these devils try to plot trap our young black seeds
look it cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin
lookin for role models our father figures is basers
some say expect illuminati take my body to sleep
niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
before i fear computer chips i gotta deal with brothers flippin
i dont see no devils bleedin only black blood drippin
we can change — what your mouth say
im watchin niggas work their lives out without pay
whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
im bustin shots make the world stop
they dont give a fuck about us

verse 2 edi mean
its the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
time to reflect on what you did ‘cause they sayin you wrong
im sure you had your reasons dawg i dont doubt you
see the simple fact of the matter is they dont give a fuck about you
or them five mouths you forced to feed not includin yourself
all you want is wealth they perceive it as greed
so as you loaded up that mac and continue to bust
your mind was on paper thinkin they dont give a fuck about us

verse 3 2pac
im seein it clearer hatin the picture in the mirror
they claim we inferior so why the fuck these devils fear ya
im watchin my nation die genocide the cause
expect a blood bath the aftermath is yalls
i told you last album we need help cause we dyin
give us a chance help us advance ‘cause we tryin
ignored my whole plea watchin us in disgust
and then they beg when my guns bust
they dont give a fuck about us
hook 2pac
now if i choose to ride thuggin til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us
but when i start to rise
a hero in they childrens eyes
now they give a fuck about us
if i choose to ride thuggin til the day i die
nobody gives a fuck about us
but when i start to rise
a hero in they childrens eyes
now they give a fuck about us

verse 4 kastro
now all the homies got love for me
down to catch a slug for me
guaranteed to bleed deeply now thats love
shit nobody else would give a fuck
if im tore down from the floor down sixfeet deep in the cut
what the fuck done went wrong
how long will i be mourned
when im gone same song aint give a fuck all along
and who am i to blame em
just do or die through the rainin
since they dont give a fuck i dont feel what im sayin

verse 5 kadafi
now thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
pressed in times we busted like bubbles
with the police this nations peace sent here to run you
now look at what this crooked world has come to
i grew up on the other side of perfect a life of hurtin
man i still hustle so im dyin certain
so why spend your time poor and workin i see no reason
so i stay ballin season to season
why you stuck thinkin that they give a fuck
verse 6 napoleon
you tell me my world is in peace but nigga youre lyin
‘cause half of my niggas long gone
buried in the dirt just for tryin
sometime i think my block is dyin and that is awful
to wake up to another day shit aint changed thats awful
i wake up sweatin dreamin coughin
seein me upside down backwards head twisted
while im layin in the coffin
the shit comes around so often so tell me somethin
before i take it out on the world and get to dumpin
nigga id be soft if i aint go through the strugglin
im doin the same thing you did at my age and thats hustlin
on the edge of straight bustin
well since you dont give a fuck i be frontin
ima drink my hennessy like it aint nothin

hook 2pac
if i choose to ride thuggin til the day i die
they dont gives a fuck about us
but while im kickin rhymes
kick it to they childrens minds
now they give a fuck about us
they wanna see us die
they kick us every time we try
‘cause they dont give a fuck about us
so while im gettin high
im watchin as the world goes by
‘cause they dont give a fuck about us
if i choose to ride thuggin til the day i die
they dont gives a fuck about us
but while im kickin rhymes
kick it to they childrens minds
now they give a fuck about us
they wanna see us die
they kick us every time we try
‘cause they dont give a fuck about us
so while im gettin high
im watchin as the world goes by
‘cause they dont give a fuck about us
