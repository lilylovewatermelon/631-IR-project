did you ever want me no worries if not
its just that i told my mum she thinks were still going strong
she knows that im so fond of you that she cant ignore
how every day she knocks but i dont answer my door
every time i look outside my house i try to make myself believe
i can look at nature and feel good again
you just call and text to say i want to talk but im too scared to meet
is that why you think the worst of me

chorus
say well make up
whyd you say that
whyd you break her
cause i never got to teach myself at all
how to not show myself let go
all my friends know
that you think the worst of me

verse 2
even though you broke my heart
now were living worlds apart
now ive blocked you since im smart
never got to teach myself at all
now that all thats done and said
i see all the time i spent
not talking to my best friend
cause i thought the worst of mesee pinkpantheress liveget tickets as low as 43you might also like6embed"
