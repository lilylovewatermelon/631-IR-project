who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know for them niggas like me
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know it dont matter what they say bout you
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
let me know
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know for them niggas like me
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else

verse 1
some things we cant explain
why do we act this way
why dont we make it easier for the world to change someday
sometimes i contemplate some things my heart cant take
why do we hurt one another fight our brother kill and rape
love can trump it all
i know you seen it all
and know you a star you just have to believe in who you are
who can you love

chorus
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know for them niggas like me
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
let me know
who can i love when they tell me i cant love myself let me know
how in the hell could i possibly love someone else
