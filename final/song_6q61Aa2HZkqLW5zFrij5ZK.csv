they blazed a trail i dared to run
they built this world and i have come
i need another like a brother
for a cryin shoulder

chorus
this could be the last time
you will stand by my side
i can feel my soul it’s bleeding
will you fly with me this evening

verse 2
sober mind time now is gone
they carved my body not of stone
a pretty maze of emptiness
i said to hell with all the rest

chorus
this could be the last time
you will stand by my side
i can feel my soul it’s bleeding
will you fly with me this evening

this could be the last time
you will stand by my side
i can feel my soul it’s bleeding
will you fly with me this evening
this could be the last time
you will stand by my side
i can feel my soul it’s bleeding
will you fly with me this eveningembed"
