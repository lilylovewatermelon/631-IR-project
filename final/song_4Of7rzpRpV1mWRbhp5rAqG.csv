counting days counting days
since my love up and got lost on me
and every breath that ive been taking
since you left feels like a waste on me
ive been holding on to hope
that youll come back when you can find some peace
cause every word that ive heard spoken
since you left feels like a hollow street

prechorus
ive been told ive been told to get you off my mind
but i hope i never lose the bruises that you left behind
oh my lord oh my lord i need you by my side

chorus
there must be something in the water
cause every day its getting colder
and if only i could hold you
youd keep my head from going under

verse 2
maybe i maybe im just being blinded
by the brighter side
of what we had because its over
