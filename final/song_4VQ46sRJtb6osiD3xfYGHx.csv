broward county 954 we here i kicked the door down
nolia boy shit 1800 block ugly corner tied gleeful

verse
i was hopin that youd ride for me the way i rode for you
i wish my boy was here to see the man that i grew into
and i know if im feelin like this it gotta be mutual
but it aint they business tellin them the shit we surfaced through
yeah i wont never tell the world the shit i did for you
even though you lied on me thats cool as long as you know the truth
i dont even feel the love be real no more so i keep my distance
remember i ran me up my millions you was in your feelings
even that time you shake my hand and you dont even grip it
but if i put that shit on blast they gon say im trippin
ima just follow my intuition and ima keep on livin
i wonder sometimes if you wishin shit couldve been different
right now im cheffin its too late im doin my thing right now
i aint lookin down on you just chillin im on the plane right now
i know you miss me but dont worry ill never forget you
even though you switched on me and it hurt me i cant hold that gainst you
takin everything in me and its burnin for me to forgive you
you still my whoadie still my dirty but i aint fuckin wit you
to create my future i had to revisit my past revisit my pain
but i wont never let you back in we cant rekindle that flame
when he got stuck on and you blamed me cause you know i did it
couldnt call on you when it was raining and it killed my spirit
all the shit you said you tried to shame me tried to kill my image
even though you know me since a baby and you know im with it
you know im serious steppin on niggas like i aint even got no feelings
im in my cell right now im wishin shit couldve been different
i aint droppin no names no more but nigga i hope you hear it
cant take nothin back it went like that so nigga thats what it is
everywhere i went i took you with me every show i did
aint say your name in all my songs no more cant waste my lyrics
i said i was comin home they said no you isnt
im a real nigga so im dyin how im livin
i remember throwin rocks now we goin to prison
when i got my first glock kept that thing with me
you was with me on the block thuggin real silly
jumped in the game then i popped then you went to switchin
i tried to give you niggas shots but you niggas missin
soon as lil yella got knocked niggas went to snitchin
i done been through a lot shit you never didnt
i had to pop a nigga top to make that boy feel me
crackers had me in the box thuggin every minute
young nigga see about me ima show you different
all my life throwin rocks at the penitentiary
but now my watch got rocks no more drug dealin
and now my top gon drop im in a new bentley
heard foolie got shot i wonder who did it
you my dirty you and me we made it from the mud
i been wishin shit couldve been how it was
bout you i swear to god i wouldve took a slug
down to kill a nigga bout you and its all love
this shit aint about a stripe this just what im used to
im down to throw away my life throw away my future
bout street principality no flag
man that soldierlike mentality automatic
im jumpin out the pinkg truck with the ratchet
zs up til i freeze up lil daddy glee
zs up til i freeze up lil daddy gleeful
zs up til i freeze up lil daddy

gleefully thats how you present that shit the right way
you know what im talkin bout broward county 954
you know we dont represent we dont represent
we present it once and thats what it is thats how you step

i wish it couldve been different though
