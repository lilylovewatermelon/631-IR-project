were not gonna be just a part of their game
were not gonna be just the victims
theyre taking our dreams and they tear them apart
until everyones the same

prechorus
ive got no place to go
ive got no where to run
they love to watch me fall
they think they know it all

chorus
im a nightmare a disaster
thats what they always said
im a lost cause not a hero
but ill make it on my own
ive gotta prove them wrong
me against the world
its me against the world

verse 2
we wont let them change how we feel in our hearts
were not gonna let them control us
we wont let them shove all their thoughts in our heads
and well never be like them
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeprechorus
ive got no place to go
ive got no where to run
they love to watch me fall
they think they know it all

chorus
im a nightmare a disaster
thats what they always said
im a lost cause not a hero
but ill make it on my own
ive gotta prove them wrong
me against the world
me against the world

bridge
now im sick of this waiting
so come on and take your shot
you can spit all your insults
but nothing you say is gonna change us
you can sit there and judge me
say what you want to
well never let you in

chorus
im a nightmare a disaster
thats what they always said
im a lost cause not a hero
but ill make it on my own
me against the world
im a nightmare a disaster
thats what they always said
im a lost cause not a hero
but ill make it on my own
im gonna prove em wrong
theyll never bring us down
well never fall in line
ill make it on my own
me against the world3embed"
