if you derive your sense of identity from being a victim lets say bad things were done to you when you were a child and you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you

verse baby keem
you ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division
your uncle ever stole from you day after christmas
seen both of those in them county jail visits
the first and the fifteenth the only religion
noodles in the microwave shark tank tidal wave
grandma shootin niggas blood on the highway
crossеs on the dashboard you just want a platform
i wanna take evеrything that i ask for
catch me a body ill put that on anybody but my mama
she showin a pattern for certain
i think its white panties and minimal condoms
my uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
this year i did fortythree shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
jack of all trades got money out the way
put my heart in the faith im good love
cousin in the courts heard he jumped off the porch
turn a brick to a porsche im good love
catch us you know im gon rack up
i need the advance and the equity to match up
the engineer dead if the drive dont back up
these words come of god you could never outrap us
nowadays gotta walk cautious ayy
nowadays im a new prophet ayy
game dead no autopsy ayy
city girl with they new hobby ayy
catch a body put the prada in the tada
nigga bout to get some pussy give me five give me five
gun dirty got the thirty in the purse purse
tight bitch put a perky in her salad
i gotta pray for the basic
i never seen my niggas bust down faces
them niggas not tasteless
i only had one chance i aint even waste it
been down on my luck
been down on my luck when i faaall
i gotta get up
i gotta get back up and baaaall
rip under my people
im proud of my people im proud of my dawgs
my ex got a beamer she want me to see it
i still aint gon see it like okay
i love when they ratchet i dont do her patek
i still do the watches the old way
she think im conceited im thinkin bout cheatin
i dont do the flowers or roleplay
now how can i fold lookin at twenty million
this money dont come with a probate
mama i said itd be okay
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likeoutro baby keem
i got this shit brackin in four days
four eyes four eyes two eyes
switch sides nigga be fresh out
suicide doors i suicide suicide
