baby you summertime fine
i let you get on top i be the underline im
tryna get beside you like the number nine dime
you fine as hell
i guess i met you for a reason only time can tell
but well im wonderin what type of shit you wantin
do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
would you drink with a nigga do you smoke weed
dont be ashamed it aint no thing i used to blow trees
gettin lifted i quit but shit i might get high with you
its only fittin cause im lookin super fly with you
a flower you are powerful you do somethin to me
cause girl i caught the vibe like you threw somethin to me
so i threw em back now all my niggas hollerin “who was that”
“oh boy she bad nigga what you bout to do with that”
im finna take you home just sip a little patron
now we zonin baby you so fine

uh baby you wintertime cold
the night is still young drink that dinner wine slow
im tryna make the goosebumps on your inner thigh show
ill let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
yeah and if you gotta leave for work
ill be right here in the same bed that you left me in
i love thick women cause my aunt she rode equestrian
i used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me
and i would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
im jokin i mean that thing is pokin
i mean you kinda like that girl thats in the us open
i mean i got this hidden agenda that you provokin
i got bath water that you can soak in things i could do with lotion
dont need a towel we could dry off in the covers
and when you think you like it i promise you gonna love it
yeah when lights comin through the drapes and we both yawnin
i roll over and ask if i can hit it in the mornin

chorus drake
yeah can i hit it in the mornin
yeah can i hit it in the mornin
yeah the sun risin while you moanin baby
can i hit it in the mornin uh
can i hit it in the mornin yeah
can i hit it in the mornin
the sun risin while you moanin
verse 3 j cole
hey god bless the child that can hold his own
god bless the woman that can hold patron
god bless her homegirl that drove us home
no strings attached like a cordless phone
you see my intentions with you was clear
im learnin not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
therefore you shouldnt judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
get all defensive apprehensive all because my career
to be fair i know we barely know each other and yeah
somehow i wound up in your bed so where we headed from here
just say youre scared if youre scared
but if you through frontin we can do somethin
and you know just what im talkin about
tomorrow youll be callin out
cause tonight we gettin right into the wee morn
cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
then i go my own way you think about me all day
thats just a warnin

chorus j cole
and can i hit it in the mornin
can i hit it in the mornin
can i hit it in the mornin
the sun risin while you moanin
can i hit it in the mornin
can i hit it in the mornin
and can i hit it in the mornin
the sun risin while you moanin yeah100embed"
