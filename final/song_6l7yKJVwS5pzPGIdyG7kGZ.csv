i woke up on this side i thought it was a dream
at first we learned to walk then learned to scream
you dont understand heres the places you cant believe
and you cant see the things that i can see
but i forget that you thank god and pray
some things just never stay
and we all just slip away

chorus
this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it when i cant see the truth
welcome to the real world now
and i dont want to believe that its a place for you and i
i hope you think its tragic
because i know
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh

verse 2
look out the window at a sky that doesnt care
i look up for the sun but its not there not there
the rivers flood and the ground beneath me shakes
turn your eyes and hope that window doesnt breaks
but still i know that you cant make the change
some things just never stay
and we all just slip away

this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it and i can see that soon
welcome to the real world now
you try to wind your watch but were all running out of time
i hope
i hope you think its tragic
because i know
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh

verse 3
just as soon as you see just as soon as you see
its not the way that it should be youll understand
its not the way that it should be
just for the first time
as fake as it seems we all share in this disease
so what a damn for the last time

chorus
this cant be the real world now
i dont believe it and i cant see the truth
welcome to the real world now
you try to wind your watch but were all running out of time
i hope
i hope you think its tragic
because i know
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
the old are carried in now just to poison youth
am i the only one who thinks its tragic
because i know
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh
this cant be the real world now
oh no oh
oh no oh1embed"
