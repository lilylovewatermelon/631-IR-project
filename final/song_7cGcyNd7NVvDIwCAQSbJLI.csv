this is for my number one
this is for my number one
this is for my number one
true baby for i adore

verse 1 ll cool j
this is hard to say
i wanna make sure i go about this in the right way
cause lately i been busy a lot
and i know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
i used to tell you that your hair looked fly
kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
now i talk real foul and slick
every other sentence is you make me sick
back in the days i was your number one pick
now your hearts halfbroken and that’s hard to fix
i had to dig deep inside myself
cause i cant see you bouncin with somebody else
its a long journey back to the place we was
when i was too embarrassed to admit i was in love
and you was my good girl that wouldnt give it up
i cant let us selfdestruct

chorus marc dorsey
baby smile today
cause i been imaginin more ways
i’m gon luv u better
when your friends’ll see you too
just when you think theres nothin else i can do
i’m gon luv u better
you might also likeverse 2 ll cool j
when i think about the things we did
and i think about you having my kids
and i think about us sharing a crib
losin’ all that god forbid
you deserve flowers and candy the simple things
in addition to the sl’s baguettes and rings
instead i walk around like i’m a king
and having you ain’t nothing but a thing
i even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
too busy frontin’ in the hood
baby girl hold me tight don’t ever let go
i’ma do it real gentle baby nice and slow
one more chance baby and don’t say no
cause i got another side to show
some say love is painful it helps you grow
well it’s time for the pain to go ya’know

chorus marc dorsey
baby smile today
cuz i been imaginin’ more ways
i’m gon’ luv u better
when your friends’ll see you too
just when you think there’s nothin’ else i can do
i’m gon’ luv u better
bridge ll cool j  pharrell williams
do you think i meant to hurt you no

so let’s laugh together cry together
god willin’ we gon’ die together
do you think i meant to hurt you no
do you think i meant to hurt you no
so let’s laugh together cry together
god willin’ we gon’ die together

verse 3 ll cool j
it’s a brand new me a brand new you
a brand new day sky so blue
hold my hand while i walk with you
sit on my lap lemme talk to you
no more games callin’ you foul names
actin’ like females is all the same
i’m gon’ love you better my mentality changed
from this day forward i’ll never be the same
i’ma rub your lower back share my dreams
i love you lemme show you what i mean
give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
watch you sleep so peaceful and serene
a toast to the queen you’re back in my life
but this time i’ma do it right
trust me from the bottom of my heart
nothin’s gonna tear us apart promise
chorus marc dorsey
