i couldnt sleep
took a walk down second avenue
sick of dreaming dreams that never come true
one way street and i know where its leading to
theres a for sale sign on the front door of the city hall
the subway line got graffiti crawling off the wall
i could take a hit but i dont want to take the fall
thats just one side of the story
in this two story town

chorus
its just the same old sights
and the same old sounds
i want to take my car and drive out of this two story town
its the same old shit going around
im going down down down down down
in a two story town

verse 2
theres a girl that i sleep with
shes got ecstasy eyes
he promised her roses and american pie
i called her and my demons
and i kissed them both goodbye
seven days of monday morning
in a two story town

bridge
one shot to make a move now
the ghosts are calling me out
and me im just one story
in a two story town
but youre never going to find me in the lost and found

chorus

chorusx2
its just the same old sights and the same old sounds
i want to take my horse and drive out of this merrygoround
i wont give in and i wont back down
im going down down down down down
never going down down down down down
i aint going down down down down down
in a twostory town
in this two story townembed"
