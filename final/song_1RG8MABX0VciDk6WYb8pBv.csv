inaudible chatter

verse 1
ohh
lookin like another bob marley day
hittin from the bong like a diesel train
and im down with hangin out this afternoon
we got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
cheech and chong probably woulda smoked them all
so im out on the couch this afternoon
beer bottles layin on the kitchen floor
if we take em all back we can buy some more
so i doubt well go without this afternoon

prechorus
ohh
you better hang on if youre taggin along
cause well be doin this till six in the mornin
nothin wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when youd rather

chorus
get up and go out
me and all my friends
we drink up we fall down
and then we do it all again
just sittin around hangin out this afternoon
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likeverse 2
landlord says i should buy a tent
but he can kiss my ass cause i paid the rent
so i doubt hell kick me out this afternoon
down on the corner in a seedy bar
juke box crankin out the ccr
had a few to suzy q this afternoon

prechorus
ohh
you better hang on if youre taggin along
cause well be doin this till six in the mornin
nothin wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when youd rather

chorus
get up and go out
me and all my friends
we drink up we fall down
and then we do it all again
yeah we get up and go out
me and all my friends
we drink up we fall down
and then we do it all again
yeah just sittin around hangin out this afternoon
bridge 1
dont want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
to see what time it is
from the moment i wake up
i just love being with my friends
we barely get by but have the best times
and hope it never ends
we drink all day till we fall down
so we can do it all again

bridge 2
its not the human walk
its the human race
if you aint livin on the edge
youre takin too much space
so i doubt ill figure out just what to do
bout to kick it around
hanging out this afternoon

prechorus
ohh
you better hang on if youre taggin along
cause well be doin this till six in the mornin
nothin wrong with goin all night long
tough to put the brakes on
doesnt matter when youd rather
chorus
get up and go out
me and all my friends
we drink up we fall down
and then we do it all again
yeah we get up and go out
me and all my friends
we drink up we fall down
and then we do it all again

outro
just kickin around hangin out this afternoon
laughter
sittin around hangin out this afternoon
last call you sons of bitches
just kickin around hangin out this afternoon
yeah just sittin around hangin out this afternoon
drinks on the house
just kickin around hangin out this afternoon
just sittin around hangin out this afternoon2embed"
