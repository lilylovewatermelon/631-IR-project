i bet i sound like a broken record
like a backseatfloorboard scratched cd
playin the same old sad song on repeat
doin what they say to do to forget her
but its just red eyes at the bottom of a bottle
aint no red words aint no gospel

chorus
ooh she finally got me down here on my knees
ooh fightin back tears and gravity
shes learnin how to fly those angel wings
im drownin her goodbye in tennessee
probably wouldnt be if her halo was still hangin over me
heaven knows she walked on water
hell i cant even walk on whiskey

verse 2
i bet this bartenders tired of hearin my confession
and the jukebox playin that whitley songs
like a devil smilin remindin me shes gone
so im swingin back with old number seven
and its two on one but it still aint fair
without her here i aint got a prayer

chorus
ooh she finally got me down here on my knees
ooh fightin back tears and gravity
shes learnin how to fly those angel wings
im drownin her goodbye in tennessee
probably wouldnt be if her halo was still hangin over me
heaven knows she walked on water
hell i cant even walk on whiskey

god i know youre up there listenin
good book says you always do
all the wrong ive done that youve forgiven
maybe she can too

chorus
ooh she finally got me down here on my knees
ooh fightin back tears and gravity
shes learnin how to fly those angel wings
im drownin her goodbye in tennessee
i probably wouldnt be if her halo was still hangin over me
heaven knows she walked on water
yeah heaven knows she walked on water
hell i cant even walk on whiskey
no i cant even walk on whiskeyembed"
