verse 2
a lot of people told me
when daddy passed away
go take some time off
but i got no time to waste
dont you have a dream too
some goals youve got to make
you may feel small sometimes

sometimes your life can bring you down
sometimes you run for miles and miles
sometimes you scream without hope
now once you feel you hit the ground
then victory comes back around
and youll be proud to let them know
