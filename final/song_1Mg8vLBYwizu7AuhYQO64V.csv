verse 3 ludacris
i love everything about you youre imperfectly perfect
everyones itchin for beauty but just scratching the surface
lost time is never found can the dj please reverse it
in life we pay for change lets make every second worth it
anything can work if you work it
when people say you dont deserve it then dont give in
cause hate may win some battles but love wins in the end
you shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
beauty revolves around you its only right that
