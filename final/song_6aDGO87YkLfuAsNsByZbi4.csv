of your favorite dress
and im sneaking glances
and looking for the patterns in static
they start to make sense
the longer im at it

ivory lines lead
oohwhaho
oohwhaho

your heart is a river
that flows from your chest
through every organ
your brain is the dam
and i am the fish
who cant reach the core

ivory lines lead
oohwhaho
oohwhaho

oh instincts are misleading
you shouldnt think what youre feeling
they dont tell you what
you know you should want
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likeivory lines lead

ivory lines lead

oh instincts are misleading
you shouldnt think what youre feeling
they dont tell you what
you know you should want

ivory lines lead
