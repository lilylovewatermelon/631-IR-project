eighty dollars round trip anywhere you fly
well that sounds like a winner but before i book the flight
hey talk me out of tampa

verse 2
well tell me bout new orleans just when is that mardi gras
well then how about chicago
is it still cold there now or not
talk me out of tampa

chorus
i mean surely theres a hurricane due to hit there any day
wont that close the beaches and the airport
or maybe its still way to hot or did i hear
somewhere you stopped flyin into that part of the country
you can think of somethin cant ya
just talk me out of tampa

verse 3
between that first ride at busch gardens
and room eight bayside motel
theres no way around the memories
dont let me do this to myself
talk me out of tampa

id just wind up at her front door
shes still living there i bet
oh but what if shes not there alone
there goes what pride that ive got left
talk me out of tampa please

chorus
i mean surely theres a hurricane due to hit there any day
wont that close the beaches and the airport
or maybe its still way to hot or did i hear
somewhere you stopped flyin into that part of the country
you can think of somethin cant ya
just talk me out of tampa

verse 5
put me somewhere nowhere even close
to where i feel when my heart broke
exactly six months ago this weekend
i just need to get away
without your help maam im afraid
it wouldnt be a getaway at all
you can make up somethin cant ya
just talk me out of tampa
