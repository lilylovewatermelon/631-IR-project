meet eddie 23 years old
fed up with life and the way things are going

but on his way in he has a sudden change of heart
shit is mine
and suddenly i gotta do this
his conscience comes into play i gotta do this

verse 1 dr dre eminem  eddie
alright stop huh
now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
you better think of the consequence who are you
im your motherfuckin conscience
thats nonsense
go in gaffle the money and run to one of your aunts cribs
and borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
can i borrow this
tell her you need a place to stay youll be safe for days
if you shave your legs with renees razor blades
yeah but if it all goes through like its supposed to
the whole neighborhood knows you and theyll expose you
think about it before you walk in the door first
look at the store clerk shes older than george burns
fuck that do that shit shoot that bitch
can you afford to blow this shit are you that rich
