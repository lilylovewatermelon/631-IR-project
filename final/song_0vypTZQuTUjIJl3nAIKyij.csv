girls in bikinis bikinis
gimme gimme
girls in bikinis
gimme gimme

verse 1
watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
cant help but stare
they do the shimmy out of them cutoffs
lay a towel down and they look around
they ride up they pull em out
dont try to act like you dont know what im talking about

chorus
camo canary yellow red white and blue
highfive to the guy who thought about cutting that thing in two
string around her neck or without a strap
laying on their bellies untied off their backs
watching girls in bikinis is like watching a slinky walk down the stairs
cant help but stare
gimme gimme
girls in bikinis
gimme gimme

verse 2
