she was the color of tv
her mouth curled under like a metal snake
although holy wood was sad
theyd remember this as valentines day

prechorus
flies are waiting

chorus
in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death
slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

verse 2
i saw that pregnant girl today
she didnt know that it was dead inside
even though it was alive
some of us are really born to die

prechorus
flies are waiting

chorus
in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death
slit our wrists and send us to heaven
the first flower after the flood

in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death
in the shadow of the valley of death

in the shadow of the valley of death7embed"
