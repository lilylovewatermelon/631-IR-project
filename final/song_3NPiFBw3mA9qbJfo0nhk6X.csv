foals in winter coats
white girls of the north
file past one five and one
they are the fabled lambs
of sunday ham
the ehs norm

verse 2
and they could float above the grass
in circles if they tried
a latent power i know they hide
to keep some hope alive
that a girl like i
could ever try
could ever try

chorus 1
so we just skirt the hallway sides
a phantom and a fly
follow the lines
and wonder why
theres no connection

verse 3
a week of rolling eyes
and cheap shots from the trite
and were off to nemarcas porch again
another afternoon
of the goathead tunes
and pilfered booze

we wander through her mamas house
the milk from a window lights
family portrait circa 95
this is that foreign land
with the sprayedon tans
and it all feels fine
be it silk or slime

chorus 2
so when they tap our monday heads
two zombies walk in our stead
this town seems hardly worth the time
and well no longer memorize or rhyme
too far along in our climb
stepping over what now towers to the sky
with no connection

bridge
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh

chorus 3
so when they tap our sunday heads
two zombies walk in our stead
this town seems hardly worth the time
and well no longer memorize or rhyme
too far along in our crime
stepping over what now towers to the sky
with no connection
outro
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh ohh
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh ohh
oh ohoh ohohh
oh ohoh ohohh ohh16embed"
