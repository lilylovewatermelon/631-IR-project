man i could use a pina colada
little bit of sun on my skin
a hammock a book
never gonna look back
once my feet hit the sand
ive had it up to here with this rat race
need a smile on my face

chorus
i wanna go where i can lighten up the load
drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
get this laying low off to a flying start
play my guitar in the caribbean sun
hang with the locals at the quiet mon
where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star
and be as you are

verse 2
getting stuck sure would be easy
in this palm tree paradise
ambition fades with every wave
for the finer things in life
maybe ill just hang around here
go home later next year
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
i wanna go where i can lighten up the load
drive a little while on the wrong side of the road
get this laying low off to a flying start
play my guitar in the caribbean sun
hang with the locals at the quiet mon
where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star
and be as you are

verse 3
i wanna play my guitar in the caribbean sun
hang with the locals at the quiet mon
where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star
and be as you are
be as you areembed"
