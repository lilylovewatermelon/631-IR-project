ive got an aching in my bones
from sixteen days out on the road
and im almost through
mmm i got to get back home to you
i aint had a bite since yesterday
theres an exit sign and a little caf√©
but i aint got time to lose
oh i got to get back home to you

chorus
big ol wheels keep rolling down the line
american steel dont let me down tonight
and ill get out and push this rig if ive got too
and walk right through the soles of these ol boots
just to get back home to you

verse 2
i can almost see your angel face
its like diesel in my veins
and it keeps me pushing on through
mmm to get back home to you
girl the telephones hard to hold on to
but baby you know im staying true
cause i know what youre gonna do
mmm when i get back home to you

big ol wheels keep rolling down the line
american steel dont let me down tonight
and ill get out and push this rig if ive got too
and walk right through the soles of these ol boots
just to get back home to you
ive got to get back home to you

chorus
big ol wheels keep rolling down the line
american steel dont let me down tonight
and ill get out and push this rig if ive got too
and walk right through the soles of these ol boots
just to get back home to you
ive got to get back home to youembed"
