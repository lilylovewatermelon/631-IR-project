rode into town and only eighteen
my girl beside me and a baby in a car seat
everybody called me crazy
that was fine as long as i knew
she believed
not a nickel to our name
cheap motel east side of town just south of main
songs i wrote for change
and one day id be headlining the stage

chorus
she gives me strength
when mines all gone
she always keeps me hanging on
when i feel ive lost my way
she leads me home
she dont know how much i need her
a beautiful believer

verse 2
i just got the news today
you know that song i wrote for you has made its way
then oh so much has changed
you know the one thing that has always stayed the same

she gives me strength
when mines all gone
she always keeps me hanging on
when i feel ive lost my way
she leads me home
she dont know how much i need her
a beautiful believer

bridge
beautiful believer
every time i doubt myself
before i even ask for help
shes right there next to me
a beautiful believer
every night i close my eyes
just knowing that shes by my side
thats all i really need

chorus
she gives me strength
when mines all gone
she always keeps me hanging on
when i feel ive lost my way
she leads me home
she dont know how much i need her
a beautiful believer
she dont know how much i need her
a beautiful believerembed"
