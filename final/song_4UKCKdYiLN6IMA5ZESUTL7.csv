verse
steady tryin to maintain
same things thatll blow a bitch mind frame
my brain cant fathom what the hate say
he say she say how bout me say
get the visa headed to the islands asap
whats that on my shawty wrist thats a ap
im the type to save a bitch cape
feelin like et flyin out of the addy
fuckin on shawty she baddie casual convo then at it
i mean im better than better maybe im lyin
im sadder than most of yall with the money and the freedom nigga
what is money really worth if it aint love
ima find a perfect balance its gon take time
i heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
heard shawty in love through the grapevine
