in the darkest corner of the house i found her body there
cold and stiff spine in a twist
she left a note it read like so
my dearest one heres what youve done

chorus
ive got your knife inside my back
ive got your rope around my neck
i feel the poison in my veins
corrode and eat away my brain
ive told you fifteen dozen times
and thats one hundredeighty times
if i cant have you
then no one can

verse
she was an honest girl never told a lie
raised with the finest things far too rich to die
a silver spoon gold diamond rings
and her sainted mother the benefactor
of the inheritance that i was after
shes got a feeling that ill get even
and if i cant have you then no one can
whoa oh oh

ive got your knife inside my back
ive got your rope around my neck
i feel the poison in my veins
corrode and eat away my brain
ive told you fifteen dozen times
and thats one hundredeighty times
if i cant have you
then no one can6embed"
