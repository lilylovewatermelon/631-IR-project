verse 1 machine gun kelly
no license im still ridin
crashed into a tree and kept drivin
my label hates that im like this
i gotta go through shit to keep writin
all these girls i dont want none of them
but i know ill end up with one of them
my life on the outsides fun to them
but the person on the inside is crumblin
