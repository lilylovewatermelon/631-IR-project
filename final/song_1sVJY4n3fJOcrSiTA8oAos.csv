i never take a day off
work around the clock my engineer gettin paid off
rock like aesop light the weed and take off
so high i cannot see adolf
now i got these rappers all breakin up a sweat
cause every time i get up on the mic it come correct
and i learned it from the best always dressed in somethin fresh
lookin for a little dime big butt and nice chest
yes they heard i used to rock guess
but now im rockin clothes that aint in the stores yet
travel back in time im in a vortex
tryna make it work out think i need more reps
used to take a bus now the boy board jets
cause kids got me buzzin like a fuckin hornet
they say i got next tell them that i got now
its all disney boy my family proud
make em say ow make em say oh
the hoes that tell me yes the same ones that tell ya no
whoa i aint just an average joe way above the average flow
boy my life is most dope uh

chorus
no matter where life takes me find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy only laughin like a child
i never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesin from cheek to cheek ayy ayy
and i aint gonna wait for nothin
cause that just aint my style
life couldnt get better
this gon be the best day ever

if it aint about a dream then it aint about me
go a couple full weeks without a good nights sleep
imagination makin musical creation
the journey that im facin plus the paper that im chasin
got me crazy halfinsane and with the lames i see you hatin
but theres nothin that you changin thumbs up im maintainin
no complainin when its rainin ill be in another zone
move out my mothers home to a world i call my own
i aint gonna play around no more
find a difference from the ground and the floor
if we got a fight ill be down for the war
thumbs up homie ill be sure

chorus
no matter where life takes me find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy only laughin like a child
i never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesin from cheek to cheek ayy ayy
and i aint gonna wait for nothin
cause that just aint my style
life couldnt get better
this gon be the best day ever94embed"
