your aura separates the lines so i can drive on in
drive into your life but dont you worry
try not to hurry but dont forget to smell the roses
the flowers that i got for you to mend a wound inside
in a distant place where i can run with you all night
youre like the moonshine

chorus
moonshine stepping in front of my skyline
can i get a minute to figure it out figure why we had to fall apart
youre a moonshine stepping in front of my skyline
can i get a minute to figure it out figure why we had to fall apart

keep your composure dont let nobody inside the circle
that remains tragic somehow ancient and less abusive to you
but you know how to get through everything when theres problems surrounding
so many problems surrounding
im gonna mend a wound inside
in a distant place where i can run with you all night
youre the moonshine

chorus
moonshine stepping in front of my skyline
can i get a minute to figure it out figure why we had to fall apart
moonshine stepping in front of my skyline
can i get a minute to figure it out figure why we had to fall apart

moonshine stepping in front of my skyline
