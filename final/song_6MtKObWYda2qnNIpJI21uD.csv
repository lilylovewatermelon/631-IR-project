verse 1 kid cudi
crush a bit little bit roll it up take a hit
feelin lit feelin right 2 am summer night
i dont care hand on the wheel
driving drunk im doing my thing
rolling the midwest side and out
living my life getting out dreams
people told me slow my roll im screaming out fuck that
ima do just what i want looking ahead no turning back
if i fall if i die know i lived it to the fullest
if i fall if i die know i lived and missed some bullets

ill be good

everything that shine aint always gonna be gold hey

tell me what you know about dreamin dreamin

you dont really care about the trials of tomorrow
rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow
