that was you up on the mountain
all alone and all surrounded
walking on the ground youre breaking
laughing at the life youre wasting
one two tries wont do it
you do it all your life and you never get through it
everything they had to say
had been erased in just one day

chorus 1
good try we dont like it
good try we wont take that shit
oh i cant win

verse 2
things in bars that people do
when no one wants to talk to you
failing can be quite a breeze
he told me that these girls were easy
happy that you said youd mount me
felt unlucky when you found me
some nights come up empty handed
yes ill take it

chorus 2
wait now by the sidewalk
hold on yes ill be right back
oh i cant win
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus 3
yeah i wait for something
cool it we wont take that shit
good try we dont like it
hold on yes ill be right back13embed"
