id like to say that i was on your mind
so i phone you at ten past three in the afternoon
its evening for you and another bare hotel room
so hard to believe that youre dreaming of me too but its true

refrain
you only go around round round
you only go around round round
you only go around round round
you only go around round round

verse 2
but amsterdam i never knew you so well
the stadium rings with laughter at every turn
and flying pianos of all things to set your scene
im such a nice man to you but so obscene and its true girl

refrain
you only go around round round
you only go around round round
you only go around round round
you only go around round round

chorus
jackie big tits is hiding in the corner
respect is the word she shouts as i implore her
to speak to the man not me for i was only speaking freely
and interrupt me once more and ill take you to the cleaners
see the kooks liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likerefrain
you cant push me around round round
you cant push me around round round
you only go around round round
you only go around round round
