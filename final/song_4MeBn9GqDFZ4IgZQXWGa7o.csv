meet me on the equinox
meet me halfway
when the sun is perched at its highest peak
in the middle of the day
let me give my love to you
let me take your hand
and as we walk in the dimming light
oh darling understand

chorus
that everything everything ends
that everything everything ends

verse 2
meet me on your best behavior
or meet me at your worst
for there will be no stone unturned
or bubble left to burst
let me lay beside you darling
let me be your man
and let our bodies intertwine
but always understand

chorus
that everything everything ends
that everything everything ends
that everything everything
everything ends

a window
an opened tomb
the sun crawls
across your bedroom
a halo
a waiting moon
your last breaths
moving through you

chorus
as everything everything ends
as everything everything ends
as everything everything
everything everything
everything everything ends

verse 3
meet me on the equinox
meet me halfway
when the sun is perched at its highest peak
in the middle of the day
let me give my love to you
let me take your hand
and as we walk in the dimming light
oh darling understand
chorus
that everything everything ends4embed"
