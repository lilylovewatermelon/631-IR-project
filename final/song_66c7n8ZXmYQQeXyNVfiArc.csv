id like to tell you that my skys not blue its violent rain
and in my world the people on the street dont know my name
in my world im seven feet tall
and the boys always call and the girls do too
because in my world im constantly constantly havin a breakthrough hmm
or a breakdown or a blackout
would you make out with me underneath the shelter of the balcony

chorus
cause i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some

verse 2
wish i could see what its like to be the blood in my veins
do the insides of all of my fingers still look the same
and can you feel it too when i am touchin you
and when my hair stands on ends its saluting you
the blush in your cheeks says that you bleed like me
and the 808 beat sends your heart to your feet
left my shoes in the street so youd carry me
through a breakdown
through a breakdown or a blackout
would you make out with me on the floor of the mezzanine

cause i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some

bridge
my face is full of spiderwebs all tender yellow blue
and still with one eye open well all i see is you
i left my daydreams at the gate because i just cant take em too
know my heart still has a suitcase but i still cant take it through

chorus
i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
i dont need anyone i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some i just need everyone and then some

outro
i dont need anyone
i dont need anyone
i just need everyone and then some
ohmmm ohmmm yep29embed"
