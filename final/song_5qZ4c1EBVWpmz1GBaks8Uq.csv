kill everybody there
and im watching all the stars burn out
trying to pretend that i care
but i didnt no one ever does
and i would no one ever will
cant you see its all flown out of my hands
and our clothes are all too often ripped
and our teeth are all too often gnashed
and it lasts as long as it possibly can
but i just dont
but i just dont accept this
i just dont accept this at all
but i just dont
but i just dont accept this
i just dont accept this at all
and i just dont
and i just dont accept this
i just dont accept this at all
and i just dont
and i just dont accept this
i just dont accept this at all

what a glorious set of stairs we make
faces sweaty arms and legs
what a glorious set of stairs we make
faces sweaty arms and legs
what a glorious set of stairs we make
faces sweaty arms and legs
we kill everyone with
