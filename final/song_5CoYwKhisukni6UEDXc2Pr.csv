shes out of my life
and i dont know whether to laugh or cry
i dont know whether to live or die
and it cuts like a knife
shes out of my life

its out of my hands
its out of my hands
to think for two years she was here
and i took her for granted i was so cavalier
now the way that it stands
shes out of my hands

and so ive learned that love its not possession
and ive learned that love dont wait
now ive learned that love needs expression
but i learned too late

and shes out of my life
shes out of my life
damned indecision and cursed pride
i kept my love for her locked deep inside
and it cuts like a knife
shes out of my lifeyou might also likeembed"
