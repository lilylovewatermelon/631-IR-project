try not to kill yourself today
think of all that youd be missing
prescription made painkillers
count your blessings early before the lot will hit the gates
winnings for the lucky living just takes painkillers
living just comes with a bit of heartache
heartache comes with a bit of young faith
faith stays young till your heart get broken
hope grows up to become someday
i never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
i believe i believe i believe i believe
faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
i believe i believe i believe i believe
manna wont fall till the people all speak
i believe i believe i believe i believe
canaan aint far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief
my queen wont feed on milk and honey
she impartial to the summer sun
shes a lone fire burning in the sand
and a cold lonely night without one
she cocks her pistols fore she pops her collar
oh shes all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
shes rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
if all she ever does is smile at you run
you might also likewhatd ya need these for
round here the cries die young
fly momma fly to where you come
speak momma round here the quiet die young

very lovely morning
dont kill yourself today
think of all that youd be missing
and dont you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says youll ruin it
youll ruin this for everybody wont you

very lovely morning
try not to kill yourself today
think of all the things youll be missing
