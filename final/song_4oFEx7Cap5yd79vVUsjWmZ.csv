yeah oh yeah oh yeah

verse 1
i made the mark on february 1st
between me and you you can call it birth
the beginning of our universe
remind me of alicia keys verse

im falling for you
i wish i had an opportunity to not do
what i did to hurt you
and now im here living with regrets

i know that it was my fault
i know that i got caught
so please dont lose your thoughts
of me loving you and you loving me

im on the highway swerving
i aint drunk but im about to hit the curbn
looking at the calendar getting nervous
just a few more days to the first soul


this the day it all began
one place that it came together
more than a ring or a tattoo
wish your birthmark that reminds me of you
see akon liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likeso lets get on an airplane
go back to where we began
to that point which is days apart
that stamp right next to your heart

chorus
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart

to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart

verse 2
get the calendar go to august 3rd
first words stay we heard our first words
first argument gotta let it go
cause it could possibly affect what our future holds

flipping pages now famous
thinking back i aint seen you in ages
wishing that i coulda made it less painless
brings me back right back to the same as
i know that it was my fault
i know that i got caught
so please dont lose your thoughts
of me loving you and you loving me

im on the highway swerving
i aint drunk but im about to hit the curbn
looking at the calendar getting nervous
just a few more days to the first soul

this the day it all began
one place that it came together
more than a ring or a tattoo
wish your birthmark that reminds me of you

so lets get on an airplane
go back to where we began
to that point which is days apart
that stamp right next to your heart

to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart
to your heart to your heart

september october november trying to find a way
in december to mark my calendar to meet again

if only we can go to that place where me and you know
theres no faith fronting cheating even lying
the time has come where we stand face to face

this the day it all began
one place that it came together
more than a ring or a tattoo
wish your birthmark that reminds of you

so lets get on an airplane
go back to where we began
to that point which is days apart
that stamp right next to your heart
