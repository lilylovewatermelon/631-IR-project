dove in my front seat
windshield full of road to run
and a gas tank full of freedom

red sky faded to black
a couple cans deep in a six pack
world disappearing around us
temptation always found us

with beer on our breath in a parking lot
kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
radio glow on the dash
we were messin around
we could hardly breathe
breakin new ground in my back seat
we had our foot on the gas
goin nowhere fast

one summer of sunsets
was as far as we were gonna get
so caught up in how it feels
we didnt care if we were spinnin wheels

with beer on our breath in a parking lot
kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
radio glow on the dash
we were messin around
we could hardly breathe
breakin new ground in my back seat
we had our foot on the gas
goin nowhere fast
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeyeaahee

with beer on our breath in a parking lot
kill the headlights so we wouldnt get caught
here and gone in a flash
yeah
we were messin around
we could hardly breathe
breakin new ground in my back seat
no way to know if it would last
but we had our foot on the gas
goin nowhere fast
goin nowhere fast1embed"
