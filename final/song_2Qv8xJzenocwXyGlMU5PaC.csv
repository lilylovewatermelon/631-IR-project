soaked in the neon glows
silverforked tongues talking to you in the digital snow
a glitch in the chain a loop in the brain you wanted to break
but you still wanna play the game

chorus
well were not gonna be a commodity
not another maggot in the feed that youre gonna eat
motherfucker you can try
artificial suicide

verse 2
eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
lightin molotovs for the broken youth
can you hear me through the white noise friend
a cheers to the life you dont get to choose
another antichrist on the evening news
can you hear me through the white noise
can you hear me through the white noi—

chorus
were not gonna be a commodity
not another maggot in the feed that youre gonna eat
motherfucker you can try
artificial suicide
were not gonna be a commodity
not another maggot in the feed that youre gonna eat
motherfucker you can try
artificial suicide
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 3
you hate the shape when you have to see
an unfamiliar face on an allblack screen
can you hear me through the white noise friend
repeat the phrase they force you to read
if i wanna be great i dont wanna be me
can you hear me through the white noise
can you hear me through the white noise

breakdown
can you hear me
can you hear me through the white noise

chorus
were not gonna be a commodity
not another maggot in the feed that youre gonna eat
motherfucker you can try
artificial suicide
were not gonna be a commodity
not another maggot in the feed that youre gonna eat
motherfucker you can try
artificial suicide

outro
can you hear me through the white noi—7embed"
