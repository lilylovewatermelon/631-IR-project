plowin these fields in the hot summer sun
over by the gate lordy here she comes
with a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
i make a little room and she climbs on up
open up a throttle and stir a little dust
just look at her face she ain’t a foolin me

chorus
she thinks my tractors sexy
it really turns her on
shes always starin at me
while im chuggin along
she likes the way its pullin while were tillin up her land
shes even kinda crazy bout my farmers tan
shes the only one who really understands what gets me
she thinks my tractors sexy

verse 2
we ride back and forth til we run out of light
take it to the barn put it up for the night
climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
she said shes got a dream and i ask what it is
she wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
and one more teeny weenie ride before i take her home
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likechorus
she thinks my tractors sexy
it really turns her on
shes always starin at me
while im chuggin along
she likes the way its pullin while were tillin up the land
shes even kinda crazy bout my farmers tan
shes the only one who really understands what gets me
she thinks my tractors sexy

bridge
well she ain’t into cars or pickup trucks
but if it runs like a deere man her eyes light up

chorus
she thinks my tractor
she thinks my tractors sexy
it really turns her on
shes always starin at me
while im chuggin along
she likes the way its pullin while were tilling up her land
shes even kinda crazy bout my farmers tan
shes the only one who really understands what gets me
she thinks my tractors sexy
she thinks my tractors sexy
she thinks my tractors sexy1embed"
