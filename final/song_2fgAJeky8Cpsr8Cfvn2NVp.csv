so i met this young lady ya know when i went back home i was tryna spit my best game to her you know give her my best cap but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps i said you know what girl you crazy then she asked me what he said
verse 1 kendrick lamar  mani strings
what did the asian say a peace of mind
thats what the asian said—i need a divine
intervention was his religion and i was surprised
him believing in buddha me believing in god
asked him what are you doing he said taking my time
meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
see you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
worried about your career you ever think of your health
verse 2 kendrick lamar  mani strings
what did the indian say a piece of land
thats what the indian said—i needed the man
telling me longevity is in the dirt
should buy some property first
should profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best really you should invest
these tangible things expire dont you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage we blessed
verse 3 kendrick lamar  mani strings
now what the black man say a piece of pussy
thats what the black man said i needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
we do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
we like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
what you saying to me
he said nigga come back to reality for a week
pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
i wouldnt be prouder you should allow it
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likeverse 4 kendrick lamar  mani strings
what the white man say a piece of mines
thats what the white man wanted when i rhyme
telling me that he selling me just for 1099
if i go platinum from rapping i do the company fine
what if i compromise he said it dont even matter
you make a million or more you living better than average
you losing your core following gaining it all
he put a price on my talent i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
look at what you accomplishing what he said to the boy
ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist if i dont target your market
if you aint signing your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
your world tour your masters mortgage i need a piece
chorus bilal
i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today
i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today
saxophone interlude terrace martin
outro
what the black man say
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
