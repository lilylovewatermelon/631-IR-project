took a chance
rolled the dice on me and you
opened up let you in my world
like a dance started slow and then love took control
swept away so proud to be your girl
but when you write a story much too fast
sometimes a happy ending doesnt last

chorus
now i know that love aint meant to be a play thing
now i know its not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when its right its so amazing
but when its wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know

verse 2
remember when we said our love would last forever
but then again how are we to know
there comes a time that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn
but therell always be a first time you get burned
