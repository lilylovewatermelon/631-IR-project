couldve given me something
you my everything

verse 1
you were my backbone when
my body ached with weariness
and you were my hometown when
my heart was filled with loneliness
and just as the dark was rising
i heard you close the door again
and just as the light turns off
i know who i dream of

chorus
couldve given me something
you my everything
you left me kneeling ah
im just one of those people
you my everything
you my everything
you my everything

holding me under this time

you left me kneeling ah
and im just one of those people
