ive missed your calls for months it seems
dont realize how mean i can be
cause i can sometimes treat the people
that i love like jewelry
cause i can change my mind each day
i didnt mean to try you on
but i still know your birthday
and your mothers favorite song

chorus
so im sorry to my unknown lover
sorry that i cant believe
that anybody ever really
starts to fall in love with me
sorry to my unknown lover
sorry i could be so blind
didnt mean to leave you
and all of the things that we had behind
ooh ooh oooh

verse 2
i run away when things are good
and never really understood
the way you laid your eyes on me
in ways that no one ever could
and so it seems i broke your heart
my ignorance has struck again
i failed to see it from the start
and tore you open til the end
you might also likechorus
and im sorry to my unknown lover
sorry that i cant believe
that anybody ever really
starts to fall in love with me
sorry to my unknown lover
sorry i could be so blind
didnt mean to leave you
and all of the things that we had behind

bridge
and someone will love you
someone will love you
someone will love you
but someone isnt me
someone will love you
someone will love you
someone will love you
but someone isnt me

chorus
sorry to my unknown lover
sorry that i cant believe
that anybody ever really
starts to fall in love with me
sorry to my unknown lover
sorry i could be so blind
didnt mean to leave you
and all of the things that we had behind
outro
and someone will love you
someone will love you
someone will love you
but someone isnt me
and someone will love you
someone will love you
someone will love you
but someone isnt me104embed"
