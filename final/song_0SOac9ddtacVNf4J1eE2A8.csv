i never was able to say
just how i was feeling
can we see the endless stake
and this path im leaving

bridge
do you really wanna know
do you really

chorus
i feel lost
feel boring
ive been caught
sleeping all morning

verse 2
pull down the shades
rather stay inside all day
my own thoughts are in my way
rather sleep than have to stay

chorus
i feel lost
feel boring
ive been caught
sleeping all morning
i feel scared
of knowing
im just a single leaf
in the wind blowing
