close enough to start a war
all that i have is on the floor
god only knows what were fighting for
all that i say you always say more

prechorus
i cant keep up with your turning tables
under your thumb i cant breathe

chorus
so i wont let you close enough to hurt me
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
i cant give you the heart you think you gave me
its time to say goodbye to turning tables
to turning tables

verse 2
under haunted skies i see you ooh
where love is lost your ghost is found
i braved a hundred storms to leave you
as hard as you try no i will never be knocked down

prechorus
i cant keep up with your turning tables
under your thumb i cant breathe

so i wont let you close enough to hurt me
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
i cant give you the heart you think you gave me
its time to say goodbye to turning tables
turning tables

next time ill be braver
ill be my own saviour
when the thunder calls for me
next time ill be braver
ill be my own saviour
standing on my own two feet

chorus
i wont let you close enough to hurt me
no i wont rescue you to just desert me
i cant give you the heart you think you gave me
its time to say goodbye to turning tables
to turning tables
