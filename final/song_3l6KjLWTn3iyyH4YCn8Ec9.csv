take it from an old man
time’s just sand slippin past
we wanna hold it in our hands
but no one ever sees what falls through the cracks
take it from an old man
my mistakes have made me
and i am what i am
and though i don’t believe in silver linings

all
oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

joe
i believe that there’s something in you

all
i believe in you

joe
something good is tryin’ to break through

all
through

joe
you might have to fight the good fight
and when you think you can’t
you might also likejoe  all
you can

joe
take it from an old man
take it from an old man
the days don’t stretch any longer

joe  all
they’ve left tracks upon my skin

joe
but i reckon made me stronger

joe  all
but i believe there’s something in you
something you should be seeing too
bet it all on yourself at least one time

joe
cause honey win or lose

all
win or lose

joe  all
it’s one hell of a ride
becky
it’s one hell of a ride

joe
and if you lack the strength of your own
honey hold out your hands and take it from an old manembed"
