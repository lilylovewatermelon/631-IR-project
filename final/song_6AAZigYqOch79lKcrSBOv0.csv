shes sticking needles in her skin i turn with an ugly grin
her canvas doesnt leave a lot to fantasy
but her peace of mind cant stay inside the lines
its so confusing the methods that shes using
she knows she shouldnt leave a mark that i can see
will she ever find one million of a kind
its cold and lonely but thats because she told me
lost inside her dirty world no one hurts this pretty girl but her

prechorus
oh shes beautiful
a little better than a man deserves
oh im not insane
please tell me she wont change

chorus
maybe i should let her go
but only when she loves me she loves me
how can i just let her go
not until she loves me she loves me oh

verse 2
shes drowning in herself again my god what a lovely sin
i guess theres nothing left to do but have my way
she can feel its right so she doesnt close her eyes
she smiles and answers it doesnt seem to matter
lost inside my dirty head something tells me im the one whos kept

oh so volatile
a little better than a man defiled
oh i need the pain
please tell me she wont change

chorus
maybe i should let her go
but only when she loves me she loves me
how can i just let her go
not until she loves me she loves me oh
