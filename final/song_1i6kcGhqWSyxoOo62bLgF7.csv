hold on just a little bit longer
keep the faith and let your love be stronger
hold on like a promised you
cause ill be coming back to you

i heard just the other day
that since weve
since weve been apart
someone is making a play
darling to steal your heart
but i say

hold on just a little bit longer
keep the faith
and let your love be stronger
hold on like a promised you
cause ill be coming back to you

his arms oh his arms may be so tempting
but darling remember remember so am i
so be strong and think of me only
and forget about that other guy
all i want you to do for me is

hold on just a little bit longer
keep the faith and let your love be stronger
hold on like a promised you
cause ill be coming back to you
