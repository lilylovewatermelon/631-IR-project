till death do us part
is what she told that preacher man
now she says this aint worth dying for
shes had all she cant stand
shes boxed up mommas china
its loaded on the truck
shes just got started packing
and im thinking this could suck

verse 2
now there goes my layz boy
and my flat top guitar
here comes her big sister
whats she doing in my car
as they drive off to the city
i just waved
from the top of my lungs
i hope she heard me say

chorus
you aint leaving thank god are ya
you cant be gone fast enough
what seemed to take a lifetime
just left in a cloud of dust
thisll make my girlfriend happy
shes the one that never thought you would
you aint leaving thank god are ya
let us pray youre gone for good
you might also likeverse 3
she forgot her new laptop
so i know shell be back
ill have a hot tub full of hotties
icing down a 24pack
shell cuss me like a sailor
but i dont care
ill have a few choice words
when i come up for air

chorus
you aint leaving thank god are ya
you cant be gone fast enough
and what seemed to take a lifetime
just left in a cloud of dust
thisll make my girlfriend happy
shes the one that never thought you would
you aint leaving thank god are ya
let us pray youre gone for good

outro
you aint leaving thank god are ya
let us pray youre gone for good
adiosembed"
