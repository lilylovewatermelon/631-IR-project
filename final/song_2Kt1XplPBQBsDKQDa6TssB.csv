she planned ahead for a year he said lets play it by ear
she didnt want him to run he didnt want her to fear
nobody said itd be easy they knew it was rough
but tough luck

prechorus
i fell in love today there arent any words that you can say
that could ever get my mind to change
shes enough for me shes in love with me

chorus
youre a doll you are flawless
but i just cant wait for love to destroy us
i just cant wait for love
the only flaw you are flawless
but i just cant wait for love to destroy us
i just cant wait for love

so she put his heart in a bag he wouldnt ask for it back
he didnt want her to cry she didnt want to be sad

this shitll be fucked for days and weeks and months but

prechorus
i fell in love today there arent any words that you can say
