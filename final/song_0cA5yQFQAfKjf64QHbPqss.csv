early mornin without warnin woke me with a scare
i had that dream again
that the sun was dead
make me warm or take me home its so cold in here
cant we meet somewhere
is it winter there is it winter there
this winter

chorus
meet me in the summertime we can move the air
sweet virginia countryside i will meet you there
bloody lips and cherry wine moonshine in your hair
just keep starin at the sun pray for summers end

verse 2
come on over brave my storm oceans overhead
come inside my friend
gettin bad out there
every moment we have stolen all we had to share
no one wanted them
but you know i did you know i did
this moment

chorus
meet me in the summertime we can move the air
sweet virginia countryside i will meet you there
bloody lips and cherry wine moonshine in your hair
just keep starin at the sun pray for summers end
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeguitar solo

chorus
meet me in the summertime we can move the air
sweet virginia countryside i will meet you there
bloody lips and cherry wine moonshine in your hair
just keep starin at the sun pray for summers end

outro
meet me in the summertime
meet me in the summertime
meet me in the summertime we can move the air
meet me in the summertime i will meet you there4embed"
