baby why dont we just turn that tv off
three hundred fifteen channels
of nothing but bad news on
well it might be me but the way i see it
the whole wide world has gone crazy
so baby why dont we just dance

verse 2
guess the little bitty living room aint going to look like much
when the lights go down and we move the couch
its going to be more than enough
for my two left feet and our two hearts beating
nobodys going to see us go crazy
so baby why dont we just dance

chorus
down the hall maybe straight up the stairs
bouncing off the wall floating on air
baby why dont we just dance

verse 3
baby why dont you go put your best dress on
those high heeled shoes you love to lose
as soon as the tunes come on
on second thought just the way you are
is already driving me crazy
so baby why dont we just dance
see josh turner liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likechorus
down the hall maybe straight up the stairs
bouncing off the wall floating on air
baby why dont we just dance
ill cut a rug

outro
well it might be me but the way i see it
the whole wide world has gone crazy
so baby why dont we just dance
oh baby why dont we just dance2embed"
