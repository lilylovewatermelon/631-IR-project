you almost made me cry again this time
another false alarm red flashing lights
well this time im not going watch myself die
i think i made it a game to play your game and let myself cry
buried myself alive on the inside so i could shut you out
and let you go away for a long timeâ€¦ god

i guess its okay i puked the day away
i guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way
and if you want me back youre gonna have to ask
i think the chain broke away and i felt it the day
that i had my own time
i took advantage of myself and felt fine
but it was worth the night i caught an early flight
and i made it home

i guess its okay i puked the day away
i guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way
and if you want me back youre gonna have to ask
nicer than that nicer than that
my foot on your neck i finally have you
right where i want you right where i want you
right where i want you right where i want you
you might also likei guess its okay i puked the day away
i guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way
and if you want me back youre gonna have to ask
nicer than that
i guess its okay i puked the day away
nicer than that
i guess its better you trapped yourself in your own way
and if you want me back youre gonna have to ask
nicer than that nicer nicer5embed"
