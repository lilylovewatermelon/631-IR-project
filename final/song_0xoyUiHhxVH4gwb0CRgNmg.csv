look into my face then look again
we are not the same were different
to tell your tales and fables
you couldnt wait
you need a new clean slate without the dents
a place to put your pain your consequence
when you look into the mirror
are you even there

chorus
i dont wanna know all your secrets cause ill tell
its hard enough being alone with myself
i dont know how long ill be holding on
i know you tried your hardest i know that you meant it well
but you pushed me to the edge and i slipped and then i fell
i dont know how long ill be holding on

verse 2
so write a brandnew page then write again
i know your act is staged yet you pretend
all while youre turnin tables
with missing legs
i think youve overstayed your welcome in
so go the fuck away dont come again
ill see your face in the fire
and burn it out
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus

i know you tried your hardest i know that you meant it well
but you pushed me to the edge and i slipped and then i fell
i dont know how long ill be holding on

i didnt need it it needed me
