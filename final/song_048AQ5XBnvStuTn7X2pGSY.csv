thats a frosty way to speak
to tell me how to live next to your potpourri
all this talking pulls my teeth
i believed in you so youd believe in

chorus
me i cried out god
you dared me in the dark
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now i hide in piles
of princely orange peels
it feels the way you told me
how itd always feel

verse 2
once i had a name to claim
i scraped on all the walls
like an orthodox saint
i wish for the same old things
that turned me inside out
keeling in such pain
its a game

chorus
me i cried out god
you dared me in the dark
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now i hide in piles
of princely orange peels
it feels the way you told me
how itd always feel

never have i ever been
clutching at your hair
to cure you of some sin
but thats the kind of state im in
swimming in a pool of godly medicine

outro
come come hear it calling me yelling like
if ever there was someone who could make things
heavenly again
feel alright

chorus
me i cried out god
you dared me in the dark
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now i hide in piles
of princely orange peels
it feels the way you told me
how itd always feel

chorus
me i cried out god
you dared me in the dark
i felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
so now i hide in piles
of princely orange peels
it feels the way you told me
how itd always feel4embed"
