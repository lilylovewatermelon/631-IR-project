oohooh ooh
oohoohoohooh

verse 1
i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
i will not break the way you did you fell so hard
ive learned the hard way to never let it get that far

chorus
because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i dont get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
because of you i am afraid

verse 2
i lose my way
and its not too long before you point it out
i cannot cry
because i know thats weakness in your eyes
im forced to fake a smile a laugh every day of my life
my heart cant possibly break
when it wasnt even whole to start with

because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i dont get hurt
because of you
i find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
because of you
i am afraid

bridge
i watched you die i heard you cry every night in your sleep
i watched you die in your sleep
i was so young you should have known better than to lean on me
i was too young for you to lean on me
you never thought of anyone else you just saw your pain
you never saw me yeah yeah
and now i cry in the middle of the night
for the same damn thing

chorus
because of you
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
because of you
i learned to play on the safe side so i dont get hurt
because of you
i try my hardest just to forget everything
because of you
i dont know how to let anyone else in
because of you
im ashamed of my life because its empty
because of you
i am afraid
outro
because of you ahah ah ah
