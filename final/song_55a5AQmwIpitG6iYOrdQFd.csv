in the course of that war there developed in the united states the greatest antiwar movement the nation had ever experienced a movement that played a critical part in bringing the war to an end

it was another startling fact of the sixties

in the fall of 1945 japan defeated was forced to leave indochina the former french colony it had occupied at the start of the war in the meantime a revolutionary movement had grown there determined to end colonial control and to achieve a new life for the peasants of indochina led by a communist named ho chi minh the revolutionists fought against the japanese and when they were gone held a spectacular celebration in hanoi in late 1945 with a million people in the streets and issued a declaration of independence it borrowed from the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen in the french revolution and from the american declaration of independence and began all men are created equal they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness just as the americans in 1776 had listed their grievances against the english king the vietnamese listed their complaints against french rule

they have enforced inhuman laws they have built more prisons than schools they have mercilessly slain our patriots they have drowned uprisings in rivers of blood they have fettered public opinion they have robbed us of our rice fields our mines our forests and our raw materials 

they have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people especially our peasantry to a state of extreme poverty 

from the end of last year to the beginning of this year    more than two million of our fellowcitizens died of starvation  

the whole vietnamese people animated by a common purpose are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the french colonialists to reconquer their country

the us defense department study of the vietnam war intended to be top secret but released to the public by daniel ellsberg and anthony russo in the famous pentagon papers case described ho chi minhs work

  ho had built the viet minh into the only vietnamwide political organization capable of effective resistance to either the japanese or the french he was the only vietnamese wartime leader with a national following and he assured himself wider fealty among the vietnamese people when in augustseptember 1945 he overthrew the japanese   established the democratic republic of vietnam and staged receptions for incoming allied occupation forces  for a few weeks in september 1945 vietnam was—for the first and only time in its modern history—free of foreign domination and united from north to south under ho chi minh  

the western powers were already at work to change this england occupied the southern part of indochina and then turned it back to the french nationalist china this was under chiang kai shek before the communist revolution occupied the northern part of indochina and the united states persuaded it to turn that back to the french as ho chi minh told an american journalist we apparently stand quite alone  we shall have to depend on ourselves

between october 1945 and february 1946 ho chi minh wrote eight letters to president truman reminding him of the selfdetermination promises of the atlantic charter one of the letters was sent both to truman and to the united nations

i wish to invite attention of your excellency for strictly humanitarian reasons to following matter two million vietnamese died of starvation during winter of 1944 and spring 1945 because of starvation policy of french who seized and stored until it controlled all available rice  three fourths of cultivated land was flooded in summer 1945 which was followed by a severe drought of normal harvest fivesixths was lost  many people are starving   unless great world powers and international relief organizations bring us immediate assistance we face imminent catastrophe
truman never replied

in october of 1946 the french bombarded haiphong a port in northern vietnam and there began the eightyear war between the vietminh movement and the french over who would rule vietnam after the communist victory in china in 1949 and the korean war the following year the united states began giving large amounts of military aid to the french by 1954 the united states had given 300000 small arms and machine guns enough to equip the entire french army in indochina and 1 billion all together the us was financing 80 percent of the french war effort

why was the united states doing this to the public the word was that the united states was helping to stop communism in asia but there was not much public discussion in the secret memoranda of the national security council which advised the president on foreign policy there was talk in 1950 of what came to be known as the domino theory—that like a row of dominoes if one country fell to communism the next one would do the same and so on it was important therefore to keep the first one from falling

a secret memo of the national security council in june 1952 also pointed to the chain of us military bases along the coast of china the philippines taiwan japan south korea

communist control of all of southeast asia would render the us position in the pacific offshore island chain precarious and would seriously jeopardize fundamental us security interests in the far east

and

southeast asia especially malaya and indonesia is the principal world source of natural rubber and tin and a producer of petroleum and other strategically important commodities 

it was also noted that japan depended on the rice of southeast asia and communist victory there would make it extremely difficult to prevent japans eventual accommodation to communism

in 1953 a congressional study mission reported the area of indochina is immensely wealthy in rice rubber coal and iron ore its position makes it a strategic key to the rest of southeast asia that year a state department memorandum said that the french were losing the war in indochina had failed to win a sufficient native support feared that a negotiated settlement would mean the eventual loss to communism not only of indochina but of the whole of southeast asia and concluded if the french actually decided to withdraw the us would have to consider most seriously whether to take over in this area

in 1954 the french having been unable to win vietnamese popular support which was overwhelmingly behind ho chi minh and the revolutionary movement had to withdraw

an international assemblage at geneva presided over the peace agreement between the french and the vietminh it was agreed that the french would temporarily withdraw into the southern part of vietnam that the vietminh would remain in the north and that an election would take place in two years in a unified vietnam to enable the vietnamese to choose their own government

the united states moved quickly to prevent the unification and to establish south vietnam as an american sphere it set up in saigon as head of the government a former vietnamese official named ngo dinh diem who had recently been living in new jersey and encouraged him not to hold the scheduled elections for unification a memo in early 1954 of the joint chiefs of staff said that intelligence estimates showed a settlement based on free elections would be attended by almost certain loss of the associated states laos cambodia and vietnamthe three parts of indochina created by the geneva conference to communist control diem again and again blocked the elections requested by the vietminh and with american money and arms his government became more and more firmly established as the pentagon papers put it south viet nam was essentially the creation of the united states

the diem regime became increasingly unpopular diem was a catholic and most vietnamese were buddhists diem was close to the landlords and this was a country of peasants his pretenses at land reform left things basically as they were he replaced locally selected provincial chiefs with his own men appointed in saigon by 1962 88 percent of these provincial chiefs were military men diem imprisoned more and more vietnamese who criticized the regime for corruption for lack of reform
opposition grew quickly in the countryside where diems apparatus could not reach well and around 1958 guerrilla activities began against the regime the communist regime in hanoi gave aid encouragement and sent people southmost of them southerners who had gone north after the geneva accordsto support the guerrilla movement in 1960 the national liberation front was formed in the south it united the various strands of opposition to the regime its strength came from south vietnamese peasants who saw it as a way of changing their daily lives a us government analyst named douglas pike in his book viet cong based on interviews with rebels and captured documents tried to give a realistic assessment of what the united states faced

in the 2561 villages of south vietnam the national liberation front created a host of nationwide sociopolitical organizations in a country where mass organizations   were virtually nonexistent aside from the nlf there had never been a truly massbased political party in south vietnam

pike wrote the communists have brought to the villages of south vietnam significant social change and have done so largely by means of the communication process that is they were organizers much more than they were warriors what struck me most forcibly about the nlf was its totality as a social revolution first and as a war second pike was impressed with the mass involvement of the peasants in the movement the rural vietnamese was not regarded simply as a pawn in a power struggle but as the active element in the thrust he was the thrust pike wrote

the purpose of this vast organizational effort was  to restructure the social order of the village and train the villages to control themselves this was the nlfs one undeviating thrust from the start not the killing of arvn saigon soldiers not the occupation of real estate not the preparation for some great pitched battle but organization in depth of the rural population through the instrument of selfcontrol

pike estimated that the nlf membership by early 1962 stood at around 300000 the pentagon papers said of this period only the viet cong had any real support and influence on a broad base in the countryside

when kennedy took office in early 1961 he continued the policies of truman and eisenhower in southeast asia almost immediately he approved a secret plan for various military actions in vietnam and laos including the dispatch of agents to north vietnam to engage in sabotage and light harassment according to the pentagon papers back in 1956 he had spoken of the amazing success of president diem and said of diems vietnam her political liberty is an inspiration

one day in june 1963 a buddhist monk sat down in the public square in saigon and set himself afire more buddhist monks began committing suicide by fire to dramatize their opposition to the diem regime diems police raided the buddhist pagodas and temples wounded thirty monks arrested 1400 people  and closed down the pagodas there were demonstrations in the city the police fired killing nine people  then in hue the ancient capital ten thousand demonstrated in protest

under the geneva accords the united states was permitted to have 685 military advisers in southern vietnam eisenhower secretly sent several thousand under kennedy the figure rose to sixteen thousand and some of them began to take part in combat operations diem was losing most of the south vietnam countryside was now controlled by local villagers organized by the nlf

diem was becoming an embarrassment an obstacle to effective control over vietnam some vietnamese generals began plotting to overthrow his regime staying in touch with a cta man named lucien conein conein met secretly with american ambassador henry cabot lodge who was enthusiastically for the coup lodge reported to kennedys assistant mcgeorge bundy on october 25 pentagon papers i have personally approved each meeting between general iran van don and conein who has carried out my orders in each instance explicitly kennedy seemed hesitant but no move was made to warn diem indeed just before the coup and just after he had been in touch through conein with the plotters lodge spent a weekend with diem at a seaside resort when on november 1 1963 the generals attacked the presidential palace diem phoned ambassador lodge and the conversation went as follows

diem some units have made a rebellion and i want to know what is the attitude of the united states
lodge i do not feel well enough informed to be able to tell you i have heard the shooting but am not acquainted with all of the facts also it is 430 am in washington and the us government cannot possibly have a view
diem but you must have some general ideas  

lodge told diem to phone him if he could do anything for his physical safety

that was the last conversation any american had with diem he fled the palace but he and his brother were apprehended by the plotters taken out in a truck and executed
earlier in 1963 kennedys undersecretary of state u alexis johnson was speaking before the economic club of detroit

what is the attraction that southeast asia has exerted for centuries on the great powers flanking it on all sides why is it desirable and why is it important first it provides a lush climate fertile soil rich natural resources a relatively sparse population in most areas and room to expand the countries of southeast asia produce rich exportable surpluses such as rice rubber teak corn tin spices oil and many others 

this is not the language that was used by president kennedy in his explanations to the american public he talked of communism and freedom in a news conference february 14 1962 he said yes as you know the us for more than a decade has been assisting the government the people of vietnam to maintain their independence

three weeks after the execution of diem kennedy himself was assassinated and his vice president lyndon johnson took office

the generals who succeeded diem could not suppress the national liberation front again and again american leaders expressed their bewilderment at the popularity of the nlf at the high morale of its soldiers the pentagon historians wrote that when eisenhower met with president elect kennedy in january 1961 he wondered aloud why in interventions of this kind we always seemed to find that the morale of the communist forces was better than that of the democratic forces and general maxwell taylor reported in late 1964

the ability of the vietcong continuously to rebuild their units and to make good their losses is one of the mysteries of the guerrilla war  not only do the vietcong units have the recuperative powers of the phoenix but they have an amazing ability to maintain morale only in rare cases have we found evidences of had morale among vietcong prisoners or recorded in captured viet cong documents

in early august 1964 president johnson used a murky set of events in the gulf of tonkin off the coast of north vietnam to launch fullscale war on vietnam johnson and secretary of defense robert mcnamara told the american public there was an attack by north vietnamese torpedo boats on american destroyers while on routine patrol in international waters mcnamara said the us destroyer maddox underwent an unprovoked attack it later turned out that the gulf of tonkin episode was a fake that the highest american officials had lied to the publicjust as they had in the invasion of cuba under kennedy in fact the cia had engaged in a secret operation attacking north vietnamese coastal installations—so if there had been an attack it would not have been unprovoked it was not a routine patrol because the maddox was on a special electronic spying mission and it was not in international waters but in vietnamese territorial waters it turned out that no torpedoes were fired at the maddox as mcnamara said another reported attack on another destroyer two nights later which johnson called open aggression on the high seas seems also to have been an invention

at the time of the incident secretary of state rusk was questioned on nbc television

reporter what explanation then can you come up with for this unprovoked attack
rusk well i havent been able quite frankly to come to a fully satisfactory explanation there is a great gulf of understanding between that world and our world ideological in character they see what we think of as the real world in wholly different terms their very processes of logic are different so that its very difficult to enter into each others minds across that great ideological gulf

the tonkin attack brought a congressional resolution passed unanimously in the house and with only two dissenting votes in the senate giving johnson the power to take military action as he saw fit in southeast asia

two months before the gulf of tonkin incident us government leaders met in honolulu and discussed such a resolution rusk said in this meeting according to the pentagon papers that public opinion on our southeast asia policy was badly divided in the united states at the moment and that therefore the president needed an affirmation of support

the tonkin resolution gave the president the power to initiate hostilities without the declaration of war by congress that the constitution required the supreme court supposed to be the watchdog of the constitution was asked by a number of petitioners in the course of the vietnam war to declare the war unconstitutional again and again it refused even to consider the issue

immediately after the tonkin affair american warplanes began bombarding north vietnam during 1965 over 200000 american soldiers were sent to south vietnam and in 1966 200000 more by early 1968 there were more than 500000 american troops there and the us air force was dropping bombs at a rate unequaled in history  tiny glimmerings of the massive human suffering under this bombardment came to the outside world on june 5 1965 the new york times carried a dispatch from saigon

as the communists withdrew from quangngai last monday united states jet bombers pounded the hills into which they were headed many vietnamese—one estimate is as high as 500—were killed by the strikes the american contention is that they were vietcong soldiers but three out of four patients seeking treatment in a vietnamese hospital afterward for burns from napalm or jellied gasoline were village women

on september 6 another press dispatch from saigon

in bien hoa province south of saigon on august 15 united states aircraft accidentally bombed a buddhist pagoda and a catholic church  it was the third time their pagoda had been bombed in 1965 a temple of the cao dai religious sect in the same area had been bombed twice this year

in another delta province there is a woman who has both arms burned off by napalm and her eyelids so badly burned that she cannot close them when it is time for her to sleep her family puts a blanket over her head the woman had two of her children killed in the air strike that maimed her

few americans appreciate what their nation is doing to south vietnam with airpower    innocent civilians are dying every day in south vietnam

large areas of south vietnam were declared free fire zones which meant that all persons remaining within themcivilians old people  children—were considered an enemy and bombs were dropped at will villages suspected of harboring viet cong were subject to search and destroy missions—men of military age in the villages were killed the homes were burned the women children and old people were sent off to refugee camps jonathan schell in his book the village of ben suc describes such an operation a village surrounded attacked a man riding on a bicycle shot down three people picnicking by the river shot to death the houses destroyed the women children old people herded together taken away from their ancestral homes

the cia in vietnam in a program called operation phoenix secretly without trial executed at least twenty thousand civilians in south vietnam who were suspected of being members of the communist underground a proadministration analyst wrote in the journal foreign affairs in january 1975 although the phoenix program did undoubtedly kill or incarcerate many innocent civilians it did also eliminate many members of the communist infrastructure

after the war the release of records of the international red cross showed that in south vietnamese prison camps where at the height of the war 65000 to 70000 people were held and often beaten and tortured american advisers observed and sometimes participated the red cross observers found continuing systematic brutality at the two principal vietnamese pow camps—at phu quoc and qui nhon where american advisers were stationed

by the end of the vietnam war 7 million tons of bombs had been dropped on vietnam more than twice the total bombs dropped on europe and asia in world war ii—almost one 500pound bomb for every human being in vietnam it was estimated that there were 20 million bomb craters in the country in addition poisonous sprays were dropped by planes to destroy trees and any kind of growth—an area the size of the state of massachusetts was covered with such poison vietnamese mothers reported birth defects in their children yale biologists using the same poison 245t on mice reported defective mice born and said they had no reason to believe the effect on humans was different

on march 16 1968 a company of american soldiers went into the hamlet of my lai 4 in quang ngai province they rounded up the inhabitants including old people and women with infants in their arms these people were ordered into a ditch where they were methodically shot to death by american soldiers the testimony of james dursi a rifleman at the later trial of lieutenant william calley was reported in the new york times

lieutenant calley and a weeping rifleman named paul d meadlo—the same soldier who had fed candy to the children before shooting them—pushed the prisoners into the ditch

there was an order to shoot by lieutenant calley i cant remember the exact wordsit was something like start firing

meadlo turned to me and said shoot why dont you shoot

i was crying i said i cant i wont

then lieutenant calley and meadlo pointed their rifles into the ditch and fired

people were diving on top of each other mothers were trying to protect their children  

journalist seymour hersh in his book my lai 4 writes

when army investigators reached the barren area in november 1969 in connection with the my lai probe in the united states they found mass graves at three sites as well as a ditch full of bodies it was estimated that between 450 and 500 people most of them women children and old menhad been slain and buried there

the army tried to cover up what happened but a letter began circulating from a gi named ron ridenhour who had heard about the massacre there were photos taken of the killing by an army photographer ronald haeberle seymour hersh then working for an antiwar news agency in southeast asia called dispatch news service wrote about it the story of the massacre had appeared in may 196b in two french publications one called sud vietnam en lutte and another published by the north vietnamese delegation to the peace talks in parisbut the american press did not pay any attention

several of the officers in the my lai massacre were put on trial but only lieutenant william calley was found guilty he was sentenced to life imprisonment but his sentence was reduced twice he served three yearsnixon ordered that he be under house arrest rather than a regular prisonand then was paroled thousands of americans came to his defense part of it was in patriotic justification of his action as necessary against the communists part of it seems to have been a feeling that he was unjustly singled out in a war with many similar atrocities colonel oran henderson who had been charged with covering up the my lai killings told reporters in early 1971 every unit of brigade size has its my lai hidden someplace

indeed my lai was unique only in its details hersh reported a letter sent by a gi to his family and published in a local newspaper

dear mom and dad

today we went on a mission and i am not very proud of myself my friends or my country we burned every hut in sight

it was a small rural network of villages and the people were incredibly poor my unit burned and plundered their meager possessions let me try to explain the situation to you

the huts here are thatched palm leaves each one has a dried mud bunker inside these bunkers are to protect the families kind of like air raid shelters

my unit commanders however chose to think that these bunkers are offensive so every hut we find that has a bunker we are ordered to burn to the ground

when the ten helicopters landed this morning in the midst of these huts and six men jumped out of each chopper we were firing the moment we hit the ground we fired into all the huts we could

it is then that we burned these huts    everyone is crying begging and praying that we dont separate them and take their husbands and fathers sons and grandfathers the women wail and moan

then they watch in terror as we burn their homes personal possessions and food yes we burn all rice and shoot all livestock

the more unpopular became the saigon government the more desperate the military effort became to make up for this a secret congressional report of late 1967 said the viet gong were distributing about five times more land to the peasants than the south vietnamese government whose land distribution program had come to a virtual standstill the report said the viet cong have eliminated landlord domination and reallocated lands owned by absentee landlords and the gvn government of viet nam to the landless and others who cooperate with viet cong authorities

the unpopularity of the saigon government explains the success of the national liberation front in infiltrating saigon and other governmentheld towns in early 1968 without the people there warning the government the nlf thus launched a surprise offensive it was the time of tet their new year holiday that carried them into the heart of saigon immobilized tan san nhut airfield even occupied the american embassy briefly the offensive was beaten back but it demonstrated that all the enormous firepower delivered on vietnam by the united states had not destroyed the nlf its morale its popular support its will to fight it caused a reassessment in the american government more doubts among the american people 

the massacre at my lai by a company of ordinary soldiers was a small event compared with the plans of highlevel military and civilian leaders to visit massive destruction on the civilian population of vietnam assistant secretary of defense john mcnaughton in early 1966 seeing that largescale bombing of north vietnam villages was not producing the desired result suggested a different strategy the air strikes on villages he said would create a counterproductive wave of revulsion abroad and at home he suggested instead

destruction of locks and dams however—if handled rightmight offer promise it should be studied such destruction doesnt kill or drown people  by shallowflooding the rice it leads after a time to widespread starvation more than a million unless food is provided—which we could offer to do at the conference table 

the heavy bombings were intended to destroy the will of ordinary vietnamese to resist as in the bombings of german and japanese population centers in world war ii—despite president johnsons public insistence that only military targets were being bombed the government was using language like one more turn of the screw to describe bombing the cia at one point in 1966 recommended a bombing program of greater intensify according to the pentagon papers directed against in the cias words the will of the regime as a target system

meanwhile just across the border of vietnam in a neighboring country laos where a rightwing government installed by the cia faced a rebellion one of the most beautiful areas in the world the plain of jars was being destroyed by bombing this was not reported by the government or the press but an american who lived in laos fred branfman told the story in his book voices from the plain of jars

over 25000 attack sorties were flown against the plain of jars from may 1964 through september 1969 over 75000 tons of bombs were dropped on it on the ground thousands were killed and wounded tens of thousands driven underground and the entire aboveground society leveled

branfman who spoke the laotian language and lived in a village with a laotian family interviewed hundreds of refugees from the bombing who poured into the capital city of vientiane he recorded their statements and preserved their drawings a twentysixyearold nurse from xieng khouang told of her life in her village

i was at one with the earth the air the upland fields the paddy and the seedbeds of my village each day and night in the light of the moon i and my friends from the village would wander calling out and singing through forest and field amidst the cries of the birds during the harvesting and planting season we would sweat and labor together under the sun and the rain contending with poverty and miserable conditions continuing the farmers life which has been the profession of our ancestors

but in 1964 and 1965 i could feel the trembling of the earth and the shock from the sounds of arms exploding around my village i began to hear the noise of airplanes circling about in the heavens one of them would stick its head down and plunging earthward loose a loud roar shocking the heart as light and smoke covered everything so that one could not see anything at all each day we would exchange news with the neighboring villagers of the bombings that had occurred the damaged houses the injured and the dead

the holes the holes during that time we needed holes to save our lives we who were young took our sweat and our strength which should have been spent raising food in the rice fields and forests to sustain our lives and squandered it digging holes to protect ourselves 

one young woman explained why the revolutionary movement in laos the neo lao attracted her and so many of her friends

as a young girl i had found that the past had not been very good for men had mistreated and made fun of women as the weaker sex but after the neo lao party began to administer the region  it became very different  under the neo lao things changed psychologically such as their teaching that women should be as brave as men for example although i had gone to school before my elders advised me not to they had said that it would not be useful for me as i could not hope to be a high ranking official after graduation that only the children of the elite or rich could expect that

but the neo lao said that women should have the same education as men and they gave us equal privileges and did not allow anyone to make fun of us

and the old associations were changed into new ones for example most of the new teachers and doctors trained were women and they changed the lives of the very poor  for they shared the land of those who had many rice fields with those who had none

a seventeenyearold boy told about the pathet lao revolutionary army coming to his village

some people were afraid mostly those with money they offered cows to the pathet lao soldiers to eat but the soldiers refused to take them if they did take them they paid a suitable price the truth is that they led the people not to be afraid of anything

then they organized the election of village and canton chief and the people were the ones who chose them  

desperation led the cia to enlist the hmong tribesmen in military campaigns which led to the deaths of thousands of hmong this was accompanied by secrecy and lying as was so much of what happened in laos in september 1973 a former government official in laos jerome doolittle wrote in the new york times

the pentagons most recent lies about bombing cambodia bring back a question that often occurred to me when i was press attache at the american embassy in vientiane laos

why did we bother to lie

when i first arrived in laos i was instructed to answer all press questions about our massive and merciless bombing campaign in that tiny country with at the request of the royal laotian government the united states is conducting unarmed reconnaissance flights accompanied by armed escorts who have the right to return if fired upon

this was a lie every reporter to whom i told it knew it was a lie hanoi knew it was a lie the international control commission knew it was a lie every interested congressman and newspaper reader knew it was a lie  

after all the lies did serve to keep something from somebody and the somebody was us

by early 1968 the cruelty of the war began touching the conscience of many americans for many others the problem was that the united states was unable to win the war while 40000 american soldiers were dead by this time 250000 wounded with no end in sight the vietnam casualties were many times this number

lyndon johnson had escalated a brutal war and failed to win it his popularity was at an alltime low he could not appear publicly without a demonstration against him and the war the chant lbj lbj how many kids did you kill today was heard in demonstrations throughout the country in the spring of 1968 johnson announced he would not run again for president and that negotiations for peace would begin with the vietnamese in paris

in the fall of 1968 richard nixon pledging that he would get the united states out of vietnam was elected president he began to withdraw troops by february 1972 less than 150000 were left but the bombing continued nixons policy was vietnamization—the saigon government with vietnamese ground troops using american money and air power would carry on the war nixon was not ending the war he was ending the most unpopular aspect of it the involvement of american soldiers on the soil of a faraway country

in the spring of 1970 nixon and secretary of state henry kissinger launched an invasion of cambodia after a long bombardment that the government never disclosed to the public the invasion not only led to an outcry of protest in the united states it was a military failure and congress resolved that nixon could not use american troops in extending the war without congressional approval the following year without american troops the united states supported a south vietnamese invasion of laos this too failed in 1971 800000 tons of bombs were dropped by the united states on laos cambodia vietnam meantime the saigon military regime headed by president nguyen van thieu the last of a long succession of saigon chiefs of state was keeping thousands of opponents in jail

some of the first signs of opposition in the united states to the vietnam war came out of the civil rights movementperhaps because the experience of black people with the government led them to distrust any claim that it was fighting for freedom on the very day that lyndon johnson was telling the nation in early august 1964 about the gulf of tonkin incident and announcing the bombing of north vietnam black and white activists were gathering near philadelphia mississippi at a memorial service for the three civil rights workers killed there that summer one of the speakers pointed bitterly to johnsons use of force in asia comparing it with the violence used against blacks in mississippi

in mid1965 in mccomb mississippi young blacks who had just learned that a classmate of theirs was killed in vietnam distributed a leaflet

no mississippi negroes should be fighting in viet nam for the white mans freedom until all the negro people are free in mississippi

negro boys should not honor the draft here in mississippi mothers should encourage their sons not to go 

no one has a right to ask us to risk our lives and kill other colored people in santo domingo and viet nam so that the white american can get richer

when secretary of defense robert mcnamara visited mississippi and praised senator john stennis a prominent racist as a man of very genuine greatness white and black students marched in protest with placards saying in memory of the burned children of vietnam

the student nonviolent coordinating committee declared in early 1966 that the united states is pursuing an aggressive policy in violation of international law and called for withdrawal from vietnam that summer six members of sncc were arrested for an invasion of an induction center in atlanta they were convicted and sentenced to several years in prison around the same time julian bond a sncc activist who had just been elected to the georgia house of representatives spoke out against the war and the draft and the house voted that he not be seated because his statements violated the selective service act and tend to bring discredit to the house the supreme court restored bond to his seat saying he had the right to free expression under the first amendment

one of the great sports figures of the nation muhammad ali the black boxer and heavyweight champion refused to serve in what he called a white mans war boxing authorities took away his title as champion martin luther king jr spoke out in 1967 at riverside church in new york

somehow this madness must cease we must stop now i speak as a child of god and brother to the suffering poor of vietnam i speak for those whose land is being laid waste whose homes are being destroyed whose culture is being subverted i speak for the poor of america who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in vietnam i speak as a citizen of the world for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken i speak as an american to the leaders of my own nation the great initiative in this war is ours the initiative to stop it must be ours

young men began to refuse to register for the draft refused to be inducted if called as early as may 1964 the slogan we wont go was widely publicized some who had registered began publicly burning their draft cards to protest the war one david obrien burned his draft card in south boston he was convicted and the supreme court overruled his argument that tins was a protected form of free expression in october of 1967 there were organized draftcard turnins all over the country in san francisco alone three hundred draft cards were returned to the government just before a huge demonstration at the pentagon that month a sack of collected draft cards was presented to the justice department

by mid1965 380 prosecutions were begun against men refusing to be inducted by mid1968 that figure was up to 3305 at the end of 1969 there were 33960 delinquents nationwide

in may 1969 the oakland induction center where draftees reported from all of northern california reported that of 4400 men ordered to report for induction 2400 did not show up in the first quarter of 1970 the selective service system for the first time could not meet its quota

a boston university graduate student in history philip supina wrote on may 1 1968 to his draft board in tucson arizona

i am enclosing the order for me to report for my preinduction physical exam for the armed forces i have absolutely no intention to report for that exam or for induction or to aid in any way the american war effort against the people of vietnam

he ended his letter by quoting the spanish philosopher miguel unamuno who during the spanish civil war said sometimes to be silent is to lie supina was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison

early in the war there had been two separate incidents barely noticed by most americans on november 2 1965 in front of the pentagon in washington as thousands of employees were streaming out of the building in the late afternoon norman morrison a thirtytwoyearold pacifist father of three stood below the thirdfloor windows of secretary of defense robert mcnamara doused himself with kerosene and set himself afire giving up his life in protest against the war also that year in detroit an eightytwoyearold woman named alice herz burned herself to death to make a statement against the horror of indochina

a remarkable change in sentiment took place in early 1965 when the bombing of north vietnam began a hundred people gathered on the boston common to voice their indignation on october 15 1969 the number of people assembled on the boston common to protest the war was 100000 perhaps 2 million people across the nation gathered that day in towns and villages that had never seen an antiwar meeting

in the summer of 1965 a few hundred people had gathered in washington to march in protest against the war the first in line historian staughton lynd sncc organizer bob moses and long time pacifist david dellinger were splattered with red paint by hecklers but by 1970 the washington peace rallies were drawing hundreds of thousands of people  in 1971 twenty thousand came to washington to commit civil disobedience trying to tie up washington traffic to express their revulsion against the killing still going on in vietnam fourteen thousand of them were arrested the largest mass arrest in american history 

hundreds of volunteers in the peace corps spoke out against the war in chile ninetytwo volunteers defied the peace corps director and issued a circular denouncing the war eight hundred former members of the corps issued a statement of protest against what was happening in vietnam

the poet robert lowell invited to a white house function refused to come arthur miller also invited sent a telegram to the white house when the guns boom the arts die singer eartha kitt was invited to a luncheon on the white house lawn and shocked all those present by speaking out in the presence of the presidents wife against the war a teenager called to the white house to accept a prize came and criticized the war in hollywood local artists erected a 60foot tower of protest on sunset boulevard at the national book award ceremonies in new york fifty authors and publishers walked out on a speech by vicepresident humphrey in a display of anger at his role in the war

in london two young americans gatecrashed the american ambassadors elegant fourth of july reception and called out a toast to all the dead and dying in vietnam they were carried out by guards in the pacific ocean two young american seamen hijacked an american munitions ship to divert its load of bombs from airbases in thailand for four days they took command of the ship and its crew taking amphetamine pills to stay awake until the ship reached cambodian waters the associated press reported in late 1972 from york pennsylvania five antiwar activists were arrested by the state police today for allegedly sabotaging railroad equipment near a factory that makes bomb casings used in the vietnam war

middleclass and professional people unaccustomed to activism began to speak up in may 1970 the new york times reported from washington 1000 establishment lawyers join war protest corporations began to wonder whether the war was going to hurt their long range business interests the wall street journal began criticizing the continuation of the war as the war became more and more unpopular people in or close to the government began to break out of the circle of assent the most dramatic instance was the case of daniel ellsberg

ellsberg was a harvardtrained economist a former marine officer employed by the rand corporation which did special often secret research for the us government ellsberg helped write the department of defense history of the war in vietnam and then decided to make the top secret document public with the aid of his friend anthony russo a former rand corporation man the two had met in saigon where both had been affected in different experiences by direct sight of the war and had become powerfully indignant at what the united states was doing to the people of vietnam

ellsberg and russo spent night after night after hours at a friends advertising agency duplicating the 7000page document then ellsberg gave copies to various congressmen and to the new york times in june 1971 the times began printing selections from what came to be known as the pentagon papers it created a national sensation

the nixon administration tried to get the supreme court to stop further publication but the court said this was prior restraint of the freedom of the press and thus unconstitutional the government then indicted ellsberg and russo for violating the espionage act by releasing classified documents to unauthorized people  they faced long terms in prison if convicted the judge however called off the trial during the jury deliberations because the watergate events unfolding at the time revealed unfair practices by the prosecution

ellsberg by his bold act had broken with the usual tactic of dissidents inside the government who bided their time and kept their opinions to themselves hoping for small changes in policy a colleague urged him not to leave the government because there he had access saying dont cut yourself off dont cut your throat ellsberg replied life exists outside the executive branch

the antiwar movement early in its growth found a strange new constituency priests and nuns of the catholic church some of them had been aroused by the civil rights movement others by their experiences in latin america where they saw poverty and injustice under governments supported by the united states in the fall of 1967 father philip berrigan a josephite priest who was a veteran of world war ii joined by artist tom lewis and friends david eberhardt and james mengel went to the office of a draft board in baltimore maryland drenched the draft records with blood and waited to be arrested they were put on trial and sentenced to prison terms of two to six years

the following may philip berriganout on bail in the baltimore casewas joined in a second action by his brother daniel a jesuit priest who had visited north vietnam and seen the effects of us bombing they and seven other people went into a draft board office in catonsville maryland removed records and set them afire outside in the presence of reporters and onlookers they were convicted and sentenced to prison and became famous as the catonsville nine dan berrigan wrote a meditation at the time of the catonsville incident

our apologies good friends for the fracture of good order the burning of paper instead of children the angering of the orderlies in the front parlor of the charnel house we could not so help us god do otherwise we say killing is disorder life and gentleness and community and unselfishness is the only order we recognize for the sake of that order we risk our liberty our good name the time is past when good men can remain silent when obedience can segregate men from public risk when the poor can die without defense

when his appeals had been exhausted and he was supposed to go to prison daniel berrigan disappeared while the fbi searched for him he showed up at an easter festival at cornell university where he had been teaching with dozens of fbi men looking for him in the crowd he suddenly appeared on stage then the lights went out he hid inside a giant figure of the bread and puppet theatre which was on stage was carried out to a truck and escaped to a nearby farmhouse he stayed underground for four months writing poems issuing statements giving secret interviews appearing suddenly in a philadelphia church to give a sermon and then disappearing again baffling the fbi until an informers interception of a letter disclosed his whereabouts and he was captured and imprisoned

the one woman among the catonsville nine mary moylan a former nun also refused to surrender to the fbi she was never found writing from underground she reflected on her experience and how she came to it

 we had all known we were going to jail so we all had our toothbrushes i was just exhausted i took my little box of clothes and stuck it under the cot and climbed into bed now all the women in the baltimore county jail were blacki think there was only one white the women were waking me up and saying arent you going to cry i said what about they said youre in jail and i said yeah i knew id be here  

i was sleeping between two of these women and every morning id wake up and theyd be leaning on their elbows watching me theyd say you slept all night and they couldnt believe it they were good we had good times

i suppose the political turning point in my life came while i was in uganda i was there when american planes were bombing the congo and we were very close to the congo border the planes came over and bombed two villages in uganda   where the hell did the american planes come in

later i was in dar es salaam and chou enlai came to town the american embassy sent out letters saying that no americans were to be on the street because this was a dirty communist leader but i decided this was a man who was making history and i wanted to see him 

when i came home from africa i moved to washington and had to deal with the scene there and the insanity and brutality of the cops and the type of life that was led by most of the citizens of that city—70 percent black 

and then vietnam and the napalm and the defoliants and the bombings 

i got involved with the womens movement about a year ago  

at the time of catonsville going to jail made sense to me partially because of the black sceneso many blacks forever filling the jails  i dont think its a valid tactic anymore i dont want to see people marching off to jail with smiles on their faces i just dont want them going the seventies are going to be very difficult and i dont want to waste the sisters and brothers we have by marching them off to jail and having mystical experiences or whatever theyre going to have 

the effect of the war and of the bold action of some priests and nuns was to crack the traditional conservatism of the catholic community on moratorium day 1969 at the newton college of the sacred heart near boston a sanctuary of bucolic quiet and political silence the great front door of the college displayed a huge painted red fist at boston college a catholic institution six thousand people gathered that evening in the gymnasium to denounce the war

students were heavily involved in the early protests against the war a survey by the urban research corporation for the first six months of 1969 only and for only 232 of the nations two thousand institutions of higher education showed that at least 215000 students had participated in campus protests that 3652 had been arrested that 956 had been suspended or expelled even in the high schools in the late sixties there were five hundred underground newspapers at the brown university commencement in 1969 twothirds of the graduating class turned their backs when henry kissinger stood up to address them

the climax of protest came in the spring of 1970 when president nixon ordered the invasion of cambodia at kent state university in ohio on may 4 when students gathered to demonstrate against the war national guardsmen fired into the crowd four students were killed one was paralyzed for life students at four hundred colleges and universities went on strike in protest it was the first general student strike in the history of the united states during that school year of 19691970 the fbi listed 1785 student demonstrations including the occupation of 313 buildings

the commencement day ceremonies after the kent state killings were unlike any the nation had ever seen from amherst massachusetts came this newspaper report

the 100th commencement of the university of massachusetts yesterday was a protest a call for peace

the roll of the funeral drum set the beat for 2600 young men and women marching in fear in despair and in frustration

red fists of protest white peace symbols and blue doves were stenciled on black academic gowns and nearly every other senior wore an armband representing a plea for peace

student protests against the rotc reserve officers training program resulted in the canceling of those programs in over forty colleges and universities in 1966 191749 college students enrolled in rotc by 1973 the number was 72459 the rotc was depended on to supply half the officers in vietnam in september 1973 for the sixth straight month the rotc could not fulfill its quota one army official said i just hope we dont get into another war because if we do i doubt we could fight it

the publicity given to the student protests created the impression that the opposition to the war came mostly from middleclass intellectuals when some construction workers in new york attacked student demonstrators the news was played up in the national media however a number of elections in american cities including those where mostly bluecollar workers lived showed that antiwar sentiment was strong in the working classes for instance in dearborn michigan an automobile manufacturing town a poll as early as 1967 showed 41 percent of the population favored withdrawal from the vietnam war in 1970 in two counties in california where petitioners placed the issue on the ballot—san francisco county and marin county—referenda asking withdrawal of the us forces from vietnam received a majority vote

in late 1970 when a gallup poll presented the statement the united states should withdraw all troops from vietnam by the end of next year 65 percent of those questioned said yes in madison wisconsin in the spring of 1971 a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of us forces from southeast asia won by 31000 to 16000 in 1968 such a resolution had lost

but the most surprising data were in a survey made by the university of michigan this showed that throughout the vietnam war americans with only a grade school education were much stronger for withdrawal from the war than americans with a college education in june 1966 of people with a college education 27 percent were for immediate withdrawal from vietnam of people with only a grade school education 41 percent were for immediate withdrawal by september 1970 both groups were more antiwar 47 percent of the collegeeducated were for withdrawal and 61 percent of grade school graduates

there is more evidence of the same kind in an article in the american sociological review june 1968 richard f hamilton found in his survey of public opinion preferences for tough policy alternatives are most frequent among the following groups the highly educated high status occupations those with high incomes younger persons and those paying much attention to newspapers and magazines and a political scientist harlan hahn doing a study of various city referenda on vietnam found support for withdrawal from vietnam highest in groups of lower socioeconomic status he also found that the regular polls based on samplings underestimated the opposition to the war among lowerclass people 

all this was part of a general change in the entire population of the country in august of 1965 61 percent of the population thought the american involvement in vietnam was not wrong by may 1971 it was exactly reversed 61 percent thought our involvement was wrong bruce andrews a harvard student of public opinion found that the people most opposed to the war were people over fifty blacks and women he also noted that a study in the spring of 1964 when vietnam was a minor issue in the newspapers showed that 53 percent of collegeeducated people were willing to send troops to vietnam but only 33 percent of grade schooleducated people were so willing

it seems that the media themselves controlled by highereducation higherincome people who were more aggressive in foreign policy tended to give the erroneous impression that workingclass people were superpatriots for the war lewis lipsitz in a mid1968 survey of poor blacks and whites in the south paraphrased an attitude he found typical the only way to help the poor man is to get out of that war in vietnam   these taxes—high taxes—its going over yonder to kill people with and i dont see no cause in it

the capacity for independent judgement among ordinary americans is probably best shown by the swift development of antiwar feeling among american gisvolunteers and draftees who came mostly from lowerincome groups there had been earlier in american history  instances of soldiers disaffection from the war isolated mutinies in the revolutionary war refusal of reenlistment in the midst of hostilities in the mexican war desertion and conscientious objection in world war i and world war ii but vietnam produced opposition by soldiers and veterans on a scale and with a fervor never seen before

it began with isolated protests as early as june 1965 richard steinke a west point graduate in vietnam refused to board an aircraft taking him to a remote vietnamese village the vietnamese war he said is not worth a single american life steinke was courtmartialed and dismissed from the service the following year three army privates one black one puerto rican one lithuanianitalianall poorrefused to embark for vietnam denouncing the war as immoral illegal and unjust they were courtmartialed and imprisoned

in early 1967 captain howard levy an army doctor at fort jackson south carolina refused to teach green berets a special forces elite in the military he said they were murderers of women and children and killers of peasants he was courtmartialed on the grounds that he was trying to promote disaffection among enlisted men by his statements the colonel who presided at the trial said the truth of the statements is not an issue in this case levy was convicted and sentenced to prison

the individual acts multiplied a black private in oakland refused to board a troop plane to vietnam although he faced eleven years at hard labor a navy nurse lieutenant susan schnall was courtmartialed for marching in a peace demonstration while in uniform and for dropping antiwar leaflets from a plane on navy installations in norfolk virginia a sailor refused to train fighter pilots because he said the war was immoral an army lieutenant was arrested in washington dc in early 1968 for picketing the white house with a sign that said 120000 american casualtieswhy two black marines george daniels and william harvey were given long prison sentences daniels six years harvey ten years both later reduced for talking to other black marines against the war

as the war went on desertions from the armed forces mounted thousands went to western europe—france sweden holland most deserters crossed into canada some estimates were 50000 others 100000 some stayed in the united states a few openly defied the military authorities by taking sanctuary in churches where surrounded by antiwar friends and sympathizers they waited for capture and courtmartial at boston university a thousand students kept vigil for five days and nights in the chapel supporting an eighteenyearold deserter ray kroll

krolls story was a common one he had been inveigled into joining the army he came from a poor family was brought into court charged with drunkenness and given the choice of prison or enlistment he enlisted and then he began to think about the nature of the war

on a sunday morning federal agents showed up at the boston university chapel stomped their way through aisles clogged with students smashed down doors and took kroll away from the stockade he wrote back to friends i aint gonna kill its against my will  a friend he had made at the chapel brought him hooks and he noted a saying he had found in one of them what we have done will not be lost to all eternity everything ripens at its time and becomes fruit at its hour

the gi antiwar movement became more organized near fort jackson south carolina the first gt coffeehouse was set up a place where soldiers could get coffee and doughnuts find antiwar literature and talk freely with others it was called the ufo and lasted for several years before it was declared a public nuisance and closed by court action but other gi coffeehouses sprang up in half a dozen other places across the country an antiwar bookstore was opened near fort devens massachusetts and another one at the newport rhode island naval base

underground newspapers sprang up at military bases across the country by 1970 more than fifty were circulating among them about face in los angeles fed up in tacoma washington short times at fort jackson vietnam gi in chicago graffiti in heidelberg germany bragg briefs in north carolina last harass at fort gordon georgia helping hand at mountain home air base idaho these newspapers printed antiwar articles gave news about the harassment of gis and practical advice on the legal rights of servicemen told how to resist military domination

mixed with feeling against the war was resentment at the cruelty the dehumanization of military life in the army prisons the stockades this was especially true in 1968 at the presidio stockade in california a guard shot to death an emotionally disturbed prisoner for walking away from a work detail twentyseven prisoners then sat down and refused to work singing we shall overcome they were courtmartialed found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to terms of up to fourteen years later reduced after much public attention and protest

the dissidence spread to the war front itself when the great moratorium day demonstrations were taking place in october 1969 in the united states some gis in vietnam wore black armbands to show their support a news photographer reported that in a platoon on patrol near da nang about half of the men were wearing black armbands one soldier stationed at cu chi wrote to a friend on october 26 1970 that separate companies had been set up for men refusing to go into the field to fight its no big thing here anymore to refuse to go the french newspaper le monde reported that in four months 109 soldiers of the first air cavalry division were charged with refusal to fight a common sight the correspondent for le monde wrote is the black soldier with his left fist clenched in defiance of a war he has never considered his own

wallace terry a black american reporter for time magazine taped conversations with hundreds of black soldiers he found bitterness against army racism disgust with the war generally low morale more and more cases of fragging were reported in vietnam—incidents where servicemen rolled fragmentation bombs under the tents of officers who were ordering them into combat or against whom they had other grievances the pentagon reported 209 fraggings in vietnam in 1970 alone

veterans back from vietnam formed a group called vietnam veterans against the war in december 1970 hundreds of them went to detroit to what was called the winter soldier investigations to testify publicly about atrocities they had participated in or seen in vietnam committed by americans against vietnamese in april 1971 more than a thousand of them went to washington dc to demonstrate against the war one by one they went up to a wire fence around the capitol threw over the fence the medals they had won in vietnam and made brief statements about the war sometimes emotionally sometimes in icy bitter calm

in the summer of 1970 twentyeight commissioned officers of the military including some veterans of vietnam saying they represented about 250 other officers announced formation of the concerned officers movement against the war during the fierce bombings of hanoi and haiphong around christmas 1972 came the first defiance of b52 pilots who refused to fly those missions

on june 3 1973 the new york times reported dropouts among west point cadets officials there the reporter wrote linked the rate to an affluent less disciplined skeptical and questioning generation and to the antimilitary mood that a small radical minority and the vietnam war had created

but most of the antiwar action came from ordinary gis and most of these came from lowerincome groups—white black native american chinese and chicano chicanos back home were demonstrating by the thousands against the war

a twentyyearold new york city chinese american named sam choy enlisted at seventeen in the army was sent to vietnam was made a cook and found himself the target of abuse by fellow gis who called him chink and gook the term for the vietnamese and said he looked like the enemy one day he took a rifle and fired warning shots at his tormenters by this time i was near the perimeter of the base and was thinking of joining the viet cong at least they would trust me

choy was taken by military police beaten courtmartialed sentenced to eighteen months of hard labor at fort leaven worth they beat me up every day like a time clock he ended his interview with a new york chinatown newspaper saying one thing i want to tell all the chinese kids that the army made me sick they made me so sick that i cant stand it

a dispatch from phu bai in april 1972 said that fifty gis out of 142 men in the company refused to go on patrol crying this isnt our war the new york times on july 14 1973 reported that american prisoners of war in vietnam ordered by officers in the pow camp to stop cooperating with the enemy shouted back whos the enemy they formed a peace committee in the camp and a sergeant on the committee later recalled his march from capture to the pow camp

until we got to the first camp we didnt see a village intact they were all destroyed i sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself is this right or wrong is it right to destroy villages is it right to kill people en masse after a while it just got to me

pentagon officials in washington and navy spokesmen in san diego announced after the united states withdrew its troops from vietnam in 1973 that the navy was going to purge itself of undesirablesand that these included as many as six thousand men in the pacific fleet a substantial proportion of them black all together about 700000 gis had received less than honorable discharges in the year 1973 one of every five discharges was less than honorable indicating something less than dutiful obedience to the military by 1971 177 of every 1000 american soldiers were listed as absent without leave some of them three or four times deserters doubled from 47000 in 1967 to 89000 in 1971

one of those who stayed fought but then turned against the war was ron kovic his father worked in a supermarket on long island in 1963 at the age of seventeen he enlisted in the marines two years later in vietnam at the age of nineteen his spine was shattered by shellfire paralyzed from the waist down he was put in a wheelchair back in the states he observed the brutal treatment of wounded veterans in the veterans hospitals thought more and more about the war and joined the vietnam veterans against the war he went to demonstrations to speak against the war one evening he heard actor donald sutherland read from the postworld war i novel by dalton trumbo johnny got his gun about a soldier whose limbs and face were shot away by gunfire a thinking torso who invented a way of communicating with the outside world and then beat out a message so powerful it could not be heard without trembling

sutherland began to read the passage and something i will never forget swept over me it was as if someone was speaking for everything i ever went through in the hospital i began to shake and i remember there were tears in my eyes

kovic demonstrated against the war and was arrested he tells his story in born on the fourth of july

they help me back into the chair and take me to another part of the prison building to be booked

whats your name the officer behind the desk says

ron kovic i say occupation vietnam veteran against the war

what he says sarcastically looking down at me

im a vietnam veteran against the war i almost shout back

you should have died over there he says he turns to his assistant id like to take this guy and throw him off the roof

they fingerprint me and take my picture and put me in a cell i have begun to wet my pants like a little baby the tube has slipped out during my examination by the doctor i try to fall asleep but even though i am exhausted the anger is alive in me like a huge hot stone in my chest i lean my head up against the wall and listen to the toilets flush again and again

kovic and the other veterans drove to miami to the republican national convention in 1972 went into the convention hall wheeled themselves down the aisles and as nixon began his acceptance speech shouted stop the bombing stop the war delegates cursed them traitor and secret service men hustled them out of the hall

in the fall of 1973 with no victory in sight and north vietnamese troops entrenched in various parts of the south the united states agreed to accept a settlement that would withdraw american troops and leave the revolutionary troops where they were until a new elected government would be set up including communist and noncommunist elements but the saigon government refused to agree and the united states decided to make one final attempt to bludgeon the north vietnamese into submission it sent waves of b52s over hanoi and haiphong destroying homes and hospitals killing unknown numbers of civilians the attack did not work many of the b52s were shot down there was angry protest all over the worldand kissinger went back to paris and signed very much the same peace agreement that had been agreed on before

the united states withdrew its forces continuing to give aid to the saigon government but when the north vietnamese launched attacks in early 1975 against the major cities in south vietnam the government collapsed in late april 1975 north vietnamese troops entered saigon the american embassy staff fled along with many vietnamese who feared communist rule and the long war in vietnam was over saigon was renamed ho chi minh city and both parts of vietnam were unified as the democratic republic of vietnam

traditional history portrays the end of wars as coming from the initiatives of leadersnegotiations in paris or brussels or geneva or versailles—just as it often finds the coming of war a response to the demand of the people the vietnam war gave clear evidence that at least for that war making one wonder about the others the political leaders were the last to take steps to end the warthe people  were far ahead the president was always far behind the supreme court silently turned away from cases challenging the constitutionality of the war congress was years behind public opinion

in the spring of 1971 syndicated columnists rowland evans and robert novak two firm supporters of the war wrote regretfully of a sudden outbreak of antiwar emotionalism in the house of representatives and said the antiwar animosities now suddenly so pervasive among house democrats are viewed by administration backers as less antinixon than as a response to constituent pressures

it was only after the intervention in cambodia ended and only after the nationwide campus uproar over that invasion that congress passed a resolution declaring that american troops should not be sent into cambodia without its approval and it was not until late 1973 when american troops had finally been removed from vietnam that congress passed a bill limiting the power of the president to make war without congressional consent even there in that war powers resolution the president could make war for sixty days on his own without a congressional declaration

the administration tried to persuade the american people that the war was ending because of its decision to negotiate a peacenot because it was losing the war not because of the powerful antiwar movement in the united states but the governments own secret memoranda all through the war testify to its sensitivity at each stage about public opinion in the united states and abroad the data is in the pentagon papers

in june of 1964 top american military and state department officials including ambassador henry cabot lodge met in honolulu rusk stated that public opinion on our sea policy was badly divided and that therefore the president needed an affirmation of support diem had been replaced by a general named khanh the pentagon historians write upon his return to saigon on june 5 ambassador lodge went straight from the airport to call on general khanh    the main thrust of his talk with khanh was to hint that the united states government would in the immediate future be preparing us public opinion for actions against north vietnam two months later came the gulf of tonkin affair

on april 2 1965 a memo from cia director john mccone suggested that the bombing of north vietnam be increased because it was not sufficiently severe to change north vietnams policy on the other hand  we can expect increasing pressure to stop the bombing   from various elements of the american public from the press the united nations and world opinion the us should try for a fast knockout before this opinion could build up mccone said

assistant secretary of defense john mcnaughtons memo of early 1966 suggested destruction of locks and dams to create mass starvation because strikes at population targets would create a counterproductive wave of revulsion abroad and at home in may 1967 the pentagon historians write mcnaughton was also very deeply concerned about the breadth and intensity of public unrest and dissatisfaction with the war   especially with young people  the underprivileged the intelligentsia and the women mcnaughton worried will the move to call up 20000 reserves  polarize opinion to the extent that the doves in the united states will get out of handmassive refusals to serve or to fight or to cooperate or worse he warned

there may be a limit beyond which many americans and much of the world will not permit the united states to go the picture of the worlds greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1000 noncombatants a week while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed is not a pretty one it could conceivably produce a costly distortion in the american national consciousness

that costly distortion seems to have taken place by the spring of 1968 when with the sudden and scary tet offensive of the national liberation front westmorland asked president johnson to send him 200000 more troops on top of the 525000 already there johnson asked a small group of action officers in the pentagon to advise him on this they studied the situation and concluded that 200000 troops would totally americanize the war and would not strengthen the saigon government because the saigon leadership shows no signs of a willingness—let alone an ability—to attract the necessary loyalty or support of the people  furthermore the report said sending troops would mean mobilizing reserves increasing the military budget there would he more us casualties more taxes and

this growing disaffection accompanied as it certainly will be by increased defiance of the draft and growing unrest in the cities because of the belief that we are neglecting domestic problems runs great risks of provoking a domestic crisis of unprecedented proportions

the growing unrest in the cities must have been a reference to the black uprisings that had taken place in 1967—and showed the link whether blacks deliberately made it or not—between the war abroad and poverty at home

the evidence from the pentagon papers is clear—that johnsons decision in the spring of 1968 to turn down westmorelands request to slow down for the first time the escalation of the war to diminish the bombing to go to the conference table was influenced to a great extent by the actions americans had taken in demonstrating their opposition to the war

when nixon took office he too tried to persuade the public that protest would not affect him but he almost went berserk when one lone pacifist picketed the white house the frenzy of nixons actions against dissidentsplans for burglaries wiretapping mail openingssuggests the importance of the antiwar movement in the minds of national leaders

one sign that the ideas of the antiwar movement had taken hold in the american public was that juries became more reluctant to convict antiwar protesters and local judges too were treating them differently in washington by 1971 judges were dismissing charges against demonstrators in cases where two years before they almost certainly would have been sent to jail the antiwar groups who had raided draft boards—the baltimore four the catonsville nine the milwaukee fourteen the boston five and more—were receiving lighter sentences for the same crimes

the last group of draft board raiders the camden 28 were priests nuns and laypeople who raided a draft board in camden new jersey in august 1971 it was essentially what the baltimore four had done four years earlier when all were convicted and phil berrigan got six years in prison but in this instance the camden defendants were acquitted by the jury on all counts when the verdict was in one of the jurors a fiftythreeyearold black taxi driver from atlantic city named samuel braithwaite who had spent eleven years in the army left a letter for the defendants

to you the clerical physicians with your godgiven talents i say well done well done for trying to heal the sick irresponsible men men who were chosen by the people to govern and lead them these men who failed the people  by raining death and destruction on a hapless country   you went out to do your part while your brothers remained in their ivory towers watching   and hopefully some day in the near future peace and harmony may reign to people of all nations

that was in may of 1973 the american troops were leaving vietnam c l sulzberger the new york times correspondent a man close to the government wrote the us emerges as the big loser and history books must admit this    we lost the war in the mississippi valley not the mekong valley successive american governments were never able to muster the necessary mass support at home

in fact the united states had lost the war in both the mekong valley and the mississippi valley it was the first clear defeat to the global american empire formed after world war ii it was administered by revolutionary peasants abroad and by an astonishing movement of protest at home

back on september 26 1969 president richard nixon noting the growing antiwar activity all over the country announced that under no circumstance will i be affected whatever by it but nine years later in his memoirs he admitted that the antiwar movement caused him to drop plans for an intensification of the war although publicly i continued to ignore the raging antiwar controversy i knew however that after all the protests and the moratorium american public opinion would be seriously divided by any military escalation of the war it was a rare presidential admission of the power of public protest

from a longrange viewpoint something perhaps even more important had happened the rebellion at home was spreading beyond the issue of war in vietnam1embed"
