i look like rocky balboa

verse 1
cross my heart and hope to die
burn my lungs and curse my eyes
ive lost control and i dont want it back
im going numb ive been hijacked
its a fucking drag

prechorus
i taste you on my lips and i cant get rid of you
so i say damn your kiss and the awful things you do

chorus
yeah youre worse than nicotine nicotine
yeah youre worse than nicotine nicotine
yeah

verse 2
its better to burn than to fade away
its better to leave than to be replaced
im losing to you baby im no match
im going numb ive been hijacked
its a fucking drag
