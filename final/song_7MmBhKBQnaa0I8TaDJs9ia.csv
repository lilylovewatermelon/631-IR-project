ive been duckin my friends ive been stuck on my ends
memories about people all in my head
first come to mind is my mama buyin me jordans
are we really made equal cause everybody got plans
i cant go ghost i face demons
dont let it defeat you all in my hands
i know its hard for you to come out that trance
i look myself in the mirror when i can
lets speak the truth tell me in pieces
i know its you i know just what you do
i knew since we first got evicted out our roof
my new since rehab i was six tryna see you

chorus
how could i resent you demons they test you
grandma and i missed you
you dont know what we been through
dont let the wolves come get you oohooh
please dont let them come get you oohooh
how could i resent you demons they test you
grandma and i missed you
you dont know what we been through
dont let the wolves come get you oohooh
please dont let them come get you oohooh
