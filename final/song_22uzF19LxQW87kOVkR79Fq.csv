late night watching tv
used to be you here beside me
used to be your arms around me
your body on my body

chorus
when the world means nothing to me
anothers arms anothers arms
when the pain just rips right through me
anothers arms anothers arms

verse 2
late night watching tv
used to be you here beside me
is there someone there to reach me
someone there to find me

chorus
when the pain just rips right through me
anothers arms anothers arms
and thats just torture to me
anothers arms anothers arms
pull yourself into me
anothers arms anothers arms
when the world means nothing to me
anothers arms anothers arms
see coldplay liveget tickets as low as 113you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
got to pull you close into me
anothers arms anothers arms
pull yourself right through me
anothers arms anothers arms

outro
late night watching tv
wish that you were here beside me
wish that your arms were around me
your body on my body22embed"
