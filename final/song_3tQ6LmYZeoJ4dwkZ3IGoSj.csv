touch

verse 1
ill stand for nothing less
or never stand again
these are the limits when ones buried
this bodys left the soul

prechorus
could we have known
never would i helped to nail down

verse 2
careful of drifting off
now losing taste and touch
turning a pale blue leaning in to say
this bodys left the soul

the brain needs oxygen
cant sneak around this bait
his catacomb has got me by the chin
this bodys left the soul

chorus
could we have known
never would i helped to nail down
with nothing to gain
heres the clincher this should be you
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likebridge
now saturate now saturate
now saturate now saturate and touch
now saturate now saturate
now saturate the earth
now saturate now saturate
now saturate the earth

chorus
well could we have known
never would i helped to nail down
ill stand for nothing less
with nothing to gain heres the clincher
this should be you made cold and crippled

this happened to be never changing
holding inside or never stand again
the phobia viewed made cold and crippled
ending it all

outro
now saturate now saturate
now saturate now saturate the earth
now saturate now saturate
now saturate2embed"
