i am such a sucker and im always the last to know
my insides are copper id kill to make them gold
conversation got me here another night alone in the city
so make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets

when you go i will forget everything about you
when you go i will forget everything about you

i have seen sinking ships go down
with more grace than you
turn this up ill tune you out another night alone in the city yeah
fake it like you matter thats a lie we can both keep oh
