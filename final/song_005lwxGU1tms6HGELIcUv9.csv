this was never the way i planned
not my intention
i got so brave drink in hand
lost my discretion
its not what im used to
just wanna try you on
im curious for you
caught my attention

chorus
i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend dont mind it
it felt so wrong it felt so right
dont mean im in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

verse 2
no i dont even know your name
it doesnt matter
youre my experimental game
just human nature
its not what good girls do
not how they should behave
my head gets so confused
hard to obey

i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend dont mind it
it felt so wrong it felt so right
dont mean im in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it

bridge
us girls we are so magical
soft skin red lips so kissable
hard to resist so touchable
too good to deny it
aint no big deal its innocent

chorus
i kissed a girl and i liked it
the taste of her cherry chapstick
i kissed a girl just to try it
i hope my boyfriend dont mind it
it felt so wrong it felt so right
dont mean im in love tonight
i kissed a girl and i liked it
i liked it44embed"
