forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who have trespassed against us
give us this day our daily bread
daily bread daily bread
in cello et in terra fiat voluntas tua
gloria spiritui sancto

verse 1
what language do you speak
if you speak at all
are you some kind of freak
who lives to raise the ones who fall
hey could you tell me why
the cat fights the dog
do you go to the mosque
or the synagogue

prechorus
and if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
and if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers

chorus
how do you do
how does it feel to be so high
and are you happy
do you ever cry i sometimes cry
youve made mistakes
well thats ok cause we all have
but if i forgive yours will you forgive mine

hey do you feel our pain
and walk in our shoes
have you ever felt starved
or is your belly always full
how many people die
and hurt in your name
hey does that make you proud
or does it bring you shame

prechorus
and if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
and if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers

chorus
how do you do
how does it feel to be so high
and are you happy do you ever cry i sometimes cry
youve made mistakes
well thats ok cause we all have
but if i forgive yours will you forgive mine
