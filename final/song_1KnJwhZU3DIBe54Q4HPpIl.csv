this whiskey got me feelin pretty
so pardon if im impolite
i just really need your ass with me
im sorry bout the other night
and i know i could be more creative
and come up with poetic lines
but im turnt up upstairs and i love you
is the only thing thats in my mind

chorus
you take me higher higher than ive ever been babe
just come over lets pour a drink babe
i hope i aint calling you too late too late
you light my fire
lets stay up late and smoke a j
i wanna go back to the old way
but im drunk instead with a full ashtray
with a little bit too much to sayyou might also like72embed"
