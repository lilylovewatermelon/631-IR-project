could this be earth could this be light
does this mean everything is going to be alright
one look out my window theres trees talking like people
ive dreamt of storms ive dreamt of sound
ive dreamt of gravity keeping us around
ive slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent
what is this love i dont feel the same
dont believe what this is could be given a name
i woke you were there tracing planets on my forehead
but ill forget 23 like i forget 17
and i forget my first love like you forget a daydream
and what of all my wild friends and the times ive had with them
well all fade to grey soon on the tv stationyou might also like55embed"
