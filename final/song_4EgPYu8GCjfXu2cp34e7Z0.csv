welcome home

verse 1 corey taylor clown  chris fehn
mother nature is a coward mother nature is a whore
no more presence no more power i pray for death by the hour
cut another smile into me into me is all you are
my artifice wont recognize me you wont find me anymore
posttraumatic war machines
the pessimists still wont believe
throw away my past mistakes
its all i came to feel
let my weapons be your children
let my armies be your damned
try to suffer on in silence
try to stop me if you can

chorus corey taylor clown chris fehn  paul gray
pneumatic destroyer
pathetic seducer
distortion sufficient
some day some day one day one day
well live our lives again

verse 2 corey taylor  chris fehn
my ghosts have found their way back home
i have every right to kill my own every right to kill my own
i am something now that never could exist
my anguish conquers all
pay the price and watch me fall
my only key is broken
my broken key is only me

bridge corey taylor
you utter waste of tired flesh
it doesnt matter if you cant progress
even now they still create me

i am made of the same debris
you want it all but you didnt want me
hypocrite with no real use
im alive whats your excuse
