ive seen dark before but not like this
this is cold this is empty this is numb
the life i knew is over the lights are out
hello darkness im ready to succumb

verse 2
i follow you around i always have
but youve gone to a place i cannot find
this grief has a gravity it pulls me down
but a tiny voice whispers in my mind
you are lost hope is gone
but you must go on
and do the next right thing

verse 3
can there be a day beyond this night
i dont know anymore what is true
i cant find my direction im all alone
the only star that guided me was you
how to rise from the floor
when its not you im rising for
just do the next right thing
take a step step again
it is all that i can to do
the next right thing
you might also likebridge
i wont look too far ahead
its too much for me to take
but break it down to this next breath
this next step
this next choice is one that i can make

verse 4
so ill walk through this night
stumbling blindly toward the light
and do the next right thing
and with the dawn what comes then
when its clear that everything will never be the same again
then ill make the choice
to hear that voice
and do the next right thing3embed"
