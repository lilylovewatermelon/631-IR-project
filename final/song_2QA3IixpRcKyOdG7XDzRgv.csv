i didnt know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason i know
i didnt read between the lines
and baby ive got nowhere to go

prechorus
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right

chorus
so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside

verse 2
you saw me there but never knew
that i would give it all up to be
a part of this a part of you
and now its all too late so you see

prechorus
you couldve helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until its too late to do anything

how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside

postchorus

chorus
how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
and i can still see you this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been a lot of lonely places
ive never been on the outside
