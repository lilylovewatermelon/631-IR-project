not sure what day it is
when i stopped counting it
my times been wasted
been thinking of him
i wonder if he remembers my brothers name
i only said it once but was he listening

verse 2
its the little things
that just arent the same
i used to make my bed
but now i see no point in it
hes awake the whole time that im asleep
maybe thats why i dont see him in my dreams

verse 3
dont know what to do dont
i have nothing to do no
theres nowhere to go go
i just stay at home
i sent a pigeon with a note to his house
i hope he hung it up but probably threw it out

chorus
i sent a pigeon with a note to his house
i hope he hung it up but probably threw it out
i wish i knew but i am too afraid to ask
i should just let it go but i cant not look backsee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeembed"
