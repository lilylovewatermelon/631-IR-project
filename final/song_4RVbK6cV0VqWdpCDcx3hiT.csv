verse 1 kanye west
very rarely do you catch me out
yall done specially invited guestd me out
yall been tellin jokes thats gon stress me out
soon as i walk in im like lets be out
i was off the chain i was often drained
i was off the meds i was called insane
what a awesome thing engulfed in shame
i want all the rain i want all the pain
i want all the smoke i want all the blame

caught in the audy home we was all detained
