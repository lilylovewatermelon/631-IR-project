ive got a hunger
twisting my stomach into knots
that my tongue has tied off
my brains repeating
if youve got an impulse let it out
but they never make it past my mouth

our youth is fleeting
old age is just around the bend
and i cant wait to go gray
and i know ill wonder
about the love that could have been
if id only thought of something charming to say
