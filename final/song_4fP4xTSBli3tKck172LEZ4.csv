to my surprise and my delight
i saw sunrise i saw sunlight
i am nothing in the dark
and the clouds burst to show daylight

chorus
ooh and the sun shine
yeah on this heart of mine
ooh and i realise
who couldnt live without
ooh come apart without it

verse 2
on a hilltop on a skyrise
like a firstborn child
and at full tilt and in full flight
defeat darkness breakin daylight

chorus
ooh and the sun shine
yeah on this heart of mine
ooh and i realise
who couldnt live without
ooh come apart without daylight
