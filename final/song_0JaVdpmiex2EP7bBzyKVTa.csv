intro
one time for the homie dj screw
already im feeling throwed in this bitch

verse 1
up so high even when im coming down
just met a girl say she from the htown
i say my name is drizzy and aint nobody realer
cup inside a cup smoking ghostface killah
got these boppas going crazy nigga im the man
i sent ya girl a message said ill see ya when i can
she sent me one back but i aint never read it
cause pussys only pussy and i get it when i need it

verse 2
and im telling you im as cold as windows down in the winter
and i be riding rims if my tires any thinner
airport stunting flying charters overseas
full of dom perignon and the water for the ds
dont know why it happens everytime we alone
but here we are again and i swear im in my zone
so ima sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
and you gon get undressed and we gon get it on
see drake liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
i dont give you the time you deserve from me
this is something i know i know i know
so tonight ill just fuck you like were in houston
taking everything slow so slow so slow
but i do it to her

bridge
draped up dripped out know what im talking bout
3 in the morning get it popping in the parking lot
its on once again and i never pretend
a nigga staying g til the end

outro
ayy yeah
i swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation you know
i just get that feeling like im in houston
candy paint switching colors in the light
its about like 11 pm and you just rolling through the city
bumping that screw big moe ugk lil keke
it feel like like everythings just moving slow
lets take my time i pace it baby yeah im gone39embed"
