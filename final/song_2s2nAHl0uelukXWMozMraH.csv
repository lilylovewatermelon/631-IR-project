theyre too fat to feed
youre on medication
taking pills to sleep
i think im doing just fine
compared to what youve been doing
i wont get vaccinated
insurance costs too much
you think youre so persuasive
but im not giving up
saving my life
its not what youre doing

i i wont justify
the way i live my life
cause im the one livin it
feelin it tastin it
and youre just wasting your time
trying to throw me a line
when youre the one drowning
i like where im at on my back
floating down in my own riptide
the water is fine

i like to step on cracks
i go against the odds
you think my world is flat
do i turn you on
maybe yeah im wrong
but i like where im going
i leave when others stay
i never redecide
i dont mind if you wait
but i dont waste my time
crazy is just fine
cause i like where im going
you might also likei i wont justify
the way i live my life
cause im the one livin it
feelin it tastin it
and youre just wasting your time
trying to throw me a line
when youre the one drowning
i like where im at on my back
floating down in my own riptide
the water is fine

i remember when it used to be easy
i remember when it wasnt so hard
i remember when it used to be easy
i remember when i remember when

i i didnt have to justify
the way i live my life
cause im the one livin it
feelin it tastin it
and youre just wasting your time
trying to throw me a line
when youre the one drowning
i like where im at on my back
floating down in my own riptide
the water is fine
i remember when it used to be easy
i remember when it wasnt so hard
i remember when it used to be easy
i remember when i remember when2embed"
