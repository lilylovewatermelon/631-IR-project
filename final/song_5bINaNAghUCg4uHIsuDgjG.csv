im at the bottom can you come let me up
cause i wrote a vow for you
your friends are faded let me fill up your cup
and toast to the stars over

we spin the bottle till were kissing our cups
felt like id die for you

and ive waited nine for you

i dont wanna live for nothing just wanna be something
i never knew wed be more than friends
