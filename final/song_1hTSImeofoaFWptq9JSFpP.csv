i have been dragging around your sensitive ego
making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
a little suitcase like a brick
it kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
i drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
ill hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

chorus
at the baggage claim you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground check the lost and found
cause it aint my problem now
i cant carry it on ive got a lot of troubles on my own
its all over the yard in the trunk of the car
im packing it in so come and get it

verse 2
if it aint obvious what has set me off today
behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
go on and take your little business trip
with that sweet little habit that you cant kick
you better call your momma when you get to town
cause i aint gonna be hanging around

chorus
at the baggage claim you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground check the lost and found
cause it aint my problem now
i cant carry it on ive got a lot of troubles on my own
its all over the yard in the trunk of the car
im packing it in so come and get it
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likebreak
come and get it

verse 3
come and pick it up pick it up
before i blow it up in flames
you better pick it up pick it up
baby im leaving everything

chorus
at the baggage claim you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground check the lost and found
cause it aint my problem now
i cant carry it on ive got a lot of troubles on my own
its all over the yard in the trunk of the car
im packing it in so come and get it

outro
come and get your shit2embed"
