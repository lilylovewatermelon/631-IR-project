the colors are beautiful
when they say give up
turn up your radio
all the sentimental memories you own
when they say grow up
its just like a funeral

keep your head up
the colors are beautiful
keep your head up
its all right in front of you
when they say wake up
youre braking ridicule
when all the sentimental memories you own
keep you trapped inside your room there all alone

and it feels like
it feels like youre lost
and it feels like
it feels like youre lost

is there some way you can be out on your own
trust yourself
dont waste another day at all
you might also likeon your own

keep your head up
the colors are beautiful
and it feels like
it feels like youre lost
and it feels like
it feels like youre lost

is there some way you can be out on your own
trust yourself
dont waste another day at all

watch this fade away
everything fades away
keep your head up
the colors are beautifulembed"
