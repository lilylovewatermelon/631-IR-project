taking it slowly
im afraid to be lonely
nobody told me
its harder than i thought to tell the truth
its gonna leave you in pieces
all alone with your demons
and i know that we need this
but ive been too afraid to follow through

chorus noah kahan
hold me close and i wont leave
cause it hurts when you hurt somebody
so much to say but i dont speak
and i hate that i let you stop me
cause it hurts when you hurt somebody

verse 2 julia michaels
dont know where the time went
stuck in the wrong mindset
and i let the rules bend
when i know that all along theyre made to break eh
you got me searching for reasons
to keep me from leaving
and then i have trouble breathing
i give myself another chance to stay eh
