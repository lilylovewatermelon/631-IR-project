are you going to live your life wondering
standing in the back looking around
are you going to waste your time thinking
how youve grown up or how you missed out
thththththings are never going to be the way you want
wheres it going to get you acting serious
thththththings are never going to be quite what you want
even at 25 you got to start sometime

im on my feet im on the floor im good to go
now all i need is just to hear a song i know
i want to always feel like part of this was mine
i want to fall in love tonight
