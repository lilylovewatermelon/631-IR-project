are you on your way
are you coming soon to me
no parking in la
so ima send a uber to your place
is my secret safe
safe with just you and me
we cant leave a trace
this is my favorite mistake

prechorus
look in my eyes
can you find the lies do you feel alive
look in my eyes
do you mind the lies do you feel alive
look in my eyes

chorus
we both know its wrong
but youre still coming over
even when youre gone
the feeling just grow stronger
should leave it alone
but youre still getting closer
we both know its wrong
cant keep this for long
while its going on
ill put it in a song
