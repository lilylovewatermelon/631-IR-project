who really know what rights all the wrongs anyway
who really cares what people do or say
and no matter where this life takes me ill never let it compromise compromise
to much luck to bet it on do or die

chorus
cause ive seen everything that i could see
and now i can say goodbye today
with all i know
its time i said goodbye
today is a good day to die

verse 2
lived by the rules you that you gave me and fell apart
all the wrong turns down a dead end street so far
i stretched my wings and breathe in different day
alone and broken is the price i pay
but thats ok

chorus
ive seen everything that i could see
and now i can say goodbye today
with all i know
its time i said goodbye
today is a good day to die
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likebridge
never thought out a life
taking all i can take
its time to say goodbye
its a good day to die

chorus
cause ive seen everything that i could see
and now i can say goodbye today
with all i know
its time i said goodbye
today is a good day to die

outro
cause ive seen everything
and i know all i know
its time i said goodbye today
with all i know
its time i said goodbye
today is a good day to dieembed"
