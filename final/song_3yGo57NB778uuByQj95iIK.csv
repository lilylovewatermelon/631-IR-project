i woke up in bed last night when something came upon me
i was not lying there alone but i’ve never felt so lonely
something’s come between us girl feels like we’ve hit a wall
how can i know just how you feel when we don’t touch at all
this no communication thing is quickly growing old
this isolation booth i’m in is dark and turning cold
i used to steal your breath away with just one little kiss
me and you we were so in love back then but that’s not how it is

chorus
but i’d catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness
fill my pickup bed with roses and back it right up to your door
i’d write your name in candy kisses from here to carolina
if you change your mind and love me like before but that’s not how it is

verse 2
i have tossed and turned and rolled it over in my mind
not knowing all the questions make the answers hard to find
i think i’ve covered everything but still there’s something that i’ve missed
i used to read you baby like a book but that’s not how it is

chorus
but i’d catch moonlight in a bottle if we could drink a toast to happiness
fill my pickup bed with roses and back it right up to your door
i’d write your name in candy kisses from here to carolina
if you change your mind and love me like before but that’s not how it is
you might also likechorus
i’d write your name in candy kisses from here to carolina
if you change your mind and love me like before but that’s not how it is
that’s not how it is
that’s not how it isembed"
