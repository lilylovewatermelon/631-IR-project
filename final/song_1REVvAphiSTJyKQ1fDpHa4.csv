verse 1 kendrick lamar
this my undisputed truth uhhuh
my life is like forbidden fruit my bitch know better than i do
a womans worth i barely went to church id rather fast with you
than fuck it up fucking with skirts cause im rational
a nigga still gon be a nigga emoji heart my family pictures
twosteppin away from rappers i dont trust their true intеntions
im not in the music business i been in the human businеss
whole life been social distant hoes like when you not trippin
i duck the party who said they saw me
crown on bob marley wrist on yo gotti
they gon judge yo’ life for a couple likes on the double tap
them hoes is sorry they all get bodied
i bless it that you have an open heart i bless that you forgive
i bless it that you can learn from a loss i bless it that you heal
i bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
a patient life flaws bless em twice and theyll bless you back

verse 2 summer walker  kendrick lamar
hows love hows love when its haunting your soul
but my nigga left his ass on the road
gossiping bout some shit you dont know
oh you ho yeah yeah yeah fo sho
i hate it here baby daddy still on my phone
i hate it here asking if i been on the pole
i hate it here if you keep lurking on the low
if you a fan just let me know
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
now if its love i deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes sometimes
and if i feel where your heart can be youll still be a part of me
i love my love my love my love my
summer in the storm i cannot conform
i cannot conform i cannot conform
i just might love you still just think i love me more
it aint love if you gon judge me for my past
no it aint love if you aint never eat my ass
it aint love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
thats why im antieveryone before this mask

verse 3 ghostface killah
yo yo
telekinesis im purifying these d speeches
while im crying i clean the feet of the sweet jesus
dreams visions get blurry of the elohim its light
its known to tear retinas in a single gleam
shut the fuck up when you hear his love talkin
to the mind its gods cypher divine in a small portion uh
faded pictures this global madness need intervention
this worlds in the twilight zone this is the fifth dimension
god please blow the whistle we need an intermission
my good deeds in front of your door im standing by the entrance
with heavy baggage my brothers ashes
i seen tragic i did dirt smacked death and held it to that nigga cabbage
love we killin greed we killin homelessness
and i dont give a fuck about this land i want ownership
bow your head for just gods sake
listen what the stars say when i say its gods way
chorus kendrick lamar
tippytoeing and im mudwalkin hmm
rollin sevens i aint bred for no coffin
i know yall love it when the drugs talkin but
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin
shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin
if god be the source then i am the plug talkin
yeah baby yeah baby
