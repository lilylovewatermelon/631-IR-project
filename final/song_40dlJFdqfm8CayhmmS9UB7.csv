intro

said hows it feel can you feel it

verse 1
uh polo pajamas i think i made it
i showed my mom my first million she damn near fainted
the rich and famous so nice to make your acquaintance
the legends put out their latest i feel that it sound outdated
im the hardest workin person in the universe
temptation victim to the church of lucifer
internet rappers aint shit when no computers work
you spent your whole advance on two chains and a gucci verse
a gucci verse im the greatest admit it im the greatest
and i dont hold a grudge against anybody who hate it
im underrated dont fit on nobodys playlist
if i aint in your top ten then you a racist
cocaine ether creates a strange creature

key to the city i keep to open the gates wit
a briefcase with a million under the pavement

they shootin up doin drugs or they doin nothin
my girls parents still livin out in the hood
i come through in that new bimmer like the shit all good damn
im just a human let me make mistakes

they know it aint their place and this a day i hate to waste
tryna be a legend by tomorrow

im not perfect but they aint either
i did it all without a jay feature
