damn your lips very soft
as i turn my blackberry off
and i turn your bathwater on
and you turn off your iphone
careless whispers eye fuckin bitin ass
neck ears hair legs eating ass
your pussys too good i need to crash
your titties let em out free at last
thank god almighty they free at last
we was up at the party but we was leavin fast
had to stop at 7eleven like i needed gas
im lyin i needed condoms dont look through the glass
chasin love all the bittersweet hours lost
eatin asian pussy all i need was sweet and sour sauce
tell your boss you need an extra hour off
get you super wet after we turn the shower off
