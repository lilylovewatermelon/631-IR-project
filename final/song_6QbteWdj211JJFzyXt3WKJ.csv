verse 1
in the temple i was an offering
of the heartless i was an offering
i was humbled i was an offering
and reborn into a god

prechorus 1
my dearest sensitive soul is just
a tyrant who enslaves
all those around him
to make certain he
he is hurt always

chorus
i dont need a reason baby
put your arms around me
hold me real close clap me in irons
come on caligulove me
come on caligulove me

verse 2
you can hear it as an offering
if youre a good girl as an offering
a righteous choir is singing as an offering
no screaming as they burn

darling there are no taboos in lust
my veins course blood
thats so venomous
when the heartless hears a heartbeat
hes jealous so jealous

chorus
i dont need a reason baby
put your arms around me
hold me real close clap me in irons
come on caligulove me
i already gotcha baby
put yourself upon me
im in lust a slave to desire
when you caligulove me

postchorus
come on love me
hold me real close love me
need your caligulove girl
caligulove
