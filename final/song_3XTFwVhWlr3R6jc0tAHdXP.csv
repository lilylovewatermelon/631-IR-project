we laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
just my brother and me
the night before he shipped out overseas
a leatherneck jarhead marine

prechorus 1
he said the radiator leaks
and the timingbelt is worn
but the heart and soul of this old beat up truck
is the dashboard

chorus
its seen a lot of tan legs
got a kick ass radio
heard a lot of singing along with some country songs
and rock and roll
got a 38 bullet hole courtesy of kate tillmans dad
a lot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs
he said if i dont come back
you can have this ford
just tape a picture of me on the dashboard

prechorus 2
he said the paint is peeling off
its got dents in both the doors
if something happens to me
dont hang a forsale sign above the dashboard

its seen a lot of tan legs
got a kick ass radio
heard alot of singing along with some country songs
and rock and roll
got a 38 bullet hole courtesy of kate tillmans dad
alot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs
he said if i dont come back
you can have this ford
just tape a picture of me on the dashboard

i had the engine overhauled
a paintjob and brand new chrome
i had her washed and waxed sittin in the drive
the day that he came home

i said heres the keys
shes all yours
i fixed everything
but the dashboardembed"
