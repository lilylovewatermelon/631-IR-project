a warning to the crews out there who think they’re hot
if you’re not original rockers you will get shot
down by the kids neglectin’ your art the stuff you did

of raw voltage briefly we see and the hope is

and boss dj illness upon you now quickly
infecting you fast upon the airwaves

activate and attune yourself with meditation
and green plants they’ve got mad life they’re sentient
they’re beautiful as you and they like to dance

bridge 3 nick hexum and sa
everything we do we gotta come original
put your hand up in the air and prepare for battle
sit upon the rhythm like a tire upon a rim
we do it nonstop and then we do it again
some a them whine and some a them bitch
they can not do it never switch
comin’ up from the heart and
delivered with a wild pitch
sit up on top the rhythm like a wild stallion
this is the ruling system
