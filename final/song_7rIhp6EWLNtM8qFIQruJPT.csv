climb
is all we know
when thaw
is not below us
no cant grow up
in that iron ground
claire all too sore for sound

verse 2
bet
is hardly shown
scraped
across the foam
like they stole it
and oh how they hold it
claire we nearly forfeit

chorus 1
i im growing like the quickening hues
i im telling darkness from lines on you
over havens fora
full and swollen morass young habitat
all been living alone
where the ice snap and the hold clast are known

home
were savage high
come
we finally cry
oh and we don it
because its right
claire i was too sore for sight

chorus 2
i were sewing up through the latchet greens
i unpeel keenness honey bean for bean
same white pillar tone as with the bone street
sand is thrown where she stashed us at
all been living alone all been living alone
where the cracks at in the low part of the stoning

outro
enough of this
give us the grown
give us the grown16embed"
