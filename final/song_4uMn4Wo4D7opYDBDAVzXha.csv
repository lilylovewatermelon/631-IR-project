and the pictures that i stashed
of the two of us in 1992

having headaches in my brain
listening to you complain
shopping at the mall again
im outta rhymes ive gotta say
life after lisas not so bad at all
not so bad at all
no more
mountain climbing in the rain
not so bad at all
no more

life will never be the same
life after lisas not so bad at all
oh no not so badembed"
